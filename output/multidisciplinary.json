          "title": "Legislative Capture in Hungary: Well-Managed Autocratization",
          "authors": "Zsolt Enyedi, Bálint Mikola",
          "abstract": "We discuss the case of Hungary’s rapid democratic backsliding under Viktor Orbán as an example of legislative capture. We show that, despite relatively unfavorable conditions for autocratization, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party have supervised a well-crafted project of institutional transformation and a comprehensive regrouping of financial resources, all of which have led to an effective and stable concentration of power. This power concentration has its limits, given the country’s membership in the European Union, resistance by parts of the judiciary, media initiatives focused on corruption, and local opposition victories; but the national government’s room for maneuver has increased every year since 2010. We provide an overview of the changes that facilitated democratic erosion and an inventory of the actors that still retain a capacity to hinder further autocratization.",

          "title": "Democratic Backsliding Through Legislative Capture in Serbia: A One-Man Show",
          "authors": "Filip Milačić",
          "abstract": "Serbia’s democracy has been in a state of continuous erosion since the Serbian Progressive Party and Aleksandar Vučić came to power in 2012. Vučić exploited his popularity as a self-proclaimed defender of the Serbian nation to gain full control of the party and initiate democratic backsliding through “legislative capture.” Vučić’s capture of the parliament and its appointment powers made possible a subsequent capture of many democratic institutions. The rest, mindful of Vučić’s broad electoral appeal, deferred to the executive. Challenges to Serbia’s democratic backsliding were attempted through popular mobilizations and electoral resistance, but they have not been successful. There are several reasons for such an outcome: the uneven playing field, a fragmented and ideologically heterogeneous opposition, a misguided choice of resistance strategies, the absence of an alternative political platform that addressed the issue of Kosovo—the antecedent condition that precipitated backsliding, and insufficient support from external prodemocracy actors.",

          "authors": "Murat Somer",
          "abstract": "Since 2002, governments led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his party have taken Turkey’s political regime from electoral democracy to electoral autocracy. This has been principally accomplished through legislative capture: control, abuse, and weaponization of Parliament to pass democracy-eroding laws, discredit opposition, and legitimize executive authoritarianism. But other tools, such as executive power grabs, were also used against strong state institutions, civil society, and even by Erdoğan against his own party. Democratic backsliding advanced through crises that polarized the electorate and through fierce political warfare between the incumbent government and its opponents. Like other cases on the legislative capture pathway, opposition parties have resisted backsliding predominantly through electoral mobilization, but their partial access to the legislature has, for the most part, limited their capacity to join forces with grassroots contentious politics. The opposition has not developed solutions for programmatic renewal that might heal formative rifts and lead to sustainable recovery.",

          "authors": "Shelley A. McConnell",
          "abstract": "Nicaragua has followed an unusual path from democracy to authoritarianism. In 2000, despite deep political polarization, outgoing Liberal president Arnoldo Alemán colluded with opposition leader Daniel Ortega to convert politically neutral judicial and electoral institutions into partisan tools. Their pact constrained the party system and lowered the electoral threshold, enabling Ortega to win the presidency in 2006. From a minority position in the legislature, Ortega’s Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) party used the politicized judiciary and electoral infrastructure to remove presidential term limits and manipulate elections. After gaining a legislative majority, the FSLN then reformed the constitution to consolidate power. Public resistance to democratic decline came slowly and too late: Initially offset by social spending funded in part by international authoritarian allies, it was ultimately repressed. The Nicaragua case shows that a gradualist pathway toward democratic backsliding may be available to minority parties in poor countries.",

          "abstract": "This case study explores democratic backsliding in Brazil that was accompanied by Jair Bolsonaro’s rise to power and his push for autocratization. Bolsonaro’s presidency was characterized by systematic attacks on democratic institutions, including efforts to undermine the judiciary, the legislature, and electoral integrity. A broad prodemocracy coalition of political parties, state governors, civil society, and the judiciary emerged to resist Bolsonaro’s authoritarian drive. The coalition played a pivotal role in preserving Brazil's democratic framework and preventing further erosion of democratic norms, but structural weaknesses in Brazil’s political system—which include growing affective polarization, ineffective governance, and the creeping influence of organized crime—present significant challenges to sustaining democracy. In the face of these enduring threats, maintaining democratic resilience in Brazil will likely be difficult.",

          "abstract": "Until the 1990s, Venezuela had one of the longest-running democracies in Latin America. Today it is one of the region’s most entrenched authoritarian regimes. I discuss Venezuela’s 25-year autocratization process, focusing on the contingent nature of democratic backsliding. This article is useful to understand how executive power grabs shape the ways in which those who oppose autocrats act to protect a democracy, as well as how the opposition can jeopardize, protect, and open spaces for democratic contestation in both democratic and authoritarian contexts.",

          "title": "Elite Collusion in Indonesia: How It Has Both Enabled and Limited Executive Aggrandizement",
          "authors": "Marcus Mietzner",
          "abstract": "After a largely successful post-authoritarian transition, Indonesia has experienced democratic backsliding since the 2010s. This backsliding accelerated under the presidency of Joko Widodo (2014-2024), but it has not yet pushed the Indonesian polity into a full-blown autocracy. I argue that Indonesia’s specific pathway to democratic backsliding prefigured this outcome. While elites have colluded to share power and allow the president to engage in executive aggrandizement, they have set limits to the latter’s potential authoritarian ambitions. For example, they rejected Widodo’s attempt to extend his time in power beyond the constitutionally allowed two terms. Thus, elites have both produced executive aggrandizement and contained its scope. This pattern has protected Indonesian democracy from a full collapse, but it has produced a gradual decline, reducing the chances of democratic revitalization through formal or contentious politics.",

          "authors": "Rachel Beatty Riedl, Jennifer McCoy, Kenneth Roberts, Murat Somer",
          "abstract": "We provide an analytical framework that identifies three distinct institutional pathways for democratic backsliding that culminate in executive aggrandizement: legislative capture, plebiscitary override, and executive power grabs. We also identify a fourth pathway of elite collusion that erodes democracy without necessarily concentrating powers in the executive. These four pathways reflect different combinations of ruling and opposition party strength, institutional legitimacy, and levels of popular support and political mobilization. The pathways also open and close different institutional and societal arenas where opposition forces can counter backsliding, and they create different opportunities, challenges, and dilemmas for democratic actors. The 15 case studies featured in this volume illustrate how backsliding occurs along these pathways, and how democratic actors achieved partial reversal in some cases. The cases also suggest focal points of resistance and institutional and programmatic reform that may be helpful to policymakers and advocates working to defend democracy.",

I describe the political resistance to backsliding and why it has failed to date, analyzing the roles of specific institutions and individual actors in that resistance. I argue that two key dynamics explain why efforts to mobilize against Saied’s power grab have failed to slow democratic erosion in Tunisia: top-down regime control of key government institutions and a deep popular frustration with the country’s political class, which limited bottom-up mobilization against Saied’s power grab.",

          "abstract": "Ecuador experienced a dramatic process of democratic backsliding during Rafael Correa’s decade-long administration, which began in 2007. The Correa administration brought plebiscitary overrides and constitutional reengineering that made the government a hyperpresidential one, weakening political institutions and undermining basic civil liberties. When Correa left power in 2017, Ecuador’s democracy recovered; but, even with the promise of an enduring democratic future, the country has not been able to consolidate a functioning representative democratic regime, and new processes of backsliding have occurred. A combination of weak political institutions, poor democratic culture, and major threats to political stability—including the infiltration of organized crime into the political arena—seems to have stagnated Ecuador at the status of a low-quality delegative democracy.",

          "authors": "Manuel Meléndez-Sánchez, Lucas Perelló",
          "abstract": "Guatemala is a case study in democratic backsliding led not by an aggrandized executive, but by a coalition of elites who collude to maximize and protect their collective power. Beginning in the mid-2010s, a decentralized but deeply entrenched network of elites dismantled democracy when anticorruption efforts threatened their common interests. The 2023 election was widely expected to consolidate this authoritarian turn but, instead, delivered an unexpected democratic resurgence when a moderate anticorruption reformer secured a shocking victory and then successfully resisted a “slow-motion coup” aimed at preventing the transfer of power. The Guatemalan case suggests that, under elite collusion, elites can be more prone to splits and strategic errors than in other authoritarian settings. These missteps provide unexpected opportunities to reverse backsliding, but democrats must be prepared to capitalize on regime errors and repel authoritarian counteroffensives by building broad coalitions that work simultaneously across multiple arenas of democratic contestation.",

          "abstract": "“Democratic careening” aptly captures Poland’s recent oscillation between liberal democracy, illiberalism, and efforts toward the recovery of liberal democratic norms. In contrast to the recent experience of Hungary, Poland’s hard right governing party was unable to amend the nation’s constitution as it attempted to consolidate power, so it relied on ordinary legislation and changes of personnel in the judiciary and other state institutions. This analysis shows how Poland’s complex constitutional framework, its elections, and the contentious politics of resistance contributed to the nation’s democratic resilience. I also reflect on the challenges faced by Poland’s new government in undoing illiberal changes while avoiding legal and political instability, highlighting the broader implications of this case for democratic theory and the study of illiberalism.",

          "abstract": "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won consecutive parliamentary majorities in India’s 2014 and 2019 elections, ushering in a period of single-party dominance that has replaced a quarter-century of coalition politics. This new era has been marked by a growing concentration of executive power, crackdowns on dissent, and rising Hindu majoritarianism. The roots of India’s democratic backsliding predate the BJP’s resurgence, but the trends have intensified in the past 10 years. While the party’s disappointing performance in the 2024 elections suggests a possible corrective, legislative capture in India will not easily unravel: The BJP remains in a commanding political position and shows little inclination toward moderation; questions about electoral integrity abound; referee institutions are abdicating their authority; and constraints on civil society endure. Given India’s outsize geopolitical importance, foreign pressure is unlikely to be decisive in reversing these trends.",

After a long history of authoritarian rule, Malawi’s 1994 constitution envisioned a robust separation of powers, yet power remains concentrated in the presidency. Presidents have repeatedly attempted to consolidate power but have been rebuffed at crucial moments. Presidents have attempted to constrain political opposition through personalist ties, the bureaucracy, control over executive appointments, regulation, and coercion. But the courts and civil society have been key actors in countering executive overreach, exemplified by the Constitutional Court’s annulment of the 2019 presidential election. Despite recent legal reforms, Malawi’s parliament, opposition parties, and other political institutions still struggle to check the executive.",

          "abstract": "I examine two pathways of democratic backsliding in Moldova and the ways in which the country was able to reverse the backsliding trends. The first episode (2001–2009) started with a political party gaining a supermajority in Parliament and setting up a semi-authoritarian system of governance. Prodemocracy protests and coercive attempts by the state to suppress them led to an institutional stalemate, culminating in snap elections that brought a victory for the political opposition. The second backsliding episode (2014–2019) was characterized by oligarchic collusion: Major oligarchs funded and controlled the ruling parties while engaging in grand corruption and contributing to a gradual democratic decline. Recovery from this backsliding episode was enabled by cross-ethnic, transideological protests against corruption, strategic institutional changes, and interoligarchic wars. The analysis underscores how contentious politics, electoral processes, and the empowerment of weakened political institutions can help generate democratic recovery.",

According to multiple measures, Benin’s democracy declined continuously between 2016 and 2023.

Notably, the influence—or lack of influence—of elites resulted in limited competitiveness of the electoral process and worsening freedom of expression and assembly. Better cooperation of opposition forces in 2023 has helped to halt further backsliding, but it has not reversed the decline.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated potassium (K V ) channels contain cytoplasmically exposed β-subunits 1–5 whose aldo-keto reductase activity 6–8 is required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep 9 . Here we show that Hyperkinetic, the β-subunit of the K V 1 channel Shaker in Drosophila 7 , forms a dynamic lipid peroxidation memory. Information is stored in the oxidation state of Hyperkinetic’s nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor, which changes when lipid-derived carbonyls 10–13 , such as 4-oxo-2-nonenal or an endogenous analogue generated by illuminating a membrane-bound photosensitizer 9,14 , abstract an electron pair. NADP + remains locked in the active site of K V β until membrane depolarization permits its release and replacement with NADPH. Sleep-inducing neurons 15–17 use this voltage-gated oxidoreductase cycle to encode their recent lipid peroxidation history in the collective binary states of their K V β subunits; this biochemical memory influences—and is erased by—spike discharges driving sleep. The presence of a lipid peroxidation sensor at the core of homeostatic sleep control 16,17 suggests that sleep protects neuronal membranes against oxidative damage. Indeed, brain phospholipids are depleted of vulnerable polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains after enforced waking, and slowing the removal of their carbonylic breakdown products increases the demand for sleep.",

          "abstract": "Hexameric helicases are nucleotide-driven molecular machines that unwind DNA to initiate replication across all domains of life. Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved1: the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis2, we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an ‘entropy switch’, removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery.",

          "abstract": "Many technological breakthroughs in electronics and photonics were made possible by downscaling—the process of making elementary devices smaller in size1,2,3,4,5. The downsizing of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on III–V semiconductors led to micro-LEDs5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12, an ‘ultimate technology’ for displays. However, micro-LEDs are costly to produce and they exhibit severe efficiency losses when the pixel sizes are reduced to about 10 μm or less, hindering their potential in commercial applications. Here we show the downscaling of an emerging class of LEDs based on perovskite semiconductors to below the conventional size limits. Micro- and nano-perovskite LEDs (micro-PeLEDs/nano-PeLEDs) with characteristic pixel lengths from hundreds of micrometres down to about 90 nm are demonstrated, through a localized contact fabrication scheme that prevents non-radiative losses at the pixel boundaries. For our near-infrared (NIR) and green micro-PeLEDs, average external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) are maintained at around 20% across a wide range of pixel lengths (650 to 3.5 μm), exhibiting minimum performance reduction on downsizing. Our nano-PeLEDs with characteristic pixel lengths down to about 90 nm represent the smallest LEDs reported, enabling a record-high pixel density of 127,000 pixels per inch (PPI) among all classes of LED arrays. Our demonstration showcases the strength of micro- and nano-PeLEDs as a next-generation light-source technology with unprecedented compactness and scalability.",

          "abstract": "Lymphatic capillaries continuously take up interstitial fluid and adapt to resulting changes in vessel calibre 1–3 . The mechanisms by which the permeable monolayer of loosely connected lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) 4 maintains mechanical stability remain elusive. Here we identify dynamic cytoskeletal regulation of LEC shape, induced by isotropic stretch, as crucial for the integrity and function of dermal lymphatic capillaries. We found that the oak leaf-shaped LECs showed a spectrum of VE-cadherin-based junctional configurations at the lobular intercellular interface and a unique cytoskeletal organization, with microtubules at concave regions and F-actin at convex lobes. Multispectral and longitudinal intravital imaging of capillary LEC shape and actin revealed dynamic remodelling of cellular overlaps in vivo during homeostasis and in response to interstitial fluid volume increase. Akin to puzzle cells of the plant epidermis 5,6 , LEC shape was controlled by Rho GTPase CDC42-regulated cytoskeletal dynamics, enhancing monolayer stability. Moreover, cyclic isotropic stretch increased cellular overlaps and junction curvature in primary LECs. Our findings indicate that capillary LEC shape results from continuous remodelling of cellular overlaps that maintain vessel integrity while preserving permeable cell–cell contacts compatible with vessel expansion and fluid uptake. We propose a bellows-like fluid propulsion mechanism, in which fluid-induced lumen expansion and shrinkage of LEC overlaps are countered by actin-based lamellipodia-like overlap extension to aid vessel constriction.",

          "abstract": "In the course of antibody affinity maturation, germinal centre (GC) B cells mutate their immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes in a process known as somatic hypermutation (SHM) 1–4 . Panels of mutant B cells with different binding affinities for antigens are then selected in a Darwinian manner, which leads to a progressive increase in affinity among the population 5 . As with any Darwinian process, rare gain-of-fitness mutations must be identified and common loss-of-fitness mutations avoided 6 . Progressive acquisition of mutations therefore poses a risk during large proliferative bursts 7 , when GC B cells undergo several cell cycles in the absence of affinity-based selection 8–13 . Using a combination of in vivo mouse experiments and mathematical modelling, here we show that GCs achieve this balance by strongly suppressing SHM during clonal-burst-type expansion, so that a large fraction of the progeny generated by these bursts does not deviate from their ancestral genotype. Intravital imaging and image-based cell sorting of a mouse strain carrying a reporter of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity showed that B cells that are actively undergoing proliferative bursts lack the transient CDK2 low ‘G0-like’ phase of the cell cycle in which SHM takes place. We propose a model in which inertially cycling B cells mostly delay SHM until the G0-like phase that follows their final round of division in the GC dark zone, thus maintaining affinity as they clonally expand in the absence of selection.",

          "abstract": "Rapid learning confers significant advantages on animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues1,2,3,4. This slow learning is thought to be supported by gradual changes to cue representation in the sensory cortex2,5. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest6,7, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance)7. Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable once mice achieve ‘expert’ performance. Instead of enhanced cue representations8, two-photon calcium imaging of auditory cortical neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. A reward-prediction signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors early in training, and faded in expert mice. Silencing at the time of this signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting that it serves an associative role. A distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove slower performance improvements. These ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from sensory representations, indicating higher-order functional segregation within auditory cortex. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.",

          "abstract": "Rates of relative sea-level rise during the final stage of the last deglaciation, the early Holocene, are key to understanding future ice melt and sea-level change under a warming climate1. Data about these rates are scarce2, and this limits insight into the relative contributions of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets to global sea-level rise during the early Holocene. Here we present an early Holocene sea-level curve based on 88 sea-level data points (13.7–6.2 thousand years ago (ka)) from the North Sea (Doggerland3,4). After removing the pattern of regional glacial isostatic adjustment caused by the melting of the Eurasian Ice Sheet, the residual sea-level signal highlights two phases of accelerated sea-level rise. Meltwater sourced from the North American and Antarctic ice sheets drove these two phases, peaking around 10.3 ka and 8.3 ka with rates between 8 mm yr−1 and 9 mm yr−1. Our results also show that global mean sea-level rise between 11 ka and 3 ka amounted to 37.7 m (2σ range, 29.3–42.2 m), reconciling the mismatch that existed between estimates of global mean sea-level rise based on ice-sheet reconstructions and previously limited early Holocene sea-level data. With its broad spatiotemporal coverage, the North Sea dataset provides critical constraints on the patterns and rates of the late-stage deglaciation of the North American and Antarctic ice sheets, improving our understanding of the Earth-system response to climate change.",

          "abstract": "Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8+ T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear1,2. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS–STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS–STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8+ T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.",

Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity3, offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1–PD-L1-blocking fusion protein4, for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma.

          "abstract": "Magnetism typically arises from the effect of exchange interactions on highly localized fermionic wavefunctions in f- and d-atomic orbitals. By contrast, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG), magnetism—manifesting as spontaneous polarization into one or more spin and valley flavours1,2,3,4,5,6,7—originates from itinerant electrons near a Van Hove singularity. Here we show experimentally that the electronic entropy in this system indicates signatures typically associated with disordered local magnetic moments, unexpected for electrons in a fully itinerant metal. Specifically, we find a contribution ΔS ≈ 1 kB per charge carrier that begins at the Curie temperature and survives more than one order of magnitude in temperature. First-order phase transitions show an isospin ‘Pomeranchuk effect’ in which the fluctuating moment phase is entropically favoured over the nearby symmetric Fermi liquid8,9. Our results imply that, despite the itinerant nature of the electron wavefunctions, the spin and valley polarization of individual electrons is decoupled, a phenomenon typically associated with localized moments, as happens, for example, in solid 3He (ref. 10). Transport measurements, surprisingly, show a finite-temperature resistance minimum in the fluctuating moment regime, which we attribute to the interplay of fluctuating magnetic moments and electron–phonon scattering. Our results highlight the universality of soft isospin modes to two-dimensional flat-band systems.",

          "abstract": "Modern birds have diversified into a striking array of forms, behaviours and ecological roles. Analyses of molecular evolutionary rates can reveal the links between genomic and phenotypic change1,2,3,4, but disentangling the drivers of rate variation at the whole-genome scale has been difficult. Using comprehensive estimates of traits and evolutionary rates across a family-level phylogeny of birds5,6, we find that genome-wide mutation rates across lineages are predominantly explained by clutch size and generation length, whereas rate variation across genes is driven by the content of guanine and cytosine. Here, to find the subsets of genes and lineages that dominate evolutionary rate variation in birds, we estimated the influence of individual lineages on decomposed axes of gene-specific evolutionary rates. We find that most of the rate variation occurs along recent branches of the tree, associated with present-day families of birds. Additional tests on axes of rate variation show rapid changes in microchromosomes immediately after the Cretaceous–Palaeogene transition. These apparent pulses of evolution are consistent with major changes in the genetic machineries for meiosis, heart performance, and RNA splicing, surveillance and translation, and correlate with the ecological diversity reflected in increased tarsus length. Collectively, our analyses paint a nuanced picture of avian evolution, revealing that the ancestors of the most diverse lineages of birds underwent major genomic changes related to mutation, gene usage and niche expansion in the early Palaeogene period.",

So far, these systems are primarily handcrafted by domain experts and tweaked through heuristics rather than being automatically optimized, presenting a substantial challenge to accelerating progress. The development of artificial neural networks faced a similar challenge until backpropagation and automatic differentiation transformed the field by making optimization turnkey. Analogously, here we introduce TextGrad, a versatile framework that performs optimization by backpropagating LLM-generated feedback to improve AI systems. By leveraging natural language feedback to critique and suggest improvements to any part of a system—from prompts to outputs such as molecules or treatment plans—TextGrad enables the automatic optimization of generative AI systems across diverse tasks. We demonstrate TextGrad’s generality and effectiveness through studies in solving PhD-level science problems, optimizing plans for radiotherapy treatments, designing molecules with specific properties, coding, and optimizing agentic systems.

          "abstract": "Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10−3 per base pair per cell division1. As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions2. Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation.",

          "abstract": "Phonon polaritons are quasiparticles resulting from the coherent coupling of photons with optical phonons in polar dielectrics1. Owing to their exceptional ability to confine electric fields to deep-subwavelength scales with low loss, they are uniquely poised to enable a suite of applications beyond the reach of conventional photonics, such as subdiffraction imaging2 and near-field energy transfer3,4,5. The conventional approach to exciting phonon polaritons through optical methods, however, involves costly light sources along with near-field schemes6,7, and generally leads to low excitation efficiency owing to substantial momentum mismatch between phonon polaritons and free-space photons. Here we demonstrate that under proper conditions, phonon polaritons can be excited all-electrically by drifting charge carriers. Specifically, in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures, by electrically driving charge carriers in ultrahigh-mobility graphene out of equilibrium, we observe bright electroluminescence of hBN’s hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) at mid-infrared frequencies, which shows a temperature and carrier density dependence distinct from black-body thermal emission. Moreover, the carrier density dependence of the HPhP electroluminescence spectra reveals that HPhP electroluminescence can arise from both interband transition and intraband Cherenkov radiation8 of charge carriers in graphene. The HPhP electroluminescence offers avenues for realizing electrically pumped mid-infrared and terahertz phonon-polariton light sources.",

          "abstract": "The landscapes of somatic mutation in normal cells inform us about the processes of mutation and selection operative throughout life, providing insight into normal ageing and the earliest stages of cancer development 1 . Here, by whole-genome sequencing of 238 microdissections 2 from 30 individuals, including 18 with gastric cancer, we elucidate the developmental trajectories of normal and malignant gastric epithelium. We find that gastric glands are units of monoclonal cell populations that accrue roughly 28 somatic single-nucleotide variants per year, predominantly attributable to endogenous mutational processes. In individuals with gastric cancer, metaplastic glands often show elevated mutation burdens due to acceleration of mutational processes linked to proliferation and oxidative damage. Unusually for normal cells, gastric epithelial cells often carry recurrent trisomies of specific chromosomes, which are highly enriched in a subset of individuals. Surveying 829 polyclonal gastric microbiopsies by targeted sequencing, we find somatic ‘driver’ mutations in a distinctive repertoire of known cancer genes, including ARID1A , ARID1B , ARID2 , CTNNB1 and KDM6A . The prevalence of mutant clones increases with age to occupy roughly 8% of the gastric epithelial lining by age 60 years and is significantly increased by the presence of severe chronic inflammation. Our findings provide insights into intrinsic and extrinsic influences on somatic evolution in the gastric epithelium in healthy, precancerous and malignant states.",

          "abstract": "Superconducting (SC) states that break space-group symmetries of the underlying crystal can exhibit nontrivial spatial modulation of the order parameter. Previously, such states were intimately associated with the breaking of translational symmetry1,2, resulting in the density-wave orders3,4,5,6,7,8, with wavelengths spanning several unit cells9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. However, a related basic concept has long been overlooked20: when only intra-unit-cell symmetries of the space group are broken, the SC states can show a distinct type of nontrivial modulation preserving long-range lattice translation. Here we refer to this new concept as the pair density modulation (PDM) and report the first observation of a PDM state in exfoliated thin flakes of the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. Using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we discover robust SC gap modulation with the wavelength corresponding to the lattice periodicity and the amplitude exceeding 30% of the gap average. Notably, we find that the observed modulation originates from the large difference in SC gaps on the two nominally equivalent iron sublattices. The experimental findings, backed up by model calculations, suggest that, in contrast to the density-wave orders, the PDM state is driven by the interplay of sublattice symmetry breaking and a peculiar nematic distortion specific to the thin flakes. Our results establish new frontiers for exploring the intertwined orders in strong-correlated electronic systems and open a new chapter for iron-based superconductors.",

          "abstract": "From experimental evolution in the laboratory to sustained measurements of natural selection in the wild, long-term studies have revolutionized our understanding of evolution. By directly investigating evolutionary dynamics in real time, these approaches have provided unparallelled insights into the complex interplay between evolutionary process and pattern. These approaches can reveal oscillations, stochastic fluctuations and systematic trends that unfold over extended periods, expose critical time lags between environmental shifts and population responses, and illuminate how subtle effects may accumulate into significant evolutionary patterns. Long-term studies can also reveal otherwise cryptic trends that unfold over extended periods, and offer the potential for serendipity: observing rare events that spur new evolutionary hypotheses and research directions. Despite the challenges of conducting long-term research, exacerbated by modern funding landscapes favouring short-term projects, the contributions of long-term studies to evolutionary biology are indispensable. This is particularly true in our rapidly changing, human-dominated world, where such studies offer a crucial window into how environmental changes and altered species interactions shape evolutionary trajectories. In this Review article, we showcase the groundbreaking discoveries of long-term evolutionary studies, underscoring their crucial role in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of evolution across multiple systems and timescales.",

          "abstract": "Under high electrical current, some materials can emit electromagnetic radiation beyond incandescence. This phenomenon, referred to as electroluminescence, leads to the efficient emission of visible photons and is the basis of domestic lighting devices (for example, light-emitting diodes)1,2. In principle, electroluminescence can lead to mid-infrared emission of confined light–matter excitations called phonon polaritons3,4, resulting from the coupling of photons with crystal lattice vibrations (optical phonons). In particular, phonon polaritons arising in the van der Waals crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) present hyperbolic dispersion, which enhances light–matter coupling5,6. For this reason, electroluminescence of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) has been proposed as an explanation for the peculiar radiative energy transfer within hBN-encapsulated graphene transistors7,8. However, as HPhPs are locally confined, they are inaccessible in the far field, and as such, any hint of electroluminescence has been based on indirect electronic signatures and has yet to be confirmed by direct observation. Here we demonstrate far-field mid-infrared (wavelength approximately 6.5 μm) electroluminescence of HPhPs excited by strongly biased high-mobility graphene within a van der Waals heterostructure, and we quantify the associated radiative energy transfer through the material. The presence of HPhPs is revealed by far-field mid-infrared spectroscopy owing to their elastic scattering at discontinuities in the heterostructure. The resulting radiative flux is quantified by mid-infrared pyrometry of the substrate receiving the energy. This radiative energy transfer is also shown to be reduced in hBN with nanoscale inhomogeneities, demonstrating the central role of the electromagnetic environment in this process.",

However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets2. Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.",

MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC.",

Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build ‘rings’ of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world.",

Machine learning is transforming numerical weather prediction (NWP) by replacing the numerical solver with neural networks, improving the speed and accuracy of the forecasting component of the prediction pipeline 1,2,3,4,5,6. However, current models rely on numerical systems at initialisation and to produce local forecasts, limiting their achievable gains. Here we show that a single machine learning model can replace the entire NWP pipeline. Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system, ingests observations and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The global forecasts outperform an operational NWP baseline for multiple variables and lead times. The local station forecasts are skillful up to ten days lead time, competing with a post-processed global NWP baseline and a state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting system with input from human forecasters. End-to-end tuning further improves the accuracy of local forecasts. Our results show that skillful forecasting is possible without relying on NWP at deployment time, which will enable the full speed and accuracy benefits of data-driven models to be realised. We believe Aardvark Weather will be the starting point for a new generation of end-to-end models that will reduce computational costs by orders of magnitude, and enable rapid, affordable creation of customised models for a range of end-users.",

Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury3, and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched ‘ECM-secreting’ (Csmd1-expressing) and ‘pro-resolving’ (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial–transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution.",

However, there is still much debate on the fundamental properties of water at hydrophobic interfaces, such as orientational ordering, the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide, improper hydrogen bonds and the presence of large electric fields2,3,4,5. This controversy arises from the challenges in measuring interfacial systems, even with the most advanced experimental techniques and theoretical approaches available. Here we report on an in-solution, interface-selective Raman spectroscopy method using multivariate curve resolution6,7 to probe hexadecane-in-water emulsions, aided by a monomer-field theoretical model for Raman spectroscopy8. Our results indicate that oil–water emulsion interfaces can exhibit reduced tetrahedral order and weaker hydrogen bonding, along with a substantial population of free hydroxyl groups that experience about 95 cm−1 redshift in their stretching mode compared with planar oil–water interfaces. Given the known electrostatic zeta potential characteristic of oil droplets9, we propose the existence of a strong electric field (about 50–90 MV cm−1) emanating from the oil phase. This field is inferred indirectly but supported by control experiments and theoretical estimates. These observations are either absent or opposite in the molecular hydrophobic interface formed by small solutes or at planar oil–water interfaces. Instead, water structural disorder and enhanced electric fields emerge as unique features of the mesoscale interface in oil–water emulsions, potentially contributing to the accelerated chemical reactivity observed at hydrophobic–water interfaces10,11,12,13.",

AMPARs are critical for the learning and memory mechanisms of Hebbian plasticity2 and glutamatergic synapse homeostasis3, with recent work establishing that AMPAR missense mutations can cause autism and intellectual disability4,5,6,7. AMPARs have been grouped into two functionally distinct tetrameric assemblies based on the inclusion or exclusion of the GluA2 subunit that determines Ca2+ permeability through RNA editing8,9. GluA2-containing AMPARs are the most abundant in the central nervous system and considered to be Ca2+ impermeable10. Here we show this is not the case. Contrary to conventional understanding, GluA2-containing AMPARs form a continuum of polyamine-insensitive ion channels with varying degrees of Ca2+ permeability. Their ability to transport Ca2+ is shaped by the subunit composition of AMPAR tetramers as well as the spatial orientation of transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins and cornichon auxiliary subunits. Ca2+ crosses the ion-conduction pathway by docking to an extracellular binding site that helps funnel divalent ions into the pore selectivity filter. The dynamic range in Ca2+ permeability, however, arises because auxiliary subunits primarily modify the selectivity filter. Taken together, our work proposes a broader role for AMPARs in Ca2+ signalling in the mammalian brain and offers mechanistic insight into the pathogenic nature of missense mutations.",

Identifying tree species that grow fast is therefore commonly considered to be essential for effective climate change mitigation through forest planting. Although species characteristics are key information for plantation design and forest management, field studies often fail to detect clear relationships between species functional traits and tree growth2. Here, by consolidating four independent datasets and classifying the acquisitive and conservative species based on their functional trait values, we show that acquisitive tree species, which are supposedly fast-growing species, generally grow slowly in field conditions. This discrepancy between the current paradigm and field observations is explained by the interactions with environmental conditions that influence growth. Acquisitive species require moist mild climates and fertile soils, conditions that are generally not met in the field. By contrast, conservative species, which are supposedly slow-growing species, show generally higher realized growth due to their ability to tolerate unfavourable environmental conditions. In general, conservative tree species grow more steadily than acquisitive tree species in non-tropical forests. We recommend planting acquisitive tree species in areas where they can realize their fast-growing potential. In other regions, where environmental stress is higher, conservative tree species have a larger potential to fix carbon in their biomass.",

A quantum satellite constellation offers a solution to facilitate the quantum network on a global scale4,5. The Micius satellite has verified the feasibility of satellite quantum communications6,7,8,9; however, scaling up quantum satellite constellations is challenging, requiring small lightweight satellites, portable ground stations and real-time secure key exchange. Here we tackle these challenges and report the development of a quantum microsatellite capable of performing space-to-ground quantum key distribution using portable ground stations. The microsatellite payload weighs approximately 23 kilograms, and the portable ground station weighs about 100 kilograms, representing reductions by more than 1 and 2 orders of magnitude, respectively. Using this set-up, we demonstrate satellite-based quantum key distribution with multiple ground stations and achieve the sharing of up to 1.07 million bits of secure keys during a single satellite pass. In addition, we multiplex bidirectional satellite–ground optical communication with quantum communication, enabling key distillation and secure communication in real time. Also, a secret key, enabling one-time pad encryption of images, is created between China and South Africa at locations separated by over 12,900 kilometres on Earth. The compact quantum payload can be readily assembled on existing space stations10,11 or small satellites12, paving the way for a satellite-constellation-based quantum and classical network for widespread real-life applications.",

Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes.

Previous research has failed to find an equivalent forebrain representation in other species7,8,9,10,11. To investigate whether this functional organization is unique to humans, here we performed population recordings in the vocal production circuitry of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), a small parrot that can generate flexible vocal output12,13,14,15, including mimicked speech sounds16. Using high-density silicon probes17, we measured the song-related activity of a forebrain region, the central nucleus of the anterior arcopallium (AAC), which directly projects to brainstem phonatory motor neurons18,19,20. We found that AAC neurons form a functional vocal motor map that reflects the spectral properties of ongoing vocalizations. We did not observe this organizing principle in the corresponding forebrain circuitry of the zebra finch, a songbird capable of more limited vocal learning21. We further demonstrated that the AAC represents the production of distinct vocal features (for example, harmonic structure and broadband energy). Furthermore, we discovered an orderly representation of vocal pitch at the population level, with single neurons systematically selective for different frequency values. Taken together, we have uncovered a functional representation in a vertebrate brain that displays unprecedented commonalities with speech-related motor cortices in humans. This work therefore establishes the parrot as an important animal model for investigating speech motor control and for developing therapeutic solutions for addressing a range of communication disorders22,23.",

Distinct trafficking pathways for import and export would be an elegant solution to avoid unproductive collisions and opposing movements. However, the three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale spatiotemporal dynamics of macromolecules traversing the NPC remains challenging to visualize on the timescale of millisecond-scale transport events. Here we used 3D MINFLUX 2 to identify the nuclear pore scaffold and then to simultaneously monitor both nuclear import and nuclear export, thereby establishing that both transport processes occur in overlapping regions of the central pore. Whereas translocation-arrested import complexes bound at the pore periphery, tracks of translocating complexes within the central pore region revealed a preference for an approximately 40- to 50-nm diameter annulus with minimal circumferential movement, indicating activity-dependent confinement within the permeability barrier. Movement within the pore was approximately 1,000-fold slower than in solution and was interspersed with pauses, indicating a highly restricted environment with structural constraints and/or transient binding events during transport. These results demonstrate that high spatiotemporal precision with reduced photobleaching is a major advantage of MINFLUX tracking, and that the NPC permeability barrier is divided into annular rings with distinct functional properties.",

          "title": "Swarms of satellites are harming astronomy. Here’s how researchers are fighting back",
          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "In the next few months, from its perch atop a mountain in Chile, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will begin surveying the cosmos with the largest camera ever built. Every three nights, it will produce a map of the entire southern sky filled with stars, galaxies, asteroids and supernovae — and swarms of bright satellites ruining some of the view.\n\nAstronomers didn’t worry much about satellites photobombing Rubin’s images when they started drawing up plans for the observatory more than two decades ago. But as the space around Earth becomes increasingly congested, researchers are having to find fresh ways to cope — or else lose precious data from Rubin and hundreds of other observatories.\n\nThe number of working satellites has soared in the past five years to around 11,000, mostly because of constellations of orbiters that provide Internet connectivity around the globe (see ‘Satellite surge’). Just one company, SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, has more than 7,000 operational Starlink satellites, all launched since 2019; OneWeb, a space communications company in London, has more than 630 satellites in its constellation. On paper, tens to hundreds of thousands more are planned from a variety of companies and nations, although probably not all of these will be launched1.\n\nSources: Jonathan’s Space Pages (https://go.nature.com/4IV22FD; https://go.nature.com/4225MKX)\n\nSatellites play a crucial part in connecting people, including bringing Internet to remote communities and emergency responders. But the rising number can be a problem for scientists because the satellites interfere with ground-based astronomical observations, by creating bright streaks on images and electromagnetic interference with radio telescopes. The satellite boom also poses other threats, including adding pollution to the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the first Starlinks launched, some astronomers warned of existential threats to their discipline. Now, researchers in astronomy and other fields are working with satellite companies to help quantify and mitigate the impacts on science — and society. “There is growing interest in collaborating and finding solutions together,” says Giuliana Rotola, a space-policy researcher at the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy.\n\nTiming things right\n\nThe first step to reduce satellite interference is knowing when and where a satellite will pass above an observatory. “The aim is to minimize the surprise,” says Mike Peel, an astronomer at Imperial College London.\n\nCleaning up space: how satellites and telescopes can live together\n\nBefore the launch of Starlinks, astronomers had no centralized reference for tracking satellites. Now, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has a virtual Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS), which serves as an information hub and to which researchers, including Peel and Rotola, volunteer their time.\n\nOne of the centre’s tools, called SatChecker, draws on a public database of satellite orbits, fed by information from observers and companies that track objects in space. Astronomers can use SatChecker to confirm what satellite is passing overhead during their observations. The tool isn’t perfect; atmospheric drag and intentional manoeuvring can affect a satellite’s position, and the public database doesn’t always reflect the latest information. For instance, the BlueWalker 3 satellite from telecommunications firm AST SpaceMobile in Midland, Texas, launched in 2022 and was sometimes brighter than most stars; yet uncertainty of its position was so great at times that astronomers had difficulty predicting whether it would be in their field of view for their night-time observations2.\n\nStarlink satellites leave streaks in a 2019 image taken by a 4-metre telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.Credit: CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/DECam DELVE Survey\n\nTools such as SatChecker help telescope operators to avoid problems by allowing them to target a different part of the sky when a satellite passes overhead or by simply pausing observations as it flies by. It would aid astronomers if SatChecker had even more accurate information about satellite positions, but there are constraints on improving the system. SatChecker data come from the US Space Force, which draws on a global network of sensors that tracks objects in orbit and issues updates on satellite locations as often as several times a day. The frequency of these updates is limited by factors such as how often a sensor can observe an object and whether the sensor can distinguish what it’s looking at.\n\nCurrently, satellite streaks are a relatively minor issue for telescope operators. But the problem will grow as satellite numbers continue to increase drastically, meaning more observation time will be lost, and this issue will be magnified for Rubin.\n\nFixing the streaks\n\nRubin, which cost US$810 million to build, is a unique case because it scans large swathes of the sky frequently — meaning it can detect rapidly changing phenomena such as incoming asteroids or cosmic explosions. Astronomers don’t want to be fooled by passing satellites, as happened in 2017 when researchers spotted what they thought was a γ-ray burst — high-energy flashes of light — from a distant galaxy but turned out to be sunlight reflecting off a piece of space junk.\n\nPrivate spacecraft nails Moon landing: first images of Blue Ghost on the lunar surface\n\nRubin’s powerful camera, coupled with its 8.4-metre telescope, will take about 1,000 nightly exposures of the sky, each about 45 times the area of the full Moon. That’s more wide-field pictures of the sky than any optical observatory has ever taken. Simulations suggest that if satellite numbers in low Earth orbit rise to around 40,000 over the 10 years of Rubin’s survey — a not-impossible forecast — then at least 10% of its images, and the majority of those taken during twilight, will contain a satellite trail3.\n\nSpaceX took early steps to try to mitigate the problem. Working with Rubin astronomers, the company tested changes to the design and positions of Starlinks to try to keep their brightness beneath a target threshold. Amazon, the retail and technology giant based in Seattle, Washington, is also testing mitigations on prototype satellites for its planned Kuiper constellation. Such changes reduce, but don’t eliminate, the problem.\n\nTo limit satellite interference, Rubin astronomers are creating observation schedules to help researchers avoid certain parts of the sky (for example, near the horizon) and at certain times (such as around twilight)4. For when they can’t avoid the satellites, Rubin researchers have incorporated steps into their data-processing pipeline to detect and remove satellite streaks. All these changes mean less time doing science and more time processing data, but they need to be done, astronomers say. “We are really looking forward to getting data from Rubin and seeing how it turns out,” Peel says.\n\nFor other observatories, the IAU CPS is working on tools to help astronomers identify and correct satellite streaks in their data. One is a new database of crowdsourced observations of satellite brightnesses called SCORE, which is currently being beta tested and is planned for wider release in the coming months. This will help scientists to work backwards — they might see something puzzling in their past observations and be able to work it out, Peel says.\n\nThe database “is definitely a very valuable tool” because it’s one of few that have data freely available, says Marco Langbroek, a space-tracking specialist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. As a beta tester, Langbroek has added a number of entries to SCORE, including measurements of a NASA solar sail that changes in brightness as it tumbles through space. Going forwards, he says, SCORE will be most useful if a lot of astronomers contribute high-quality observations to the database, thereby building up a resource over time.\n\nTuning things out\n\nAstronomers who work in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum face extra challenges when it comes to satellites.\n\nSpaceX launch highlights threat to astronomy from ‘megaconstellations’\n\nBig radio telescopes are typically located in remote regions, to be as far as possible from mobile-phone masts and other technological infrastructure that leak radio emissions. But satellites can’t be avoided. “If signals are coming from the sky, they’re always there,” says Federico Di Vruno, an astronomer at the Square Kilometre Array Observatory in Jodrell Bank, UK, and co-director of the IAU CPS.",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "On the Swiss–French border, at the headquarters of the European laboratory CERN, a battle is under way for the future of particle physics. CERN’s leaders want to build the biggest machine on the planet here: an enormous particle accelerator that would open in 2070 and would dwarf the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the lab’s current flagship facility.\n\nEverything about the plan is unprecedented. The Future Circular Collider (FCC), as it’s called, would sit in a tunnel 91 kilometres in circumference, more than three times the size of the LHC’s. Its cost is likely to be at least US$30 billion and it would smash protons together at energies eight times greater than those in the LHC. It is hoped that expanding this energy frontier will reveal never-before-seen particles that could solve some pressing issues regarding the standard model — the current best theory of the Universe’s fundamental particles and fields — and shed light on some of physics’ greatest mysteries, such as the nature of dark matter.\n\nA CERN map shows where a 91-km circular tunnel might be dug; the smaller LHC is to its left.Credit: CERN\n\nThe technologies to reach such energies aren’t ready yet. So the plan is to dig the tunnel and insert a simpler machine that, starting around 2045, would collide electrons and their antiparticles, called positrons (see ‘CERN’s plan for a mega-collider’). This interim collider would produce and study copious numbers of elementary particles known as Higgs bosons to understand their pivotal role in nature. Later, this ‘Higgs factory’ would be dismantled.\n\nSource: https://go.nature.com/4TVDVSR\n\nThe two-stage FCC plan is backed by many physicists. It is spearheaded by CERN’s director-general (DG), Fabiola Gianotti, and supported by Mark Thomson, who is due to replace her in January 2026. “If approved, the FCC would become the most powerful instrument ever built to study the laws of nature at the most fundamental level,” Gianotti said in a statement to Nature.\n\nBut many others are unhappy with it, Nature has found. Interviews with more than two dozen researchers show that many are critical of the FCC strategy, because it will take so long to come to fruition and because sinking resources into it could close off alternative ideas.\n\n“The issue is whether the community is willing to sacrifice the next 50 years to get a toy which may or may not be the way for [fixing] the standard model,” says Halina Abramowicz, a particle physicist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. Critics also say that CERN’s leadership has decided to back the FCC without adequately consulting the community.\n\nIn such a giant and political project, which involves financial contributions from many of CERN’s member countries and the opinions of tens of thousands of researchers, disagreements are inevitable. (When the LHC was built, Germany threatened to leave CERN if its budget-cut demands weren’t met.) But the discontent has reached an unprecedented pitch, many researchers told Nature.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether CERN’s member states will pay for the project. Germany has already said that it won’t raise its budget contributions. And projects elsewhere might undercut the case for the FCC: in particular, China is deciding whether to approve a similar machine.\n\nThe next year could be decisive for the European mega-collider plan. By December, a strategy working group will submit its conclusions on the idea to the CERN Council, the organization’s governing body. At stake is not only the ambitious experiment itself, but also the working lives of generations of physicists — and Europe’s role in particle physics for the rest of the century.\n\nDecades of circular colliders\n\nCERN emerged after the Second World War as part of a deliberate effort to pursue science for peace, and it has been a key centre for particle-physics research ever since. With an annual budget of almost 1.5 billion Swiss francs (US$1.7 billion) set by an international convention, and funding from 24 member states as well as non-member countries such as the United States and Japan, it is a beacon for international scientific cooperation.\n\nFor nearly two decades, it has hosted the LHC, the world’s largest and most powerful collider. The LHC itself replaced a previous electron–positron collider in the same tunnel, called LEP, that was built in the 1980s. But CERN hosts many other experiments and technology programmes, including work on antimatter, cosmic rays, alternative accelerator technologies, advanced magnets and isotopes for medical applications.\n\nIt was at the LHC that, in 2012, Gianotti announced the discovery of the Higgs boson. This is perhaps CERN’s crowning discovery: not just another particle, but the linchpin of the standard model. The discovery of the Higgs was the first direct evidence of a field that permeates the Universe, the Higgs field. The varying interactions of other fundamental particles with this field explains why they have different masses.\n\nCERN director-general Fabiola Gianotti (centre) pictured at the LHC in 2023, with French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and Alain Berset (then-president of Switzerland, who is currently secretary-general of the Council of Europe).Credit: Martial Trezzini/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nThe LHC has not managed to top that moment. The Higgs boson was shaken out by smashing protons at high energies, but the collider has so far failed to deliver further, much-anticipated discoveries, such as the nature of dark matter. With the LHC’s life scheduled to end in 2040, thoughts of its successor have been brewing since the 2010s.\n\nThe standard model can’t explain dark matter or the unknown particles that determine the nature of the Higgs field, among other major questions in particle physics. But it is not clear from theorists’ models whether smashing higher-energy protons would turn up new, extremely massive particles that might provide answers.\n\nStill, many researchers think that it is worthwhile. “Exploration of the energy frontier will enable us to deepen our understanding of physics at the shortest distances, which we know is intimately connected to the physics of the Universe on the largest scales,” Gianotti says. “It’s like an open ocean,” says particle physicist Pierluigi Campana, who is based near Rome and chairs the International Committee for Future Accelerators. He compares the quest for the energy frontier to that of the first explorers who took their canoes across the Pacific Ocean and settled its many islands.\n\nAn artist’s impression of the tunnel for the proton–proton collider stage of the Future Circular Collider.Credit: PIXELRISE via CERN\n\nThe two-stage FCC concept was first presented in 2019. The idea is that the initial-stage ‘Higgs factory’ might reveal some deviations from standard-model predictions, which could hint at whether new particles exist and how massive they might be. This question is linked to a central mystery about the standard model: how the Higgs boson ‘breaks the symmetry’ between two of the three fundamental forces in the standard model: the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force. At the high energies that existed straight after the Big Bang, these two forces were unified.\n\nThen, once research has produced breakthroughs in the necessary technology, such as how to produce sufficiently high-strength superconducting magnets that steer and focus beams of particles, the second-stage FCC could be built to discover those particles — if they are within its reach. (Some physicists say that new particles could include the constituents of dark matter, but many theorists now think that such particles are likely to be much lighter, not heavier, than the range already searched by the LHC.)\n\nCostly collider\n\nAlthough most particle physicists agree that both FCC machines would be good to have, the costs are daunting. No full costing is yet available; CERN documents have suggested the first phase alone might cost $17 billion. However, estimates by Vladimir Shiltsev, an accelerator physicist at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, and his collaborators suggest that is a minimum value and that the two phases together would cost at least $30 billion, and probably much more (T. Roser et al. J. Instrum. 18, P05018; 2023).\n\nPlans for the next mega-collider at CERN are not yet in the bag.Credit: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty\n\nResearchers have proposed several other possible designs for future colliders. For decades, a leading proposal for a Higgs factory was not a circular collider but a straight one, called the International Linear Collider. It was studied in detail with the intent of placing it in Japan, but that country did not finalize its approval. Advocates of a linear Higgs factory modelled on the International Linear Collider say it would do all the Higgs studies of the circular version, but be cheaper and faster. Jenny List, a physicist at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, says that a machine with a 21–33-kilometre tunnel could cost less than half as much as the first stage of the FCC. It could also study how two Higgs particles interact with each other. That research would not be directly accessible at the FCC, and could be crucial to understanding the nature of the Higgs field, says Michael Peskin, a theoretical physicist at the SLAC National Laboratory in Menlo Park, California. “We know how to build it; it has a reasonable cost, and it really can be running at the time the LHC ends, if we can get our act together,” he says.\n\nCERN’s $17-billion supercollider in question as top funder criticizes cost\n\nThe linear and circular options each have their strengths and weaknesses, physicists say. Proponents of the FCC plan say a linear tunnel would be a dead end once it has served its purpose as a Higgs factory. But List counters that a linear collider can be upgraded by lengthening the tunnel later on. And it could host a future linear accelerator based on one of several advanced technologies that are being developed, such as the US-led Cool Copper Collider. This is a new concept for linear accelerators that could drastically reduce electricity consumption compared with machines of similar power.\n\n“There is no reason in the world to build a circular Higgs factory” as opposed to a linear one, says Abramowicz, pointing in particular to its expected high electricity bill. And some researchers suggest that it would be better to explore a number of options than to lock future generations of scientists into an expensive path to 2070 and beyond, when it’s unclear whether the FCC would be the right tool for answering physicists’ questions. “I would find it very unfair to impose a physics programme on my grandchildren,” says Jochen Schieck, a physicist at the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna, who is a member of the CERN Council.\n\nFor many physicists, one persuasive argument for the FCC is that it can continue to support the large community of 15,000 researchers and support staff that has grown around the LHC experiments. That, says Abramowicz, is the real reason why many are behind the circular collider idea: it could produce collisions at four independent ‘interaction points’, each with a massive detector producing data that could involve a collaboration of thousands of physicists. A linear collider can conduct only one experiment at a time, so it would support fewer physicists.\n\nReach higher energies sooner\n\nThe thought that the giant proton collider wouldn’t be ready until 2070 also worries some researchers, because it means they won’t see the new energy frontier in their working lifetimes. Some say that CERN should make an all-out effort in research and development for advanced accelerator technologies that could enable facilities to reach higher energies sooner. This would include the magnet research necessary for the FCC, but would also take in new — but unproven — ideas, such as colliding beams of muons, particles that are heavier cousins of electrons.\n\nNew CERN chief pledges to forge ahead with $17-billion supercollider\n\nSome researchers, including John Womersley, a former chief executive of the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council, and Tulika Bose, an LHC physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, want to see higher-energy machines developed as quickly as possible.\n\nWomersley has suggested cutting short the LHC’s running time, to 2035, and using the allocated funding to develop technologies for the FCC’s second stage. Bose suggests skipping the Higgs factory altogether.\n\nA spokesperson for CERN says that the upcoming data from the upgraded LHC will already give early-career researchers “a fantastic, exciting and instructive position to be in”, and that if all goes according to plan, there will be only a few years between the conclusion of that programme and the start of an electron–positron collider in the mid-2040s.\n\nHow CERN pushed forward its plan\n\nA criticism of the current FCC plan is that CERN didn’t listen sufficiently to the community before formulating it, and that the financial and human resources it has put into the feasibility study have dwarfed investment in other programmes, such as advanced accelerator research.\n\nSome of the disagreement is about how to read a pivotal document released in 2020 after a symposium in Bad Honnef, Germany (see go.nature.com/4hrjmqp). Held by a working group appointed by the CERN Council and chaired by Abramowicz, its aim was to update the strategy for European particle physics and CERN’s future. At that meeting, researchers who were present say, a representative from Germany’s government privately told physicists (including Gianotti) that Germany couldn’t afford to contribute to a massive new accelerator — views that would become public in 2024.\n\nWhat emerged in the document, some say, was an unclear compromise between those who wanted endorsement of a two-stage FCC plan and alternative scenarios. The document listed a Higgs factory as ‘highest priority’ (without ruling out a linear collider), and then stated but didn’t rank other priorities. These included investigating the feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with the possibility of a Higgs factory as a first stage, and ramping up efforts to develop technologies for future accelerators.\n\nUS particle physicists want to build a muon collider — Europe should pitch in\n\nSome researchers who took part in the strategy process, including Schieck and Siegfried Bethke, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Garching, Germany, who is a former member of the CERN Council, say that this document was carefully written to leave the door open for alternative Higgs factory designs and to avoid making a two-stage FCC the top priority — calling only for its feasibility to be investigated. It did not back the precise option that CERN’s leadership has pursued, the two-stage plan that reaches fruition as far away as 2070. CERN could have put more effort into exploring the linear collider option and more resources into advanced accelerator technologies, they say.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "A device can supposedly create a tiny current by manipulating Earth’s magnetic field as the planet rotates.Credit: Getty\n\nElectricity can be generated from the energy of Earth rotating through its own magnetic field — according to a provocative claim put forward by physicists today.\n\nThe findings are controversial but intriguing, researchers told Nature. The effect was identified only in a carefully crafted device and generated just 17 microvolts — a fraction of the voltage released when a single neuron fires — making it hard to verify that some other effect isn’t causing the observations.\n\nIf the phenomenon is real and the device could be scaled up, it could generate emission-free power while remaining static, which could be useful in remote locations or for medical applications. The authors published their findings in Physical Review Research1 and presented them at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California.\n\n“The idea is somewhat counter-intuitive and has been argued since Faraday,” says Paul Thomas, an emeritus physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. But the experiments, led by Christopher Chyba, a physicist at Princeton University in New Jersey, are very carefully done, he adds. “I find it very convincing and remarkable.”\n\nOthers agree that the results are striking, but remain sceptical. Rinke Wijngaarden, a retired physicist previously at the Free University of Amsterdam, has followed the authors’ assertions since 2016 and failed to find the effect in his own experiments in 2018. He finds the work very interesting, but is “still convinced that the theory of Chyba et al. cannot be correct”.\n\nPlanet power\n\nIn theory, the device would work in a similar fashion to an electrical power station, in which passing a conductor through a magnetic field causes electrons to move, creating a current. As Earth rotates and part of its magnetic field remains static (at least according to a 1912 proof), a conductor on its surface would move through some components of the field.\n\nNormally, this would not create a current, because in a uniform field such as Earth’s, electrons feeling this push would rearrange themselves to create an opposing electric force, ultimately leaving charges static (this does not apply in places where the force a conductor feels is constantly changing, as in a generator).\n\nBut Chyba and his colleagues say that they have found a loophole. Using a complex calculation, they showed that certain materials — with unusual properties and when shaped into cylindrical tube — could channel Earth’s magnetic field into a strange configuration. This, they argue, would create a magnetic push that the electrostatic force inside the device could not cancel out, generating a current.\n\nTo demonstrate their theory, the researchers crafted a hollow cylinder made of a soft magnetic material containing manganese, zinc and iron. While controlling for other effects, they looked for any voltage and current running through the device. The result verified their predictions: they observed a tiny 17-μV voltage that depended on the set-up’s orientation with respect to Earth’s magnetic field. The voltage was zero when they used a solid chunk of the conductor, rather than a hollow tube.\n\n“The observed voltages are so small that there are many potential spurious causes available,” says Wijngaarden, but he points out that Chyba’s team has “gone to great lengths to try and avoid” other effects that could mimic their predicted phenomenon, such as temperature variations.",

          "abstract": "One of the most important ways for the world to tackle climate change is through renewable energy. However, the potential for renewables to bring about a sustainable future is threatened by the environmental impact of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. These technologies rely on data centres, whose incessant thirst for energy is challenging the ability of renewable sources to satisfy demand.\n\nMeeting the energy challenge posed by data centres is essential to unlocking the true potential of renewable energy. This has led some to explore new ways to generate power, such as small modular reactors — smaller-scale nuclear reactors that are designed to be easier to assemble and transport to locations where extra grid capacity is needed. But a sustainable long-term solution will require a shift in the way energy producers, distributors and consumers think. Instead of constantly trying to satisfy an energy need that is growing exponentially, a move towards a ‘datacentric perspective’ would put considerations around data use at the heart of decisions around power generation and consumption. In other words, to ensure that renewable energy remains viable, the discourse about energy transition must include a focus on highlighting, regulating and limiting data-centre impact.\n\nNature Index 2025 Energy\n\nThe technologies that are becoming part of daily life — such as large language models and automated vehicles — all require data centres to store vast amounts of information. These global data centres consumed about 1% of global electricity in 2024, or 460 terawatt hours, which is roughly half the electricity consumed by residential households globally. In the United States, which is estimated to have the largest number of data centres in the world, centres consumed around 4.4% of all US electricity in 2024, a figure expected to rise to as much as 12% by 2028.\n\nElectricity usage by data centres will continue to rise at an ever-increasing rate — and its global carbon footprint will follow. One 2022 study found that among information communications technologies, data centres are driving the fastest growth in the carbon footprint (D. Al Kez et al. J. Clean. Prod. 371, 133633; 2022).",

Marenfeld\n\nFresh data have bolstered the discovery that dark energy, the mysterious force that makes galaxies accelerate away from each other, has weakened over the past 4.5 billion years.\n\nThe effect was first tentatively reported in April last year, but the latest results — presented on 19 March by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Anaheim, California — are based on three years’ worth of data-taking, versus one year for the results announced in 2024.\n\n“Now I’m really sitting up and paying attention,” says Catherine Heymans, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, UK, and the Astronomer Royal for Scotland.\n\nIf the findings hold up, they could force cosmologists to revise their ‘standard model’ for the history of the Universe. The model has generally assumed that dark energy is an inherent property of empty space that does not change over time — a ‘cosmological constant’.\n\n“The gauntlet has been thrown down to the physicists to explain this,” says Heymans.\n\nCosmic mapping\n\nThe DESI telescope is located at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. It uses 5,000 robotic arms to point optical fibres at selected points where galaxies or quasars are located within its field of view. The fibres then deliver light to sensitive spectrographs that measure how much each object is redshifted — meaning the degree to which its light waves were stretched by the expansion of space on their way to Earth. Researchers can estimate an object’s distance using its redshift, to produce a 3D map of the Universe’s expansion history.\n\nIn that map, researchers then look at the density of galaxies to identify variations that are left over from sound waves called baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), which existed before stars began to form. Those variations have a characteristic scale that started out at 150 kiloparsecs (450,000 light years) in the primordial Universe and has been increasing with the cosmic expansion; they have now grown by a factor of 1,000 to 150 megaparsecs across — making them the largest known features in the current Universe.\n\nA slice of the 3D map of galaxies based on data collected by DESI in the first year of its survey. Credit: DESI Collaboration/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/R. Proctor\n\nBy tracking the evolving size of BAOs, researchers can reconstruct how the Universe’s rate of expansion has changed over the eons. Around 5 billion years ago, the expansion switched from decelerating to accelerating under the push of dark energy. Until last year, cosmology data were all consistent with dark energy being a cosmological constant — which meant that the Universe should continue to expand at an increasingly fast rate.\n\nBut the results of DESI’s latest analysis imply that the cosmic expansion is accelerating less now than it was in the past, which does not fit the assumption that dark energy is a cosmological constant. Instead, the data suggest that its energy density — the amount of dark energy per cubic metre of space — is now around 10% lower than it was 4.5 billion years ago.",

These words, supposedly whispered by Galileo Galilei at the end of his 1633 trial — held because he supported the Copernican ‘heresy’ that Earth moves around the Sun — have long been a byword for how scientists should behave in the face of ignorance, intolerance and ideological inerrancy. They come to mind now, during the all-out war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) happening in the United States.\n\nAt the end of his trial, Galileo was made to swear that he did not believe in Earth’s motion. He was confined to house arrest and forbidden to write any more about the movement of the planet. If he had had grant funding and a website, I am sure that the Roman Catholic Church would have suspended the former and scrubbed the latter.\n\nYet, far from acting in courageous defiance, many scientists and administrators now seem to think that the best response to the war on DEI is to keep their heads low and wait out four hard years.\n\nTrump 2.0: an assault on science anywhere is an assault on science everywhere\n\nThe American Society of Microbiology, NASA, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Transportation and many prominent universities are among those that have been removing references to DEI from their websites, grants, papers, biographies and even histories.\n\nMore scholars must push back. The idea that scientists can keep doing what they know must be done to incorporate DEI into their work while adjusting terms to fit the demands of bigoted autocrats bent on hobbling science is to whistle loudly past a graveyard of avoidable error, continued financial cuts and censorship. That diversity matters to science is a truth — albeit one that has only recently begun to be accepted and applied.\n\nFirst, clinical and social-science research requires diversity to be valid. Genomics has established that different groups of people respond differently to drugs and vaccines. The individuals recruited to and participating in clinical trials must be representative of those who will use those treatments in real life. Attention to DEI allows researchers to identify differences in safety and efficacy between groups early on in the testing process.\n\nLikewise, social scientists are well aware that understanding behaviour and implementing desired change requires studying populations besides white, Western, university psychology students — the group from which psychologists have mainly sourced participants for decades. This is the case whether researchers seek to overcome vaccine hesitancy, prevent self-harm, improve reading skills, change recycling habits or prevent obesity.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next",

It aims to make academic journals freely available online without charging authors or relying on donations. Fifty-four societies, museums and research institutions around the world have signed their journals up.\n\nThe model guarantees that a journal’s content will be free to access for one year, as long as enough libraries commit to paying an annual subscription fee. If there aren’t enough subscriptions to the journal, all of its content remains paywalled. This process repeats annually, which means that ongoing access depends on yearly participation by libraries. It’s not permanent open access, says Lauren Kane, chief executive of BioOne, the non-profit organization in Washington DC that is leading the pilot. “It is a conditional open access.”\n\nKane says this ‘all or nothing’ approach ensures that there is enough money to cover the publishing costs. The hope is that the system will allow smaller journals with limited funding to be open access.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nThe S2O trial includes journals under the BioOne umbrella, independent publishers and some commercial entities. In September 2023, the independent German publisher De Gruyter announced that 85% of its 320 subscription journals would adopt the S2O model over the next five years. Publishers Taylor and Francis in the UK and Karger in Switzerland also announced that they would trial it for certain journals this year.\n\nWhether the pilot continues in 2027 and beyond depends on whether BioOne meets its net subscription-revenue target by the end of next January, Kane says. Some partners, such as the California Digital Library, which is part of the University of California system, have committed to subscription licences spanning several years.\n\nSustainable and equitable\n\nA number of publishers have already implemented the model, independently of the BioOne trial. For example, all 51 journals run by Annual Reviews, an independent, non-profit publisher in San Mateo, California, adopted S2O fully in 2023 after testing it on a handful of titles1. “For us, this has been an unqualified success,” says Richard Gallagher, an immunologist and editor-in-chief of Annual Reviews. He notes that the model has some “very strong advantages” over established forms of open access. “It’s a big equity play, it’s an affordability play and it transforms whole journals instead of individual articles.”\n\nAfter seeing an increase in readership of the journal’s freely accessible content during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gallagher says the Annual Reviews team decided that it was a “moral imperative” to make its content openly available. Journals can charge article-processing fees (APCs) to make papers completely open access by having the authors cover publishing costs, such as administration, editing and typesetting. But Gallagher says charging APCs for review articles — which summarize and analyse the current state of research on a specific topic — wouldn’t have gone over well. “We cannot invite someone to spend three to six months writing a thorough review of their field and then present them with a bill to publish open access.”\n\nAnother option to avoid APCs is transformative agreements, in which universities or libraries pay a set amount to publishers to allow their researchers to publish their work openly and access paywalled content.",

You know Mummy wants to understand you always, pet. Help me understand.\n\nIt’s not like we live in the Dark Ages. We’ve given you all the modern advantages. And for you to throw them away like this — well, yes, you’re throwing them away. I can’t see it any other way. To choose all your friends with no previous contact overlaps, what else do you call that? How do you know that they’re — well — that they’re our sort of person?\n\nIn your grandmother’s time, if someone seemed familiar, you couldn’t compare life-tracking data with them and find out where you’d seen them before. You’d have to muddle through with what you personally remembered: had they gone to your preschool, were they on the opposing team in that tournament once. And if you didn’t have a good memory for faces, you just wouldn’t know, can you imagine that, sweetheart? No, I think you can’t, even I can’t. Granny has told me, it’s too horrible to contemplate.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nAnd you had no chance of knowing if their family had taken the same seashore holiday package the week before, or if they’d been at a birthday party in the same shop the hour after yours when you were seven. All of the little things that give you the comfort of knowing that you might not know this person, but you know this person — you had to rely on clothing brands and haircuts for that, and anyone might walk into a hairdresser and ask for the same haircut, darling, just anyone. You never knew. You had to talk for simply hours — well, at least quarters of hours — to make sure.\n\nThe world is so large, and yet the acceptable parts of it so small. I thought you knew that. I thought we taught you, before we sent you off to university.\n\nAnd now here you are with these — these — let’s call them young people, that sounds polite — I don’t know who they are. I literally do not know who these young people are. Where are their parents? Who are their parents? I have run the tracker program and I have never been in the same shops as their parents, never. What do they buy? I don’t know, how would I know? Is it healthy, is it safe? Are they safe?\n\nIt’s not that I don’t understand teenage rebellion. I was a teenager, too. I turned off tracking data for a month once when I was in university — did you know you could do that then? The, what do you call it, when you use different people’s data to get to the one you’re looking for. Parallax. Yes. The parallax wasn’t good enough then, so you could just turn it off. I just about gave your poor grandparents a heart attack. And what did it get me? Nothing! I felt very clever for a week or so and then the novelty wore off and I was just being stubborn until I got a scare at a party, and then I turned it on damned quickly, you’d better believe it. Thank goodness your generation can’t flirt with that kind of nonsense. But I don’t want you thinking I don’t understand.\n\nWhy do you think we have tracking data, if not to help you with this sort of thing? You think it doesn’t mean anything now, you’re only a student, but soon you’re going to be applying for jobs, and then you’ll have to see where you’ve overlapped with the people who can hire you. Then you’ll see that you should have taken this seriously instead of mingling with people whose choices we can’t approve or verify.",

          "title": "How the US tech industry is shaping the transition to green energy",
          "authors": "Mark Peplow",
          "abstract": "Whether their core business is search engines, social media, shopping or computing, data fuels the US tech behemoths — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia — along with countless other companies. Now, though, it seems that the big-tech industry is increasingly focused on big energy.\n\nThese six US companies — the largest tech firms in the world, by market capitalization — are already substantial buyers of renewable electricity, but their needs are now being multiplied by the latest generation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In response, firms have been signing a flurry of deals with energy companies to establish new generating capacity.\n\nIn 2024, for example, Microsoft announced that it had agreed on a 20-year deal to buy energy from a dormant nuclear plant at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania — the site of a nuclear accident in 1979 — which would reopen in 2028. Google (owned by Alphabet) and Amazon both revealed last year that they had made power purchase agreements (PPAs) with companies that plan to build a new generation of smaller nuclear plants known as small modular reactors (SMRs). Google and Meta are also investing in firms developing next-generation geothermal energy.\n\nNature Index 2025 Energy\n\nThese high-profile developments have garnered huge media attention, accompanied by speculation that they could help to accelerate the global shift to cleaner power. But many researchers point out that the big-tech industry is influencing the energy transition in much more significant ways: through their cloud computing services, by applying machine learning to the management of electricity supply and demand, and, above all, by harvesting — and exploiting — data about that energy.\n\n“In general, it’s better to have them doing all this than actively opposing the transition,” says Silvia Weko, a sustainability researcher at the University of Erlangen–Nuremberg, in Germany, who studies the role of big tech in the energy business. But she’s not alone in a belief that there’s a risk that energy systems are also becoming too dependent on a handful of companies. “Once they have that monopoly, they can do whatever they want with it.”\n\nThe big-tech industry has a long history of building renewable-energy capacity to service its needs. Amazon, for example, owns roughly 25 gigawatts of its own installed capacity worldwide: mostly solar panels, with a smattering of wind. That alone is similar to the entire solar power capacity of the Netherlands. But the firm buys even more renewable energy from external suppliers through PPAs. These are long-term contracts to buy energy at a predetermined price, and Amazon has signed agreements that enable to it tap at least 33.6 gigawatts, according to the energy consultancy, BloombergNEF.\n\nSasha Luccioni, who studies the environmental impact of AI at US machine-learning company Hugging Face in New York City, says until about five years ago, this kind of approach had kept pace with big tech’s growing energy needs. “They were on track until generative AI came along,” Luccioni says. “I think that with the advent of these new, more energy-intensive models, the PPAs are not enough and now they’re turning to nuclear and other ways of dealing with it.”\n\nIn demand\n\nGenerative AI is a supersized form of machine learning that can be trained to recognize patterns within data in order to produce novel text, images and video. “It’s still this big pattern-recognition engine, but now these models are being trained on all of the internet,” says Raghavendra Selvan, a machine-learning researcher at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nTraining a model with billions of different parameters can take months of work at data centres that consume huge amounts of energy; and once the model is available for wider use, each query racks up further energy costs that can be ten times greater than a conventional web search.\n\nResearchers say that those energy costs can be curbed. In January, for example, Chinese AI firm, DeepSeek, released a chatbot app based on its low-cost R1 model, which requires far less computing power to run than rivals developed by companies such as OpenAI in San Francisco, California.\n\nNevertheless, the rapid acceleration of AI means that finding a constant and reliable source of power for data centres is a growing problem, especially because solar and wind power are inherently intermittent.\n\nIn hot water\n\nNext-generation geothermal systems might be one solution. Many conventional geothermal systems tap into reservoirs of hot water deep underground, drawing it to the surface to create steam that can drive turbines and generate electricity. But there are relatively few places on the planet that have the right combination of heat, fluid and permeable rocks, says Lauren Boyd, a geologist who heads the Geothermal Technologies Office at the US Department of Energy (DoE) in Washington DC.\n\nNext-generation geothermal systems seek to overcome this limitation by engineering suitable subsurface conditions — either through a process akin to fracking, which uses high-pressure water and chemicals to fracture rock layers, or by drilling carefully guided boreholes deep underground. Both techniques create a route for cool water to be pumped underground, where it absorbs heat before returning to the surface for use in a power station. This should open up many more potential sites to turn geothermal energy into electrical power, and the DoE estimates that operators in the United States could develop 90–130 gigawatts of geothermal power capacity by 2050.\n\nPart of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant will reopen to power Microsoft’s data centres.Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty\n\nBoyd says that although these systems are likely to be more expensive to build than solar or wind, they offer other advantages beyond providing a more constant flow of power. They take up a lot less space, so they could be built in areas where land availability is a constraint, and they use materials and technologies that can be sourced within the United States — a key political consideration, given that China dominates the supply chain for materials used to generate solar power.\n\nThe combination of public and private funding for next-generation geothermal start-up companies such as Fervo Energy and Sage Geosystems, both based in Houston, Texas — which have partnerships with Google and Meta, respectively — helped to triple geothermal investment in the United States from 2023 to 2024. “Right now, the number of companies and start-ups in this space in the United States is pretty dramatic,” says Boyd. That puts the country in pole position in the race for next-generation geothermal power, although other nations — including France, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the United Kingdom — have their own programmes.\n\nDespite the enthusiasm, however, this new approach to geothermal power might take time before it has a noticeable impact on broader power supplies, and many experts agree that variable renewables linked to battery storage will likely be the backbone of decarbonization scenarios.\n\nGoing nuclear\n\nBig tech’s investments in SMRs, meanwhile, are helping to bolster a technology that many governments hope will assist their decarbonization plans. Proponents say that these reactors could be built in factories using production-line techniques to create ‘modular’ units that will ultimately drive down the cost of nuclear power. Major firms already developing SMRs, such as Toshiba and Rolls Royce, are being joined by a parade of start-up companies that are trying different techniques and materials, hoping their designs will have an edge.\n\nYet behind the hype, there are no commercial SMRs currently in operation. “The press writes about them as if they already exist, as if we know that they’re cheap and they’re safe — but we don’t know any of that,” says Allison Macfarlane, director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and former chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. She doubts whether SMRs will offer any economic benefit over conventional nuclear reactors, and they might even generate more nuclear waste, adding to costs. “With nuclear, it’s always the price tag that kills it, and there’s nothing different about small modular reactors,” she says.\n\nMacfarlane thinks that restarting dormant nuclear plants could offer a more promising strategy. That’s what utility company Constellation Energy in Baltimore, Maryland, plans to do with the plant it owns at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania, which will help to power Microsoft’s data centres. “That’s the one model that I see as being successful,” she says. However, she cautions that there are relatively few sites in the United States that would be suitable for that kind of make-over.\n\nPower play\n\nWeko and other researchers see big tech’s investments in these burgeoning technologies as more than a quest for energy. Instead, they say it is part of a broader business strategy to play pivotal roles in every aspect of the energy transition, from individual homes to national grids.\n\nMany homeowners already use Amazon’s cloud-based AI assistant Alexa to manage their domestic energy use. But Weko has detailed (S. Weko Rev. Political Econ. https://doi.org/n8wk; 2024) how global energy-related companies also depend on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the biggest cloud computing company in the world with around 30% of market share and revenues topping US$75 billion in 2022. AWS servers help to manage data about the supply, demand and storage of energy, weather patterns, and a host of other variables. AWS also uses machine-learning systems to analyse those kinds of data, to forecast and potentially optimize renewable-energy production. “If you increase the amount of solar and wind on the grid, then it just gets more complex to control, because you need to match supply and demand,” says Lynn Kaack, who studies the relationship between AI and climate change at the Hertie School, a university in Berlin, and is also the co-founder of non-governmental organization Climate Change AI.",

          "authors": "Santiago Beguería",
          "abstract": "Science flourishes when data are shared freely, enabling verification, replication and innovation. In climate science, where I work, the stakes of open data sharing are nothing less than the future of our planet. Yet it is precisely in this field that access to fundamental data sets is often withheld or limited by gate-keeping national agencies, which often cite security, privacy or commercial concerns.\n\nThese restrictions have huge consequences. Climate models are a crucial tool for projecting future warming and informing global policies, and must be validated using observational data. The same is true of reanalysis data sets, which combine models and previously gathered data to understand climate patterns. Without access to relevant observational data, these models and analyses can propagate flaws, leading to misguided policies or ineffective mitigation strategies. There is an urgent need to enact policies that ensure all relevant climate data are shared for the benefit of everyone.\n\nUS pulls back from gold-standard scientific climate panel\n\nGood intentions are already there. The World Meteorological Organization has made efforts to support data sharing through initiatives such as Resolution 60 on the free exchange of meteorological information, adopted in 2019, and the 2022 Unified Data Policy, which aims to standardize practices among its 193 member states and territories. Yet progress has been slow, with certain national agencies still reluctant to release their data. However, most of the reasons given are spurious, and many of the proposed barriers can be surmounted.\n\nTake national security. Climate data can involve sensitive sites, such as military bases or ships, but most of the obtained data pose minimal or no security risks. In cases with legitimate concerns, simple measures, including censoring the sites’ coordinates, can deal with such issues effectively.\n\nMost weather stations are on public property, such as state facilities, parks and educational institutions. But where this is not the case, privacy considerations can arise because localized data sets might reveal private landowners or properties. But such challenges are not unique to climate science: fields such as health research encounter them, too, and navigate them using anonymization methods that climate scientists could easily adapt and adopt.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\nWhen commercial confidentiality is cited as a reason for not sharing data sets, it is often because maintaining observational networks and curating the data comes with costs that are usually borne by state-run institutions. Some governments argue that making the data freely available undermines those institutions’ financial viability.\n\nBut these arguments don’t take into account that environmental data gathered using state funding ought eventually to yield benefits to the public, something that is best ensured by the broadest possible access. Free access is also prudent economically: it stimulates innovation in the private sector, enabling businesses and entrepreneurs to develop new technologies, services and applications.",

          "title": "How ‘animal methods bias’ is affecting research careers",
          "authors": "Christine Ro",
          "abstract": "Animals do not always need to be used in preclinical studies.Credit: Evgenyi Eg / Getty\n\nWhile Catharine Krebs was working in a human-genetics laboratory during her PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, there was a line that she got used to seeing at the end of papers: “These findings will need to be confirmed in vivo.“\n\nWhat that usually means is in an animal model. “You just say it without even thinking, because you’ve been trained to think that that’s the next best line of investigation,” she reflects.\n\nKrebs is now the medical-research programme manager for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), a non-profit organization in Washington DC that advocates for alternatives to animal-based research.\n\nIn this role, she and other attendees at a 2022 workshop coined a term that helped to make sense of what she’d noticed as a researcher: animal-methods bias.\n\nThey define animal-methods bias as indicating “a reliance on or preference for animal-based methods despite the availability of potentially suitable non-animal-based methods”.\n\nIn 2023, Krebs and her co-authors at the PCRM and at Humane Society International Europe in Brussels, published the results of a survey of life-sciences researchers and peer reviewers1.\n\nThe authors note that the sample of 90 respondents was small, but provides preliminary evidence of animal-methods bias.\n\nSome researchers felt that some of the requests from peer reviewers to add an animal-research component to their studies were unjustified and unnecessary, such as for researchers doing purely computational work.\n\n“The issues are mostly with journals and funders,” Krebs says. In her experience, researchers who are using animal-free models are “extremely frustrated” by such pushback.\n\nA spokeperson for Springer Nature, which publishes Nature, says: “As part of the peer-review process, our editors carefully evaluate requests by reviewers for animal studies and any arguments made against this by the authors.\"\n\nThe spokeperson adds that at all times, its journal editors follow the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines 2.0, which were last updated in 20202. Nature is editorially independent of its publisher.\n\nAnimal research is not always king: researchers should explore the alternatives\n\nKrebs and her colleagues are now following up with larger-scale research. One aspect Krebs is interested in investigating is whether the bias interacts with researchers’ experience. “The impact of animal-methods bias may be especially strong with early-career researchers,” Krebs hypothesizes. “If they undergo an experience where they feel like they have to use an animal research model to publish or get a grant or publish in a high-impact journal, then that just reinforces it, and it can set them on a career path where they’re using animals instead of other models that may more reliably mimic human biology but are not yet as common in the field.”\n\n“We all know that our in vitro studies do not capture every aspect of biology or physiology,” says Abhijit Majumder, a chemical engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay in Mumbai. “But at the same time, animal studies do not capture the many aspects of human physiology.” A commonly cited statistic is that about 90% of candidate drugs in early-stage clinical trials fail before reaching the market, in part owing to heavy reliance on animal models in preclinical research.\n\nMajumder thinks that broader scientific acceptance of NAMs (an acronym that has been applied variously to “new approach methodologies”, “novel alternative methods”, “new alternative methods” and “non-animal models”) will take some time.\n\nFunding opportunities opening up\n\nFunding from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) has been crucial for Laura Sinclair, a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Exeter, UK. She started out doing a non-funded PhD related to adipose tissue and diabetes. She then switched to a PhD on cellular ageing in an animal-research-free lab. She took advantage of an innovative funding model offered by the London-based charity Animal Free Research UK, which provided three years of funding for her PhD studentship, three years for her postdoc and three years for another fellowship. The stability has been very welcome for her as an early-career researcher, she says.\n\nIn general, Krebs says, NGO grants for animal-free research tend to be smaller than the longer-term, multimillion-dollar awards offered by government sources such as the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research.\n\nAnother change is the number of grants awarded to support the use of alternative methods. In 2021, alternative methods made up about 8% of competitive (non-clinical, non-invertebrate) awards disbursed by the NIH. In the early 1980s, that figure was essentially zero.\n\n“It’s still small compared to the overall NIH funding,” acknowledges Danilo Tagle, director of the Office for Special Initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), an NIH institute based in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nLaura Sinclair was grateful for an animal-free-research grant that gave her stability in the early stages of her career.Credit: Dr Laura R Sinclair\n\nTagle started his science career as a geneticist modelling human diseases in mice, which exposed him to some of the weaknesses in rodent models. He says that there’s been a gradual increase in NIH funding for NAMs, especially in the past decade.\n\nIn 2010, a European Union directive established an ambitious goal to fully replace live animals used for scientific purposes with non-animal methods such as organoids or computer simulations. However, the number of animals used in science in the EU barely moved between 2017 and 2022.\n\nIn terms of EU funding schemes and general acceptance of non-animal methods, there are more doors open to emerging researchers today, says Mathieu Vinken, who obtained his PhD in pharmaceutical sciences in 2006. Vinken is now a professor at the Free University of Brussels, with research interests including reducing the use of animals in space toxicology. His funding sources have included large EU grant programmes.\n\nOverall, Majumder thinks that funders are further along than many scientists in being open to alternative models. For instance, a 2025 call for discovery research proposals from the Indian Council of Medical Research in New Delhi explicitly states that both animal and non-animal models are covered, and gives examples of non-animal methods.\n\nMajumder and other scientists have found niches in which alternative methods are especially needed to plug research gaps. One example is investigating how safe medicines are likely to be during pregnancy because “most of the drugs, when they go through clinical trials, cannot be tested on pregnant women”, Majumder explains. For this, researchers are working on developing an organ-on-a-chip model, a microfluidic system that uses cultured cells to simulate the processes in various organs — in this case, the placenta.\n\nSimilarly, the NIH programme Complement Animal Research In Experimentation, established in 2024, is identifying areas in which animal models are lacking, including rare diseases and sepsis. The programme is a coordinated approach to funding NAMs across the NIH, says Tagle, who spoke to Nature’s careers team before the Trump administration paused some external communications and related activities at the organization.\n\n“We’re looking at at least $30 million per year over the course of the next 10 years to develop NAMs,” Tagle says.\n\nHow a shift in research methodology could reduce animal use\n\nAlthough there is uncertainty about the future of US government funding of biomedical research, Krebs thinks that there’s a case to be made that animal research can be quite wasteful, which could align with the new administration’s messaging about reducing government waste.\n\nFor the time being, duplicating research using different models — while more funders, regulators and scientists become comfortable with NAMs — can add time and expense.\n\n“Essentially today we are in the cusp period where doing all this research has become expensive,” says Deepak Modi, a biologist focused on reproductive health at India’s National Institute for Research in Reproductive and Child Health in Mumbai, who collaborates with Majumder.\n\nModi thinks that in the future, some steps in the chain could be omitted, which would speed up the process and bring down costs without losing rigour. There might also be more “ready-to-play” organ-on-chip solutions once the technology matures, Modi says.\n\nSinclair thinks costs are coming down in response to consumer demand, noting a shift towards more synthetic, reproducible materials since she did her animal-free PhD. She and her colleagues have created a guide to working with tissue cultures that are relevant to humans and not derived from animals — the type of resource that would have been useful to her earlier in her career, she says.\n\nFrom a funder’s perspective, value for money can be complex. “The translational implications have to be weighed in, because one can invest in animal models, but if the animal models are not necessarily human-relevant ... then that’s a big waste in terms of time and resources,” says Tagle, who adds that with organs-on-chips, there are examples of moving from developing models to screening drugs and then going on to clinical trials much faster than when animal models were used. An example is researchers who used a lung tissue-chip to test the chemical azeliragon as a treatment for inflammatory lung diseases, an application that has moved on to phase III clinical trials.\n\nPublication perils",

The analysis was published1 last month on the SSRN preprint server.\n\nPrevious analyses have found that using shorter titles, funny ones or including certain punctuation marks, such as hyphens, commas, brackets or colons, can also help studies to garner more citations.\n\nThe economics papers were published in journals indexed by the scholarly database Web of Science between 2006 and 2019.

The fossil record has long been explored for hard materials, such as shells, bones and teeth, to assess tissue morphology. By contrast, the molecular building blocks of decay-prone soft tissues were assumed to disintegrate rapidly after death owing to physical and biological stressors1. Although there had been a number of reports of soft tissues and biomolecular fragments extracted from fossils from the Mesozoic era (252 million to 65 million years ago) and Palaeozoic era (538 million to 252 million years ago)1,2, it was a landmark paper3published in Science in 2005 by Mary Schweitzer and colleagues that prompted palaeontologists, chemists, geologists, astrobiologists and evolutionary biologists to question previous assumptions about the limitations of the fossil record.",

          "abstract": "A Climate of Truth: Why We Need It and How To Get It Mike Berners-Lee Cambridge Univ. Press (2025)\n\nI had the privilege of hearing climate scientist Mike Berners-Lee talk about his latest book before it was published. To a packed lecture theatre, he laid out his thesis: an increase in truthfulness is more important than technological advances as a solution to climate change and the related threats facing humanity.\n\nI could not stop thinking about this proposition. Was it really that simple, or was the author being unforgivably naive? What would the book have to say about the strange times we currently live in, variously described as post-truth1 and the age of misinformation2? I went out of my way to get my hands on an advance copy — it was a compelling read.\n\nHow scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope\n\nThe first chapter lays out a clear-eyed and data-rich description of the polycrisis we find ourselves in. Berners-Lee takes us through the interlinked issues of climate, energy, population, food, biodiversity, pollution and disease. He sugar-coats nothing.\n\nThe book firmly pushes back on those who argue that we are making progress on climate change. It presents what science tells us we can expect with the temperature rises that are already baked in: collapsing crop yields, worsening fires and more floods. With emissions continuing to increase year on year, we are still accelerating into the problem rather than putting on the brakes.\n\nTechnology isn’t enough\n\nHow can this view of climate change be reconciled with the techno-optimist view that innovation is delivering sustained improvements for most people on our shared planet, and will solve our environmental problems, too?\n\nBerners-Lee refers to techno-optimism as “the new face of climate denial”. He argues that, although we have the technical advances needed to tackle the polycrisis, these alone will never be enough. A good example is how efficiency gains tend to increase, rather than reduce, consumption. This well-understood ‘rebound effect’ is also known as Jevons paradox, after a nineteenth-century industrialist who noticed that more-efficient use of coal led to increased demand. A green transition requires that renewable energy replace fossil fuels rather than supplementing them. This is not happening.\n\nWildfires are expected to increase in severity and frequency owing to climate change.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty\n\nDespite Berners-Lee’s rhetoric, he shares a lot of ground with data scientist Hannah Ritchie, whose excellent book Not the End of the World (2024) takes a techno-optimist position. They both think that a sufficiently high global carbon price is crucial for incentivizing a reduction in fossil-fuel use. And they both agree that we need a mechanism, such as cap and trade, to ensure that the poorest are not disadvantaged. Berners-Lee puts more emphasis on how to get there.\n\nHigh price of deceit\n\nHis book peels back the outer layer of the polycrisis to discuss the drastic changes needed in equality, education, the media, politics, the economy and law. The argument is that living well in the Anthropocene — in which the physical limits to growth are undeniable — demands drastic changes to how society operates, but that the decisions needed will be made only if voters’ understanding isn’t obscured by deceit.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the polycrisis. Berners-Lee highlights three intersecting values needed for humanity to thrive in the Anthropocene: respect for the environment, respect for others and respect for the truth. The final few chapters focus on the most crucial lever: truth.\n\nHow to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics\n\nThe book presents a typology of deception. Outright lies are just the tip of the iceberg, with more-hidden forms such as misdirection, burying bad news and false impressions potentially doing just as much damage. He talks about how “enticing bullshit” propagates: sometimes owing to self-interested cynicism, but often owing to simply to wishful or uncritical thinking.",

          "abstract": "Researchers in Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and European countries are working together to study the use of barn owls (Tyto alba) in pest control.Credit: Thanassis Stravrakis/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nThroughout 15 months of brutal war in the Middle East, an unlikely cross-border scientific collaboration has endured. Ornithologists at Tel Aviv University in Israel have continued to meet online with their counterparts in Jordan, the Palestinian territories and European countries to study the potential for barn owls (Tyto alba) to reduce pesticide use in agriculture.\n\nThe project enlists the owls to devour crop-eating rodents instead of relying on farmers using toxic rodenticides to control populations. In January, shortly after a ceasefire was signed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, researchers from 13 countries gathered in Greece. Their mission was both to discuss how to expand the use of barn owls for biological control and to promote the project as an example of research collaboration to promote peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe ceasefire’s first 42-day phase ended officially on 1 March. Talks between various parties have resumed in Doha, Qatar, but huge uncertainty hovers over what will happen next, including whether the ceasefire will endure. Despite opposition from many countries, Israel’s government is currently blocking food and fuel from entering Gaza. It has also stopped supplying electricity to Gaza’s main desalination plant, aiming to pressure Hamas into extending the ceasefire’s first phase.\n\nOrnithologist Yossi Leshem of Tel Aviv University says he is committed to pursuing collaborations.Credit: Menaham Kahana/AFP/Getty\n\n“I’m not naive,” says Yossi Leshem, the project’s founder and an ornithologist at Tel Aviv University. “The ceasefire is very fragile. I hope [it] will continue permanently, but the situation is still very sensitive.”\n\nLeshem and other Israeli scientists tell Nature that they are committed to continuing their research and pursuing collaborations. Among them is David Lehrer, director of the Center for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, based in Ketura in the south of Israel.\n\nLehrer is coordinating an effort with the Palestinian non-profit organization Damour for Community Development, which has offices in both Gaza and the West Bank. In January, 60 Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli experts met in Athens to discuss how to solve the Middle East’s water, energy, food-security and overall environmental problems. Last week, the group announced further studies into seven project ideas. One is to create an artificial structure from the rubble of destroyed buildings. The structure would house solar energy or water desalination infrastructure.\n\n“Seventy per cent of the buildings in Gaza and almost all infrastructure has been destroyed due to the war,” Lehrer says. As of now, “the rubble constitutes a major environmental and humanitarian threat, due to chemicals released as buildings were destroyed and the large amount of unexploded ordinance mixed in with the rubble”, he adds.\n\nAny project to reconstitute it “will require major coordination between Israel and Palestine and can only be achieved if all sides, including the international community, are fully on board”.\n\nCoexistence amid boycotts\n\nAfter the 7 October 2023 Hamas terror attacks on Israel, the country conducted intense, deadly air strikes on Gaza’s populated areas for 15 months. For most of that time Israel was also at war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nSome universities in Europe have suspended institution-level ties with universities in Israel. For example, the Council of Rectors of French-speaking universities of Belgium, said in a statement in January that it commits to suspending institutional collaborations with organizations, regardless of their origin, that repeatedly support or are directly involved in violations of international law and human rights.\n\n“People in the Middle East have common issues,” says Mouna Maroun, rector of the University of Haifa in Israel.Credit: Medhat Zioud\n\nIn an open letter published last May, some 185 researchers and university administrators from Gaza wrote: “We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the national and international institutions that have stood in solidarity with us, providing support and assistance during these challenging times. However, we stress the importance of coordinating these efforts to effectively reopen Palestinian universities in Gaza.”\n\nNeurobiologist Mouna Maroun, rector of the University of Haifa in Israel, opposes boycotts of Israel’s universities. “Academia is an opportunity to share knowledge and do research in complete freedom,” says Maroun who is an Arab–Israeli citizen. “People in the Middle East have common issues, more than factors that can differentiate and discriminate between us.”\n\nTamir Sheafer, rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, agrees. “Israeli academia is independent of the government,” he says. “At the Hebrew University, 20% of our students are Arab–Palestinian, including thousands of students from East Jerusalem. We maintained our coexistence here on campus during the whole war.”\n\nIn February, Israel’s Association of University Heads issued a report that recorded almost 500 complaints by Israeli researchers of boycotts by overseas institutions and professional academic associations. Researchers reported rejection of papers, disruption to lectures, avoidance of peer review, difficulties in obtaining funding and “a demand from Israelis to declare anti-Israeli intentions as a condition for continued participation in a conference”.\n\nSome international academics are refusing peer-review requests from Israeli researchers because of the war, according to the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), the country’s main research-funding agency, although such refusals are relatively uncommon, says Tamar Jaffe-Mittwoch, the director-general of the ISF, based in Jerusalem.\n\nThese Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty\n\nIn 2024, the ISF approached around 22,000 mostly international researchers for 6,600 grant-reviewer positions. “We were very concerned,” says physicist Daniel Zajfman, who chairs the ISF’s academic board. “We thought, ‘no one wants to look at Israeli science’,” he adds. Of these, around 170 potential reviewers declined to review applications, explicitly citing political reasons — some doing so politely, says Zajfman, and some not so politely, says Jaffe-Mittwoch.\n\nScholarship goes on\n\nAlthough military service in Israel is compulsory for most adult citizens, the war has not reduced the country’s scientific output, according to ISF data. In 2024, grant applications increased by 10% from the roughly 2,500 applications received annually in previous years. Zajfman thinks that this increase can partly be attributed to the determination of scientists to continue with their scholarship. “The feeling is we cannot allow these events, this war, to affect what we are doing now,” he says.\n\nResearchers in these regions hope that collaborative efforts will continue.Credit: Christophe Gateau/dpa/Alamy",

          "authors": "Nikki Forrester",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI’m a scientist based in the United Kingdom. A few years ago, I was verbally encouraged to organize an international conference by staff at a university. At the time, I wasn’t employed at the university or elsewhere in a full-time position, but I’d like to work there in the future. I agreed to the request because the staff suggested it would raise their group’s profile and also help to set me apart in future job applications. I asked repeatedly to be compensated for my conference efforts, and had to wait a long time for the institution’s ambiguous responses. I also could not easily pull out of my commitment to host the event, because it would have negatively affected the attendees and required me to pay a significant cancellation fee.\n\nMy request for compensation was eventually declined, but only after I had delivered the conference. I calculate my efforts to be the equivalent of nearly two years of full-time work. I feel embarrassed, pained and stuck. How can an institution be made to pay? And how can I prevent this situation from happening again? — A distressed scientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s Careers team reached out to two researchers and an employment lawyer for advice.\n\n“This story has all the hallmarks of uncompensated labour done by faculty” members, says Hava Rachel Gordon, a sociologist at the University of Denver in Colorado. “It happens all the time, whether they belong to an institution or are doing work for another institution.”\n\nGordon notes that academics often view themselves as passionate scholars, scientists and teachers. “We don’t often think of ourselves as workers,” she says. “And the problem is, then we are easily taken advantage of.”\n\nAll the sources noted that one of the challenges of working in academia is defining what the job itself entails. Along with research, teaching and service, many faculty members engage in mentorship, public outreach, administrative work and other tasks. Some of this work is paid, but compensation for other labour, such as reviewing grant proposals or giving conference presentations, might take the form of increased stature in the field or enhanced job prospects.\n\nHowever, there is also uncompensated or invisible labour, which is neither rewarded nor recognized in merit reviews1.\n\nStudies have found that women and faculty members of colour spend more time on campus service, diversity-related service, student advising and teaching than do their male and white peers, and this can delay career progression by taking time away from research2,3.\n\nThe time tax put on scientists of colour\n\n“A lot of these requests are done informally without contracts, sometimes without even a paper trail. We call it a hallway ask,” says Gordon, referring to a 2018 article by KerryAnn O’Meara, a higher-education researcher at Columbia University in New York City, describing how the most agreeable and productive faculty members are often stopped in corridors and asked to take on various service tasks.\n\nGordon emphasizes that she understands why the distressed scientist agreed to organize this conference, but notes that it’s difficult to demand payment without a contract in place.\n\n“I think the real problem here is that the parties didn’t make an arrangement ahead of time,” says David Belfort, founding partner of the employment-law firm Bennett & Belfort in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The scientist needs to put their foot down and tell the institution that they’re willing to do the work, but that it needs to be compensated, because they can’t work for free for two years with the expectation that they’re going to get a job offer out of it.”\n\nBelfort acknowledges that the situation is tricky, given that conference organizing is often voluntary, ancillary work conducted by individuals who are paid, full-time employees at universities. “The odd thing here is that if they had received an offer of a position at this institution, they likely would be content. However, there is no quid pro quo — the institution is not required to offer any role going forward — but they may be entitled to back pay for their work.” For instance, if the distressed scientist had carried out this work in certain US jurisdictions, Belfort says, they could claim a violation of state-minimum-wage laws.",

The findings suggest that infantile amnesia — the inability to remember the first few years of life — is probably caused by difficulties in recalling memories, rather than creating them.\n\n“One really cool possibility is that the memories are actually still there in adulthood. It’s just that we’re not able to access them,” says study co-author Tristan Yates, a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nMemory mystery\n\nTry as they might, adults can’t remember events from their earliest months or years. But whether this is because a baby’s hippocampus, a key brain region in storing such memories, is not sufficiently developed or because adults cannot recall these memories has long been an open question.\n\nTo shed light on the issue, Yates and her colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to scan the brains of 26 young children, aged 4 months to 2 years, who were performing a task involving memory.\n\nYoung brain fluid improves memory in old mice\n\nThe team measured hippocampal activity as the children viewed an image of a new face, object or scene for 2 seconds, and when they were shown the same image again about a minute later.\n\nThey found that the greater the hippocampal activity when a baby was looking at a new image, the longer they looked at that image when shown it again. Because babies tend to spend more time looking at familiar things, this result suggests that they were remembering what they had seen.\n\nThe researchers saw the strongest encoding activity in the posterior part of the hippocampus — the area most associated with memory recall in adults.\n\n“What this study shows is a proof of concept that the encoding capability exists,” says study co-author Nick Turk-Browne, a cognitive psychologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“Although we saw this across all the infants in our study, the signal was stronger in those older than 12 months of age, suggesting a kind of developmental trajectory for the ability of the hippocampus to encode individual memories,” says Yates.\n\nResearchers scanned the brains of young children as they lay in an MRI scanner and performed a memory task.Credit: 160/90",

          "abstract": "Chetan Nayak leads Microsoft’s quantum computing effort.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nAnaheim, California\n\nA Microsoft researcher today presented results behind the company’s controversial claim last month that it created the first ‘topological’ qubits — a long-sought goal of quantum computing.\n\nInside Microsoft’s quest for a topological quantum computer\n\nIn front of a packed room at a meeting of the American Physical Society (APS), Chetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsoft’s quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, explained how the company is developing topological qubits, which could be the building blocks for a noise-resistant quantum computer.\n\nPhysicists in the audience said they are still unsure whether Microsoft really has made the first topological qubits, however. “It’s a hard problem,” says Ali Yazdani, an experimental physicist at Princeton University in New Jersey. To anyone trying to make topological qubits, he says, “good luck”.\n\n“It was a beautiful talk,” says Daniel Loss, a theorist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. But he took issue with the strong claims and relative lack of evidence. “People have gone overboard, and the community is not happy. They overdid it,” he says.\n\nNayak acknowledges the criticism: “I never felt like there would be one moment when everyone is fully convinced,” he says, adding that Microsoft is confident in its understanding of the devices, and that other researchers are excited by the work.\n\nQubit cliffhanger\n\nThe standing-room-only APS talk was hotly anticipated in physics circles. Microsoft announced that it had created the first topological qubits on 19 February in a press release. But some physicists were unsure whether the claim would hold because there was no peer-reviewed scientific paper to back it up. (Microsoft published a paper in Nature at the same time as its initial announcement, but the paper described a way to take a read-out from future topological qubits rather than proving their existence1 ).\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nPhysicist Henry Legg of the University of St Andrews, UK, then cast further doubt on Microsoft’s claim when he posted a report on the preprint server arXiv, ahead of peer review, that pokes holes in a test that the company uses to verify its quantum-computing devices2. Legg presented these findings at the APS conference on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, in today’s talk, Nayak displayed a schematic for Microsoft’s qubits: they are microscopic, H-shaped aluminium wires on top of indium arsenide, which is a superconductor at ultracold temperatures. The devices are designed to harness Majoranas, previously undiscovered ‘quasiparticles’ that are essential for topological qubits to work. The goal is for the Majoranas to appear at the four tips of the H-shaped wire, emerging from the collective behaviour of electrons. These Majoranas, in theory, could be used to perform quantum computations that are resistant to information loss.\n\nThe new data that Nayak presented were primarily of ‘X’ and ‘Z’ measurements of the qubits, which are vertical and horizontal probes along the H-shaped wire. When Nayak showed data for the X measurement, he acknowledged that the characteristic bimodal signal was hard to see by eye because of electrical noise.\n\nEun-Ah Kim, a theorist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, therefore questioned the robustness of the X measurement. “I’d like to see the bimodality be easily visible in future experiments,” she told Nature’s news team.",

The end product was a bioplastic called poly(ester amide), or PEA, that consisted mainly of polyester with a few nylon-like amide bonds.\n\nNylon is a 100% amide-bond containing polymer, so there is still some way to go before bacteria can properly mimic this type of plastic, says Yup Lee.\n\nTesting revealed that one type of PEA had physical, thermal and mechanical properties comparable to those of polyethylene, one of the most widely used commercial plastics.\n\nBut Seiichi Taguchi, a bioproduction engineer at Kobe University in Japan, says it is unlikely that the plastic would be as strong as polyethylene, because of the low frequency at which the amino acids were incorporated into the polymers. And adding an amino acid to a polymer often leads to the termination of the chain, creating stunted polymers with low molecular weights, he says.\n\nCommercial potential?",

This is the time programmers typically take to complete the tasks that AI models can complete at a certain success rate.\n\nIn a preprint posted on arXiv this week, METR reports that GPT-2, an early large language model (LLM) published by OpenAI in 2019, failed on all tasks that took human experts more than one minute. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, released in February by the US-based start-up Anthropic, completed 50% of the tasks that would take people 59 minutes.\n\nOverall, the time horizon of the 13 leading AI models has doubled roughly every seven months since 2019, the paper finds. The exponential growth of AI time horizons accelerated in 2024, with the latest models doubling their horizon roughly every three months. The work has not been formally peer reviewed.\n\nSource: T. Kwa et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.14499 (2025).\n\nAt the 2019-2024 rate of progress, METR suggests that AI models will be able to handle tasks that take humans about a month at 50% reliability by 2029, possibly sooner.\n\nOne month of dedicated human expertise, the paper notes, can be enough to start a new company or make scientific discoveries, for instance.\n\nBut Joshua Gans, a management professor at the University of Toronto in Canada, who has written on the economics of AI, says that these sorts of predictions aren’t that useful. “Extrapolations are tempting to do, but there is still so much we don’t know about how AI will actually be used for these to be meaningful,” he says.\n\nHuman versus AI assessment\n\nThe team chose the 50% success rate because it was the most robust to small changes in the data distribution. “If you pick very low or very high thresholds, removing or adding a single successful or single failed task, respectively, changes your estimate a lot,” says co-author Lawrence Chan.\n\nRaising the reliability threshold from 50% to 80% reduced the average time horizon by a factor of five — although the overall doubling time and trendline were similar.\n\nIn the past five years, improvements in the general capabilities of LLMs have been driven largely by increases in scale — the amount of training data, training time and number of model parameters. The paper attributes progress on the time horizon metric mainly to improvements in AI’s logical reasoning, tool use, error correction and self-awareness in task execution.\n\nMETR’s time-horizon approach addresses some of the limitations in existing AI benchmarks, which map to real-world work only loosely and quickly ‘saturate’ as models improve. It provides a continuous, intuitive measure that better captures meaningful long-term progress, says co-author Ben West.\n\nLeading AI models achieve superhuman performance on many benchmarks, but they have had relatively little economic impact, says West. METR’s latest research offers a partial answer to this puzzle: the best models sit at around a 40-minute time horizon, and there isn’t much economically valuable work that a person can do in that time, says West.\n\nBut Anton Troynikov, an AI researcher and entrepreneur in San Francisco, California, says that AI would have more economic impact if organizations were more willing to experiment and invest in leveraging the models effectively.",

Credit: Steve Gschmeissner/SPL\n\nImmune cells in the skin ‘cauterize’ open wounds and create ‘band-aids’ to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and foreign molecules from injury sites, finds a study1 in mice.\n\nThe works shows that white blood cells called neutrophils form gooey, protein-rich rings around sites where the skin has been breached. These rings trap pathogens, ensuring that they don’t penetrate into deeper tissues.\n\nSuperpowered skin\n\nScientists have long known that neutrophils wage chemical warfare by releasing toxins to kill invading microorganisms. But the new work, published today in Nature, reveals “an additional role for neutrophils here that we had not appreciated”, says Niki Moutsopoulos, a clinical immunologist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, who was not involved with the study. The findings show that neutrophils aid in wound healing — and are not just immune warriors, she adds.\n\nThe study also highlights a new defence tactic that the immune system deploys to protect the body beyond destroying germs. To the authors’ surprise, neutrophils “prevent conflict before they go into this biochemical war. They build the structures to separate self from non-self, to keep pathogens [away]”, says study co-author Andrés Hidalgo, an immunologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nMulti-talented immune cells\n\nNeutrophils are known to poison invading microbes and to swallow them. But these strategies cause “collateral damage” to the body by killing healthy bystander cells, Hidalgo says.\n\nThe skin’s ‘surprise’ power: it has its very own immune system\n\nTo investigate whether neutrophils have another trick up their sleeves, the researchers examined samples of mouse skin, lungs and gut ― organs that have contact with the external environment and are lined with protective layers to help ward off pathogens and foreign substances. Hidalgo and his colleagues found that a high percentage of neutrophils in these tissues produce collagen and other proteins that are important for forming ‘extracellular matrix’, a scaffolding that surrounds cells and gives tissues structure. By contrast, neutrophils in blood did not release collagen.",

          "abstract": "The Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands has posted online a copy of the survey some of its researchers received.Credit: Shutterstock\n\nA growing number of researchers in Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada who receive US funding have been asked to declare their institution’s links to China and whether their projects comply with US government ideology. Associations representing universities in these regions say this threatens academic freedom and undermines scientific advancement.\n\nSeveral universities or university associations have confirmed to Nature that some of their staff or members were sent a detailed survey asking whether their US-funded projects relate to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), climate and environmental justice or study what the survey calls ‘gender ideology’. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s administration has cut funding for research related to these topics. Other questions ask specifically about the institution’s funding ties and collaborations with entities that could be against US interests.\n\nThe survey “is at the extreme end of foreign influence in a way that we have never seen from any of our research partners”, says Vicki Thomson, chief executive of the Group of Eight (Go8) consortium of Australia’s leading research universities, some of which have received the survey. It could “tip over to foreign interference if it is contrary to our values and national interests”, she says.\n\nMany universities in Europe have advised their researchers not to respond to the survey, but some in Australia have responded.\n\nThe questions\n\nThe 36-point survey also asks researchers whether their institutions work with communist, socialist or any parties that espouse anti-American beliefs, according to copies of the questionnaire posted online by UK newspaper The Guardian and Resource, a magazine published by Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands.\n\nResponses to questions are scored out of a total of 180 points. Projects get higher points if they don’t contribute to DEI, climate and ‘gender ideology’, or their organisation doesn’t work with communist, socialist or parties that espouse anti-American beliefs. Projects that contribute to preventing illegal immigration to the United States; to combating prosecution of Christians; and to supporting efforts to secure rare-earth minerals also score highly. By contrast, institutions that receive funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran score lower.\n\nThomson says that, although funding agencies often ask about universities’ policies around modern slavery, gender-equality plans and other good research practices, many questions in the survey are “beyond the traditional scope of grant compliance”. Researchers were given 48 hours to respond to the questionnaires, she says.\n\nChad Gaffield, chief executive of the U15-Group of Canadian Research Universities in Ottawa, says that while the questionnaire asks some familiar and appropriate questions about accountability, transparency and security, other points “politicize the research enterprise”. The questions threaten the ability of US-led research projects to address crucial questions and thereby undermine the advancement of knowledge, says Gaffield.\n\nIn the Netherlands, where researchers in at least one university were sent the survey, Caspar Van den Berg, president of Universities of the Netherlands, which represents 14 universities in the country, said the survey was an example of the deteriorating climate for the freedom of scientific practice in the United States, which affects Dutch universities and Dutch researchers. It “underlines the importance of all of us standing up for free science”, Van den Berg said in the daily Dutch newspaper NRC.\n\nUniversity response\n\nThe surveys have been forwarded to foreign researchers either from their university research partners in the United States or sent directly to researchers abroad from US government departments. Copies of the survey that have been shared online state that the document has been sent on the instruction of the US Office of Management and Budget, a large office in the executive branch of government, which oversees the budget.",

Horálek\n\nA massive green hydrogen plant proposed for construction in Chile could increase light pollution at one of the world’s most powerful telescopes by at least one-third, says the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the consortium that operates the telescope and will either host or operate others being built nearby.\n\nAn ESO analysis released on Monday found that light pollution would increase by at least 35% at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) ― one of the most advanced optical telescopes in the world ― and by at least 55% at the southern array of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), which is now under construction and will be the largest ground-based observatory for very-high-energy γ-ray astronomy. The analysis also found that the green-energy project would increase atmospheric turbulence at the telescopes and cause vibrations that will damage the sensitive equipment.\n\nLasers pierce the stunning dark skies of the Atacama Desert\n\nTogether, the effects will cause “devastating, irreversible” damage that cannot be mitigated, astronomer Itziar de Gregorio-Monsalvo, the ESO’s representative in Chile, said at a media briefing on Monday. “It will reach a point where it is highly likely that we won’t be able to operate these telescopes.”\n\nBefore the analysis was released, the developer of the green-energy plant, AES Andes in Santiago, said that its project “aims to use the best technologies and the strictest standards”, and that a company analysis found that the project will not have a “significant impact” at the observatories. On Monday, the company said in a statement: “We are still working on gathering data from the ESO document to understand the discrepancies between ESO’s numbers and our own analysis.”\n\nPerfect conditions\n\nThe green-energy project would span 3,000 hectares in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the driest on Earth. The arid climate and lack of cloud cover there create ideal conditions for stargazing. The region also has extremely dark skies: a 2023 study1 compared levels of light pollution at the 28 leading astronomical observatories worldwide and found that the Paranal Observatory, site of the VLT, had the darkest location of them all, followed by the nearby Armazones Observatory, where the ESO is building the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which the organization says “will be the largest visible and infrared light telescope in the world”.\n\nAstronomers fear that the Very Large Telescope, one of the most advanced optical telescopes in operation, could lose some of its capabilities if a proposed energy mega-project moves forward. Credit: European Southern Observatory/Science Photo Library\n\nThe Atacama’s dark skies and other qualities lured organizations to build cutting-edge instruments such as the VLT, the ELT and the southern array of the CTAO. “The darker the sky, the fainter the astronomical object that can be examined,” notes a summary of the ESO’s report on the green-energy project.\n\nThe conditions in the Atacama also lured energy company AES Andes, a subsidiary of the AES Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. The company has proposed using the region’s intense sunshine and strong winds to generate solar and wind power. These would provide energy for the extraction of hydrogen from water, which could be collected from the nearby Pacific Ocean. Hydrogen made with renewable energy is often called green hydrogen.\n\nAES has proposed building a green-hydrogen complex that would include a port, ammonia and hydrogen production plants and thousands of electricity generators. The project’s main unit would be located 11 kilometres from Paranal Observatory, 5 km from the CTAO and 20 km from the ELT.\n\nDuelling numbers\n\nThe ESO’s latest analysis was conducted by Martin Aubé at the Center for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec in Sherbrooke, Canada, who studies light pollution at astronomical facilities, and other researchers led by ESO director of operations Andreas Kaufer. It is based on information in the environmental-impact report that AES submitted in early January to Chile’s Environmental Evaluation Service agency (SEA). The SEA will decide whether the AES project goes ahead.\n\n‘Einstein’ telescope high on Europe’s astronomy wish list\n\nThe ESO analysis found that the increase in artificial light from the AES project would make it harder for instruments to distinguish between celestial bodies. “Increasing the brightness of the sky is like reducing the size of the telescope mirrors,” said Eduardo Unda-Sanzana, an astronomer at the University of Antofagasta in Chile.",

          "title": "What is stopping a complete switch to clean energy?",
          "authors": "Benjamin Plackett",
          "abstract": "Enthusiasm for lower carbon emissions is fuelling record investment in energy technologies. In 2024, global energy investment exceeded US$3 trillion for the first time, two-thirds of which went towards clean-energy technologies and infrastructure. This trend, detailed in the World Energy Investment 2024 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), is mirrored by a surge in research on affordable and clean energy. In the Nature Index, which tracks output in selected natural- and health-science journals, such research accounted for just 3.7% of all papers in 2015. By 2023, that figure had grown to 8.3%. While these are positive steps in the transition away from fossil fuels, a deeper look at the data reveals challenges that must be addressed for clean energy to be scaled up globally.\n\nNature Index 2025 Energy\n\n“There is a ramping up of clean-energy investment against a backdrop of plateauing fossil-fuel spending,” says IEA investment and finance analyst, Tanguy De Bienassis. But, he adds, it’s probably premature to say that the halcyon days of oil and gas are finished, because that plateauing could simply mean that fossil fuels don’t need as much investment as they once did to remain competitive.\n\nThe fact that renewables don’t meet demand in key areas emphasizes the work that needs to be done to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. According to the IEA report, global demand for heat energy — used to warm buildings and power industrial processes — is outstripping the rate at which renewables can be deployed to meet the need. The subsequent use of fossil fuels for heat is predicted to drive a 5% increase in annual carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector between 2024 and 2030.\n\nAt the same time, the way that clean-energy investment is shared between countries is highly uneven (see ‘Stark imbalance’). China, for instance, is responsible for roughly one-third of global spending on renewables (and a similar share of global carbon emissions). In 2023, it spent an estimated $890 billion in clean-energy sectors, up by 40% on 2022, according to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. This is just shy of the total global investments in the fossil-fuel supply in 2023, at $950 billion, as reported by the IEA.\n\nSource: World Energy Investment 2024, IEA (2024)\n\nA big part of China’s efforts in clean energy is building renewable power facilities. The country invested $359 billion in this area in 2024, compared with $85 billion from the United States and the European Union’s $106 billion. Emerging and developing economies, including Brazil, India and South Africa, account for just 15% of global renewables investment, and risk missing out on the benefits of clean-energy technologies, including energy independence.\n\nSolar stronghold\n\nAmong renewables, solar energy dominates research and investment. In 2023, solar outperformed investments in every other energy type combined for the first time. This happened again in 2024, and the gap widened (see ‘Solar supremacy’). “We’re always underestimating how much solar is going to come online,” says De Bienassis. “It shows that the technology is rich and reaching its maturity. It’s very easy to install and that’s what makes it a success.”\n\nChina boasts the world’s most advanced manufacturing base for solar-energy generation. The Tongwei Company, for example, which is headquartered in Chengdu, produced enough solar panels in 2023 to meet 10% of global demand that year. But the vast solar-panel plants that China specializes in have their weaknesses. De Bienassis notes that if one of them underwent an industrial accident, “it would completely disrupt the supply chain”. For now, however, China remains the leading force in solar-energy technology and facilities.\n\nSource: World Energy Investment 2024, IEA (2024)\n\nChina’s dominance also extends to nuclear power. Over the past five years, China has added 11 gigawatts to its nuclear power capacity, according to the IEA report, far outstripping any other country. It was one of only two countries (the other being Egypt) that started construction on a new nuclear power plant in 2023, and of the estimated $80 billion spent on nuclear power globally last year, China contributed the lion’s share. “They’re the country that builds the most nuclear plants, the most solar and the most wind,” says De Bienassis. “We call them the powerhouse of the clean-energy transition.”\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, is likely to continue decoupling its trade and supply chains from China. President Donald Trump has signalled that he favours fossil fuels over renewables and pledged to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord earlier this year.",

          "authors": "Richard O. Ocaya, Thembinkosi D. Malevu",
          "abstract": "At 3 p.m. on 30 December last year, residents of Mukuku village in Makueni county, Kenya, were startled by a loud crash. In the middle of a field lay a mysterious, smouldering metal ring, 2.5 metres across and weighing nearly 500 kilograms. Elsewhere, in western Uganda in May 2023, villagers reported seeing streaks of fire in the sky before debris rained down, scattering wreckage across a 40-kilometre-wide area.\n\nThese were no ordinary meteorites — they were remnants of a defunct satellite and spent rocket stage, returning to Earth without warning.\n\nThe quest to conquer Earth’s space junk problem\n\nThese events are not isolated. Across the world, from Texas to Saudi Arabia, from Cape Town to the Amazon rainforest, objects launched into low Earth orbit (LEO) are now falling back to Earth. Some burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, but others — especially those made of titanium and heat-resistant space-age alloys — survive re-entry and slam into the ground, sometimes in populated areas.\n\nThe problem is getting worse. With the rapid expansion of commercial space flight, thousands of satellites are being launched each year. Yet few owners have plans to remove them from orbit in a controlled way.\n\nEveryone, everywhere — on Earth’s surface, flying in aeroplanes, as well as in space — is increasingly at risk from these projectiles1.\n\nSpace-faring nations and companies must urgently address this threat. The uncontrolled re-entry of space debris is not just a nuisance — it is a legal, environmental and potentially catastrophic problem. Without fresh policies and mitigation strategies, it is only a matter of time before one of these incidents leads to a loss of life.\n\nA growing problem above\n\nLow Earth orbit, the region of space stretching from 160 km to 2,000 km above Earth’s surface, is the most congested orbital zone. It is home to imaging satellites, weather and communications constellations and space stations such as the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nIt is also the most debris-laden part of space, harbouring more than 6,000 tonnes of human-made objects. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030, more than 60,000 satellites will have been launched, the majority of which are destined to become debris2,3.\n\nFour steps to global management of space traffic\n\nMost satellite re-entries are uncontrolled. Some space agencies deliberately steer defunct satellites into the ocean. However, many operators simply leave them to decay naturally, with no certainty about where they will land. Any location on Earth could be in the firing line.\n\nAs objects in LEO experience atmospheric drag, they gradually slow down and spiral back to Earth. Smaller fragments burn up during re-entry, but larger pieces — rocket stages, fuel tanks and satellite components — often survive, crashing to Earth at speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second. The energy released by their impacts can be equivalent to that of a small missile4. The higher the re-entry speed, the further debris can spread.\n\nPredicting crash sites is extremely difficult. When an object falls from space, its path to Earth isn’t a straight line or even smooth. Predicting where it will land involves complex calculations and many factors, including Earth’s rotation, gravity, winds and the object’s initial speed and altitude5. Mathematical models, such as NASA’s Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool and simplified general perturbations models, can be used to estimate the track of decaying orbital debris.\n\nA large piece of debris from a spacecraft was found in Salinópolis, Brazil, in April 2014.Credit: Tasso Sarraf/AFP/Getty\n\nHistory has repeatedly shown that crises are often ignored until they escalate into disasters. Space debris is no exception, and failing to address it urgently could have catastrophic consequences. Imagine a large satellite, weighing several tonnes, re-entering Earth’s atmosphere without warning. Unlike the controlled descent of the Mir space station in 2001, this object might well veer off course and crash into a city. The devastation would be catastrophic, bringing legal, political and financial chaos.\n\nThe risks extend beyond ground impacts. A major — and rarely discussed — concern is a potential collision between a falling piece of debris and commercial aircraft. At any given time, more than 10,000 aeroplanes are in the air worldwide. The uncontrolled descent of a dense, high-velocity object through busy air corridors could lead to a mid-air disaster. Currently, there are no global protocols to warn pilots or airlines about incoming space debris. In 2022, US airspace was briefly shut down because of an uncontrolled rocket body re-entry. Although such closures are rare, increasing global space activity makes similar incidents more likely, underscoring the need for stricter regulations on debris mitigation and controlled re-entries to prevent future disruptions and safety hazards.\n\nCascading collision threats\n\nBeyond the immediate threat of falling debris, there’s a looming danger known as Kessler Syndrome2. Proposed by NASA scientist Donald Kessler in 1978, this scenario predicts a point at which the density of objects in LEO becomes so high that collisions between them generate more debris, leading to a cascade of further collisions.\n\nThis self-perpetuating cycle could render certain orbital regions unusable, posing risks to satellites, space missions and the ISS. As of 2021, there were more than 4,000 active satellites in orbit, with estimates of 600,000 pieces of space junk ranging from 1–10 centimetres in size6. On average, one satellite is destroyed each year when it collides with another satellite or piece of debris.\n\nWorld’s first wooden satellite could herald era of greener space exploration\n\nThe growing amount of space debris is no longer a distant or hypothetical threat; it is an immediate danger. European Space Agency (ESA) estimates show that, as of February this year, more than 36,000 objects larger than 10 cm are currently being tracked in Earth’s orbit and more than one million objects between 1 cm and 10 cm are orbiting the planet. Even tiny fragments — many too small to be detected by current tracking systems — can cause huge amounts of damage owing to the sheer velocity at which they travel. The ISS relies on ballistic panels for protection, but shielding alone is not enough. The station’s crew must remain vigilant; spacewalking astronauts are especially vulnerable.\n\nThe escalating situation underscores the crucial need for space-traffic management and collision-avoidance strategies to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration and utilization. As orbital congestion worsens, the need for robust tracking, accountability and mitigation strategies becomes undeniable.\n\nFurthermore, sunlight reflected from and the burning up of orbital debris contribute to light pollution, increasingly interfering with views of the night sky from ground-based scientific observatories. For instance, bright trails from SpaceX’s satellite constellations, although not classified as active debris, are hard to miss as they move across the night sky. In January, astronomers mistook a Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car that was launched by SpaceX in 2018 as a stunt, for an asteroid that could potentially threaten Earth. Having to devote global resources to track such an object is wasteful.\n\nThe legal black hole",

          "abstract": "Pictured (left to right) Rafiou Agoro, Justin Hounkpevi, Tchilabalo Parobali, Dzifa AhiatrogahCredit: Rafiou Agoro\n\nIn April 2018, during my second year of a postdoctoral fellowship at New York University, I and my colleagues submitted an abstract to the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), which was holding its annual meeting that September in Montreal, Canada.\n\nAs a citizen of Togo with limited experience of international conference travel, I saw the chance to attend this three-day meeting as an important career-development opportunity, enabling me to share scientific discoveries, learn from others and get updates on emerging technologies.\n\nBut unlike my colleagues from Europe, and despite us all having similar professional titles and immigration statuses in the United States, I needed a Canadian visa to attend. That’s because documentation requirements were more stringent for citizens of African countries than for applicants from elsewhere.\n\nI identified a private company that provided visa services for the Canadian government, and six weeks before the conference I took a half-day’s leave to attend an appointment and paid Can$185 (then the equivalent of about US$140) to secure a passport stamp. A month later, I was given a second appointment, during which I received my passport and visa. The delay meant that registration, hotel reservations and airfares had increased in price.\n\nHow African scientists can give back to their home continent\n\nBecause most of the international meetings that welcome scientists from all over the world are held in the United States and Europe, scientists based outside these territories can find attendance particularly challenging, often requiring — as it did for me — months of paperwork to prepare.\n\nThis is especially the case for PhD students in Africa who have never travelled overseas before for work.\n\nWith this in mind, and informed by my own experiences, I partnered with Mohamed Cisse, a mathematician and computer scientist based in Guinea, to launch a travel-fellowship and mentoring programme. (Mohamed and I had already worked together to found the African Diaspora Scientists Federation (ADSF), a network of scientists who have developed their careers outside the continent.)\n\nWe approached the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in 2023 with the aim of helping an interdisciplinary group of students to attend the following year’s Cell Bio meeting, an annual event held jointly with the European Molecular Biology Organization.\n\nWe wanted to create an ADSF–ASCB fellowship programme that would enable PhD students based in Africa to present their research in-person at the four-day Cell Bio meeting in San Diego, California, in December 2024.\n\nCareer resources for African scientists\n\nWe launched the call for fellowship applications in May and received more than 50 applications in a month, choosing four applicants for the pilot programme.\n\nThey were Tchilabalo Parobali, a biosecurity engineer at the University of Lomé in Togo; poultry scientist Justin Hounkpevi, also based there; Dzifa Ahiatrogah, a biomedical scientist at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana; and Gerard Quarcoo, an aquatic microbiologist at the Water Research Institute in Tamale, Ghana.\n\nIn June, we sent letters of invitation and all the paperwork for visa applications. It then took around four months before the applicants had their visa appointments at the US embassies in their countries.\n\nSadly, Gerard’s application was unsuccessful. But by mid-November, we were able to buy plane tickets for the other three. Because travel was the following month, the $1,200 round-trip ticket was twice as expensive as it would have been if purchased months in advance. The fellowship also covered hotel charges, the cost of airport–hotel transfers and ACSB membership for 2025.\n\nCamaraderie\n\nTo create a climate of pre-meeting camaraderie, the three fellows travelled together from Accra to the US west coast, a two-day journey with stopovers in Europe and the US east coast. I was in touch throughout their travels and met them before their poster sessions to offer advice, in between my own conference preparation and attendance at sessions.\n\nI loved the practical aspects of their science, which I categorize as applied biology. Tchilabalo’s work, for example, uses a new dietary formula to increase poultry mass, which has societal benefits.\n\nListening to the three students reminded me of the importance of asking myself about the translational aspect of my own fundamental research, in which I use preclinical mouse models to pinpoint molecular mechanisms that improve the healthspan and lifespan of people with sickle-cell and kidney diseases.\n\nI met the students each day for breakfast and lunch, using the time to review their plans for the day and provide advice if needed. We also took some evening walks together, and the fellows attended two receptions at which they networked with other scientists.",

That’s a question that Nicholas Evans, a social scientist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, was hoping his research could answer — until funding for his grants was cut by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) this month.\n\nThe grants were among 91 social-science studies terminated by the DoD, including many that were part of the flagship Minerva Research Initiative, which supports basic social-science research so as to better understand emerging threats to national security.\n\n“One of the brilliant parts” of Minerva is that it takes “the notion of security broadly,” says Leonardo Villalón, a political scientist who studies the Sahel region in Africa at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Minerva grants fund research on global dynamics such as violence, instability, natural catastrophes, human displacement and migration, he says.\n\nThe defence department stated in a press release that it was “scrapping its social science research portfolio as part of a broader effort to ensure fiscal responsibility and prioritize mission-critical activities”. Termination notices, seen by Nature, state that the grants no longer served DoD’s “program goals or agency priorities”.\n\n“The big challenge”, says Evans, “is that there is almost nowhere else in the United States where you can get two and a half million dollars to do social-sciences research, and that limits our ability to get funded.” He and his collaborators received US$5.3 million in research grants in 2021 and 2024, as part of Minerva. With the funding cut, he will lose US$4.3 million.\n\nNational interest\n\nThe Minerva initiative was launched in 2008, and grants are managed by research offices run by the army, air force and navy. A portion of the funds go towards educating students at US military schools and academies in key areas of the social sciences, and many of those grants have also been terminated.\n\nNeil Johnson, a physicist at George Washington University in Washington DC, received termination notices for two grants, each worth about $2.5 million. One of them, close to the end of its five-year term, supported research on how threats, hate and extremism spread through online and offline social networks. The other focused on security threats along national borders.\n\n“The rationale was really weird,” says Johnson. For years, he has participated in calls and briefs at DoD agencies. Among other things, he has advised intelligence officers at military bases of his research findings, from the weaponization of health to gun violence. Now that all stops, he says.\n\nSpending money on military preparedness — on armaments and technology, for example — but not on understanding the nature and causes of potential military conflicts is incredibly short-sighted, says Kathy Baylis, a development economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It kind of boggles the mind,” she says. The Minerva Research Initiative accounts for a fraction of the DoD’s budget. In its 2024 budget request, the department requested $64.3 million for Minerva out of a total budget of $842 billion.\n\nBaylis has also had her Minerva grant terminated. Awarded in 2023, it enabled her to study the effects of climate shocks on food security in sub-Saharan Africa. It was initially guaranteed for three years, with an option of two more. Between the Minerva losses and cuts to grants from the US Agency for International Development, Baylis has lost roughly US$5 million over the past few weeks. Since then, she has been scrounging for money to pay salaries and working out ways to share the limited data that she and her team managed to collect. “They just wasted a whole pile of money that had been spent on research that can no longer be fulfilled,” she says.\n\nVillalón, who was studying the impact of climate hazards on societies in the Sahel, and how those communities were responding to changes, had already spent most of the $1.6 million awarded as a three-year grant in 2022. He and his team had only about $200,000 left over, which would have been used to support data analysis and publication.",

Credit: Irfan Khan/Los Angeles Times via Getty\n\nThe US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has expanded its cuts to science funding, terminating a growing list of research projects that now encompasses hundreds of grants funding studies on a wide range of topics — from HIV in children to reducing mould exposure and its effect on asthma. And concern is growing among scientists that research investigating mRNA vaccines might be next.\n\nExclusive: NIH to terminate hundreds of active research grants\n\nNature has learnt that the agency has already terminated at least one grant that supported a scientist at Columbia University in New York City who was investigating the body’s immune response to an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nThe fears over mRNA-vaccine grant cancellations come after NIH staff members were instructed to compile a list of grants for studying the technology, according to an e-mail sent on 6 March that Nature has obtained. Acting NIH director Matthew Memoli “has requested information on NIH’s investment in mRNA vaccines research” — including current and planned grants, the e-mail said, setting a one-day deadline. By the time the deadline came around, a spreadsheet with more than 130 entries had been compiled, according to an NIH official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nAlthough grants on mRNA-vaccine research have not yet been terminated en masse as they have for other topics — including LGBT+ health — the request is an ominous sign, says Justin Richner, a viral immunologist at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nNIH workers are worried enough that they have started advising grant applicants not to mention mRNA vaccines in their research proposals, according to reporting by KFF Health News, a health-care and policy news outlet in Washington DC. Sources who spoke to Nature have indicated that this wasn’t an official directive from NIH leadership, but a recommendation from individual programme officers.\n\n“To take away a tool to fight infectious diseases that has been shown to be effective — it’s hard to fathom that we’d do this as a society,” says Richner, who is designing an mRNA vaccine against dengue virus.\n\nThe NIH, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research, did not respond to Nature’s queries about whether mRNA-vaccine research will be terminated or about scientists’ concerns over political meddling in scientific research.\n\nTurning against research\n\nThe panic over mRNA-vaccine grants comes hot on the heels of the agency’s termination of more than 40 grants for studying vaccine hesitancy. Similarly to the call for a list of mRNA-vaccine projects, the agency asked for a spreadsheet containing all active projects on vaccine hesitancy. NIH workers were informed that certain grants should be cancelled by the end of the day in a 10 March e-mail that Nature has obtained. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses [sic] gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the termination letters said.\n\nWill RFK Jr’s vaccine agenda make America contagious again?\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, was chosen by US President Donald Trump as the nation’s health secretary, and now runs the NIH’s parent agency. In 2021, he unsuccessfully petitioned government regulators to rescind approval of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and falsely claimed that this type of jab is the “deadliest vaccine ever made”, pointing to unverified claims of side effects on a government-run database.\n\nmRNA vaccines rose to fame during the COVID-19 pandemic, not only for their safety and efficacy in preventing severe disease, but also for the speed with which they were developed and deployed — mostly during the first Trump administration. The jabs include genetic instructions that tell a person’s cells to create copies of viral proteins, also known as antigens. This process stimulates the body to generate protective antibodies and virus-fighting immune cells.\n\nModelling studies suggest that, worldwide, mRNA vaccines saved more than 14 million lives in the first year they were administered1, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers are now testing the technology against a litany of conditions, including mosquito-borne diseases and cancer, for which there are more than 100 ongoing trials. Yet some US officials, including Florida’s surgeon general, have called for a moratorium on the technology and have made baseless claims that the jabs cause cancer and are not safe.\n\n“Never in my life did I think that the government would turn against a field of research for non-scientific reasons,” says Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who shared the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for laying the groundwork needed to create mRNA vaccines. “I feel mostly bewildered, because the potential for RNA is so enormous.”",

          "abstract": "Sámi reindeer herders of northern Sweden adapt the animals’ grazing areas depending on the changing environment.Credit: Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/Getty\n\nThe Madagascar periwinkle packs a lot of healing power into its delicate pink flowers. Although native to the African island after which it is named, for centuries it has been cultivated and used in medicinal practices around the world — including Chinese, Ayurvedic, European and African traditions — commonly as a treatment for diabetes, but also for malaria, asthma, toothache and other maladies.\n\nExtracts from the flower are used as a remedy for eye infections in the Caribbean, where Damian Cohall, a Jamaican-born ethnopharmacologist at the University of the West Indies in Cave Hill, Barbados, learnt of it through interviews with elder members of local communities. Research in his laboratory identified compounds in the plant that inhibit an enzyme that regulates insulin levels and could lead to treatments for type 2 diabetes (see go.nature.com/3djmhyr). “The fact that these anti-diabetic properties are known in traditional practices validates the Indigenous science that existed well before Western knowledge systems,” Cohall says.\n\nHow to support Indigenous Peoples on biodiversity: be rigorous with data\n\nThe case of the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) not only demonstrates the value of knowledge held by Indigenous and local communities, but also illustrates how this expertise has often been exploited. In the 1950s, Western researchers intrigued by the plant’s widespread use discovered that the vinca alkaloids that it contained could treat cancer. Drugs derived from these compounds are still sold worldwide today for huge profits, which Cohall says have not been shared equitably with the local communities where the knowledge originated.\n\nSimilar dynamics have played out repeatedly over the past 500 years or more, as Western science has become imposed as the dominant knowledge system around most of the globe. In the process, many alternative ways of understanding the world have been marginalized. “There has been for a long time, and there is still, a distrust of Indigenous knowledge among scientists,” says Marie Roué, an environmental anthropologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. She says that Indigenous knowledge is often dismissed because it incorporates religious or spiritual elements. It also tends to be passed on orally and through cultural traditions, making it hard to formalize in the manner prized by the Western empirical method.\n\nHowever, Indigenous and local communities hold unique insights that can enhance people’s shared understanding of the natural world and inform attempts to protect it. Recognizing this, scientists such as Cohall and Roué are working in partnership with Indigenous and local groups to preserve and amplify these insights, integrate them into their own research and co-produce fresh knowledge with these communities.\n\nDocumenting and validating traditional medicine\n\nCohall has also identified anti-cancer compounds in the sarsaparilla plant (Smilax regelii). Currently, his lab is investigating the wound-healing properties of the Christmas candle plant (Senna alata), “inspired by information from a traditional healer in Ghana”, Cohall says.\n\nThe sweet violet (Viola odorata) and pink Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) have a long history of use for a range of maladies.Credit: Historic Illustrations/Alamy\n\nResearchers who incorporate local traditions and Indigenous knowledge into their work need to be sensitive to a range of social and cultural factors, especially in the Caribbean. “It’s science,” Cohall says, “but at the same time it’s history, it’s globalization, it’s migration.”\n\nThroughout history, various communities have settled, or been forced to settle, in the Caribbean. Each of these groups brought their traditions and culture and produced unique insights through their interactions with the natural environment. Sometimes the groups brought medicinal plants with them, which Cohall says might have happened with the periwinkle. But this knowledge has since been dismissed or suppressed. “A lot of those traditional Indigenous practices were pushed to the side because they were considered to be more primitive or not advanced or sophisticated, which led to a major loss of information,” Cohall says.\n\nWeaving Indigenous knowledge into the scientific method\n\nThis loss continues today, in part because of the modern Westernized education system; “it might not directly suggest that you should not focus on Indigenous traditional practices,” Cohall says, “but it definitely emphasizes a different way of knowledge acquisition.” He also explains that urbanization has led more people to move to cities, away from the rural areas where they can experience nature and apply traditional practices. Although the Caribbean’s history is unique, these forces of suppression and cultural imposition are common threats to Indigenous and local knowledge around the globe.\n\nContextual understanding\n\nCohall says that he can investigate the efficacy of traditional medicine using Westernized lab methods because the basic aim of any medicine is the same: to treat illness safely and effectively. However, other forms of Indigenous and local knowledge fit less easily into different epistemological systems. Often, ways of understanding the environment are formed through direct experience of nature and can be altered by when, where and in whom the knowledge exists.\n\n“In our Western world, nature and culture are separated, and science pretends to be capable of giving knowledge without taking into account culture. Indigenous knowledge is more holistic,” says Roué. She has spent decades working with the Sámi reindeer herders of northern Sweden and notes that these less tangible ways of knowing can be seen in the Sámi’s understanding of the lands that their reindeer graze on.\n\nDuring winter, the Sámi’s reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) feed mainly on lichen that grows on the ground and is then covered by thick snow. This is dependent on a confluence of environmental factors, including the climate, soil and vegetation. If there’s no snow, the lichen is left exposed and is destroyed by the cold temperature and wind; if it rains, then a layer of ice can freeze on top of the lichen and prevent the reindeer from getting to it.\n\nReindeer in northern Sweden feed mainly on lichen that grows on the ground.Credit: Vasilisa Gagarina/Getty\n\nThe locations of good grazing areas therefore change constantly, which the Sámi have become sensitive to. This dynamic understanding of their environment is reflected in the Sámi word guohtun, which is most often translated as ‘pasture’. “They use ‘pasture’ because that’s the word in the other languages, but in their own language guohtun also encompasses how available the lichen is to the reindeer given the conditions today of the snow and wind,” says Roué. “They don’t speak about pasture like a botanist does -— as a permanent mix that is more or less good for an animal — they speak through their experience of ever-changing conditions.”\n\nFrom exploitation to empowerment: how researchers can protect Indigenous peoples’ rights to own and control their data\n\nAttempts to integrate this experiential and contextual local knowledge into scientific frameworks that prioritize stable truths can cause friction. For example, forestry companies have, with good intentions, attempted to work with the Sámi to map where reindeer graze and enable a productive dialogue between land users. But Roué says that the Sámi’s input has largely been ignored because the changeable concept of guohtun cannot be represented easily on maps. “That permanency doesn’t exist,” she says, “When you ask the Sámi, ‘What is the best place?’ or ‘When are you going to do the migration this year?’, they tend to tell you, ‘I don’t know, it depends,’ and Western people think the Sámi know nothing.”\n\nSuch thinking is, to some, infuriating. “I think that there’s an extraordinary arrogance that runs through many Euro-American knowledge systems,” says Luci Attala, a UK-based anthropologist and chair of the Tairona Heritage Trust, in Swansea, UK, which works to amplify the voices of the Indigenous Kogi people of northern Colombia. To her, researchers in the mainstream scientific establishment are culpable for the marginalization of Indigenous and local knowledge. “They’re part of the problem,” she says. “They’re part of the world that has spent years discounting other ways of being and assuming that their methodology is the one and only route to truth.”\n\nThe power of co-production\n\nTo tackle the issues that come with bridging distinct knowledge systems, Roué advocates scientists working with Indigenous and local groups to co-produce knowledge. For instance, the research of eco-anthropologist Samuel Roturier, who has worked with the Sámi for more than 15 years, shows how co-production can empower local communities and enrich conservation strategies.\n\nRoturier, who works at AgroParisTech (part of Paris-Saclay University), has researched ways to increase forest biodiversity and lichen availability, especially through artificial lichen dispersal. The Sámi have to ensure that there are diverse habitats for their reindeer, so that there are always areas where the animals can graze during fluctuations in the weather, which are becoming more volatile because of climate change. But Roturier explains that the biodiversity of the forest is steadily decreasing “because of commercial forestry and the introduction of modern forest-management practices”.\n\nControlled burning is commonly used to manage forests around the world, but is not widely used by Swedish forestry companies. Although there is no evidence to suggest that the Sámi have traditionally used the technique, the idea that fire can benefit biodiversity is conserved in the Indigenous language. “There is a Sámi word, roavve, that means ‘a forest that has burnt in the past’ but also ‘a forest that is rich in lichen’,” says Roturier.\n\nPharmacologist Damian Cohall researches medicinal plants.Credit: Brian Elcock\n\nLars Nutti, a Sámi reindeer herder from the Sirges community, recognized the significance of this linguistic artefact. “Roavve is a description of an old sparse forest with good grazing for reindeer,” he says, “but recreating such forests is largely impossible with today’s policies.” After an expanse of forest burnt down near where Nutti lives, he approached Roturier with the idea of running a research project to investigate whether dispersing lichen in this area would result in healthier pastures. “And the results actually showed that it worked very well, beyond our expectations,” says Roturier.\n\nNutti has since co-authored 2 papers, the latest reporting on 11 years of the project1, and the findings offer insights that can inform forest conservation strategies. Discussions with forestry companies about further projects are under way, but Nutti is sceptical as to whether they will result in tangible progress. “We will probably have to continue to wait for some breakthrough with the forest companies to make large-scale attempts to restore lichen,” he says.",

But a larger crisis for science still looms as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress continue to seek massive cuts to the federal budget for 2025 and beyond.\n\nTrump team orders huge government lay-offs: how science could fare\n\nIf federal spending follows current trends, the 15 March ‘continuing resolution’ agreement means that overall funding for research and development during the current fiscal year, which ends on 30 September, will probably ring in around US$193 billion — a relatively modest 3.5% cut compared with spending in the last fiscal year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC. Part of that cut is coming out of the budget for the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. The spending agreement calls for a 67% reduction in funding for the agency through the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes investments in the 2016 Cancer Moonshot programme and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative; total funding under the act will drop by $280 million, to $127 million.\n\nThe spending bill, drafted exclusively by Republicans in Congress, omits many of the usual line-item details directing agencies precisely where to put their money. This gives the Trump administration leeway to decide where the money goes — one of the reasons why many Democrats in Congress threatened to shut down the government, rather than vote for the bill. Late last week, however, a small group of Democratic senators, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, went against the rest of the party and advanced it to keep the government’s doors open.\n\nWhether the Trump administration will actually spend the money allocated in the continuing resolution remains to be seen. Over the two months since Trump took office, his team has ignored previous spending laws passed by Congress by freezing and terminating federal grants, including those from the NIH, that the administration does not support. The latest spending agreement is unlikely to change that dynamic, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “We are in a different era right now, where nothing is normal.”\n\nNothing normal\n\nPolicy specialists say that the Trump team might still try to slash this year’s budgets with a legislative package of ‘rescissions’ — which are implemented through a process separate from the appropriations one used to fund the government. This would be the easy — and legal — way for the White House to push through many funding cuts for this year, policy watchers say.\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts",

          "abstract": "As Earth warms, ice sheets will melt and sea levels will rise at rates projected to surpass those of the past several thousand years1. The last time the planet experienced such rapid sea-level rise was 11,700 to 8,200 years ago — during the early Holocene, the beginning of the current geological epoch — as the planet transitioned out of the last ice age. Detailed records from ancient periods such as the early Holocene are needed to constrain estimates of future sea-level rise2,3, but the records are sparse and uncertain. Writing in Nature, Hijma et al.4 address this knowledge gap by producing an early-Holocene sea-level record from the North Sea that has unprecedented temporal resolution. The findings provide fresh insight into how ice sheets melted and sea level rose during the final stages of deglaciation, bolstering understanding of how the Earth system responds to climate change and re-shapes the world.",

          "title": "Battery researchers strive for standardization",
          "authors": "Katharine Sanderson",
          "abstract": "Last year, 21 teams of battery researchers from around the world participated in a benchmarking test. They were each tasked with constructing a solid-state battery using their own equipment and commercially available materials while following a standardized set-up procedure. Despite using the same instructions, the performance of the batteries, and process used to build them, varied wildly across the laboratories.\n\nFans of a well-known TV baking show might recognize this scenario. Each week, Bake Off contestants are given the same ingredients, equipment and recipe and their creations are judged against one another. Even though the bakers follow the same basic procedure, the results are often very different because key steps are left out of the recipe, including mixing techniques, oven temperature and baking time.\n\nReproducing research is not much different. In the battery benchmarking test, teams were left to come up with their own techniques using their preferred equipment and components to create the electrochemical cells that power their batteries. The basic set-up required two electrodes to be separated by an electrolyte, which helps to move electrons from one electrode to the other to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. The most common configuration among the test groups involved placing a solid electrolyte between two active electrode materials, all pressed together by two metal stamps. The pressure inside the cell changed based on the equipment used. When the batteries’ performance was tested, there was a huge difference upon first discharge, ranging between 21 and 143 milliamp-hours per gram of battery material — enough power to run small LED light for a few minutes versus a wearable fitness tracker for day or so.\n\nNature Index 2025 Energy\n\nThe team behind the experiment, led by Nella Vargas-Barbosa, an electrochemist at the University of Bayreuth in Germany, says the results emphasize the need for more standardization in battery research. In a paper published by Nature Energy1, the team recommends that future solid-state battery research specifies the pressures that were used in construction to help others reproduce the work.\n\nThe benchmarking exercise follows a similar study, run as part of a UK-based project called Nextrode. Five British universities were asked to independently construct electrochemical cells using the exact same method as each other. Various measures were taken to ensure that the teams were following the same steps and not influencing each other in any way, says Denis Cumming, a battery researcher at the University of Sheffield, UK, who oversaw the experiment. “We had everyone all over the country do this at the same time on the same day in a week” to stop teams passing on tips and tricks, he says.\n\nThe results are yet to be published, but Cumming says that the failure rate among the 120 cells that were built was high: many short-circuited or failed to charge and discharge properly. “It’s very difficult to standardize these processes — extraordinarily difficult — because there are so many variables,” says Cumming.\n\nThe problem isn’t just that there are several components within a battery that might have been made slightly differently and with slightly different properties. It’s often very difficult to access enough raw material of the same quality, Cumming says. He adds that even commercial materials can vary from batch to batch, and most labs don’t have the tools to measure that variability. As it stands, there are no standard methods that everyone in battery development abides by. There is no standard data set to compare results against, no standard way to build components, and no standard formulation for the materials that go into a cell. To bring these kinds of standards into the field will require somebody to do, and pay for, the work.\n\nNo standard\n\nBattery research could learn from the field of bioinformatics, says Simon Clark, a sustainable energy researcher at Norwegian institute SINTEF in Trondheim. “When it comes to reproducibility, standardization and openness of data, bioinformatics was the field that adopted it very early on,” he says. In the 1970s, bioinformatics researchers increasingly made their databases open access and used standardized formats, says Clark, and by the 1990s, they’d started to have regular benchmarking sessions for work related to protein-structure mapping. So, when the team behind the AlphaFold artificial intelligence (AI) system, developed by Google DeepMind to predict protein structures, runs its program, “they don’t have to start from scratch”, says Clark.\n\nBattery data, by comparison, have not been collated rigorously over the past 50 years, because the field has been built on the efforts of individual labs, each developing their own interests in either materials, manufacturing or fundamental electrochemistry, he says.\n\nClark was part of the Battery Data Genome, an international collaborative project launched in 2022 to improve data collection, sharing and standardization in battery research through open-source tools and best practices. In a paper published in Joule2, which set out the principles of the project, the authors recognized that it would take time for the research community to accept their ideas, but argue that change is urgently needed if the clean-energy transition is going to happen. “The risk is not in moving forward, but in staying as we are now,” they write.\n\nSalt recovery pools at a lithium plant in Bolivia. Lithium is a significant resource in battery development.Credit: Gaston Brito Miserocchi/Getty\n\nOther battery researchers are feeling the pressure to make the field more robust. Europe’s Battery2030+ and the UK’s Faraday Battery Challenge, for example, which link up research institutions, industry and public funders to develop better batteries, emphasize the importance of common protocols and methodologies to ensure consistency, safety and efficiency across the battery industry.\n\nThis is also a key focus of Battery500, a consortium of 14 national laboratories and universities in the United States that aims to identify the most promising battery materials and accelerate their commercialization. As part of the project, researchers at the Pacific Northwestern National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, where Battery500 is headquartered, have developed standardized protocols to test each component of a battery during construction.\n\nThe consortium has also set parameters for the optimal amount of electrolyte; the optimal amount of active material, such as lithium, to be applied to the cathode; and the optimal thickness of the lithium foil3. Papers that report these parameters have been cited hundreds of times, suggesting that other researchers are following their lead and applying these protocols to their own systems.\n\nThe publishing world can also help to promote standardization. In early 2021, Joule introduced a battery checklist that researchers who want to publish battery performance results in the journal must complete. “When I was a graduate student working on lithium-ion batteries, I would often find myself deep in the supplemental information section of papers, searching for experimental details that would allow me to replicate an experiment,” Alexandra Stephan, then an editor at Joule, wrote in an editorial about the checklist4.\n\nStephan notes that key details such as electrode composition would sometimes be missing from a paper. “It was an incredibly frustrating experience,” she writes.",

His pledge to “drill, baby, drill” is set to upend markets that were on a firm path to renewables. Data from the International Energy Agency illustrate the clear direction of travel, with two-thirds of the world’s US$3-trillion investment in energy last year going on clean-energy technologies and infrastructure. At the same time, these data also point to a plateauing of fossil-fuel investment in the past few years, rather than a drop. The fear now will be that a shift in US policy will cause this to start going in an upwards direction.\n\nNature Index 2025 Energy\n\nThere is cause for hope. East Asian economies have already bet big on green technologies and the science underpinning them.

          "abstract": "The fridge-sized satellite Jinan-1, pictured before its launch in 2022. Credit: Y. Li et al./Nature\n\nResearchers have broken a distance record in quantum communication by sending a secret encryption key nearly 13,000 km from China to South Africa, using a cheap, lightweight ‘microsatellite’.\n\nThe satellite was able to send pulses of laser light, put into special quantum states, from a rooftop in Beijing to another at Stellenbosch University near Cape Town. The pulses formed a quantum key that was used to encrypt two images — one of China’s Great Wall and one showing part of Stellenbosch’s campus. The feat, a kind of encryption known as quantum key distribution (QKD), is a step towards being able to send ultra-secure messages between any two locations, however distant. It was described in Nature on 19 March1.\n\nQuantum network is step towards ultrasecure internet\n\nThe satellite, called Jinan-1, is ten times lighter, 45 times cheaper and much more efficient than its predecessor, Micius, which launched in 2016, says Jian-Wei Pan, a quantum physicist at the University of Science and Technology in Hefei, China, who led the work.\n\nPan’s team also shrank the ground-station receiver from 13,000 kg to a portable 100 kg . “We want to improve the technology from proof-of-principle to really practical and useful,” he says. Pan adds that his team is working with the Beijing-based telecommunications firm China Telecom to launch four more microsatellites for commercial applications in 2026.\n\n“This is another milestone in the development of a global QKD network,” says Alexander Ling, a quantum physicist at the National University of Singapore. The satellite is “a significant step forward” in deploying this kind of encryption in real time, adds Katanya Kuntz, a quantum physicist and co-founder of Qubo Consulting, a firm based in Calgary, Canada, that helps other companies to adopt quantum technologies.\n\nResearchers encrypted these two images using a quantum key, which they transmitted from China to South Africa.Credit: University of Science and Technology of China\nUncrackable codes\n\nPhysicists think that future quantum computers will be able to break many types of encryption, but techniques such as QKD provide “very strong assurance that a future quantum computer cannot read confidential communications”, says Ling.\n\nQKD is already used by banks and governments to transmit keys over fibre optics. But these cables absorb photons, limiting the distance over which the signal can travel. Because light is absorbed at a much lower rate when travelling through the air than in a fiber-optic cable, satellites could act as a relay to send secret keys between two locations almost anywhere on the planet.\n\nQuantum encryption rests on the idea that if two parties share a secret key, they can scramble a message so that only they can decode it.\n\nPan’s experiment involved sending pulses of laser light that are each in a ‘superposition’, where they exist at once in two quantum states, representing 1 or 0. By comparing the settings that the sender uses with those used by the receiver to measure the pulses, the two parties can work out a selection of measured 1s or 0s to use as a secure key. If an eavesdropper tries to intercept the message, this disturbs the quantum states and creates noise, revealing that the key has been compromised.",

          "abstract": "The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge has frozen hiring for non-faculty positions.Credit: Mel Musto/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nThe onslaught of US spending cuts is prompting drastic action by universities across the United States. Academic institutions are responding to the administration of US President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting campaign with hiring freezes, travel restrictions and moratoria on pay raises. At least one US university has shed staff, and other campuses are contemplating lay-offs and furloughs.\n\nThe number of schools and programmes known to have restricted graduate-student admissions continues to rise. The administration is threatening even more extensive cuts, leading some scholars to fear for the future of the US academic system, which relies on federal funding to finance everything from graduate students’ stipends to building maintenance and utility bills.\n\n“The academic model on which the universities relied to conduct their research, to fund their students, to fund postgraduate students — all this is in crisis, because a lot of it, in some way, was funded through federal grants,” says Aseem Prakash, a political scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a massive shock.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment before the time of publication.\n\nAbrupt change\n\nThe administration has choked off multiple revenue streams to universities. The US National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies have terminated research grants and halted review of new grant applications. Universities could also face steep cuts to federal income for indirect expenses — which is used to run research facilities — and hikes in taxes on endowments.\n\nDozens of campuses face even harsher restrictions. The US Department of Education has announced that 60 US institutions of higher education are under investigation for potentially antisemitic harassment and discrimination. The department cited demonstrations that began on many campuses after Israel invaded Gaza in 2023 in response to attacks by Hamas.\n\nProtests over Israel–Hamas war have torn US universities apart: what’s next?\n\nThe administration has already cancelled US$400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia University in New York City “due to the school’s continued inaction to protect Jewish students from discrimination”, according to an official statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, news outlets reported that the administration had put on hold $175 million in federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, over its support for transgender athletes. A spokesperson for the university said that its policies on student participation in athletic teams comply with those of national athletic bodies.\n\n“The speed and scope of the assault from the federal government is entirely novel,” says Daniel Greene, an information scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park.\n\nSour job market\n\nIn response to the funding cuts and worries about the future, hiring freezes for all staff and faculty have been announced at institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. The Artificial Intelligence Interdisciplinary Institute at Maryland was planning on hiring 40 faculty members in areas including chip engineering, neural networks, political science, history and health. “That will now be carved down to probably three of four” faculty members, says Greene.\n\nOther schools, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, and the University of Pennsylvania, have frozen hiring primarily for non-faculty positions.\n\nMoney-saving measures at universities include calling off pay raises and job promotions, and directives to avoid non-essential travel and training. Spending has been frozen on conferences, food and events — “the types of things to bring people together, which hurts morale even more in many ways”, says Jevin West, a computational scientist at the University of Washington. Universities are pausing spending on memberships, dues and subscriptions, and some are reviewing spending on new buildings and renovations.\n\nThe University of Washington is restricting researchers from spending grant funding until the money has been delivered. “That’s a big deal,” says West. “Having that eliminated really slows the research process.”\n\nChoking off the pipeline\n\nA substantial number of universities are limiting graduate-student admissions. Many departments at MIT have admitted fewer graduates this year. West Virginia University’s Health Sciences Office of Research and Graduate Education in Morgantown rescinded offers to students who had not yet returned acceptance letters. And a few dozen applicants to UMass Chan Medical School’s Morningside Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in Worcester, Massachusetts, were told in early March that their provisional offers of acceptance had been rescinded.",

          "abstract": "Health-care staff in Texas are racing to vaccinate infants against measles as an outbreak in the state spreads.Credit: Jan Sonnenmair/Getty\n\nA measles outbreak in the United States is growing, with no end in sight. As of 18 March, 279 cases had been reported in Texas, 38 in neighbouring New Mexico and as many as 4 in Oklahoma, which also borders Texas. Measles has killed an unvaccinated six-year-old child in Gaines County, Texas, the centre of the outbreak, and is the suspected cause of death of an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico.\n\n“We haven’t yet seen signs of the outbreak slowing down,” says William Moss, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nEven as health officials try to stop the outbreak, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has a long history of anti-vaccination activism, has offered only tepid support for the measles vaccine, a safe and potent way to prevent infection. Kennedy has also promoted treatments including cod liver oil, steroids and antibiotics, none of which is known to be effective against measles. (Kennedy has said that he does not oppose vaccination, but that it should be a “personal” choice.)\n\nNature asked specialists how bad things could get.\n\nHow big could the outbreak become?\n\nThat’s hard to predict. A measles outbreak is like a forest fire throwing out sparks, Moss says. If a spark lands in a state such as Maryland, which has a 97% measles vaccination rate, it will just fizzle out. But “if the sparks from this initial fire land in communities where vaccination rates are low, then we’re going to have multiple large outbreaks”, Moss says.\n\n“I think it could get to thousands and thousands of cases,” says virologist Paul Offit at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhy is measles so incredibly infectious?\n\nMeasles is the most contagious disease that is transmitted directly between people. Epidemiologists use a metric called R0 to indicate how many people, on average, one person with a given illness is expected to infect. The R0 for measles is a whopping 12–18. By comparison, the R0 for COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic was estimated to be about 1.4–2.5, and the R0 for influenza is about 1–2.\n\nMeasles is so contagious that in 1991, a single athlete with measles in a sports stadium infected 16 other people, including 2 sitting at least 30 metres away (about the length of a gymnasium).\n\nParticles of measles virus (artificially coloured), one of the most infectious pathogens known.Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/SPL\n\nMeasles is virulently contagious partly because the dose needed to infect someone is very small. Moreover, the measles virus spreads through airborne droplets when an infected person so much as breathes. If someone with measles passes through a room, infectious droplets can hang in the air or rest invisibly on surfaces for two hours afterwards.\n\nWhat’s more, in the first 2–4 days, the illness often features symptoms — such as a fever, cough and runny nose — that can fool people into thinking they have a cold. As a result, people with measles might not isolate when they are highly contagious. The disease’s telltale red spots don’t usually appear until several days into the illness.\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of measles?\n\nMeasles can kill: between about one and three cases in every 1,000 unvaccinated children is fatal. Roughly 5–6% of infected people develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death in young children with measles. Measles can also cause blindness or hearing loss.\n\nOne of the most eerie long-term effects is a rare, almost always fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It develops years after a measles infection and is characterized by cognitive decline, personality changes and dementia.\n\nAnother long-term effect is ‘immune amnesia’. Measles can wipe out large numbers of antibodies that store the body’s memory of how to fight other diseases. There’s evidence that measles could leave the immune system more susceptible to other diseases for some 2–3 years after infection1.\n\nEven acute symptoms of measles can be very unpleasant. They include mouth ulcers, ear infections, croup, laryngitis and diarrhoea.\n\n“The way we stop this is to vaccinate,” Moss says.",

We find that white matter connections are organized by cytoarchitecture, eccentricity and category from birth. Connectivity profiles of functional regions in the same cytoarchitectonic area are similar from birth and develop in parallel, with decreases in endpoint connectivity to lateral occipital, parietal and somatosensory cortex, and increases in connectivity to lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, connections between VTC and early visual cortex are organized topographically by eccentricity bands and predict eccentricity biases in VTC.

We test whether explicitly expressing trust in players’ capability to maintain cooperation after the removal of sanctions, i.e., vertical communication of trust, has the potential to alleviate this drop in compliance. Four incentivized public-goods experiments ( N = 2,823) find that the vertical communication of trust maintains cooperation upon the removal of centralized (Study 1), third-party (Study 2a, 2b), and peer punishment (Study 3), and this effect extends beyond single interactions (Study 4). In all studies, vertical trust communication increases mutual trust among players, providing support to the idea that vertically communicating trust can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Extrapolating our findings to natural environments, they suggest that authorities should carefully consider how they communicate the lifting of rules and sanctions.",

Here, we examined how naturalistic ups and downs in state motivation influence the subjective value of reward and effort. In a microlongitudinal design (N = 155, state timepoints = 3,344, decision-making tasks = 845), we captured fluctuations in state and effort-based decision-making using smartphone-based momentary assessments as people went about their daily lives. We found that both state and trait have independent and multiplicative effects on decision-making. State–behavior coupling was particularly pronounced in individuals with higher trait apathy, meaning that their choices were even more state dependent. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that state motivation prospectively boosted reward sensitivity, making people more willing to exert effort in future. Our results show that day-to-day fluctuations in state and cognition are tightly linked and critical for understanding fundamental human behaviors and mental ill-health.",

Voltage spikes measured on these electrodes display depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization phases with amplitudes similar to the action potentials of neurons but with the markedly slower duration of 1 to 2 s. Some propagate distances up to hundreds of μm from the wound with a mean speed of around 10 mm s −1 . Generation and transmission of bioelectric signals are significantly influenced by the perturbation of mechanosensitive cationic ion channels. These direct measurements confirm bioelectric signaling that previous work has hypothesized to regulate epithelial cell development and may have relevance to the frequency parameter selection of bioelectric devices.",

          "abstract": "The origin of birds represents a pivotal transition in vertebrate evolution, marked by significant changes in both brain size and feeding biomechanics. The evolution of the avian skull involved dramatic modifications, such as a segmented palate and the development of powered cranial kinesis in neognath birds. Powered kinesis, the ability to move parts of the skull independently, is considered a key innovation behind the dietary diversity and evolutionary success of birds. However, the processes driving the emergence of avian kinesis have remained unclear until recently. By analyzing data from Mesozoic birds, including reinterpretations of palate homology, 3D jaw muscle biomechanics, and linkage analysis, researchers have quantified changes in muscle forces and their effects on palate mechanics during the transition from theropods to birds. As the neurocranium expanded in non-avian theropods, temporal muscles shifted to more rostrocaudal positions in birds, aiding in the segmentation of the pterygoid. This musculoskeletal transformation increased fore-aft muscle force in neognaths, enabling powered cranial kinesis. A critical change was the separation of the epipterygoid ossification from the braincase, leading to the breakdown of primitive kinematic linkages and the development of a new basicranial joint, which allowed for greater cranial flexibility. These findings shed light on how the neurosensory and feeding systems coevolved during bird origins and offer new methods for identifying cranial kinesis in extinct vertebrates.",

Our structural predictions suggest dimerization of LRR proteins and support their interactions with conserved β-sheet-rich domains of high-molecular-weight proteins, the primary building blocks of velvet worm slime fibers. This suggests that LRR proteins might be involved in reversible, receptor-based supramolecular interactions in these biofibers, providing potential avenues for fabricating fully recyclable (bio)polymeric materials.",

Here, we show that static mechanical stretch of cells in 3D tissues can either increase or decrease fibroblast activation depending upon recursive cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) feedback and demonstrate control of this activation through integrated in vitro and mathematical models. ECM viscoelasticity, signaling dynamics, and cell mechanics combine to yield a predictable, but nonmonotonic, relationship between mechanical stretch and long-term cell activation.

Here, we investigate the potential of reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning technique that efficaciously acquires knowledge from the environment and systematically optimizes dynamic decisions, in modeling and informing adaptive climate decision-making. We consider coastal flood risk mitigations for Manhattan, New York City, USA (NYC), illustrating the benefit of continuously incorporating observations of sea-level rise into systematic designs of adaptive strategies. We find that when designing adaptive seawalls to protect NYC, the RL-derived strategy significantly reduces the expected net cost by 6 to 36% under the moderate emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 (9 to 77% under the high emissions scenario SSP5-8.5), compared to conventional methods. When considering multiple adaptive policies, including accomodation and retreat as well as protection, the RL approach leads to a further 5% (15%) cost reduction, showing RL’s flexibility in coordinatively addressing complex policy design problems. RL also outperforms conventional methods in controlling tail risk (i.e., low probability, high impact outcomes) and in avoiding losses induced by misinformation about the climate state (e.g., deep uncertainty), demonstrating the importance of systematic learning and updating in addressing extremes and uncertainties related to climate adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1), a pore-forming component of the mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel in cochlear outer hair cells, is subject to numerous mutations causing deafness and hair cell death. We studied mice harboring semidominant mutations Tmc1 p.T416K, p.M412K, and p.D569N, which all display functional MET channels at postnatal day (P)6 but become deaf by P21. Early signs of concomitant hair cell apoptosis were assayed in neonatal Tmc1 mutants by labeling with Calcein-acetomethyl ester (AM), MitoTracker, and Annexin V, the latter labeling scramblase externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Reduced labeling with Calcein-AM was correlated with reduced MitoTracker, the targeting of mitochondria being confirmed with the uncoupling agent carbonylcyanide p -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and use of MitoLight to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential. These markers demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in Tmc1 mutants, even at P6 when MET currents were still present. Acoustic brainstem responses established that Tmc1 p.D569N and Tmc1 p.M412K mice were deaf by P15 and Tmc1 p.T416K by P21. Two methods of blocking the stereociliary PMCA2 Ca 2+ pump both elicited scramblase activity, suggesting that apoptosis is promoted by elevation of hair bundle [Ca 2+ ]. Reduced PMCA2 density was found in the stereocilia of Tmc1 mutants and was correlated with a decrease in MET channel Ca 2+ permeability. Cre-Lox excision of the mutant M412K exon at P1 fully preserved hearing across all frequencies by P19 and promoted recovery to wild type of PMCA2 density. These results demonstrate that hair cells in Tmc1 mutants have embarked on apoptosis at P6 and argue for connections between stereociliary PMCA2 density, hair cell apoptosis, and deafness.",

However, the spatial organization of functional connectivity (FC) variability across the human connectome edges and its significance in cognitive development remain unclear. Here, we identified a connectional axis in the edge-level FC variability. The variability declined continuously along this axis from within-network to between-network connections and from the edges linking association networks to those linking the sensorimotor and association networks. This connectional axis of functional variability is associated with spatial pattern of structural connectivity variability. Moreover, the connectional variability axis evolves in youth with an flatter axis slope. We also observed that the slope of the connectional variability axis was positively related to the performance in the higher-order cognition. Together, our results reveal a connectional axis in functional variability that is linked with structural connectome variability, refines during development, and is relevant to cognition.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a prominent force shaping genome evolution, and understanding why recombination rates vary within and between species has remained a central, though challenging, question. Variation in recombination is widely thought to influence the efficacy of selection in purging transposable elements (TEs), prevalent selfish genetic elements, leading to widely observed negative correlations between TE abundance and recombination rates across taxa. However, accumulating evidence suggests that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence of this relationship. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked an approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches–analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing TE landscape can actively modify recombination, shaping genome evolution within and between species.",

Embolism reversal, or “refilling,” is a hypothesized adaptive process in which xylem functionality is rapidly and sustainably restored. This study investigated xylem embolism refilling during recovery from severe drought stress using entirely noninvasive measurements of the same plants. These results were considered in relation to functional traits to address long-standing gaps in understanding the consequences of severe drought stress. Leaf and stem xylem embolism as well as transpiration, photosynthesis, and stem water potential were characterized nondestructively on intact barnyard grass plants during an acute drought event. Plants were rewatered and returned to growth conditions for 10 d, during which time recovery of stem xylem embolism and transpiration were monitored. Leaf xylem embolism and declines in leaf gas exchange occurred mostly between −1.0 MPa and −2.0 MPa, whereas stem xylem embolism occurred mostly between −3.0 MPa and −4.0 MPa. In all measured plants, which included embolism levels up to 88%, stem xylem embolism reversed completely within 24 h after rewatering, and this refilling supported recovery of transpiration and growth after plants were returned to growth conditions. This study provides direct evidence of complete and functional stem xylem refilling. These results present a clear need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and the adaptive significance of this phenomenon as well as its prevalence in nature.",

          "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) carries out the lipolytic processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) along the luminal surface of capillaries. LPL activity is regulated by the angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL3, ANGPTL4, ANGPTL8), which control the delivery of TRL-derived lipid nutrients to tissues in a temporal and spatial fashion. This regulation of LPL mediates the partitioning of lipid delivery to adipose tissue and striated muscle according to nutritional status. A complex between ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 (ANGPTL3/8) inhibits LPL activity in oxidative tissues, but its mode of action has remained unknown. Here, we used biophysical techniques to define how ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 interact with LPL and how they drive LPL inactivation. We demonstrate, by mass photometry, that ANGPTL3/8 is a heterotrimer with a 2:1 ANGPTL3:ANGPTL8 stoichiometry and that ANGPTL3 is a homotrimer. Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) studies revealed that ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 use the proximal portion of their N-terminal α-helices to interact with sequences surrounding the catalytic pocket in LPL. That binding event triggers unfolding of LPL’s α/β -hydrolase domain and irreversible loss of LPL catalytic activity. The binding of LPL to its endothelial transporter protein (GPIHBP1) or to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans protects LPL from unfolding and inactivation, particularly against the unfolding triggered by ANGPTL3. Pulse-labeling HDX-MS studies revealed that ANGPTL3/8 and ANGPTL3 catalyze LPL unfolding in an ATP-independent fashion, which categorizes these LPL inhibitors as atypical unfoldases. The catalytic nature of LPL unfolding by ANGPTL3/8 explains why low plasma concentrations of ANGPTL3/8 are effective in inhibiting a molar excess of LPL in capillaries.",

Despite decades of theoretical studies on the mechanics of suspended thermalized sheets, controversy still exists over the impact of these ripples, with conflicting predictions about whether elasticity is scale-dependent or scale-independent. Experimental progress has been hindered so far by the inability to have a platform capable of fully isolating and characterizing the effects of ripples. This knowledge gap limits the fundamental understanding of thin materials and their practical applications. Here, we show that thermal-like static ripples shape thin films into a class of metamaterials with scale-dependent, customizable elasticity. Utilizing a scalable semiconductor manufacturing process, we engineered nanometer-thick films with precisely controlled frozen random ripples, resembling snapshots of thermally fluctuating membranes. Resonant frequency measurements of rippled cantilevers reveal that random ripples effectively renormalize and enhance the average bending rigidity and sample-to-sample variations in a scale-dependent manner, consistent with recent theoretical estimations. The predictive power of the theoretical model, combined with the scalability of the fabrication process, was further exploited to create kirigami architectures with tailored bending rigidity and mechanical metamaterials with delayed buckling instability.",

Pulsatile laminar shear stress (PS), representing atheroprotective flow, maintains the anti-inflammation and homeostatic phenotype of ECs, but the comprehensive mechanism underlying the PS-repression of inflammatory genes remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated the role of chromatin organization in mediating the effects of PS on inflammatory gene expression in ECs. We demonstrated that PS induced the expression of histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 to promote heterochromatin formation via H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) enrichment, a hallmark gene repression mechanism. SUV39H1 interacts with lamin-associated proteins and facilitates the perinuclear localization of the H3K9me3-enrichment. Silencing the lamin-associated protein emerin (EMD) not only led to the reductions of cytoskeletal F-actin formation and perinuclear H3K9me3 enrichment; but also the impairment of PS-induced SUV39H1 expression, H3K9me3 enrichment at E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 loci to revert their PS-repressed expression. Hence, EMD acts as a hub to transmit mechanical cues from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus and recruits SUV39H1, which regulate nuclear organization, chromatin state, and gene expression. These results accentuate the critical role of nuclear architecture in mechanotransduction and EC responses to mechanical stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria are able to survive frequent cycles of hydration and dehydration, which are closely linked to diurnal light oscillations. Previous studies have shown that light serves as a crucial anticipatory cue, activating desert cyanobacteria to prepare for desiccation. However, the mechanisms underlying their light-coupled desiccation tolerance remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that red-light-induced photosynthetic genes are positively regulated by a LuxR family transcription factor NfSrr1. We further identified the cyanobacteriochrome NfPixJ as interacting with NfSrr1 and functioning as a red light sensor. Phenotypic analysis revealed that the red-light signaling module NfPixJ-NfSrr1 plays a key role in preparing cyanobacteria for desiccation tolerance. This module also regulates the synthesis of protective compatible solutes, suggesting that red light functions as a global regulatory signal for the broader stress response. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the presence of this red-light signaling pathway, mediated by NfPixJ-NfSrr1 module, correlates with the ability of cyanobacteria to thrive in water-deficit habitats. Overall, our findings uncover a red-light signaling pathway that enhances desiccation tolerance as desert cyanobacteria encounter red light at dawn, before water limitation. These results provide insights into the mechanisms behind light-induced anticipatory stress tolerance in photosynthetic organisms.",

          "abstract": "α-hydroxy acids (αHAs), simple and prebiotically plausible organic monomers, were likely present in various environments on and off Earth and could have played a role in directing the emergence of the first homochiral living systems. Some αHAs, which could have been of varying chirality, can undergo dehydration polymerization into polyesters, which could assemble into membraneless microdroplets upon rehydration; understanding these processes is critical for unraveling how simple prebiotic molecules transitioned into more complex systems capable of supporting selective chemical reactions, a key step toward the origin of life. Here, we focused on tartaric acid (TA), a prebiotically relevant αHA with multiple chiral forms, to probe plausible mechanisms by which primitive αHA and polyester-based systems could have participated in selective homochiral polymer synthesis. Enantiopure solutions of d -TA or l -TA polymerize efficiently via dehydration, while racemic dl -TA polymerization is inhibited due to stereochemical incompatibility. We found that Ca 2+ ions influence this process in two significant ways: 1) regulating TA monomer availability through selective crystallization, removing equal amounts of both enantiomers in racemic proportion and thereby enriching the enantiomeric excess of the remaining nonracemic TA solution; and 2) modulating polymerization by suppressing enantiopure TA polymerization while enabling dl -TA polymerization. These findings suggest that the differential availability of simple inorganic ions, such as Ca 2+ , could have indirectly mediated the selection of simple organic chiral monomers and the emergence of homochirality in primitive protocell-forming polymers, offering a pathway from nonliving to living matter in early Earth environments.",

In this study, we investigated two KS domains in a eukaryotic microalgal DHA synthase, KS A and KS B , which show low similarities to those of prokaryotic marine enzymes, together with almost all the acyl-ACP intermediates. C6-, C12-, and C18-ACPs were exclusively accepted by KS A while KS B utilized C-8. C14- and C20-ACPs. In contrast, both KS A and KS B showed activities against C2-, C4-, and C10-ACPs.

Here, we compile a unique dataset on the largest incident wave heights (0.39 to 1.44 m) ever recorded in forested wetlands, including our own measurements and literature data. Our analysis reveals that forested wetlands can significantly attenuate storm waves (35% over 3 wavelengths) except in rare near-submerged cases. Notably, 19 of the 20 existing formulations for vegetation drag coefficient, a key parameter for wave attenuation modeling, are inapplicable in storm conditions. Hence, we introduce an new approach to reliably predict wave attenuation during storms, without the need for drag coefficient determination nor modeling expertise.

          "abstract": "Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food production, accounting for a substantial portion of water withdrawals worldwide. As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for water in agriculture, leading to alterations in regional water–energy balances. We present an approach to identify the influence of agriculture on the water–energy balance using empirical data. We explore the departure from the Budyko curve for catchments with agricultural expansion and their associations with changes in the water–energy balance using a causal discovery algorithm. Analyzing data from 1,342 catchments across three Köppen-Geiger climate classes—temperate, snowy, and others—from 1980 to 2014, we show that temperate and snowy catchments, which account for over 90% of stations, exhibit distinct patterns. Cropland percentage (CL%) emerges as the dominant factor, explaining 47 and 37% of the variance in deviations from the Budyko curve in temperate and snowy catchments, respectively. In temperate catchments, CL% shows a strong negative correlation with precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) causal strength (Spearman ρ = − 0.75 ), suggesting that cropland exacerbates precipitation-driven deviations. A moderate negative correlation with aridity-streamflow (AR-Q) causal strength ( ρ = − 0.42 ) indicates additional influences of cropland through aridity-driven interactions. In snowy catchments, CL% is similarly influential, with a positive correlation with P-Q causal strength ( ρ = 0.51 ). However, the negative correlation with AR-Q causal strength ( ρ = − 0.45 ) underscores the role of aridity as a secondary driver. While vegetation and precipitation seasonality also contribute to the deviations, their impacts are comparatively lower. These findings underscore the need for inclusion of agricultural activities in changing water–energy balance to secure future water supplies.",

Developing these nano–bio hybrid systems necessitates a deep understanding of charge-transfer dynamics at the nano–bio interface. Photoexcited carrier transfer from QDs to microbes is driven by complex interactions, with emerging insights into the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The heterogeneities of both microbes and QD ensembles pose significant challenges in mechanistic understanding, which is critical for designing advanced nano–bio hybrids. We used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to analyze charge transfer between a CdSe QD film and Shewanella oneidensis microbes. We correlated the spatiotemporal fluorescence data with an analytical model. Our analysis revealed two distinct distributions of QD de-excitation pathways. The characteristics of these distributions: 1) a faster transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 1 = 1.5   10 9   s - 1 ), with a lower acceptor number ( N ¯ a 1 = 0.03 ) and 2) a slower transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 2 = 4.1   10 8   s - 1 ) with a higher acceptor number ( N ¯ a 2 = 0.18 ). We assign these distributions to the indirect and direct electron transfer mechanisms, respectively.

Here, we apply an underused multivariate statistical method to uncover four heterogenous life-history trajectories in wild female bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ). Remarkably, these trajectories had remained unobserved in the population despite nearly five decades of monitoring. Our results indicate substantial among-trajectory heterogeneity in growth, senescence, life history trade-offs, fitness, and contributions to population growth. Some trajectories suggest the presence of life history trade-offs while others include silver spoon effects, leading to heterogenous life-history outputs. Then, we show that mother identity and year of birth are relatively good predictors of heterogeneity, indicating that individual trajectories could be largely set during early life. Critically, our results demonstrate that heterogeneity in life-history trajectories can be inconspicuous, yet substantial and structured across multiple traits within a population. Uncovering and understanding this heterogeneity in other wild populations will be key to advancing our knowledge of ecoevolutionary processes across populations and species.",

Genetic accommodation is an evolutionary process by which natural selection acts on novel phenotypes generated through repeated encounters with extreme environments. In this study, polyphenic and monophenic strains of the black mutant tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta , were evolved via genetic accommodation of heat stress-induced phenotypes, and the molecular differences between the two strains were explored. Transcriptomic analyses showed that epigenetic and hormonal differences underlie the differences between the two strains and their distinct responses to temperature. DNA methylation had diverged between the two strains potentially mediating genetic assimilation. Juvenile hormone (JH) signaling in the polyphenic strain was temperature sensitive, whereas in the monophenic strain, JH signaling remained low at all temperatures. Although 20-hydroxyecdysone titers were elevated under heat shock conditions in both strains, the strains did not differ in the titers. Tyrosine hydroxylase was also found to differ between the two strains at different temperatures, and its expression could be modulated by topical application of a JH analog. Finally, heat shock of unselected black mutants demonstrated that the expression of the JH-response gene, Krüppel-homolog 1 ( Kr-h1 ), increased within the first 30 min of heat shock, suggesting that JH levels respond readily to thermal stress. Our study highlights the critical role that hormones and epigenetics play during genetic accommodation and potentially in the evolution of populations in the face of climate change.",

          "abstract": "The global sulfur cycle plays a critical role in the redox evolution of Earth’s surface and upper mantle, yet the distribution and origin of sulfur in the mantle remains largely unconstrained. El Hierro is a volcanic island in the Canary archipelago that is fed by sulfur-rich magmas. To constrain the origin of sulfur in these melts, we combine in situ sulfur isotope analyses with regression modeling. We calculate that undegassed El Hierro melts have δ 34 S values of 0 ± 2‰. The average δ 34 S of undegassed El Hierro melts is 0.3‰ to 1‰ higher than magmas erupting at mid-ocean ridges. Mass balance calculations reveal that El Hierro’s mantle source contains 310 ± 120 μg/g sulfur and that on average 60% of sulfur in the source is of recycled origin. This recycled material should contain &gt;1,800 μg/g sulfur to satisfy isotopic constraints on its mass fraction in the mantle source. The sulfur and oxygen isotopic signature in serpentinites and sediments deviate significantly from the upper mantle, making them unsuitable candidates for the recycled material. An oxidized partial melt of recycled oceanic crust that retained one third of its sulfur budget after subduction zone processing can explain excess sulfur in the Canary Island mantle. Recycled oceanic crust is expected to contain sulfur as sulfide, which is not capable of oxidizing the mantle. The presence of ferric iron in the recycled component is necessary to produce metasomatic melts that are oxidizing enough to carry sufficient sulfur into the mantle source of ocean island basalts.",

Various motor proteins with different properties are essential for spindle self-organization. The minimal set of components required to organize dynamic microtubules into a bipolar network remains however unknown. Here, we use computer simulations to explore whether two types of microtubule-crosslinking motors with opposite directionality can organize dynamic microtubules into bipolar spindles in three-dimensional space around a local microtubule nucleation source. We find that two motors are indeed sufficient, provided their properties resemble the main human spindle motors kinesin-5 and dynein, revealing the core mechanism of spindle self-organization. It is based on the synergistic interplay of a slow plus-directed symmetric motor and a fast minus-directed asymmetric motor. A hypothetical symmetric minus-directed motor can also support spindle formation together with kinesin-5, but only in a limited and unphysiological parameter range. In agreement with its accessory role in human cells, a minus motor with human kinesin-14 properties does not assemble stable bipolar spindles together with kinesin-5. These results reveal fundamental principles for the self-organization of dynamic bipolar microtubule architectures and highlight how distinct molecular designs of mitotic motors are optimized for their task.",

          "abstract": "During fetal stage, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo rapid proliferation with a tight control of genomic stability. Although histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation has been reported to stabilize the genome in proliferating cells, its specific role in HSPC development remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) repeat protein 5 (Wdr5)-mediated H3K4 methylation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability of proliferating HSPCs in zebrafish embryos. Loss of wdr5 led to a severe reduction of HSPC pool in the caudal hematopoietic tissue, accompanied with attenuated H3K4 methylation level and evident p53 -dependent apoptosis in the HSPCs. Mechanistically, Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation maintains genomic stability by inhibiting the formation of abnormal R-loops in the HSPCs, whereas accumulation of R-loops exacerbates DNA damage. Moreover, the absence of H3K4 trimethylation leads to an inactivated DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is deleterious to DNA damage repair and genomic stability. Subsequently, we found that DDR-associated genes, mutL homolog 1 and breast and ovarian cancer interacting helicase 1 , are important to ensure HSPC survival, likely by stabilizing their genome. In summary, these findings reveal that Wdr5-mediated H3K4 methylation is essential for HSPC development through tight control of R-loop accumulation and DDR-associated program to ensure genomic stability and survival of proliferating HSPCs.",

          "abstract": "Introducing the concept of topology into material science has sparked a revolution from classic electronic and optoelectronic devices to topological quantum devices. The latter has potential for transferring energy and information with unprecedented efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a topological diode effect on the surface of a three-dimensional material, SmB 6 , a candidate topological Kondo insulator. The diode effect is evidenced by pronounced rectification and photogalvanic effects under electromagnetic modulation and radiation at radio frequency. Our experimental results and modeling suggest that these prominent effects are intimately tied to the spatially inhomogeneous formation of topological surface states (TSS) at the intermediate temperature. This work provides a manner of breaking the mirror symmetry (in addition to the inversion symmetry), resulting in the formation of pn -junctions between puddles of metallic TSS. This effect paves the way for efficient current rectifiers or energy-harvesting devices working down to radio frequency range at low temperature, which could be extended to high temperatures using other topological insulators with large bulk gap.",

          "abstract": "Diatoms, a highly successful group of photosynthetic algae, contribute to a quarter of global primary production. Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe—a specialized slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behavior and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.",

By enhancing techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies [R.

The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise S M ω , T reveals intense spin fluctuations with S M ω , T ∝ ω - α ( T ) and 0.84 &lt; α T &lt; 1.04 . Both the variance σ M 2 T and the correlation function C M t , T of this spin noise undergo crossovers at a temperature T ∗ ≈ 450   mK . While predictions for quantum spin liquids are inconsistent with this phenomenology, those from Monte–Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional (2D) SSL state in Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 yield overall quantitative correspondence with the measured frequency and temperature dependences of S M ω , T ,   C M t , T , and σ M 2 T , thus indicating that Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 is an SSL.",

On large 8-leg cylinders, we demonstrate that the pure t-J model with only nearest-neighbor hoppings and superexchange interactions, for a wide range of doping ( δ = 0.1 to 0.2 ), hosts robust d-wave superconductivity possibly coexisting with weak unidirectional pair density wave. Furthermore, a small next nearest neighbor hopping t 2 suppresses pair and charge density waves, resulting in a uniform d-wave SC phase in both electron- and hole-doped cuprate model systems. Our work validates the t-J model as a proper minimum model for the emergence of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.",

The proof of this fact combines ideas from dynamical systems, which appear naturally because these isolated states have strongly chaotic dynamics, with techniques from spectral geometry and contact topology, which can be effectively used to analyze the steady Euler equations on carefully chosen Riemannian manifolds. Interestingly, much of this strategy carries over to the Euler equations in Euclidean space, leading to the weaker result that there exist analytic steady solutions on T 3 such that the only analytic steady Euler flows in a C 1 -neighborhood must belong to a certain linear space of dimension six. For comparison, note that in any C k -neighborhood of a shear flow, there are infinitely many linearly independent analytic shears.",

          "abstract": "Seed size is one of the important yield traits, and size control is also a fundamental developmental question. The knowledge about the genetic and molecular mechanisms that govern seed size is crucial for improving crop yield. Here, we report that the Mediator subunit OsMED23 associates with the histone demethylase OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A to control grain size and weight in rice. Loss of function of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 causes narrow and light grains, while overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 results in large and heavy grains. OsMED23 physically interacts with OsJMJ703 and the transcription factor OsWOX3A. OsMED23, OsJMJ703, and OsWOX3A associate with the common promoter regions of two key grain size genes GW2 and OsLAC and repress their transcription by influencing H3K4me3 levels. Field trials demonstrate that overexpression of OsMED23 or OsJMJ703 can significantly increase grain yield. Therefore, our findings identify a mechanism by which the transcriptional repressor complex OsJMJ703-OsMED23-OsWOX3A determines grain size and weight by regulating gene expression and influencing H3K4me3 levels in rice, suggesting that this pathway has a great potential for improving grain yield in key crops.",

          "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are closely related mosquito-borne neurotropic flaviviruses that share common transmission cycle and can infect humans. However, while human infections by WNV are widespread, infections by USUV are comparatively less frequent, less severe, and currently limited to Africa and Europe. To identify human host factors that contribute to the pathogenic signatures of these two flaviviruses, we carried out an arrayed expression screen of over 1,300 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs known to target flaviviruses, including IFI6, SHFL, and RTP4 were among the strongest hits. Interestingly, we also found MITD1, an ISG with no previously reported antiviral activity, among the strongest hits. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of MITD1 was not limited to USUV and WNV, since it also inhibited Zika and dengue virus replication. We found MITD1 to interfere with viral RNA replication by sequestering specific endosomal sorting complexes required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) proteins involved in the formation of viral replication factories. MITD1 expression was not increased by type I interferon (IFN-I) in most human cells and mouse tissues that we examined, although WNV and USUV replication was strongly inhibited by IFN-I. Strikingly, MITD1 was induced in the brain of USUV-infected mice and importantly, in human monocyte-derived microglia. Using human microglial-like cells, we confirmed that MITD1 is an essential mediator of the anti-flavivirus activity of IFN-I in these cells. We conclude that MITD1 plays a key role in the cellular defenses against neurotropic flaviviruses.",

          "abstract": "Simultaneous profiling of multiple molecules trafficking at a single organelle and the surrounding cytosol within a living cell is crucial for elucidating their functions, necessitating advanced techniques that provide high spatial–temporal resolution and molecule specificity. In this study, we present an electrochemical nanodevice based on a θ-nanopipette designed to coanalyze calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a single mitochondrion and its surrounding cytosol, thereby enhancing our understanding of their trafficking within the signaling pathways of cellular autophagy. Two independent nanosensors integrated within the channels of the θ-nanopipette spatially isolate a single target mitochondrion from the cytosol and simultaneously measure the release of Ca 2+ and ROS with high spatial–temporal resolution. Dynamic tracking reveals the direct trafficking of lysosomal Ca 2+ to the mitochondrion rather than to the cytosol, which triggers ROS-induced ROS release within the mitochondria. Furthermore, highly temporal and concurrent observations revealed a second burst of Ca 2+ in both the mitochondrion and the cytosol, which is not consistent with the change in ROS. These dynamic data elucidate the potential role of a beneficial feedback loop between the Ca 2+ signaling pathway and the subsequent generation of mitochondrial ROS in ML-SA-induced autophagy. More importantly, this innovative platform facilitates detailed profiling of the molecular interactions between trafficking molecules within the mitochondria and the adjacent cytosolic environment, which is hardly realized using the current superresolution optical microscopy.",

In particular, SWCNT fluorescence quenching induced by biopolymer dispersants facilitates flexible design of molecular nanosensors, yet challenges remain in analyte selectivity and lack of rational design strategies. A sought-after alternative to haphazard molecular modulation of SWCNT-based fluorescence is to couple the movement of a quencher to the SWCNT surface, enabling fluorescence energy transfer to modulate molecular recognition with high selectivity. This study presents the rational design of SWCNT-based nanosensors with fluorescence energy transfer, leveraging the unique properties of methylene blue (MB) proximity–mediated fluorescence quenching. MB-SWCNT-based nanosensors exhibit 1- stability in redox environments and 2- analyte-specific displacement-driven fluorescence modulation. By designing hybridization-induced displacement of MB-conjugated ssDNA from the SWCNT surface, we calculate that SWCNT fluorescence modulation can occur within a 6.8 nm fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance from the SWCNT surface and develop a robust and versatile platform to synthesize oligonucleotide nanosensors with tunable Δ F / F 0 of up to 150%. Building upon this strategy, we developed four distinct nanosensors capable of selectively detecting tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) viral RNA fragments, which successfully differentiated TMV-infected plants from mock controls. Finally, we demonstrate the potential expansion of our design to target a wider scope of biomolecules using the biotin-avidin system as a model. Taken together, our study presents a generalizable platform that enables rational engineering of SWCNT NIR fluorescence intensity through MB distance-dependent fluorescence energy transfer, overcoming the intrinsic selectivity challenges of current SWCNT nanosensors.",

          "abstract": "Motile cilia are organelles found on many eukaryotic cells that play critical roles in development and fertility. Human CFAP298 has been implicated in the transport/assembly of ciliary dyneins, and defects in this protein cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, neither the exact function nor the structure of CFAP298 have been elucidated. Here, we took advantage of Chlamydomonas , a ciliated alga, to study the structure and function of FBB18, an ortholog of CFAP298. Multiple ciliary dyneins were greatly reduced in cilia of Chlamydomonas fbb18 mutants. In addition, we found that both the stability of ciliary dynein heavy chains (HCs) and the association between HCs and intermediate/light chains (IC/LCs) are greatly reduced in fbb18 cytoplasm, strongly suggesting that FBB18 functions in the cytoplasmic assembly (the so-called “preassembly”) of dynein complexes from HC/IC/LCs. Furthermore, X-ray crystallography revealed that FBB18 forms a bilobed structure with globular domains at both ends of the molecule, connected by an α-helical bundle. Unexpectedly, one globular domain shows high similarity to ubiquitin, a small protein critical for the modification of a variety of protein complexes, and this ubiquitin-like domain is indispensable for the molecular function of FBB18. Our results demonstrate that FBB18, a specialized member of the ubiquitin-like protein family, plays a critical role in dynein preassembly, most likely by mediating diverse interactions between dynein HCs, molecular chaperone(s), and other preassembly factor(s) using the ubiquitin-like domain as well as other regions, and by facilitating the proper folding of dynein HCs.",

Mechanistically, androgens directly activate AR-positive CRH neurons, enhancing the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation. This results in elevated corticosterone levels in response to restraint stress, leading to increased immune cell apoptosis and immune organ atrophy in male mice. Conditional knockout of ARs in CRH neurons eliminated this sexual dimorphism, highlighting ARs in CRH neurons as pivotal regulators of sex-specific immune responses to stress.",

Species radiations established by long-distance, and especially transoceanic, dispersal can cause substantial shifts in regional biodiversity. Here, we investigate the occurrence and timing of the greatest known long-distance oceanic dispersal event in the history of terrestrial vertebrates—the rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji. Iguanas are large-bodied herbivores that are well-known overwater dispersers, including species that colonized the Caribbean and the Galápagos islands. However, the origin of Fijian iguanas had not been comprehensively tested. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary timescale of the iguanid lizard radiation using genome-wide exons and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Those data indicate that the closest living relative of extant Fijian iguanas is the North American desert iguana and that the two taxa likely diverged during the late Paleogene near or after the onset of volcanism that produced the Fijian archipelago. Biogeographic models estimate North America as the most probable ancestral range of Fijian iguanas. Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America, and which spanned a fifth of the earth’s circumference (&gt;8,000 km). Overwater rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji strengthens the importance of founder-event speciation in the diversification of iguanids and elucidates the scope of long-distance dispersal across terrestrial vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "The high resource intensity of industrial beef in high-income economies has prompted growing interest in alternative, potentially lower environmental impact beef production pathways. Of those, grass feeding is promoted by some as one such alternative, but rigorous quantification of this claim is required. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap, we integrate empirical evidence with a model based on authoritative equations governing beef cattle performance to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of producing grass-fed beef. Because geographical specificity and dependence on agricultural intensity are key, we model widely varied herds, from extensive operations on semiarid, marginal rangelands to partially industrial, intensive ones in lusher, more accommodating settings. We find that emissions per kg protein of even the most efficient grass-fed beef are 10 to 25% higher than those of industrial US beef and 3- to over 40-fold higher than a wide range of plant and animal alternatives. Soil sequestration enhancement by rangeland grazing reduces these emissions from 280–390 to 180–290 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , still somewhat above industrial beef’s 180 to 220 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , and well above nonbeef alternatives’ 10 to 70 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 . These differences prove robust across a broad set of combinations of grass-fed beef operation types, management practices, and ration qualities. Consequently, even with maximal credit for putative sequestration enhancement, grass-fed beef is still no less carbon intensive than industrial beef, and severalfold more intensive than nonbeef alternatives.",

Here, we present a generic and scalable strategy to purify mammalian respiratory complexes I, III and the ATP synthase from enriched mitochondria in enzymatically fully active form, and procedures to reassemble the complexes into liposomes. A robust functionality can be shown by in situ monitoring of ATP synthesis rates and by using selected inhibitors of the respiratory chain complexes. By inclusion of cytochrome c oxidase, our procedures allowed us to reconstruct the entire mitochondrial respiratory chain (complexes I, III, IV, and V) in ubiquinone Q 10 containing liposomes, demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen driven ATP synthesis. The system was fully coupled at all levels and was used to probe cardiolipin as an essential component to activate the mammalian respiratory chain. Structural characterization using electron cryomicroscopy allowed us to resolve apo-state complex III and complex V at high and medium resolution, respectively, using in silico particle sorting, confirming the presence of all protein subunits and cofactors in native stoichiometry and conformation.

Upon severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, platelets become hyperactivated, releasing molecules such as cytokines, granule contents, and bioactive lipids. The key effector biolipids produced by platelets include 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and prostaglandins and thromboxane, produced by cyclooxygenase-1. While prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were previously associated with lung inflammation in severe COVID-19, the role of platelet 12-LOX in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using mice deficient for platelets’ 12-LOX, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher lung inflammation characterized by histopathological tissue analysis, increased leukocyte infiltrates, and cytokine production relative to wild-type mice. In addition, distinct platelet and lung transcriptomic changes, including alterations in NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome-related gene expression, were observed. Mass spectrometry lipidomic analysis in 12-LOX-deficient-infected mice revealed significant changes in bioactive lipid content, including reduced levels of 12-HETrE that inversely correlated with disease severity. Finally, platelet 12-LOX deficiency was associated with increased morbidity and lower survival rates relative to wild type (WT) mice. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between 12-LOX-related lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

          "abstract": "NuA4 is the only essential acetyltransferase in yeast that can catalyze the acetylation of the histones H2A, H2A.Z, and H4, thereby affecting gene transcription. However, the acetylation process of NuA4, such as how NuA4 acetylates H4 and H2A.Z differently, remains largely elusive. Here, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle analysis, we present seven cryo-EM structures of piccolo NuA4 (pNuA4) in complex with wild-type H2A.Z or H2A.Z-mutant-containing nucleosomes in the absence or presence of acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA). We revealed that, in the absence of Ac-CoA, pNuA4 adopts multiple conformations to search for its substrates. After adding Ac-CoA, the single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and cryo-EM data indicated that pNuA4 prefers to bind H4 and undergoes a dynamic conformational change to complete the acetylation. We also obtained previously unseen structures in states associated with the acetylation of H2A.Z. These cryo-EM structures and smFRET results suggest a complex acetylation process on H4 and H2A.Z by pNuA4. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanism by which pNuA4 acetylates its substrates within an H2A.Z-containing nucleosome.",

Epidemiological dynamics of many infectious diseases have highlighted the importance of considering the demographics of the societies in which they spread, particularly with respect to age structure. In addition, the waves of the recent COVID-19 pandemic driven by variant replacements at an unprecedented speed show that it is vital to consider the evolutionary aspects. The classic trade-off theory of virulence addresses aspects of pathogen evolution, but here we explore in more detail the possibility of society-specific evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) during an unfolding pandemic. Theory posits the existence under some conditions of an ESS representing the evolutionary endpoint of change. By using a demographically realistic model incorporating infection rates that vary with age, we outline which evolutionary scenarios are plausible. Focusing on the rate of infection and duration of infectivity, we ask whether an ESS exists, what characterizes it, and as a result which long-term public-health consequences may be expected. We demonstrate that the ESS of an evolving pathogen depends upon the background age-dependent frailty and mortality rates. Our findings shed important light on the plausible long-term trajectories of highly evolvable novel pathogens.",

          "abstract": "The phenological timing of leaf out in temperate forests is a critical transition point each year that alters the global climate system, which in turn, feeds back to plants, driving leaf out to occur nearly 3 d earlier per decade as temperatures rise. To improve predictions of leaf out timing, urban heat islands (UHIs) or densely developed areas that are hotter than surrounding undeveloped regions are often used to approximate warming via space-for-time substitutions (i.e., rural-to-urban temperature gradients). However, more than just environment changes along these gradients—urban regions are highly managed systems with limited-to-no within species diversity. We demonstrate here that recent observations that UHI gradients underpredict leaf out response to temperature when compared to temperature gradients through time is likely because both genetics and environment are changing across rural-to-urban gradients, whereas only environment is changing through time. We tested this hypothesis using genomic, phenological, and temperature data of northern red oak ( Quercus rubra ) over several years between an urban and rural site. Across our gradient, models that included just temperature predicted moderate advancement of leaf out. However, if we account for the genetic diversity of our trees in our model, leaf out phenology is predicted to advance significantly more in response to temperature. We demonstrate that this stronger relationship between phenological timing and climate is because urban trees have reduced genetic diversity as they are planted from limited stock by humans and, moreover, are most closely related to individuals at the rural site that leaf out later on average.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen responsible for numerous antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying vulnerabilities in S. aureus is crucial for developing new antibiotics to treat these infections. With this in mind, we probed the function of GdpS, a conserved Staphylococcal membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic GGDEF domain. These domains are canonically involved in cyclic-di-GMP signaling processes, but S. aureus is not known to make cyclic-di-GMP. Using a transposon screen, we found that loss of GdpS is lethal when combined with disruption in synthesis of the glycolipid anchor of a cell surface polymer called lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or with deletion of genes important in cell division. Taking advantage of a small molecule that inhibits LTA glycolipid anchor synthesis, we selected for suppressors of Δ gdpS lethality. The most prevalent suppressors were hypermorphic alleles of dgkB , which encodes a soluble diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase required to recycle DAG to phosphatidylglycerol. By following up on these suppressors, we found that the GGDEF domain of GdpS interacts directly with DgkB, orienting its active site at the membrane to promote DAG recycling. DAG kinase hypermorphs also suppressed the lethality caused by combined loss of gdpS and cell division factors, highlighting the importance of lipid homeostasis for cell division. GdpS’ positive regulation of DAG kinase function was dependent on the GGDEF domain but not its catalytic residues. As the sole conserved GGDEF-domain protein in Staphylococci, GdpS promotes an enzymatic process independent of cyclic-di-GMP signaling, revealing a new function for the ubiquitously conserved GGDEF domain.",

Currently, antibody candidates are exhaustively tested one-by-one in animal models to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles. The simultaneous analysis of antibody mixtures in single animals, called cassette-dosing, could in principle overcome this bottleneck, but is currently limited to small cassette sizes. Here, we demonstrate how the use of genetically encoded peptide tags (flycodes), designed for maximal detectability in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, can allow for the simultaneous characterization of large pools of drug candidates, from single cassette–dosed mice. We demonstrate the simultaneous assessment of PK parameters for a group of &gt;20 marketed/development-stage antibodies. Biodistribution experiments in mice bearing EGFR-expressing tumors correctly identified the two pool members recognizing EGFR, while organ analysis registered liver accumulation of an antibody targeting glucagon receptor, a protein profoundly expressed in that organ. In analogy to an early-phase drug development campaign, we performed biophysical and PK analysis for a cassette of 80 unique bispecific DARPin-sybody molecules. The data shown in this study originate from only 18 cassette-dosed mice, thereby demonstrating how flycode technology efficiently advances preclinical discovery pipelines allowing a direct comparison of drug candidates under identical experimental conditions.",

As a result, calibrating mammalian evolution has been largely restricted to the semicircular application of paleomagnetic inferences combined with temporally ill-constrained and geographically remote biochronological deductions. For example, fossils from three Greek localities and one Anatolian locality assigned to the primate genus Ouranopithecus lack datable samples, leaving its ages poorly constrained.

          "abstract": "Why are jellyfish round? Animals get their shapes as they develop. After development, however, how animals keep their shapes is less understood. Moon jellies respond to perturbations to body shape, such as being halved or quartered, by reorganizing existing body parts and regaining radial symmetry, i.e., their round shape. The robust recovery of radial symmetry led us to investigate, in this study, how being round is encoded. We tested perturbing shape by grafting body sections in varying configurations. Testing these perturbations confirms the moon jellies’ ability to recover their round shape from many perturbations. However, in response to some perturbations, the jellies can also adopt other stable body shapes, such as oval, quadrilateral, and triangular. Thus, although the jellies are characterized by a radially symmetrical body plan, perturbations can lead to them recovering to bilateral shapes. Employing mathematical modeling, we find that interactions between forces from muscle contractions and viscoelastic tissues can explain the recovery to different shapes. A stable body shape is achieved when the mechanical forces are locally balanced, regardless of symmetry. Consistent with the model prediction that stable shape is the outcome of balancing mechanical forces, modulating the mechanical parameter in the system, i.e., the muscle contraction rate, can produce shape-shifting. Maintaining shapes dynamically as the balance of mechanical forces may enable the animals to readily adapt to changing physical environments.",

Transcriptional repression of genes for core subunits of the NDH-1 complex, which are important for photosynthesis and carbon uptake, improved growth rates under both red and blue light but at distinct, color-specific optima. Most genes with fitness-improving knockdowns were distinct to each light color, and dual-target transcriptional repression produced nonadditive effects.

The results show that peptide bonds can be rapidly formed via a unique isomerization-then-OH − -elimination pathway. In this mechanism, the diglycine initially isomerizes into its acidic form at the air–water interface, followed by a reaction that releases an OH − anion rather than the previously hypothesized H 2 O. The free-energy barriers for the interfacial pathway with the assistance of an interfacial electric field are much lower than those in the gas phase by &gt;25 kcal/mol.

To date, PEARLs have been reported that can conjugate Cys, Ala, Trp, Gly, Leu, Asn, and Thr residues, but the basis of peptide substrate and aminoacyl-tRNA recognition is not known. Cell-free expression (CFE) has emerged as a powerful tool to rapidly assay activity of substrate variants, and we used the technique in this study to investigate the peptide substrate specificity of the PEARL B h a B C T r p . This enzyme that adds Trp was discovered previously during genome mining for ribosomally synthesized and posttranslational modified peptides (RiPPs). The enzyme is remarkably tolerant of changes to the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide substrate, and truncation and replacement experiments suggest a minimal sequence requirement. An AlphaFold3 model provided insights into binding interactions of the substrate peptide BhaA-Ala to B h a B C T r p and also generated predictions for tRNA, ATP, and Mg 2+ binding modes that were tested by site-directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that several highly conserved residues in PEARLs recognize the 3′-CCA sequence present in all tRNAs.

While this conserved architecture underpins their regulatory roles, here we uncover a structural divergence in the metazoan PAS domain–regulated kinase (PASK). By integrating evolutionary-scale domain mapping with deep learning-based structural models, we identified two PAS domains in PASK, namely PAS-B and PAS-C, in addition to the previously known PAS-A domain. Unlike canonical PAS domains, the PAS fold and PAC motif in the PAS-C domain are spatially segregated by an unstructured linker, yet a functional PAS module is assembled through intramolecular interactions. We demonstrate that this assembly is nutrient responsive and serves to remodel the quaternary structure of PASK that positions the PAS-A domain near the kinase activation loop. This nutrient-sensitive spatial arrangement stabilizes the activation loop, enabling catalytic activation of PASK. These findings revealed an alternative mode of regulatory control in PAS sensory proteins, where the structural assembly of PAS domains links environmental sensing to enzymatic activity. By demonstrating that PAS domains integrate signals through dynamic structural rearrangements, this study broadens the understanding of their functional and regulatory roles and highlights potential opportunities for targeting PAS domain–mediated pathways in therapeutic applications.",

Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here, we combine direct imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the result that the flow rate and mechanical pumping efficiency reach a maximum at a small outlet opening angle. Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number, and the outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge Ephydatia muelleri , as well as several other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping functions.

Here, we have demonstrated the efficient simultaneous removal of arsenic and uranyl-carbonate complexes from groundwater using {001}-TiO 2 . Surprisingly, the presence of U(VI) greatly enhanced the adsorption of As(V) on {001}-TiO 2 , while As(V) had a negligible impact on U(VI) adsorption. Through in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, we uncovered a mechanism involving the formation of a ternary surface complex [Ti–U(VI)–As(V)] on the surface of {001}-TiO 2 . This ternary surface complex formed through the substitution of CO 3 2- from uranyl coordination sites. Furthermore, the adsorbed As(V) and U(VI) can be easily recovered using a sodium hydroxide solution, and {001}-TiO 2 can be used repeatedly. Our findings offer a promising solution for the simultaneous removal of As(V) and U(VI) from groundwater and provide valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in their removal.",

          "abstract": "Diapause, a developmental arrest mechanism, helps animals to survive seasonal changes via endocrine regulation. While obligate diapause is genetically programmed, facultative diapause is typically triggered by environmental cues such as photoperiod. In insects, this often leads to reproductive diapause characterized by reduced juvenile hormone (JH) signaling, resulting in ovarian arrest and lipid accumulation. However, the molecular link between photoperiod and hormonal control remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi as our model system. This species exhibits a photoperiodic response, where short-day (SD) conditions promote reproduction, whereas long-day (LD) conditions induce diapause. Our research identified the PBAP chromatin remodeling complex as a key regulator of LD-induced summer diapause entry. Through RNAi screening of 56 transcriptional regulators that were differentially expressed between SD and LD females, we identified BAP170, a PBAP-specific component, as a key mediator of diapause. Knockdown of bap170 in SD females induced reproductive diapause traits, which were reversed by treatment with methoprene, a JH analog, suggesting that the PBAP complex regulates diapause by influencing JH production. We further demonstrated that the PBAP complex modulates JH biosynthesis via SET1/COMPASS-mediated trimethylation of H3K4. Transcriptome analysis and a second RNAi screen identified calmodulin , a calcium-binding messenger protein gene, as a direct target of PBAP-SET1/COMPASS-H3K4me3 signaling in the corpora allata (CA), the primary source of JH. These findings reveal how the chromatin remodeling machinery translates photoperiod signals into endocrine responses governing seasonal adaptation.",

However, achieving this goal has long been challenging due to the diffraction of low-frequency (long-wavelength) audio waves in linear acoustics. Here, we introduce an approach for creating remote audio spots, dubbed audible enclaves, by harnessing the local nonlinear interaction of two self-bending ultrasonic beams with distinct spectra. The self-bending ultrasonic beams created by acoustic metasurfaces, though inaudible, can bypass obstacles such as human heads. At their intersection behind obstacles, highly localized audible enclaves are formed due to the local nonlinear interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the ultrabroadband capabilities of our metasurface-based implementation both numerically and experimentally, spanning from 125 Hz to 4 kHz (6 octave bands), covering the majority of the audible frequency range. The practicality of our proposed technique is underscored by its compact implementation size (0.16 m, equivalent to 0.06 wavelengths at 125 Hz), as well as its robust performance under wideband transient audio signal excitation and in a common room with reverberations. Our proposed audible enclaves hold significant potential for various applications in advanced audio engineering, including private speech communications, immersive spatial audio reproduction, and high-resolution sound/quiet zone control.",

Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses, a spatiotemporal atlas of MC in human fetuses from 7 to 15 wk postconception was established, highlighting the role of MC in the ossification of the mandible. Importantly, we revealed that two populations of MC contributed to mandibular ossification through different mechanisms. The anterior MC can differentiate into osteolineage cells, as shown in an in vivo lineage tracing mouse model. The intermediate MC facilitates intramembranous ossification through cell–cell communications, possibly through signaling ligands like BMP5 , BMP7 , SEMA3A , PDGFC , and FGF7 . This study suggests that MC plays a crucial role in mediating mandibular ossification through distinct mechanisms, providing valuable insights for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders in the future.",

However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little response to diverse nonlinguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and programming languages. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n = 19 speakers) and four fictional conlangs [Klingon (n = 10), Na’vi (n = 9), High Valyrian (n = 3), and Dothraki (n = 3)]. These findings suggest that conlangs and natural languages share critical features that allow them to draw on the same representations and computations, implemented in the left-lateralized network of brain areas. The features of conlangs that differentiate them from natural languages—including recent creation by a single individual, often for an esoteric purpose, the small number of speakers, and the fact that these languages are typically learned in adulthood—appear to not be consequential for the reliance on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. We argue that the critical shared feature of conlangs and natural languages is that they are symbolic systems capable of expressing an open-ended range of meanings about our outer and inner worlds.",

Here we study by experiment and theory a model system: a coculture of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis , an obligate aerobe that is chemotactic to oxygen, and a nonmotile mutant of the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , which photosynthetically produces oxygen when illuminated. Strikingly, when a shaft of light illuminates a thin, initially uniform suspension of the two, the chemotactic influx of bacteria to the photosynthetically active region leads to expulsion of the algae from that area. We propose that this effect arises from advection by the inhomogeneous bacterial concentration. The resulting generalization of Fick’s law has been proposed in the context of chemotaxis and is mathematically related to the “turbulent pumping” in magnetohydrodynamics.",

While trophoblast-specific cis-regulatory elements impacting HLA-G transcription have been described, the identity of trans-acting factors controlling HLA-G expression in EVT remains poorly understood. Utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we find that the WNT signaling pathway negatively regulates HLA-G expression in EVT. In addition, we identified two trophoblast-specific transcription factors, TEAD1 and TEAD3, required for HLA-G transcription in EVT in a Yes-associated protein-independent manner.

          "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) can achieve near-unity quantum efficiency of light harvesting in ideal conditions and can dissipate excess light energy as heat to prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light stress. Understanding how this pigment–protein complex accomplishes these opposing goals is a topic of great interest that has so far been explored primarily through the lens of the system energetics. Despite PSII’s known flat energy landscape, a thorough consideration of the entropic effects on energy transfer in PSII is lacking. In this work, we aim to discern the free energetic design principles underlying the PSII energy transfer network. To accomplish this goal, we employ a structure-based rate matrix and compute the free energy terms in time following a specific initial excitation to discern how entropy and enthalpy drive ensemble system dynamics. We find that the interplay between the entropy and enthalpy components differ among each protein subunit, which allows each subunit to fulfill a unique role in the energy transfer network. This individuality ensures that PSII can accomplish efficient energy trapping in the reaction center (RC), effective nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) in the periphery, and robust energy trapping in the other-monomer RC if the same-monomer RC is closed. We also show that entropy, in particular, is a dynamically tunable feature of the PSII free energy landscape accomplished through regulation of LHCII binding. These findings help rationalize natural photosynthesis and provide design principles for more efficient solar energy harvesting technologies.",

          "abstract": "Plants produce diverse specialized metabolites with important ecological functions. It has recently become apparent that the genes for many of these pathways are not dispersed in plant genomes, but rather are arranged like beads on a string in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Pathways encoded by BGCs are as a rule dedicated linear pathways that do not form parts of wider metabolic networks. In contrast, the genes for the biosynthesis of widely distributed more ancestral metabolites such as carotenoids and anthocyanins are not clustered. Little is known about how these more recently evolved clustered pathways interact with general plant metabolism. We recently characterized a 12-gene BGC for the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial defense compound avenacin A-1, a triterpene glycoside produced by oats. Avenacin A-1 is acylated with the fluorophore N -methyl anthranilate and confers bright blue fluorescence of oat root tips under ultraviolet light. Here, we exploit a suite of &gt;100 avenacin-deficient mutants identified by screening for reduced root fluorescence to identify genes required for the function of this paradigm BGC. Using a combination of mutant chemotyping, biochemical and molecular analysis, and genome resequencing, we identify two nonclustered genes ( Sad4 and Pal2 ) encoding enzymes that synthesize the donors required for avenacin glycosylation and acylation (recruited from the phenylpropanoid and tryptophan pathways). Our finding of these Cluster Auxiliary Enzymes (CAEs) provides insights into the interplay between general plant metabolism and a newly evolved lineage-specific BGC.",

We observed a widespread and relatively abundant bacterial phylum (CSP1-3) in deep soils and evaluated its phylogeny, ecology, metabolism, and evolutionary history. Genome analysis indicated that members of CSP1-3 were actively replicating in situ and were widely involved in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. We identified potential adaptive traits of CSP1-3 members for the oligotrophic deep soil environments, including a mixotrophic lifestyle, flexible energy metabolisms, and conservation pathways. The ancestor of CSP1-3 likely originated in an aquatic environment, subsequently colonizing topsoil and, later, deep soil environments, with major CSP1-3 clades adapted to each of these distinct niches. The transition into the terrestrial environment was associated with genome expansion, including the horizontal acquisition of a range of genes for carbohydrate and energy metabolism and, in one lineage, high-affinity terminal oxidases to support a microaerophilic lifestyle.

In vitro without antibiotics, wild-type Mtb hastens death of the macrophages, but the processes leading to rapid cell death are not well understood. Our earlier work indicated that the death of Mtb-infected mouse macrophages in vitro is markedly exacerbated by induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) [L. Zhang et al., J. Exp. Med. 18 , e20200887 (2021)]. Here, we identified a key downstream response to IFN-β in the context of Mtb infection as the massive induction of cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), not only in its canonical subcellular localization in mitochondria but also in the cytosol, where it bound to the lysosome-stabilizing protein HSP70. ACOD1’s product, itaconate, protected Mtb-infected macrophages. However, the contrasting and predominant effect of high-level ACOD1 expression was to act in a noncatalytic manner to promote HSP70’s degradation, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Mtb-induced macrophage death was markedly diminished by inhibitors of cysteine proteases, consistent with lysosome-mediated cell death. Neither ACOD1 inhibitors nor cysteine protease inhibitors are suitable for potential host-directed therapy (HDT) of tuberculosis. Instead, this work directs attention to how ACOD1 acts nonenzymatically to promote the degradation of HSP70.",

          "abstract": "A sustained blood supply is critical for tumor growth, as it delivers the nutrients and oxygen required for development. Targeting of blood vessel formation via immunotherapies is an area of great importance. Knowing that certain embryonic genes, such as carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and oncofetal fibronectin, become reexpressed in malignant transformation, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon holds true for tumor endothelial cells (TECs) as well. An approach for identification of highly selective tumor endothelial markers was conducted to develop targeted antiangiogenic immunotherapies. We first queried the transcriptome that is present during embryo development. We then performed a systematic search for genes selectively expressed in the mouse embryo at days E11 and E18, as compared to the transcriptome of the adult mouse. Subsequently, we queried for expression of these embryonic genes in sorted murine TECs. This approach identified among others the tumor endothelial antigens fibrillin-2 (Fbn2), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 2 (Emilin2) as well as the tumor endothelial antigens lysyl oxidase (Lox) and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1; Pai-1). For these selected genes, functional involvement in angiogenesis was confirmed in in vitro bioassays. We subsequently used iBoost conjugate vaccine technology to develop vaccines against the selected targets. For all four targets, vaccination readily induced target-specific antibody responses in mice, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Access to highly specific tumor endothelial markers provides opportunities for direct targeting of the tumor vasculature with high specificity, without affecting healthy vasculature.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between humans and pigs has changed dramatically since their domestication in southwest Asia and subsequent human-induced introduction into Europe. Introgression between incoming southwest Asian pigs and European boar resulted in the gradual replacement of southwest Asian ancestry in European pigs. However, we currently lack genomic data required to explore the regional trajectories, nature, and extent of contact between European boar and pigs that led to this turnover, and how this process was facilitated by human activity. We addressed this deficit by sequencing four Mesolithic boar and seven Neolithic pig samples from six archaeological sites in the Netherlands and Britain ranging from the Mesolithic (5500 BCE) to Neolithic (2500 BCE). Our data show that despite continuous gene flow with European boar, Neolithic European pigs show varying levels of southwest Asian ancestry. The low and varying southwest Asian ancestry in pigs from the Early Neolithic Dutch settlement Swifterbant indicates a high contribution of wild ancestry. The genetic profile, enriched δ 15 N values, on-site presence, and wide size distribution of Swifterbant Sus scrofa suggest a commensal relationship. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) imply that both closed-breeding and free-ranging management occurred in Neolithic communities, where the former showed an extreme burden of long segments of ROH. We further show selection signatures, associated with coat color and behavior, in Neolithic herds despite recurrent wild gene flow. Altogether, our results show distinct husbandry practices through space and time in Neolithic Europe, with heavy reliance on boar recruitment via the commensal pathway in northwest Europe.",

However, broadening their clinical utility remains a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a high-throughput kinase inhibitor screen to identify potential targets exhibiting synthetical lethality with PARP inhibitors. Our results show that thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 1 (TAOK1) plays a pivotal role in the DNA damage response by phosphorylating ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7), thereby promoting its enzymatic activity and preventing the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RAD51, a crucial protein in the filament formation of HR repair. Notably, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of TAOK1, as well as blocking peptide targeting the USP7 phosphorylation site, impaired USP7 function, leading to RAD51 degradation, disruption of HR repair, and increased tumor cell and sensitivity to PARP inhibition. This study highlights TAOK1 as a critical regulator of HR repair pathway in human cancer cells and presents a therapeutic strategy overcoming resistance to PARPi inhibitors. These findings support the potential clinical application of combining PARP inhibitors with TAOK1 inhibition or peptide treatment to improve therapeutic outcomes.",

Intriguingly, we observed that Dnmt3a, highly expressed during osteoclastogenesis, played a pivotal role in regulating the methylation of the FoxO3 promoter. Knockdown of Dnmt3a promoted FoxO3 expression, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and mitigating OP.

          "abstract": "Opioids trigger structural and functional neural adaptations of the reward circuit that lead to dependence. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a pivotal role in circuit organization and present prime candidates for orchestrating remodeling of neural connections in response to drug exposure. However, the contribution of CAMs to opioid-induced rewiring of the reward circuit has not been explored. Here, we used unbiased molecular profiling to identify CAMs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) modulated by morphine administration. We found that opioid exposure induces the expression of ELFN1, a CAM selectively expressed in cholinergic interneurons in the NAc. We determined that ELFN1 acts trans-synaptically to modulate the strength and plasticity of the glutamatergic inputs onto cholinergic neurons via the recruitment of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4). Disruption of Elfn1 diminished morphine reward and intake in self-administering mice. Together, our findings identify a key molecular factor responsible for adjusting the strength of opioid effects by modulating the configuration of striatal circuitry in an experience-dependent fashion and unveil potential therapeutic target for combating opioid abuse.",

          "authors": "Anand Mathew, Yashashree Kulkarni",
          "abstract": "Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells and organisms is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.",

          "abstract": "Bacterial motility in spatially structured environments impacts a variety of natural and engineering processes. Constructing models to predict, control, and design bacterial motility for these processes remains challenging because bacteria and active swimmers have complex interactions with surfaces and because the precise environment geometry is unknown. Here, we present a method for deriving bacterial diffusion coefficients in disordered media in terms of cell and environmental parameters. The approach abstracts the dynamics in the full geometry to “surface states,” which encode how cells interact with surfaces in the environment. Then, a long-time diffusion equation can be derived analytically from the state model. Applying this method to a run-and-tumble particle in a 2D Lorentz gas environment provides analytical predictions that show good agreement with particle simulations. Like past studies, we observe that the diffusivity depends nonmonotonically on the cell’s run length. Using the analytical expressions, we derive the optimal run length, revealing an intuitive dependence on environmental length scales. Furthermore, we find that rescaling length and time by the average distance and time between trap events collapses all of the diffusivities onto a single curve, which we derive analytically. Thus, our approach extracts interpretable, macroscopic diffusive behavior from complex microscopic dynamics, and provides tools and intuitions for understanding bacterial diffusion in disordered media.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity hotspots in Earth’s mountain ranges suggest a strong connection between topographic development and biological processes. However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity. Our results provide insights into the influence of topographic changes on evolutionary processes, offering a potential link between mountain formation and paleodiversity records.",

          "abstract": "For cells to polarize collectively along a tissue plane, asymmetrically localized planar cell polarity (PCP) complexes must form intercellular contacts between neighboring cells. Yet, it is unknown whether asymmetric segregation of PCP complexes requires cell-cell contact, or if cell autonomous, antagonistic interactions are sufficient for polarization. To test this, we generated mouse chimeras consisting of dual PCP-reporter cells mixed with unlabeled cells that cannot form PCP bridges. In the absence of intercellular interactions, PCP proteins failed to polarize cell autonomously. Rather, PCP-mediated contacts along single cell-cell interfaces were sufficient to sort PCP components to opposite sides of the junction, independent of junction orientation. Thus, intercellular binding of PCP complexes is the critical step that initiates sorting of opposing PCP complexes to generate asymmetry.",

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.",

Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales.",

Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes.

This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation.

Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills.",

We found that self-peptide–specific T reg cells were dispensable for the control of T conv cells of matched specificity at homeostasis. However, they were required to control such T conv cells and prevent autoimmunity toward the prostate after exposure to elevated self-peptide during infection. Notably, the T reg cell response to self-peptide did not affect protective T conv cell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide. Thus, self-peptide–specific T reg cells promoted self-nonself discrimination during infection by selectively controlling T conv cells of shared self-specificity.",

          "abstract": "Highly functionalized structural motifs with extended chiral carbon chains are prevalent in a wide range of bioactive compounds and play critical roles in the production of various functionalized molecules. Here, we describe a nickel-catalyzed asymmetric radical-based electrochemical functionalization of silyl polyenolates at α-, γ-, ε-, and η-positions. Driven by electric current, this methodology provides a sustainable route to access enantioenriched dicarbonyls via vinylogous radical pathways. It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide.",

A promising avenue to tackle this problem is harnessing the supreme deformability of liquids while providing stable yet flexible shells around them. Here, we report a highly robust liquid-particle composite, named a Particle-armored liquid roBot (PB), featuring a liquid blob coated with unusually abundant superhydrophobic particles. The enhanced deformability and structural stability of our millimetric PBs enable a range of versatile robotic functions, such as navigating through complex environments, engulfing and transporting cargoes, merging, and adapting to various environments. We use both theoretical analysis and experimental approaches to develop a framework for predicting the shape evolution, dynamics, and robotic functions of PBs. The forms and functions of our liquid robots mark an essential hallmark toward miniature biomachines that perform like cells.",

          "abstract": "In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T regs ) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD + ), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T regs by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD + with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T regs back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T regs , sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD + axis disrupts T regs metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses.",

This key observable of random walk theory, historically introduced as the gambler’s ruin problem, is well understood for memoryless (Markovian) processes. However, in complex systems such as polymer fluids, the motion of a particle should typically be described as a process with memory, for which splitting probabilities are much less characterized analytically. Here, we introduce an analytical approach that provides the splitting probabilities for one-dimensional isotropic non-Markovian Gaussian processes with stationary increments, in the case of two targets. This analysis shows that splitting probabilities are controlled by the out-of-equilibrium trajectories observed after the first passage. This is directly evidenced in a prototypical experimental reaction scheme in viscoelastic fluids. These results are extended to d -dimensional processes in large confining volumes, opening a path toward the study of competitive events in complex media.",

The synthesis of monazite, LaPO 4 , requires inconveniently high temperatures near 1000°C and generally involves the conversion of the presynthesized rhabdophane, LaPO 4 •nH 2 O, to the LaPO 4 monazite phase. During this structure transformation, the rhabdophane converts irreversibly to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic monazite structure. A low-temperature (185° to 260°C) mild hydrothermal acid-promoted synthesis of monazite is described that can both transform presynthesized rhabdophane or assemble reagents to the monoclinic monazite structure. The pH dependence of this reaction is detailed, and its applicability to the Ln PO 4 ( Ln  = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm-Gd), Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 , and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 systems is discussed. The crystal growth of Ca 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 and Sr 0.5 Th 0.5 PO 4 is described, and their crystal structures were reported.

However, dysfunction and impairment of sensory nerves, accompanied by excessive inflammation impede tissue regeneration. Consequently, specific induction of sensory innervation to mediate immunoregulation becomes a promising therapeutic approach. Herein, we developed a cell/drug-free strategy to selectively boost endogenous sensory innervation to harness immune responses for promoting tissue rehabilitation. Specifically, a dual-functional phage was constructed with a sensory nerve–homing peptide and a β-subunit of nerve growth factor (β-NGF)–binding peptide. These double-displayed phages captured endogenic β-NGF and localized to sensory nerves to promote sensory innervation. Furthermore, regarding bone regeneration, phage-loaded hydrogels achieved rapid sensory nerve ingrowth in bone defect areas. Mechanistically, sensory neurotization facilitated M2 polarization of macrophages through the Sema3A/XIAP/PAX6 pathway, thus decreasing the M1/M2 ratio to induce the dissipation of local inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight the essential role of sensory innervation in manipulating inflammation and provide a conceptual framework based on neuroimmune interactions for promoting tissue regeneration.",

Immunosuppression fails to prevent CLAD, suggesting the existence of drug-resistant alloimmune pathways. We used time-of-flight mass cytometry to identify cells enriched in the bronchoalveolar lavage of patients with subsequent acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD), a risk factor for CLAD. We show that CD4 + CD57 + PD1 + T cells emerge in stable patients, conferring risks for ALAD, CLAD, and death. These cells are senescent, secrete inflammatory cytokines, and fall into two oligoclonal subsets with putative cytotoxic and follicular helper functions. Last, they are associated with fibrosis in mouse and human lung allografts, where they localize near airway epithelium and B cells. Together, our findings reveal an inflammatory T cell population that predicts future lung allograft dysfunction and may represent a rational therapeutic target.",

In this work, we achieve nanosecond-pulsed electroluminescence (EL) from a solution-processed fast-response quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED). By modeling the QLED with a resistor-capacitor equivalent circuit and analyzing the transient current of the circuit, the dynamic of the carrier injection and transport process that fundamentally affects the transient EL of QLED is revealed, which helps to guide the optimization of fast-response QLED. Driven by a high current source, the optimized QLED can output stable and repeatable ultrashort EL with a pulse duration of 20 nanoseconds, a repetition rate of 50 kilohertz, and a high radiant exitance of 5.4 watts per square centimeter. Enabled by the nanosecond-pulsed EL, the developed QLED can be directly used as an instantaneous excitation source for time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.

While these neural processes converge in the temporal cortex, the nature of their interactions remains largely unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the interplay between visual attention and stimulus feature coding by training macaques to perform a free-gaze visual search task with natural stimuli. Recording from a large number of units across multiple brain areas, we found that units exhibiting visual feature coding showed stronger attentional modulation of responses and spike–local field potential coherence than units without feature coding. Across brain areas, attention directed toward search targets enhanced the neuronal pattern separation of stimuli, with this enhancement more pronounced for units encoding visual features.

However, the therapeutic efficacy is restricted by gastrointestinal assaults, poor mucosal adhesion, and single therapeutic modality. Here, we developed acid-resistant, gut-environment–responsive composite microparticles based on microfluidic electrospray for the oral codelivery of probiotic [ Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA)] biofilm and postbiotics (indole-3-propionic acid). Montmorillonite was selected for supporting biofilm formation due to its cation-exchange capability and clearly defined biosafety. The montmorillonite-LA biofilm was effectively protected by the microparticles and markedly improved the intestinal retention. Upon oral administration, the composite microparticles notably alleviated colitis in mice, including reducing the inflammatory response, improving intestinal barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiota. Consequently, the composite microparticles show high potential for enhancing probiotic delivery efficacy and present a promising strategy for UC treatment.",

The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.",

This study explores low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) as a resuscitation strategy. Cervical LIPUS stimulation effectively elevated blood pressure in shocked rats. It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment.

After use in affinity selection, treatment with dithiothreitol enables near-quantitative reduction, rendering linear peptide analogs for standard tandem mass spectrometry. We use these libraries to discover macrocyclic binders to cadherin-2 and anti-hemagglutinin antibody clone 12ca5. Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar).

The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton.

Intriguingly, cell cycles of host and endosymbiont are synchronized. The molecular mechanisms underlying this notable level of integration are unknown. Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts. Our work unveiled that in A. deanei an endosymbiont division machinery of dual genetic origin evolved in which a neo-functionalized host protein compensates for losses of endosymbiont division genes.",

Here, we identified an SlKD1-interacting transcription factor GATA transcription factor 6 (SlGATA6), which is required for maintaining the auxin-response gradient and preventing abscission. SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 . The AUXIN RESISTANT/LIKE AUXIN RESISTANT (AUX/LAX) proteins SlLAX2-dependent asymmetric auxin distribution causes differential accumulation of Auxin/Indole-3-Acetic Acid 3 (SlIAA3) and its homolog SlIAA32 across different abscission zone cells. It is also required for SUMOylation of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 2a (SlARF2a), a key suppressor of auxin signaling and abscission initiator. Moreover, SlIAA3 and SlIAA32 depress SUMOylated SlARF2a, thus suppressing SlARF2a function. The interaction between SlKD1 and SlGATA6 suppresses SlGATA6 binding to the promoters of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 , thereby disrupting the auxin-response gradient and triggering abscission. This regulatory mechanism is conserved under low light–induced abscission in diverse Solanaceae plants. Our findings reveal a critical role of SlKD1 in modulating the auxin-response gradient and abscission initiation.",

Here, we propose an innovative concept of selective antibacterial starvation therapy based on interfering with proton and electron transfer on the bacterial membrane. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function. This proposed starvation antibacterial therapy gives a notable perspective in designing biosafe smart antibacterial biomaterials.",

PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries. Consequently, knockout of PPDPF notably accelerated the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in mouse models induced by aging, chemical exposure, and obstruction.

We demonstrate that the metabolism of the paradigmatic medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid leads to a metabolic shift toward the SOG and methionine pathways. PHGDH plays a role in both the forward direction, contributing to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, and the reverse direction, generating the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to epigenomic reprogramming and phenotypic plasticity. The methionine cycle is closely linked to the transsulfuration pathway.

The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN 4–6 GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.",

State-of-the-art metals and doped conjugated polymers used for spin manipulation suffer from fundamental performance and stability issues. We leveraged stereoselective cationic polymerization to design a polymer with a stable persistent radical in each repeat unit that enables the long-range order necessary for spin transport. This approach overcomes conventional requirements for doping in organic spin-pumping devices while showcasing high conductivity, long spin-diffusion lengths, and processability. Molecular-level alterations in polymer stereochemistry were critical for controlling spin-spin interactions and alignment. Stereoregular polymers with persistent neutral radicals represent a previously unidentified class of materials for manipulating spins over long distances for applications in next-generation information storage.",

          "abstract": "Epilepsy, a neurological disorder marked by recurrent, unprovoked seizures, is often linked to dysregulated iron metabolism, resulting in iron overload and subsequent cellular dysfunction or death within epileptogenic regions. We proposed a specific, noninvasive technique using paramagnetic susceptibility imaging via magnetic resonance imaging to quantify in vivo brain iron levels, aiming to enhance our understanding of epilepsy pathology and improve diagnostic accuracy. Our imaging and histopathological studies demonstrated that paramagnetic susceptibility is a sensitive biomarker for iron quantification in epilepsy. This method effectively detects iron abnormality from various causes and highlights that iron alters within epileptogenic zones, indicating the presence of potentially salvageable tissue. Furthermore, iron accumulation was observed to disrupt cortical laminar structures in epileptogenic zones and was associated with the proliferation of central nervous system cells, particularly astrocytes. Paramagnetic susceptibility imaging provides previously unknown insights into epilepsy, offering potential applications in diagnostics, monitoring, and personalized treatment strategies.",

To explore their potential as detectors for ultrabroadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses, we measure the transient optical birefringence the terahertz field induces. Notably, the signal component linear in the FM magnetization agrees excellently with the shape of the incident terahertz electric field at 1 to 13 terahertz and beyond. Analysis indicates that the birefringence arises from the terahertz-field–driven spin accumulation at the FM/HM interface through the spin Rashba-Edelstein effect (SREE). Because of spin-momentum locking, the SREE decays by electron momentum relaxation in &lt;10 femtoseconds, substantially faster than a spin-Hall-effect–induced bulk spin accumulation. Our experiment demonstrates straightforward spintronic sampling of intense ultrabroadband terahertz fields with flat amplitude and phase response. Furthermore, it provides temporal signatures of the SREE and can be viewed as a versatile implementation of interface-specific terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.",

This process has traditionally been explained through the model of long-range Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In this study, we demonstrate a donor-to-acceptor short-range energy transfer (SRET) mechanism in OPV blends with non-fullerene acceptors, extending beyond the Förster approximation. This SRET occurs as a two-step process mediated by interfacial excitations with mixed charge-transfer and local excitation features. We further validate this model through studies on planar heterojunctions, precisely controlling the thickness of interlayers. These findings underscore the short-range interactions in regulating the donor-to-acceptor energy transfer in OPV blends, suggesting that SRET should be considered alongside FRET and charge-transfer processes for device optimizations.",

These hydrogels exhibit mechanical properties comparable with biological tissues, reducing adverse immune responses. The hydrogels can be patterned on elastic substrates using a simple, low-cost micromolding technique to fabricate soft and stretchable implantable devices for electrical stimulation and recording. The hydrogel electrodes show much lower electrochemical impedance and higher charge storage and injection capacity compared to platinum electrodes. In addition, the properties of hydrogels and devices remain stable after long-term storage and exposure to extreme conditions.

Using online measurement methods that impinge particles for OP quantification within seconds, we reveal that 60 to 99% of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and OP in secondary organic aerosol and combustion-generated PM have a lifetime of minutes to hours and that the ROS activity of ambient PM decays substantially before offline analysis. This implies that current offline measurement methods substantially underestimate the true OP of PM. We demonstrate that short-lived OP components activate different toxicity pathways upon direct deposition onto reconstituted human bronchial epithelia. Therefore, we suggest that future air pollution and health studies should include online OP quantification, allowing more accurate assessments of links between OP and health effects.",

While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective, timely and accurate HCV diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The current two-step HCV testing process is costly and time-intensive, often leading to patient loss before treatment. Point-of-care (POC) HCV antigen (Ag) testing offers a promising alternative, but no FDA-approved test meets the required sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed a fully automated, smartphone-based POC HCV Ag assay using platinum nanoparticles, deep learning image processing, and microfluidics.

          "abstract": "The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.",

However, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Craniofacial integument displays dramatic diversity, exemplified by the Polish chicken (PC) with a homeotic transformation of comb-to-crest feathers, caused by a 195–base pair (bp) duplication in HoxC10 intron. Micro-C analyses show that HoxC-containing topologically associating domain (TAD) is normally closed in the scalp but open in the dorsal and tail regions, allowing multiple long-distance contacts. In the PC scalp, the TAD is open, resulting in high HoxC expression. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of the 195-bp duplication reduces crest feather formation, and HoxC misexpression alters feather shapes. The 195-bp sequence is found only in Archelosauria (crocodilians and birds) and not in mammals. These findings suggest that higher-order regulation of the HoxC cluster modulates gene expression, driving the evolution of adaptive integumentary appendages in birds.",

Our analysis indicates a continuous deoxygenation in 83% of the studied lakes. The mean deoxygenation rate in global lakes (−0.049 milligrams per liter per decade) is faster than that observed in the oceans and in rivers. By decreasing solubility, climatic warming contributes 55% of global lake deoxygenation. Meanwhile, heatwaves exert rapid influences on DO decline, resulting in a 7.7% deoxygenation compared to that observed under climatological mean temperatures. By the end of the century, global lake DO is projected to decrease by 0.41 milligrams per liter (4.3%) under SSP2-4.5 and 0.86 milligrams per liter (8.8%) under SSP5-8.5 scenarios.",

By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering.

Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 kelvin and dominates transport properties below 150 kelvin, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB 6 and YbB 12 . At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected.

Traditionally, wavelength multiplexing holography with high-capacity information channel was only achievable through 3D volume holograms using Bragg diffraction. Here, we demonstrate ultranarrow-linewidth wavelength-vortex multiplexing holography in metasurface holograms. By applying elementary dispersion engineering, we develop a sparse k -vector–filtering aperture array in momentum space, enabling sharp wavelength selectivity combined with orbital angular momentum selectivity. Further leveraging transformer neural networks for the design of phase-only holograms, we showcase the reconstruction of up to 118 independent images from a single hologram, achieving a simulated ultranarrow linewidth of 2 nanometers within the visible range. We apply these developed metasurface holograms for holographic visual cryptography, attaining unprecedented security levels with an information rate over 2500 times higher than traditional methods. Our results open exciting avenues for the application of metasurface holograms in various fields, including 3D displays, holographic encryption, and optical artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Synchronization occurs ubiquitously in nature and science. The synchronization regions generally broaden monotonically with the strength of the forcing, thereby featuring a tongue-like shape in parameter space, known as Arnold’s tongue. Such a shape is universal, prevailing in many diverse synchronized systems. Theoretical studies suggest that, under strong external forcing, the shape of the synchronization regions can change substantially and even holes can appear in the solid patterns. However, experimentally accessing these abnormal regimes is quite challenging mainly because many real-world systems displaying synchronization become fragile under strong forcing. Here, we are able to observe these intriguing regimes in a breathing-soliton laser. Two types of abnormal synchronization regions are unveiled, namely, a leaf- and a ray-like shape. High-resolution control of the loss allows holes to be revealed in the synchronization regions. Our work opens the possibility to study intriguing synchronization dynamics using a simple breathing-soliton laser as a test bed.",

To examine this, we use rain and aerosol Hg speciation data and high-resolution surface DMHg measurements, collected on a transect from Alaskan coastal waters to the Bering and Chukchi Seas. We observed a significant fivefold increase in the MeHg:THg fraction in rain and a 10-fold increase for aerosols, closely linked to elevated surface DMHg and the highest DMHg evasion (~9.4 picomoles per square meter per hour) found in upwelling waters near the Aleutian Islands. These data highlight a previously underexplored aspect of MeHg air-sea exchange and its importance to Hg cycling and human health concerns. Our findings emphasize the importance of DMHg evasion by demonstrating that atmospheric MeHg can be transported long distances (~1700 kilometers) in the Arctic, posing risks to human health and ecosystems.",

By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression.

Notably, the material demonstrates remarkable processability, evidenced by the ratio of G ′ max to G ′ min with a temperature differential (Δ T ) of 120°C (which signifies the soft-to-hard transition capability). This ratio reaches 153.3, higher than all reported cross-linked polyurethanes.

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.",

This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.",

While polarimetry allows for in vivo sensing up to 1 mm depth using ultraviolet-visible light, it is limited by dominant light scattering beyond this depth. We propose that photoacoustic sensing in the near-infrared II (NIR-II) window can enable deep tissue sensing as acoustic waves scatter less than light. To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing. PAPEORS holds promise for in vivo sensing and easy miniaturization using single wavelength.",

However, the in vivo metabolic pathways of NMN and NR remain to be elucidated. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the fate of orally and intravenously administered NMN and NR in mice using NAD + metabolomics. We found that only a small portion of orally administered NMN and NR was directly absorbed from the small intestine and that most of them underwent gut microbiota–mediated deamidation and conversion to nicotinic acid (NA). Moreover, intravenously administered NMN and NR were rapidly degraded into nicotinamide and secreted to bile followed by deamidation to NA by gut microbiota. Thus, enterohepatic circulated NA is preferentially used in the liver. These findings showed that NMN and NR are indirectly converted to NAD + via unexpected metabolic pathways.",

Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels.

Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales.

Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.",

          "abstract": "Transfer RNA (tRNA) modifications are crucial for protein synthesis, but their position-specific physiological roles remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the impact of N 4 -acetylcytidine (ac 4 C), a highly conserved tRNA modification catalyzed by the essential acetyltransferase Nat10. By targeting Thumpd1, a nonessential adapter protein required for Nat10-catalyzed tRNA acetylation, we determine that loss of tRNA acetylation leads to reduced levels of tRNA Leu , increased ribosome stalling, and activation of eIF2α phosphorylation. Thumpd1 knockout mice exhibit growth defects and sterility. Concurrent knockout of Thumpd1 and the stress-sensing kinase Gcn2 causes penetrant postnatal lethality in mice, indicating a critical genetic interaction. Our findings demonstrate that a modification restricted to a single position within type II cytosolic tRNAs can regulate ribosome-mediated stress signaling in mammalian organisms, with implications for our understanding of translational control and therapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "Electrorefining of low-grade titanium is one of the strategies for achieving high-purity titanium. However, the presence of nonuniform geometric effects would be induced to impact the nonuniform geometric distribution of overpotential, leading to impurity dissolution and nonuniform Ti deposition. Here, in situ high-temperature characterizations on the molten salt electrorefining process are applied to establish an anodic dissolution principle for quantitatively evaluating nonuniform geometric effects of electrode. For eliminating the nonuniform geometric effects, coaxial anode-cathode configurations are designed to promote the nonuniform anodic dissolution and nonuniform cathodic deposition. Consequently, the geometric uniformity of titanium products on the cathodes is substantially enhanced, and thus, long-term stable electrorefining process (~12 hours, ~330% increment compared to the electrode of reference configuration) and highly purified titanium products (99.2%) are achieved.",

          "abstract": "Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters are promising candidates for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color quality. However, in most cases, noble metal–containing phosphors are required as sensitizers for MR-TADF emitters to improve their electroluminescence (EL) performances, which may lead to high cost and environmental pollution. Herein, an efficient purely organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material, 3,2-PIC-TXT, with fast phosphorescence radiation is developed. It not only exhibits impressive EL performances as an emitter with an outstanding external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33.2%, higher than that of Ir(ppy) 3 (25.2%), but also functions remarkably as a sensitizer for green MR-TADF emitters (BN2, tCzphB-Ph, and tCzphB-Fl). The hyperfluorescence OLEDs using 3,2-PIC-TXT as a sensitizer provide ultrahigh EQEs of 40.9 to 43.8%, superior to those based on an Ir(ppy) 3 sensitizer (37.0 to 38.0%), along with superb color purity and excellent operational stability. These OLEDs are the best devices based on RTP materials reported so far.",

          "abstract": "Optical imaging has long been dominated by traditional lens-based systems that, despite their success, are inherently limited by size, weight, and cost. Lensless imaging seeks to overcome these limitations by replacing lenses with thinner, lighter, and cheaper optical modulators and reconstructing images computationally, while facing trade-offs in image quality, artifacts, and flexibility inherent in traditional static modulation. Here, we propose a lensless imaging method with programmable Fresnel zone aperture (FZA), termed LIP. With a commercial liquid crystal display, we designed an integrated LIP module and demonstrated its capability of high-quality artifact-free reconstruction through dynamic modulation and offset-FZA parallel merging. Compared to static-modulation approaches, LIP achieves a 2.5× resolution enhancement and a 3 decibels improvement in signal-to-noise ratio in “static mode” while maintaining an interaction frame rate of 15 frames per second in “dynamic mode.” Experimental results demonstrate LIP’s potential as a miniaturized platform for versatile advanced imaging tasks like virtual reality and human-computer interaction.",
