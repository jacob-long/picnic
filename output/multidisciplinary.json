          "abstract": "Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8+ T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear1,2. Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR–Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS–STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS–STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8+ T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex essential for uptake of pyruvate into matrix as the primary carbon source for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle1,2. Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC.",

          "abstract": "Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10−3 per base pair per cell division1. As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions2. Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation.",

          "abstract": "Defence from environmental threats is provided by physical barriers that confer mechanical protection and prevent the entry of microorganisms1. If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells2,3. Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build ‘rings’ of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world.",

          "abstract": "Students walk across Columbia University’s campus in New York City.Credit: Luiz C. Ribeiro/New York Daily News/TNS/Alamy\n\nOn Tuesday morning this week, PhD student Daniella Fodera woke up at 7 a.m. to a call from the head of her research laboratory in Columbia University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, delivering devastating news. Her F31 fellowship, a research training grant that provides the majority of her annual income, had been terminated.\n\n“It was traumatic,” Fodera says. “I immediately just broke into tears.”\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\nFodera, who studies fibroids in the uterus — non-cancerous growths that affect 70–80% of women by the age of 50, and can cause severe pain and infertility — is just one of numerous scientists affected by the decision of US President Donald Trump’s administration to cancel US$400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia, located in New York City. Announced on 7 March, the move, Trump’s team said, stemmed from the university’s “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students” and that more cancellations “are expected to follow”.\n\nMost of those affected are researchers and students whose grants and fellowships come from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. The agency announced on Monday that it was terminating more than $250 million in funding — including more than 400 research grants — to Columbia.\n\nSeveral university lab leaders, PhD students and postdocs have expressed concern to Nature about their future in science and their ability to support themselves and their families. Although a complete list of cancelled grants hasn’t been released, Nature’s reporting suggests that early-career scientists receiving NIH training grants such as F30, F31, R25 and T32 fellowships are heavily affected. Sources inside the NIH tell Nature that the lists of cancelled grants come from the agency’s Office of Extramural Research, which is in turn receiving them from the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the US Department of Government Efficiency. Action on the lists is required immediately, often within the hour.\n\nA spokesperson at Columbia told Nature that the university is in the process of reviewing termination notices and “cannot confirm how many grant cancellations have been received from federal agencies since March 7”. Still, she wrote, Columbia “pledges to work with the federal government to restore Columbia’s federal funding”.\n\nLosses for the public\n\nJamie Daw, a lab leader at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, was also taken by surprise when the grant-termination news arrived. Daw, who studies how policies affect the ability of women of reproductive age and pregnant people to access health services, got the e-mail on Monday night.\n\nUS universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts\n\nThe university stated that her grant — which supported around 20 people — had been cancelled with immediate effect, and that she needed to stop her work and notify collaborators both inside and outside Columbia.\n\n“It hurts,” Daw says. “We’re really trying to do work in the public interest — we’re working to improve the US maternal mortality crisis.” (Maternal mortality rates in the United States are high compared with in other high-income nations, particularly among Black women. )\n\nSome postdoctoral fellows at Columbia are protected from losing their positions despite a lack of funding because they are part of a union that has an agreement with the university. It is therefore the responsibility of university staff members such as lab leaders to try to find funding for those postdocs that have their grants terminated, says Sherida de Leeuw, a chair of the union.\n\n“If I did not have that protection, my last pay cheque would have been two weeks ago and I would be out on the streets now,” says Columbia postdoc Gordon Petty, who was notified on Tuesday morning that his T32 training grant to study schizophrenia was cancelled. “It is hard to know what the immediate fallout of this will be, but at this point I believe my academic career is effectively over,” he says.\n\nDemonstrators barricaded themselves in a Columbia University academic building during a pro-Palestinian protest in April 2024.Credit: Alex Kent/Getty\n\nColumbia’s woes have their roots in campus protests that broke out after Israel invaded Gaza following the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas, an Islamist organization designated by some countries as a terrorist group. Twelve hundred people died in the Hamas attacks, and about 250 were taken hostage. Some students at Columbia and other universities across the United States have called Israel’s response disproportionate, pointing to more than 48,000 Palestinians who have died, according to Gaza’s health ministry. But some Jewish students have felt threatened by the protests.\n\nTrump, who has long said that he wants to rid the US education system of “left-wing indoctrination”, wrote on his social-media network Truth Social on 4 March that “All federal funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.”\n\nBy Monday, the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights had sent letters to 60 universities, including Columbia, warning them of potential enforcement actions if they do not “fulfill their obligations to protect Jewish students on campus”.\n\nColumbia, where protests were particularly intense and where New York City police were called in to break up demonstrations, is the first to be affected by the campaign.",

          "title": "Swarms of satellites are harming astronomy. Here’s how researchers are fighting back",
          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "In the next few months, from its perch atop a mountain in Chile, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will begin surveying the cosmos with the largest camera ever built. Every three nights, it will produce a map of the entire southern sky filled with stars, galaxies, asteroids and supernovae — and swarms of bright satellites ruining some of the view.\n\nAstronomers didn’t worry much about satellites photobombing Rubin’s images when they started drawing up plans for the observatory more than two decades ago. But as the space around Earth becomes increasingly congested, researchers are having to find fresh ways to cope — or else lose precious data from Rubin and hundreds of other observatories.\n\nThe number of working satellites has soared in the past five years to around 11,000, mostly because of constellations of orbiters that provide Internet connectivity around the globe (see ‘Satellite surge’). Just one company, SpaceX in Hawthorne, California, has more than 7,000 operational Starlink satellites, all launched since 2019; OneWeb, a space communications company in London, has more than 630 satellites in its constellation. On paper, tens to hundreds of thousands more are planned from a variety of companies and nations, although probably not all of these will be launched1.\n\nSources: Jonathan’s Space Pages (https://go.nature.com/4IV22FD; https://go.nature.com/4225MKX)\n\nSatellites play a crucial part in connecting people, including bringing Internet to remote communities and emergency responders. But the rising number can be a problem for scientists because the satellites interfere with ground-based astronomical observations, by creating bright streaks on images and electromagnetic interference with radio telescopes. The satellite boom also poses other threats, including adding pollution to the atmosphere.\n\nWhen the first Starlinks launched, some astronomers warned of existential threats to their discipline. Now, researchers in astronomy and other fields are working with satellite companies to help quantify and mitigate the impacts on science — and society. “There is growing interest in collaborating and finding solutions together,” says Giuliana Rotola, a space-policy researcher at the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy.\n\nTiming things right\n\nThe first step to reduce satellite interference is knowing when and where a satellite will pass above an observatory. “The aim is to minimize the surprise,” says Mike Peel, an astronomer at Imperial College London.\n\nCleaning up space: how satellites and telescopes can live together\n\nBefore the launch of Starlinks, astronomers had no centralized reference for tracking satellites. Now, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has a virtual Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS), which serves as an information hub and to which researchers, including Peel and Rotola, volunteer their time.\n\nOne of the centre’s tools, called SatChecker, draws on a public database of satellite orbits, fed by information from observers and companies that track objects in space. Astronomers can use SatChecker to confirm what satellite is passing overhead during their observations. The tool isn’t perfect; atmospheric drag and intentional manoeuvring can affect a satellite’s position, and the public database doesn’t always reflect the latest information. For instance, the BlueWalker 3 satellite from telecommunications firm AST SpaceMobile in Midland, Texas, launched in 2022 and was sometimes brighter than most stars; yet uncertainty of its position was so great at times that astronomers had difficulty predicting whether it would be in their field of view for their night-time observations2.\n\nStarlink satellites leave streaks in a 2019 image taken by a 4-metre telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.Credit: CTIO/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/DECam DELVE Survey\n\nTools such as SatChecker help telescope operators to avoid problems by allowing them to target a different part of the sky when a satellite passes overhead or by simply pausing observations as it flies by. It would aid astronomers if SatChecker had even more accurate information about satellite positions, but there are constraints on improving the system. SatChecker data come from the US Space Force, which draws on a global network of sensors that tracks objects in orbit and issues updates on satellite locations as often as several times a day. The frequency of these updates is limited by factors such as how often a sensor can observe an object and whether the sensor can distinguish what it’s looking at.\n\nCurrently, satellite streaks are a relatively minor issue for telescope operators. But the problem will grow as satellite numbers continue to increase drastically, meaning more observation time will be lost, and this issue will be magnified for Rubin.\n\nFixing the streaks\n\nRubin, which cost US$810 million to build, is a unique case because it scans large swathes of the sky frequently — meaning it can detect rapidly changing phenomena such as incoming asteroids or cosmic explosions. Astronomers don’t want to be fooled by passing satellites, as happened in 2017 when researchers spotted what they thought was a γ-ray burst — high-energy flashes of light — from a distant galaxy but turned out to be sunlight reflecting off a piece of space junk.\n\nPrivate spacecraft nails Moon landing: first images of Blue Ghost on the lunar surface\n\nRubin’s powerful camera, coupled with its 8.4-metre telescope, will take about 1,000 nightly exposures of the sky, each about 45 times the area of the full Moon. That’s more wide-field pictures of the sky than any optical observatory has ever taken. Simulations suggest that if satellite numbers in low Earth orbit rise to around 40,000 over the 10 years of Rubin’s survey — a not-impossible forecast — then at least 10% of its images, and the majority of those taken during twilight, will contain a satellite trail3.\n\nSpaceX took early steps to try to mitigate the problem. Working with Rubin astronomers, the company tested changes to the design and positions of Starlinks to try to keep their brightness beneath a target threshold. Amazon, the retail and technology giant based in Seattle, Washington, is also testing mitigations on prototype satellites for its planned Kuiper constellation. Such changes reduce, but don’t eliminate, the problem.\n\nTo limit satellite interference, Rubin astronomers are creating observation schedules to help researchers avoid certain parts of the sky (for example, near the horizon) and at certain times (such as around twilight)4. For when they can’t avoid the satellites, Rubin researchers have incorporated steps into their data-processing pipeline to detect and remove satellite streaks. All these changes mean less time doing science and more time processing data, but they need to be done, astronomers say. “We are really looking forward to getting data from Rubin and seeing how it turns out,” Peel says.\n\nFor other observatories, the IAU CPS is working on tools to help astronomers identify and correct satellite streaks in their data. One is a new database of crowdsourced observations of satellite brightnesses called SCORE, which is currently being beta tested and is planned for wider release in the coming months. This will help scientists to work backwards — they might see something puzzling in their past observations and be able to work it out, Peel says.\n\nThe database “is definitely a very valuable tool” because it’s one of few that have data freely available, says Marco Langbroek, a space-tracking specialist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. As a beta tester, Langbroek has added a number of entries to SCORE, including measurements of a NASA solar sail that changes in brightness as it tumbles through space. Going forwards, he says, SCORE will be most useful if a lot of astronomers contribute high-quality observations to the database, thereby building up a resource over time.\n\nTuning things out\n\nAstronomers who work in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum face extra challenges when it comes to satellites.\n\nSpaceX launch highlights threat to astronomy from ‘megaconstellations’\n\nBig radio telescopes are typically located in remote regions, to be as far as possible from mobile-phone masts and other technological infrastructure that leak radio emissions. But satellites can’t be avoided. “If signals are coming from the sky, they’re always there,” says Federico Di Vruno, an astronomer at the Square Kilometre Array Observatory in Jodrell Bank, UK, and co-director of the IAU CPS.",

          "authors": "Michael Brooks",
          "abstract": "With papers to write, grants to apply for and students to teach, cybersecurity can be a low priority for scientists. Until, that is, it all goes wrong.\n\n“Frankly, this is an awful time for science,” says Noam Ross, executive director of rOpenSci, a non-profit initiative in Berkeley, California, that provides open-source software tools for scientists. He should know. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ross, who is based in Brooklyn, New York, was working for the US non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to identify areas where human activity has increased the risk of disease spillover from animal sources. “EcoHealth became the subject of conspiracy theorists about the origin of COVID,” he says.\n\nThat made the organization — and anyone who worked for it — a target. “It could range from hate mail to death threats,” Ross says. “I had colleagues where some of that stuff was directed at their homes, not just the office.”\n\nAs political divides deepen, such threats are multiplying. In February, many people working for US federal health agencies found themselves ‘doxxed’ — their photograph and work information, as well as records of their political donations, were published on a website called DEI Watchlist. The site was created by the conservative, US non-profit organization American Accountability Foundation, with the purpose of “exposing the unelected career staff driving radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives”.\n\nSo … you’ve been hacked\n\nAriadna Gallo, a political scientist at Argentina’s national scientific and technical research council, CONICET, based in Buenos Aires, was doxxed in 2024 after being filmed at a public protest against cuts to academic funding in the country. A YouTuber featured her in a video and published her personal and academic details, triggering what Gallo calls a “torrent” of attacks in the video’s comments.\n\nAll scientists, regardless of their discipline or location, are potential targets, according to Matt Mitchell, chief executive of the Safety Sync Group in New York, which provides online and real-world advice and resources on security and safety. “This is where we are,” he says. “The problem is bigger than any one president, prime minister or leader of a totalitarian or authoritarian state.”\n\nBut there are things you can do to protect yourself, and resources that can help. Here are five steps to get started.\n\nGet help\n\nYour institution will have privacy policies and digital resources you can tap into, but there are also plenty available online. These include anti-doxxing tips from digital-rights non-profit group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in San Francisco, California; cybersecurity risk-assessment tools from the Ford Foundation’s Grantee Safety Program in New York City; and assorted resources from the US government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nCybersecurity for the travelling scientist\n\nWhatever you do, include your colleagues in the conversation. “This is absolutely vital,” says Thorin Klosowski, a security and privacy activist at the EFF in Los Angeles, California. “If everyone is not on board for the security steps you’re taking, it’s going to be less secure.”\n\nBouncing ideas around with colleagues outside your discipline can expose new problems and ways to fix them, he adds. “You might not think about the risk to a particular data set, or that your laptop might get stolen at a coffee shop, until you start having those conversations.”\n\nFurthermore, it’s always good to know people who will have your back if you start to garner unwanted attention online. “Find a trusted colleague, mentor or loved one that knows what your concerns might be,” says Samuel Mendez, a PhD candidate studying public-health communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who created a digital safety kit for public-health workers. That person can then be “someone you can reach out to for support if you do need help screening messages or documenting interactions at some point”, they add.\n\nScrub your online profile\n\n“An immediate step you can take right now is to search for your own information,” Mendez suggests. That can be as simple as googling yourself in combination with names of former employers, schools, places of residence and so on, to see whether you can find any contact information that you don’t want to be public. “From there, you can manually request removal,” Mendez says. Success might vary, however — whereas residents of the European Union have relatively strong privacy protections, including the right to request that personal data be erased (the ‘right to be forgotten’), that is not true everywhere, including in the United States.\n\nCyberattacks are hitting research institutions — with devastating effects\n\nSome firms will scrape your data from the Internet and sell it on, and you should definitely include these in your scrubbing. “My general recommendation is to make a request to one of the big ones, and just see what you get,” Klosowski says. Companies that scrape such data almost always give you your data set free of charge, he says; then you can decide how much you need to worry.\n\nAlternatively, you can pay for a service that will remove the information for you, such as DeleteMe, Incogni or Kanary. In professions in which doxxing has been a problem, specialist services exist. Doximity’s DocDefender, for instance, will remove details from public sites as part of its package for physicians, who might be at risk from groups such as anti-abortion campaigners.\n\nInstitutions and professional bodies could make this process easier for researchers, says Greg Wilson, a cybersecurity educator in Toronto, Canada. Academic conferences, for instance, could include hour-long ‘bring your own device’ sessions during which people are walked through the process of securing their data and devices. Indeed, Mendez has run social events, such as a ‘digital safety disco’, where this goes on in an informal setting.\n\nPractise good cybersecurity hygiene\n\nThe basics of cybersecurity are straightforward, Klosowski says: use a password manager and two-factor authentication; make sure that no two sites or apps use the same password; and remove apps and delete accounts that you rarely use.",

          "abstract": "Anthony Gagliano (left) and Marie Launay complete the final step of their protocol, preparing a DNA library from material extracted from their fish species of interest.Credit: Denis Roy\n\nOn completing my first day of preparing genetic libraries in July 2024, my team and I were confronted with rubbish bins overflowing with plastic, single-use pipette tips, tubes and gloves. As a PhD student studying fish biology at the Natural Resources Department at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, it was hard to ignore the troubling mismatch between a widespread reliance on single-use plastic and working in a research field focused on conservation.\n\nAlthough data on this issue are scarce, in 2020, researchers at a small, seven-person microbiology laboratory in Edinburgh, UK, churned out a staggering 97 kilograms of biohazardous and plastic waste in just one month1. Plastic is now showing up in some of the most remote parts of the planet; in the Beaufort Sea, a section of the Arctic Ocean to the north of Canada and Alaska, an average of 7,570 microplastic particles were recorded per square kilometre over an 12-day period in 20222. Its impact is widespread, from littering the ocean floor to infiltrating the food web.\n\nTeaming up with Anthony Gagliano, a fellow master’s student dedicated to the conservation of freshwater fish, I embarked on a conservation project studying genetic diversity in different fish populations: the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in my case, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus x L. macrochirus) for Anthony. Although plastic pollution wasn’t the main focus of our research, safeguarding water bodies is essential to our work, and we knew we had to address the disconnect between our values and laboratory practices.\n\nResearchers have raised alarms about excessive plastic use in scientific laboratories in the past. However, few quantifiable data exist on the actual amount of plastic waste generated by common protocols. Filling that gap became our first goal.\n\nQuantifying the issue\n\nBetween June and August 2024, we extracted DNA from 518 fish and used it to produced genetic libraries for our species of interest. A genetic library consists of DNA fragments that have been cut into even smaller pieces, amplified and tagged with special labels, allowing the sequencing device to recognize and read them. By analysing the DNA sequences, we aimed to assess the adaptation potential of populations of different species, to inform conservation policies. The protocol required the use of disposable sterile materials to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nMarie Launay takes a piece of an Arctic Cod's fin ray to use in the DNA extraction process.Credit: Marie Launay\n\nTo quantify the waste produced, we set aside the plastic produced from the first batch of 96 libraries, which included items such as pipette tips, tubes, plates and packaging. Once processed, we found that our first batch had produced 7.57 kg of plastic waste, with library preparation alone accounting for around 3.85 kg.\n\nOur entire project would have produced close to 41 kg of plastic waste if we had continued with our course of action. Using this data as a baseline, it became painfully clear how big the issue was: some large-scale genetic labs process thousands of samples per year, which, if using similar procedures, would generate an astonishing amount of waste.\n\nAwareness to action\n\nSustainable practices can feel overwhelming for researchers because they require extra thought, time and funds to adopt. So, we decided to start small with practical, achievable adjustments.\n\nWe began by reusing consumables and making more-sustainable purchases. For example, we reused pipette tips by autoclaving them to clean them. By purchasing non-loaded tips with minimal packaging, and refilling the boxes ourselves, we reduced our plastic waste by almost 50%. This also saved on costs, because refill bags are more affordable than pre-loaded boxes.\n\nWe also developed a cleaning and decontamination protocol for the shearing tubes used to fragment DNA into smaller pieces for sequencing. Our protocol requires the use of ultraviolet light as well as a specialized cleaning solution to minimize contamination and allows the tubes to be safely reused.",

These words, supposedly whispered by Galileo Galilei at the end of his 1633 trial — held because he supported the Copernican ‘heresy’ that Earth moves around the Sun — have long been a byword for how scientists should behave in the face of ignorance, intolerance and ideological inerrancy. They come to mind now, during the all-out war on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) happening in the United States.\n\nAt the end of his trial, Galileo was made to swear that he did not believe in Earth’s motion. He was confined to house arrest and forbidden to write any more about the movement of the planet. If he had had grant funding and a website, I am sure that the Roman Catholic Church would have suspended the former and scrubbed the latter.\n\nYet, far from acting in courageous defiance, many scientists and administrators now seem to think that the best response to the war on DEI is to keep their heads low and wait out four hard years.\n\nTrump 2.0: an assault on science anywhere is an assault on science everywhere\n\nThe American Society of Microbiology, NASA, the US Department of Defense, the US Department of Transportation and many prominent universities are among those that have been removing references to DEI from their websites, grants, papers, biographies and even histories.\n\nMore scholars must push back. The idea that scientists can keep doing what they know must be done to incorporate DEI into their work while adjusting terms to fit the demands of bigoted autocrats bent on hobbling science is to whistle loudly past a graveyard of avoidable error, continued financial cuts and censorship. That diversity matters to science is a truth — albeit one that has only recently begun to be accepted and applied.\n\nFirst, clinical and social-science research requires diversity to be valid. Genomics has established that different groups of people respond differently to drugs and vaccines. The individuals recruited to and participating in clinical trials must be representative of those who will use those treatments in real life. Attention to DEI allows researchers to identify differences in safety and efficacy between groups early on in the testing process.\n\nLikewise, social scientists are well aware that understanding behaviour and implementing desired change requires studying populations besides white, Western, university psychology students — the group from which psychologists have mainly sourced participants for decades. This is the case whether researchers seek to overcome vaccine hesitancy, prevent self-harm, improve reading skills, change recycling habits or prevent obesity.\n\nTrump’s siege of science: how the first 30 days unfolded and what’s next",

          "abstract": "Some scientists in the United States have told Nature that they are considering leaving the country in the wake of widespread disruption to research brought in by the administration of US President Donald Trump. The researchers say they are looking for opportunities in Europe, Australia and Asia.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has cut thousands of jobs at key public-health and science agencies, frozen biomedical research funding, slashed money to cover research-overhead costs and terminated grants that don’t align with the administration’s priorities. The effects of these changes have been felt by researchers across the United States and abroad.\n\n“I’ve been really, really passionate about my work, but the situation in the US is so stressful,” says a postdoctoral researcher who studies cancer and genomics at a prestigious US institution, and who requested anonymity because she did not have permission to speak to the media. The researcher is from South Asia but has spent the past four years in the United States, and is now talking to colleagues in Europe about opportunities. As someone who is not a US citizen, she is worried about media reports describing the Trump administration’s plans to introduce travel bans affecting specific countries.\n\nAre you a researcher in the United States who is contemplating leaving the country? Are you making plans? We want to hear from you.\n\nMadhukar Pai, a tuberculosis researcher at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, says that US colleagues have been in touch looking for work, or wanting to talk. “The distress is very palpable and sad to see,” he says.\n\nReady to go\n\nA prominent infectious-diseases researcher, who is a dual national of the United States and a European Union member state, intends to move back to Europe in the coming months. This is the first time in the decade and a half since he moved to the United States that he is seriously considering job offers from colleagues across the Atlantic. “There is the case to stay and fight”, but “I have to consider what is the best decision for myself, my family, my lab, my research and my mental health”, says the researcher, who wants to remain anonymous because his plans are not finalized and to protect his team.\n\nHe says his reasons for leaving include the Trump administration’s anti-science rhetoric and leadership changes at major government agencies. He also worries about the future of funding in his field of infectious diseases and virology.\n\nLeaving the United States will require compromises, he says. Salaries in Europe are generally lower than those for researchers with his experience in the United States, and the research environment in Europe can be less interdisciplinary, he says. Funding for science across Europe also remains stagnant. But having the option to leave puts him in an “extremely privileged position”, he adds.\n\nTough job market",

          "abstract": "In Baku last November, parties to the COP29 United Nations climate summit failed to put in place enough climate finance to keep global average warming below the 1.5 °C limit established in the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nHigh-income countries (HICs) agreed only to “take the lead” in directing at least US$300 billion to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) each year by 2035. Their own contributions were left unspecified and could be drawn from a variety of sources. Meanwhile, the Baku agreement calls on “all actors” to scale up this total financing to at least $1.3 trillion annually.\n\nAlthough these headline numbers seem to be broadly similar to those that were proposed by climate-finance experts (including some of us1) before the COP29 meeting, in reality this fudged scattershot approach falls far short of what’s needed — in terms of timing and quality.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nIdeally, climate finance should be given in the form of public grants, or equivalents. That way, recipients don’t need to find money from elsewhere to repay loans, and the finance can be used as ‘catalytic capital’ to attract private finance that can be co-invested in renewables for LMICs. Grants can also be spent on ending the use of fossil fuels early. The broad mix of public and private, bilateral and multilateral sources allowed by COP29 is inefficient. To decarbonize the world in time, climate finance should be provided at full scale this year, instead of being delayed to 2035, specialists say (see go.nature.com/3r5dxfy).\n\nAnother big stumbling block in Baku was the requirement for unanimity among the parties. For example, the Arab Group of negotiators refused to accept any text that targeted specific sectors, including fossil fuels — even though these are the main source of emissions that climate finance is intended to abate.\n\nWithout access to climate finance at scale, LMICs cannot afford to decarbonize. And time is running out. To have even a 50% chance of holding to the Paris agreement’s 1.5 °C limit, the world has a remaining budget of only around 180 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (see go.nature.com/4bv5mme). This is projected to be depleted by 2035 (assuming a linear rate of decline starting from estimated annual emissions of about 40 Gt in 2025) or as soon as 2029 (assuming current emissions levels continue). Exceeding this limit makes crossing planetary tipping points more likely, including collapses of ice sheets, ocean currents, coral reefs and permafrost, threatening the lives and livelihoods of billions of people.\n\nSolar panels in Indonesia. The nation will receive US$20 billion to decarbonize over the next few years under a Just Energy Transition Partnership.Credit: Marc Romanelli/Getty\n\nImmediate action is needed to phase out and replace fossil fuels, as well as to scale up CO2-removal technologies and protect and restore carbon uptake in nature. If these measures are conducted simultaneously and at scale to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and negative emissions thereafter, only then can global warming be limited to a 1.5 °C increase or remain close to it2. This year offers a unique chance to act, because countries are required to update their declared national emissions-reduction contributions to the Paris agreement during 2025.\n\nHere, we call on nations to find an immediate solution. Taking inspiration from the idea of ‘climate clubs’ — agreements among economically self-interested nations to cut emissions through aligned policies — we propose that coalitions of willing HICs form ‘climate finance clubs’ in their own self interests3. These clubs would finance decarbonization in LMICs, sidestepping the need for a global agreement, which inevitably results in a watered-down deal.\n\nBenefits for all\n\nWhy should countries want to pay others to act? It is in their own economic interests to reduce global emissions quickly — and, from the planet’s perspective, it doesn’t matter whether those emissions are emitted domestically or elsewhere.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nFor instance, in the past 6 months, climate-related damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States, floods in Valencia in Spain and wildfires in Los Angeles, California, are estimated to exceed $500 billion. That’s already more than the annual level of climate finance that HICs currently provide (around $100 billion a year) and more than they pledged at COP29 for 2035. Such costs will only escalate until global emissions are curbed.\n\nGroups of HICs must put in place the beginnings of a climate finance framework for LMICs this year. They should offer such countries grants that complement, not offset, their own rapid decarbonization efforts.\n\nTo avoid expensive and socially unacceptable climate impacts, the only thing that matters is that emissions are reduced extremely fast, globally. To be most effective, investments should be given with the highest priority to LMICs that commit in their 2025 Paris update to credible emission reductions — those that are consistent with keeping the world within 1.5 °C of pre-industrial average temperatures. Such countries can make bolder decarbonization pledges that are conditional on receiving climate finance. As recipients decarbonize their economies, they also benefit from lower exposure to domestic climate damages and air pollution, which in turn reduces their adaptation needs.\n\nAn offshore wind farm in Vietnam.Credit: Linh Pham/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThere are already coalitions of HICs willing to provide climate finance — even if the United States does not participate. For example, the European Union, along with other HICs and multilateral development banks, have offered climate finance through Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) to Indonesia ($20 billion) and Vietnam ($15 billion) — of which half was from private sources. Offers were also made to South Africa ($8.5 billion) and Senegal ($2.7 billion). Such deals can be expanded to other LMICs, especially ones that are large emitters, including Colombia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Mexico, Thailand and India, which together would quickly add up to a significant proportion of avoided emissions. But adjustments are needed to avoid shortcomings.\n\nSo far, JETPs have offered mainly loans instead of grants — in Indonesia, for example, only 2% of JETP funds were grants. Yet loans add to LMICs’ debts and don’t provide capital to catalyse private-sector investments in renewables, or give incentives for closing fossil-fuel infrastructures early. Plans to phase out coal in South Africa, for example, have stalled without sufficient grants and a clear strategy, raising concerns over energy security as well as slowing the transition.\n\nThe climate finance club needs to do things differently. First, it should offer larger sums than JETPs do now. It should give all the public funding in grant-equivalent form, and make receipt conditional on a credible implementation plan and on accountability of fossil-fuel phase-out and renewables phase-in.\n\nSolid returns\n\nTo illustrate how a climate finance club might work (focusing on phasing out and replacing fossil fuels), we have examined the economic case for a group of nations that have the financial capacity and the incentive to support LMIC decarbonization. The group excludes the United States but includes the other G7 countries as well as the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, Australia and South Korea (see Supplementary information). We also excluded China and high-income Gulf states as recipients, given their ability to finance their own transition. This reduced climate-finance needs to about $500 billion per year.",

          "abstract": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an activist against vaccination, now oversees the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public-health agencies.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nWith the epicentre of a deadly measles outbreak roughly 120 kilometres away, Katherine Wells is trying to shield her hometown from the highly contagious virus. So far, more than 250 people have fallen ill in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, and infected children who need critical care are often brought to the children’s hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where Wells is the director of public health. Each infected child brings with them the potential to spread the disease to the city’s residents.\n\nAs a result, Wells has been scrambling to expand the city’s vaccine clinics and to print flyers about measles for distribution at medical practices and day-care centres. “It’s measles 24–7,” she says. “I’m trying hard not to wear out our staff yet. This is going to be a long haul.”\n\nIt’s a scene that some US public-health researchers fear could become more common if reduced government support for vaccination leads to a surge in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases that doctors in the country now rarely see, such as measles, pertussis and rubella. An influential anti-vaccine advocate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, now leads the US public-health system, which was already struggling to recoup lost trust and raise vaccination rates after the COVID-19 pandemic. If vaccination rates continue to drop, sporadic infections imported from abroad could spark a sustained domestic wildfire.\n\n“It’s pretty clear: once you back off from supporting vaccination, you’re going to have lower rates of it,” says Lauren Gardner, an engineer who models infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “It is so dangerous.”\n\nViral comeback\n\nMeasles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, but sporadic outbreaks still occur when unvaccinated travellers bring the virus in from abroad. This year’s outbreak has proved deadly: in February, an unvaccinated and otherwise healthy six-year-old in Texas became the first person in a decade to die from measles in the United States. Officials are evaluating another possible measles death in New Mexico.\n\nAt least 95% of a population must be vaccinated against measles to achieve herd immunity, whereby enough of a population is immune that a disease will not spread. In the United States, the level dropped just below that, to 93% during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has yet to recover. Measles is one of the most infectious human diseases, meaning that even a slight dip in vaccine coverage can make a big difference, says Ashley Gromis, a social epidemiologist at the RAND Corporation, a think tank in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPublic-health researchers worry that officials in the administration of US President Donald Trump will dial back vaccination efforts in the country.Credit: Bob Daemmrich/ZUMA Press Wire/Alamy\n\nThe 95% vaccination goal also assumes that unvaccinated individuals are evenly distributed throughout the population, she says. In practice, that is rarely the case. In Texas, about 94% of children entering kindergarten are vaccinated against measles. But in the region where the current outbreak began, only 82% are. “These pockets in which you have lots of susceptible individuals helps disease start circulating,” says Gromis.\n\nSuch numbers mean the United States is now “dangerously close” to losing ‘elimination’ status for measles, says Margaret Doll, an epidemiologist at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in New York. Given that prospect, it is particularly important for public-health officials to promote vaccines, she says. “You would like that message to be supported by our leading health authorities.”\n\nSystem in chaos\n\nYet the opposite seems to be happening. During US President Donald Trump’s first weeks in office, his administration pledged to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization and to drastically cut the US Agency for International Development. Both moves will mean more cases of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases occurring around the world, says Amy Winter, an epidemiologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. “That rise in global cases will put increased pressure on the US vaccination system,” she says.\n\nAnd that system has already been weakened: the Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nation’s main public-health agency, and put a long-time opponent of vaccines in charge of the department that oversees it. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearings that he would not alter current vaccine policy, but in the weeks since he took office on 13 February, the CDC has postponed a meeting of its vaccine advisers, and Kennedy has said that he will investigate the recommended childhood vaccination schedule.\n\nWhat Trump’s election win could mean for AI, climate and health\n\nThe CDC reportedly plans to investigate whether vaccines cause autism — an idea that has been widely discredited. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said: “The rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening.”\n\nKennedy’s response to the Texas measles outbreak also has some public-health experts on edge. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly said that he is not opposed to vaccination. And after initially downplaying the severity of the outbreak during a cabinet meeting, Kennedy issued a statement acknowledging the importance of vaccination in preventing measles.\n\nBut he also emphasized good nutrition and treatment with vitamin A as ways to reduce measles severity. In an interview on 4 March, he praised the benefits of cod liver oil.\n\nThis has fuelled confusion in Texas, where public-health officials are hearing stories of parents giving unvaccinated children vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses, rather than getting them vaccinated. “I personally am very concerned,” says Philip Huang, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas. “These confusing messages are not helpful.” The US DHHS did not respond to a request for comment about Kennedy’s remarks on nutrition and vitamin A, or about worries of future outbreaks of disease.\n\nMixed messaging",

          "abstract": "Science flourishes when data are shared freely, enabling verification, replication and innovation. In climate science, where I work, the stakes of open data sharing are nothing less than the future of our planet. Yet it is precisely in this field that access to fundamental data sets is often withheld or limited by gate-keeping national agencies, which often cite security, privacy or commercial concerns.\n\nThese restrictions have huge consequences. Climate models are a crucial tool for projecting future warming and informing global policies, and must be validated using observational data. The same is true of reanalysis data sets, which combine models and previously gathered data to understand climate patterns. Without access to relevant observational data, these models and analyses can propagate flaws, leading to misguided policies or ineffective mitigation strategies. There is an urgent need to enact policies that ensure all relevant climate data are shared for the benefit of everyone.\n\nUS pulls back from gold-standard scientific climate panel\n\nGood intentions are already there. The World Meteorological Organization has made efforts to support data sharing through initiatives such as Resolution 60 on the free exchange of meteorological information, adopted in 2019, and the 2022 Unified Data Policy, which aims to standardize practices among its 193 member states and territories. Yet progress has been slow, with certain national agencies still reluctant to release their data. However, most of the reasons given are spurious, and many of the proposed barriers can be surmounted.\n\nTake national security. Climate data can involve sensitive sites, such as military bases or ships, but most of the obtained data pose minimal or no security risks. In cases with legitimate concerns, simple measures, including censoring the sites’ coordinates, can deal with such issues effectively.\n\nMost weather stations are on public property, such as state facilities, parks and educational institutions. But where this is not the case, privacy considerations can arise because localized data sets might reveal private landowners or properties. But such challenges are not unique to climate science: fields such as health research encounter them, too, and navigate them using anonymization methods that climate scientists could easily adapt and adopt.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\nWhen commercial confidentiality is cited as a reason for not sharing data sets, it is often because maintaining observational networks and curating the data comes with costs that are usually borne by state-run institutions. Some governments argue that making the data freely available undermines those institutions’ financial viability.\n\nBut these arguments don’t take into account that environmental data gathered using state funding ought eventually to yield benefits to the public, something that is best ensured by the broadest possible access. Free access is also prudent economically: it stimulates innovation in the private sector, enabling businesses and entrepreneurs to develop new technologies, services and applications.",

Credit: NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team (STSCI/AURA)/SPL\n\nAstronomers have announced the discovery of 128 new moons orbiting Saturn, raising questions about why the planet has such a huge number of satellites. Investigating this phenomenon could provide us with crucial knowledge about the evolution of the Solar System.\n\nThe discoveries bring Saturn’s total moon count to 274, nearly triple Jupiter’s and more than the total number of known moons around the other planets.\n\n“Saturn is the king of the moons,” says Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, whose observations provided a starting point for the finding.\n\nThe discovery is “fascinating”, says Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada, who also contributed observations that led to the finding but did not contribute to the forthcoming paper about them. “It just shows how much is out there.”\n\nMany moons\n\nThe moons, which were officially recognized this week by the International Astronomical Union, will be described in a paper led by astronomer Edward Ashton at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taipei, Taiwan. The study will be published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. Unlike our own Moon, which is 3,475 kilometres wide, these small rocks are just a few kilometres across in size. They swing around Saturn in chaotic, distant orbits, often moving in reverse relative to the planet’s major moons, such as Titan and Rhea.\n\nThe moon that made Saturn a pushover\n\nMost of the moons are new discoveries, but observations by Sheppard two decades ago hinted at their existence. From 2004 to 2007, he used the 8.2-metre Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii to examine patches of space near Saturn and detected faint light from these small, irregular moons. However, many couldn’t be confirmed as moons because their orbits could not be definitively tracked.\n\nAshton was able to revisit those findings thanks to advancements in discovery techniques and the allocation of more telescope time. From 2019 to 2021, using the 3.6-metre Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Ashton confirmed 62 new moons of Saturn by stitching together the telescope’s images to more easily see the faint moons. In 2023, he had more time on the telescope, leading to the latest 128-moon haul.\n\nSaturn’s movements also helped: from our perspective on Earth, the planet has moved out of alignment with the dense star field near the centre of the Milky Way, reducing the number of background stars in our line of sight that could masquerade as moons.\n\nClusters of satellites",

          "abstract": "A Climate of Truth: Why We Need It and How To Get It Mike Berners-Lee Cambridge Univ. Press (2025)\n\nI had the privilege of hearing climate scientist Mike Berners-Lee talk about his latest book before it was published. To a packed lecture theatre, he laid out his thesis: an increase in truthfulness is more important than technological advances as a solution to climate change and the related threats facing humanity.\n\nI could not stop thinking about this proposition. Was it really that simple, or was the author being unforgivably naive? What would the book have to say about the strange times we currently live in, variously described as post-truth1 and the age of misinformation2? I went out of my way to get my hands on an advance copy — it was a compelling read.\n\nHow scientists can drive climate action: celebrate nature and promote hope\n\nThe first chapter lays out a clear-eyed and data-rich description of the polycrisis we find ourselves in. Berners-Lee takes us through the interlinked issues of climate, energy, population, food, biodiversity, pollution and disease. He sugar-coats nothing.\n\nThe book firmly pushes back on those who argue that we are making progress on climate change. It presents what science tells us we can expect with the temperature rises that are already baked in: collapsing crop yields, worsening fires and more floods. With emissions continuing to increase year on year, we are still accelerating into the problem rather than putting on the brakes.\n\nTechnology isn’t enough\n\nHow can this view of climate change be reconciled with the techno-optimist view that innovation is delivering sustained improvements for most people on our shared planet, and will solve our environmental problems, too?\n\nBerners-Lee refers to techno-optimism as “the new face of climate denial”. He argues that, although we have the technical advances needed to tackle the polycrisis, these alone will never be enough. A good example is how efficiency gains tend to increase, rather than reduce, consumption. This well-understood ‘rebound effect’ is also known as Jevons paradox, after a nineteenth-century industrialist who noticed that more-efficient use of coal led to increased demand. A green transition requires that renewable energy replace fossil fuels rather than supplementing them. This is not happening.\n\nWildfires are expected to increase in severity and frequency owing to climate change.Credit: Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty\n\nDespite Berners-Lee’s rhetoric, he shares a lot of ground with data scientist Hannah Ritchie, whose excellent book Not the End of the World (2024) takes a techno-optimist position. They both think that a sufficiently high global carbon price is crucial for incentivizing a reduction in fossil-fuel use. And they both agree that we need a mechanism, such as cap and trade, to ensure that the poorest are not disadvantaged. Berners-Lee puts more emphasis on how to get there.\n\nHigh price of deceit\n\nHis book peels back the outer layer of the polycrisis to discuss the drastic changes needed in equality, education, the media, politics, the economy and law. The argument is that living well in the Anthropocene — in which the physical limits to growth are undeniable — demands drastic changes to how society operates, but that the decisions needed will be made only if voters’ understanding isn’t obscured by deceit.\n\nThis brings us to the core of the polycrisis. Berners-Lee highlights three intersecting values needed for humanity to thrive in the Anthropocene: respect for the environment, respect for others and respect for the truth. The final few chapters focus on the most crucial lever: truth.\n\nHow to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics\n\nThe book presents a typology of deception. Outright lies are just the tip of the iceberg, with more-hidden forms such as misdirection, burying bad news and false impressions potentially doing just as much damage. He talks about how “enticing bullshit” propagates: sometimes owing to self-interested cynicism, but often owing to simply to wishful or uncritical thinking.",

          "abstract": "Chetan Nayak leads Microsoft’s quantum computing effort.Credit: John Brecher for Microsoft\n\nAnaheim, California\n\nA Microsoft researcher today presented results behind the company’s controversial claim last month to have created the first ‘topological’ qubits — a long-sought goal of quantum computing.\n\nInside Microsoft’s quest for a topological quantum computer\n\nIn front of a packed room at a meeting of the American Physical Society (APS), Chetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsoft’s quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, explained how the company is developing topological qubits, which would be the building blocks for a noise-resistant quantum computer.\n\nPhysicists in the audience told Nature’s news team they are still unsure whether Microsoft really has made the first topological qubits, however. “It’s a hard problem,” says Ali Yazdani, an experimental physicist at Princeton University in New Jersey. To anyone trying to make topological qubits, he says, “good luck”.\n\n“It was a beautiful talk,” says Daniel Loss, a theorist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. But he took issue with the strong claims and relative lack of evidence. “People have gone overboard, and the community is not happy. They overdid it,” he says.\n\nNayak acknowledges the criticism: “I never felt like there would be one moment when everyone is fully convinced,” he says, adding that Microsoft is confident in its understanding of the devices, and that other researchers are excited by the work.\n\nQubit cliffhanger\n\nThe standing-room-only APS talk was hotly anticipated in physics circles. Microsoft announced that it had created the first topological qubits on 19 February in a press release. But some physicists were unsure whether the claim would hold because there was no peer-reviewed scientific paper to back it up. (Microsoft published a paper in Nature at the same time as its initial announcement, but the paper described a way to take a read-out from future topological qubits rather than proving their existence1).\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nTwo weeks later, physicist Henry Legg of the University of St Andrews, UK, cast further doubt on Microsoft’s claim when he posted a report on the preprint server arXiv, ahead of peer review, that pokes holes in a test that the company uses to verify its quantum-computing devices2. Legg presented these findings at the APS conference on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, in today’s talk, Nayak displayed a schematic for Microsoft’s qubits: they are microscopic, H-shaped aluminium wires on top of indium arsenide, which is a superconductor at ultracold temperatures. The devices are designed to harness Majoranas, previously undiscovered ‘quasiparticles’ that are essential for topological qubits to work. The goal is for the Majoranas to appear at the four tips of the H-shaped wire, emerging from the collective behavior of electrons. These Majoranas, in theory, could be used to perform quantum computations that are resistant to information loss.\n\nThe new data that Nayak presented were primarily of ‘X’ and ‘Z’ measurements of the qubits, which are vertical and horizontal probes along the H-shaped wire. When Nayak showed data for the X measurement, he acknowledged that the characteristic bimodal signal was hard to see by eye because of electrical noise.\n\nEun-Ah Kim, a theorist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, therefore questioned the robustness of the X measurement. “I’d like to see the bimodality be easily visible in future experiments,” she told Nature’s news team.",

          "title": "I spent two years organizing an international conference. How do I get compensated for my work?",
          "authors": "Nikki Forrester",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI’m a scientist based in the United Kingdom. A few years ago, I was verbally encouraged to organize an international conference by staff at a university. At the time, I wasn’t employed at the university or elsewhere in a full-time position, but I’d like to work there in the future. I agreed to the request because the staff suggested it would raise their group’s profile and also help to set me apart in future job applications. I asked repeatedly to be compensated for my conference efforts, and had to wait a long time for the institution’s ambiguous responses. I also could not easily pull out of my commitment to host the event, because it would have negatively affected the attendees and required me to pay a significant cancellation fee.\n\nMy request for compensation was eventually declined, but only after I had delivered the conference. I calculate my efforts to be the equivalent of nearly two years of full-time work. I feel embarrassed, pained and stuck. How can an institution be made to pay? And how can I prevent this situation from happening again? — A distressed scientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s Careers team reached out to two researchers and an employment lawyer for advice.\n\n“This story has all the hallmarks of uncompensated labour done by faculty” members, says Hava Rachel Gordon, a sociologist at the University of Denver in Colorado. “It happens all the time, whether they belong to an institution or are doing work for another institution.”\n\nGordon notes that academics often view themselves as passionate scholars, scientists and teachers. “We don’t often think of ourselves as workers,” she says. “And the problem is, then we are easily taken advantage of.”\n\nAll the sources noted that one of the challenges of working in academia is defining what the job itself entails. Along with research, teaching and service, many faculty members engage in mentorship, public outreach, administrative work and other tasks. Some of this work is paid, but compensation for other labour, such as reviewing grant proposals or giving conference presentations, might take the form of increased stature in the field or enhanced job prospects.\n\nHowever, there is also uncompensated or invisible labour, which is neither rewarded nor recognized in merit reviews1.\n\nStudies have found that women and faculty members of colour spend more time on campus service, diversity-related service, student advising and teaching than do their male and white peers, and this can delay career progression by taking time away from research2,3.\n\nThe time tax put on scientists of colour\n\n“A lot of these requests are done informally without contracts, sometimes without even a paper trail. We call it a hallway ask,” says Gordon, referring to a 2018 article by KerryAnn O’Meara, a higher-education researcher at Columbia University in New York City, describing how the most agreeable and productive faculty members are often stopped in corridors and asked to take on various service tasks.\n\nGordon emphasizes that she understands why the distressed scientist agreed to organize this conference, but notes that it’s difficult to demand payment without a contract in place.\n\n“I think the real problem here is that the parties didn’t make an arrangement ahead of time,” says David Belfort, founding partner of the employment-law firm Bennett & Belfort in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The scientist needs to put their foot down and tell the institution that they’re willing to do the work, but that it needs to be compensated, because they can’t work for free for two years with the expectation that they’re going to get a job offer out of it.”\n\nBelfort acknowledges that the situation is tricky, given that conference organizing is often voluntary, ancillary work conducted by individuals who are paid, full-time employees at universities. “The odd thing here is that if they had received an offer of a position at this institution, they likely would be content. However, there is no quid pro quo — the institution is not required to offer any role going forward — but they may be entitled to back pay for their work.” For instance, if the distressed scientist had carried out this work in certain US jurisdictions, Belfort says, they could claim a violation of state-minimum-wage laws.",

Ornithologists at Tel Aviv University in Israel have continued to meet online with their counterparts in Jordan, the Palestinian territories and European countries to study the potential for barn owls (Tyto alba) to reduce pesticide use in agriculture.\n\nThe project enlists the owls to devour crop-eating rodents instead of relying on farmers using toxic rodenticides to control populations. In January, shortly after a ceasefire was signed between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, researchers from 13 countries gathered in Greece. Their mission was both to discuss how to expand the use of barn owls for biological control and to promote the project as an example of research collaboration to promote peaceful coexistence.\n\nThe ceasefire’s first 42-day phase ended officially on 1 March. Talks between various parties have resumed in Doha, Qatar, but huge uncertainty hovers over what will happen next, including whether the ceasefire will endure. Despite opposition from many countries, Israel’s government is currently blocking food and fuel from entering Gaza. It has also stopped supplying electricity to Gaza’s main desalination plant, aiming to pressure Hamas into extending the ceasefire’s first phase.\n\nOrnithologist Yossi Leshem of Tel Aviv University says he is committed to pursuing collaborations.Credit: Menaham Kahana/AFP/Getty\n\n“I’m not naive,” says Yossi Leshem, the project’s founder and an ornithologist at Tel Aviv University. “The ceasefire is very fragile. I hope [it] will continue permanently, but the situation is still very sensitive.”\n\nLeshem and other Israeli scientists tell Nature that they are committed to continuing their research and pursuing collaborations. Among them is David Lehrer, director of the Center for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, based in Ketura in the south of Israel.\n\nLehrer is coordinating an effort with the Palestinian non-profit organization Damour for Community Development, which has offices in both Gaza and the West Bank. In January, 60 Palestinian, Jordanian and Israeli experts met in Athens to discuss how to solve the Middle East’s water, energy, food-security and overall environmental problems. Last week, the group announced further studies into seven project ideas. One is to create an artificial structure from the rubble of destroyed buildings. The structure would house solar energy or water desalination infrastructure.\n\n“Seventy per cent of the buildings in Gaza and almost all infrastructure has been destroyed due to the war,” Lehrer says. As of now, “the rubble constitutes a major environmental and humanitarian threat, due to chemicals released as buildings were destroyed and the large amount of unexploded ordinance mixed in with the rubble”, he adds.\n\nAny project to reconstitute it “will require major coordination between Israel and Palestine and can only be achieved if all sides, including the international community, are fully on board”.\n\nCoexistence amid boycotts\n\nAfter the 7 October 2023 Hamas terror attacks on Israel, the country conducted intense, deadly air strikes on Gaza’s populated areas for 15 months. For most of that time Israel was also at war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nSome universities in Europe have suspended institution-level ties with universities in Israel. For example, the Council of Rectors of French-speaking universities of Belgium, said in a statement in January that it commits to suspending institutional collaborations with organizations, regardless of their origin, that repeatedly support or are directly involved in violations of international law and human rights.\n\n“People in the Middle East have common issues,” says Mouna Maroun, rector of the University of Haifa in Israel.Credit: Medhat Zioud\n\nIn an open letter published last May, some 185 researchers and university administrators from Gaza wrote: “We extend our heartfelt appreciation to the national and international institutions that have stood in solidarity with us, providing support and assistance during these challenging times. However, we stress the importance of coordinating these efforts to effectively reopen Palestinian universities in Gaza.”\n\nNeurobiologist Mouna Maroun, rector of the University of Haifa in Israel, opposes boycotts of Israel’s universities. “Academia is an opportunity to share knowledge and do research in complete freedom,” says Maroun who is an Arab–Israeli citizen. “People in the Middle East have common issues, more than factors that can differentiate and discriminate between us.”\n\nTamir Sheafer, rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, agrees. “Israeli academia is independent of the government,” he says. “At the Hebrew University, 20% of our students are Arab–Palestinian, including thousands of students from East Jerusalem. We maintained our coexistence here on campus during the whole war.”\n\nIn February, Israel’s Association of University Heads issued a report that recorded almost 500 complaints by Israeli researchers of boycotts by overseas institutions and professional academic associations. Researchers reported rejection of papers, disruption to lectures, avoidance of peer review, difficulties in obtaining funding and “a demand from Israelis to declare anti-Israeli intentions as a condition for continued participation in a conference”.\n\nSome international academics are refusing peer-review requests from Israeli researchers because of the war, according to the Israel Science Foundation (ISF), the country’s main research-funding agency, although such refusals are relatively uncommon, says Tamar Jaffe-Mittwoch, the director-general of the ISF, based in Jerusalem.\n\nThese Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty\n\nIn 2024, the ISF approached around 22,000 mostly international researchers for 6,600 grant-reviewer positions. “We were very concerned,” says physicist Daniel Zajfman, who chairs the ISF’s academic board. “We thought, ‘no one wants to look at Israeli science’,” he adds. Of these, around 170 potential reviewers declined to review applications, explicitly citing political reasons — some doing so politely, says Zajfman, and some not so politely, says Jaffe-Mittwoch.\n\nScholarship goes on\n\nAlthough military service in Israel is compulsory for most adult citizens, the war has not reduced the country’s scientific output, according to ISF data. In 2024, grant applications increased by 10% from the roughly 2,500 applications received annually in previous years. Zajfman thinks that this increase can partly be attributed to the determination of scientists to continue with their scholarship. “The feeling is we cannot allow these events, this war, to affect what we are doing now,” he says.\n\nResearchers in these regions hope that collaborative efforts will continue.Credit: Christophe Gateau/dpa/Alamy",

The fossil record has long been explored for hard materials, such as shells, bones and teeth, to assess tissue morphology.

The end product was a bioplastic called poly(ester amide), or PEA, that consisted mainly of polyester with a few nylon-like amide bonds.\n\nNylon is a 100% amide-bond containing polymer, so there is still some way to go before bacteria can properly mimic this type of plastic, says Yup Lee.\n\nTesting revealed that one type of PEA had physical, thermal and mechanical properties comparable to those of polyethylene, one of the most widely used commercial plastics.\n\nBut Seiichi Taguchi, a bioproduction engineer at Kobe University in Japan, says it is unlikely that the plastic would be as strong as polyethylene, because of the low frequency at which the amino acids were incorporated into the polymers. And adding an amino acid to a polymer often leads to the termination of the chain, creating stunted polymers with low molecular weights, he says.\n\nCommercial potential?",

          "title": "Space debris is falling from the skies. We need to tackle this growing danger",
          "authors": "Richard O. Ocaya, Thembinkosi D. Malevu",
          "abstract": "At 3 p.m. on 30 December last year, residents of Mukuku village in Makueni county, Kenya, were startled by a loud crash. In the middle of a field lay a mysterious, smouldering metal ring, 2.5 metres across and weighing nearly 500 kilograms. Elsewhere, in western Uganda in May 2023, villagers reported seeing streaks of fire in the sky before debris rained down, scattering wreckage across a 40-kilometre-wide area.\n\nThese were no ordinary meteorites — they were remnants of a defunct satellite and spent rocket stage, returning to Earth without warning.\n\nThe quest to conquer Earth’s space junk problem\n\nThese events are not isolated. Across the world, from Texas to Saudi Arabia, from Cape Town to the Amazon rainforest, objects launched into low Earth orbit (LEO) are now falling back to Earth. Some burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, but others — especially those made of titanium and heat-resistant space-age alloys — survive re-entry and slam into the ground, sometimes in populated areas.\n\nThe problem is getting worse. With the rapid expansion of commercial space flight, thousands of satellites are being launched each year. Yet few owners have plans to remove them from orbit in a controlled way.\n\nEveryone, everywhere — on Earth’s surface, flying in aeroplanes, as well as in space — is increasingly at risk from these projectiles1.\n\nSpace-faring nations and companies must urgently address this threat. The uncontrolled re-entry of space debris is not just a nuisance — it is a legal, environmental and potentially catastrophic problem. Without fresh policies and mitigation strategies, it is only a matter of time before one of these incidents leads to a loss of life.\n\nA growing problem above\n\nLow Earth orbit, the region of space stretching from 160 km to 2,000 km above Earth’s surface, is the most congested orbital zone. It is home to imaging satellites, weather and communications constellations and space stations such as the International Space Station (ISS).\n\nIt is also the most debris-laden part of space, harbouring more than 6,000 tonnes of human-made objects. The World Economic Forum predicts that by 2030, more than 60,000 satellites will have been launched, the majority of which are destined to become debris2,3.\n\nFour steps to global management of space traffic\n\nMost satellite re-entries are uncontrolled. Some space agencies deliberately steer defunct satellites into the ocean. However, many operators simply leave them to decay naturally, with no certainty about where they will land. Any location on Earth could be in the firing line.\n\nAs objects in LEO experience atmospheric drag, they gradually slow down and spiral back to Earth. Smaller fragments burn up during re-entry, but larger pieces — rocket stages, fuel tanks and satellite components — often survive, crashing to Earth at speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second. The energy released by their impacts can be equivalent to that of a small missile4. The higher the re-entry speed, the further debris can spread.\n\nPredicting crash sites is extremely difficult. When an object falls from space, its path to Earth isn’t a straight line or even smooth. Predicting where it will land involves complex calculations and many factors, including Earth’s rotation, gravity, winds and the object’s initial speed and altitude5. Mathematical models, such as NASA’s Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool and simplified general perturbations models, can be used to estimate the track of decaying orbital debris.\n\nA large piece of debris from a spacecraft was found in Salinópolis, Brazil, in April 2014.Credit: Tasso Sarraf/AFP/Getty\n\nHistory has repeatedly shown that crises are often ignored until they escalate into disasters. Space debris is no exception, and failing to address it urgently could have catastrophic consequences. Imagine a large satellite, weighing several tonnes, re-entering Earth’s atmosphere without warning. Unlike the controlled descent of the Mir space station in 2001, this object might well veer off course and crash into a city. The devastation would be catastrophic, bringing legal, political and financial chaos.\n\nThe risks extend beyond ground impacts. A major — and rarely discussed — concern is a potential collision between a falling piece of debris and commercial aircraft. At any given time, more than 10,000 aeroplanes are in the air worldwide. The uncontrolled descent of a dense, high-velocity object through busy air corridors could lead to a mid-air disaster. Currently, there are no global protocols to warn pilots or airlines about incoming space debris. In 2022, US airspace was briefly shut down because of an uncontrolled rocket body re-entry. Although such closures are rare, increasing global space activity makes similar incidents more likely, underscoring the need for stricter regulations on debris mitigation and controlled re-entries to prevent future disruptions and safety hazards.\n\nCascading collision threats\n\nBeyond the immediate threat of falling debris, there’s a looming danger known as Kessler Syndrome2. Proposed by NASA scientist Donald Kessler in 1978, this scenario predicts a point at which the density of objects in LEO becomes so high that collisions between them generate more debris, leading to a cascade of further collisions.\n\nThis self-perpetuating cycle could render certain orbital regions unusable, posing risks to satellites, space missions and the ISS. As of 2021, there were more than 4,000 active satellites in orbit, with estimates of 600,000 pieces of space junk ranging from 1–10 centimetres in size6. On average, one satellite is destroyed each year when it collides with another satellite or piece of debris.\n\nWorld’s first wooden satellite could herald era of greener space exploration\n\nThe growing amount of space debris is no longer a distant or hypothetical threat; it is an immediate danger. European Space Agency (ESA) estimates show that, as of February this year, more than 36,000 objects larger than 10 cm are currently being tracked in Earth’s orbit and more than one million objects between 1 cm and 10 cm are orbiting the planet. Even tiny fragments — many too small to be detected by current tracking systems — can cause huge amounts of damage owing to the sheer velocity at which they travel. The ISS relies on ballistic panels for protection, but shielding alone is not enough. The station’s crew must remain vigilant; spacewalking astronauts are especially vulnerable.\n\nThe escalating situation underscores the crucial need for space-traffic management and collision-avoidance strategies to ensure the long-term viability of space exploration and utilization. As orbital congestion worsens, the need for robust tracking, accountability and mitigation strategies becomes undeniable.\n\nFurthermore, sunlight reflected from and the burning up of orbital debris contribute to light pollution, increasingly interfering with views of the night sky from ground-based scientific observatories. For instance, bright trails from SpaceX’s satellite constellations, although not classified as active debris, are hard to miss as they move across the night sky. In January, astronomers mistook a Tesla Roadster, an electric sports car that was launched by SpaceX in 2018 as a stunt, for an asteroid that could potentially threaten Earth. Having to devote global resources to track such an object is wasteful.\n\nThe legal black hole",

          "abstract": "Pictured (left to right) Rafiou Agoro, Justin Hounkpevi, Tchilabalo Parobali, Dzifa AhiatrogahCredit: Rafiou Agoro\n\nIn April 2018, during my second year of a postdoctoral fellowship at New York University, I and my colleagues submitted an abstract to the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), which was holding its annual meeting that September in Montreal, Canada.\n\nAs a citizen of Togo with limited experience of international conference travel, I saw the chance to attend this three-day meeting as an important career-development opportunity, enabling me to share scientific discoveries, learn from others and get updates on emerging technologies.\n\nBut unlike my colleagues from Europe, and despite us all having similar professional titles and immigration statuses in the United States, I needed a Canadian visa to attend. That’s because documentation requirements were more stringent for citizens of African countries than for applicants from elsewhere.\n\nI identified a private company that provided visa services for the Canadian government, and six weeks before the conference I took a half-day’s leave to attend an appointment and paid Can$185 (then the equivalent of about US$140) to secure a passport stamp. A month later, I was given a second appointment, during which I received my passport and visa. The delay meant that registration, hotel reservations and airfares had increased in price.\n\nHow African scientists can give back to their home continent\n\nBecause most of the international meetings that welcome scientists from all over the world are held in the United States and Europe, scientists based outside these territories can find attendance particularly challenging, often requiring — as it did for me — months of paperwork to prepare.\n\nThis is especially the case for PhD students in Africa who have never travelled overseas before for work.\n\nWith this in mind, and informed by my own experiences, I partnered with Mohamed Cisse, a mathematician and computer scientist based in Guinea, to launch a travel-fellowship and mentoring programme. (Mohamed and I had already worked together to found the African Diaspora Scientists Federation (ADSF), a network of scientists who have developed their careers outside the continent.)\n\nWe approached the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) in 2023 with the aim of helping an interdisciplinary group of students to attend the following year’s Cell Bio meeting, an annual event held jointly with the European Molecular Biology Organization.\n\nWe wanted to create an ADSF–ASCB fellowship programme that would enable PhD students based in Africa to present their research in-person at the four-day Cell Bio meeting in San Diego, California, in December 2024.\n\nCareer resources for African scientists\n\nWe launched the call for fellowship applications in May and received more than 50 applications in a month, choosing four applicants for the pilot programme.\n\nThey were Tchilabalo Parobali, a biosecurity engineer at the University of Lomé in Togo; poultry scientist Justin Hounkpevi, also based there; Dzifa Ahiatrogah, a biomedical scientist at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana; and Gerard Quarcoo, an aquatic microbiologist at the Water Research Institute in Tamale, Ghana.\n\nIn June, we sent letters of invitation and all the paperwork for visa applications. It then took around four months before the applicants had their visa appointments at the US embassies in their countries.\n\nSadly, Gerard’s application was unsuccessful. But by mid-November, we were able to buy plane tickets for the other three. Because travel was the following month, the $1,200 round-trip ticket was twice as expensive as it would have been if purchased months in advance. The fellowship also covered hotel charges, the cost of airport–hotel transfers and ACSB membership for 2025.\n\nCamaraderie\n\nTo create a climate of pre-meeting camaraderie, the three fellows travelled together from Accra to the US west coast, a two-day journey with stopovers in Europe and the US east coast. I was in touch throughout their travels and met them before their poster sessions to offer advice, in between my own conference preparation and attendance at sessions.\n\nI loved the practical aspects of their science, which I categorize as applied biology. Tchilabalo’s work, for example, uses a new dietary formula to increase poultry mass, which has societal benefits.\n\nListening to the three students reminded me of the importance of asking myself about the translational aspect of my own fundamental research, in which I use preclinical mouse models to pinpoint molecular mechanisms that improve the healthspan and lifespan of people with sickle-cell and kidney diseases.\n\nI met the students each day for breakfast and lunch, using the time to review their plans for the day and provide advice if needed. We also took some evening walks together, and the fellows attended two receptions at which they networked with other scientists.",

The device is used as a stopgap for people with heart failure who are waiting for a donor heart, and previous recipients of this type of artificial heart had remained in US hospitals while it was in place.\n\nThe man lived with the device for more than three months until he underwent surgery to receive a donated human heart. The man is recovering well, according to a statement from St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney in Australia, where the operations were conducted.\n\nThe Australian is the sixth person globally to receive the device, known as BiVACOR, but the first to live with it for more than a month.\n\n“This is certainly an important development in the field,” says Julian Smith, a cardiac surgeon at the Victorian Heart Institute at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n“It is incredibly innovative,” says Sarah Aitken, a vascular surgeon at the University of Sydney, but she adds that there are still many unanswered questions about the level of function that people with it can achieve and the ultimate cost of the device. “This kind of research is really challenging to do because it is very expensive” and the surgery involved is very high-risk, says Aitken.\n\nThe latest success will help researchers to understand how people cope with this device in the real world, says Joseph Rogers, a heart-failure cardiologist and president of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. “They weren’t being constantly monitored by medical teams,” says Rogers, who led the first trial of the device in the United States last year.\n\nIn all cases, the BiVACOR was used as a temporary measure until a donor heart became available. Some cardiologists say that it could become a permanent option for people not eligible for transplants because of their age or other health conditions, although the idea still needs to be tested in trials. In the United States, close to 7 million adults live with heart failure, but only about 4,500 heart transplants were performed in 2023, in part because of a shortage of donors.\n\nSuspended rotor\n\nBiVACOR was invented by biomedical engineer Daniel Timms, who founded a company named after the device, with offices in Huntington Beach, California, and Southport, Australia.\n\nThe device is a total heart replacement and works as a continuous pump in which a magnetically suspended rotor propels blood in regular pulses throughout the body. A cord tunnelled under the skin connects the device to an external, portable controller that runs on batteries by day and can be plugged into the mains at night.\n\nMany mechanical heart devices support the left side of the heart, and typically work by pooling blood in a sack, which flexes some 35 million times a year to pump blood. But these devices have many parts and often fail. BiVACOR, which only has one moving part, will in theory experience fewer problems of mechanical wear, says Rogers.\n\nUS trials",

Horálek\n\nA massive green hydrogen plant proposed for construction in Chile could increase light pollution at one of the world’s most powerful telescopes by at least one-third, says the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the consortium that operates the telescope and will either host or operate others being built nearby.\n\nAn ESO analysis released on Monday found that light pollution would increase by at least 35% at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) ― one of the most advanced optical telescopes in the world ― and by at least 55% at the southern array of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), which is now under construction and will be the largest ground-based observatory for very-high-energy γ-ray astronomy. The analysis also found that the green-energy project would increase atmospheric turbulence at the telescopes and cause vibrations that will damage the sensitive equipment.\n\nTogether, the effects will cause “devastating, irreversible” damage that cannot be mitigated, astronomer Itziar de Gregorio-Monsalvo, the ESO’s representative in Chile, said at a media briefing on Monday. “It will reach a point where it is highly likely that we won’t be able to operate these telescopes.”\n\nBefore the analysis was released, the developer of the green-energy plant, AES Andes in Santiago, said that its project “aims to use the best technologies and the strictest standards”, and that a company analysis found that the project will not have a “significant impact” at the observatories. On Monday, the company said in a statement: “We are still working on gathering data from the ESO document to understand the discrepancies between ESO’s numbers and our own analysis.”\n\nPerfect conditions\n\nThe green-energy project would span 3,000 hectares in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the driest on Earth. The arid climate and lack of cloud cover there create ideal conditions for stargazing. The region also has extremely dark skies: a 2023 study1 compared levels of light pollution at the 28 leading astronomical observatories worldwide and found that the Paranal Observatory, site of the VLT, had the darkest location of them all, followed by the nearby Armazones Observatory, where the ESO is building the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which the organization says “will be the largest visible and infrared light telescope in the world”.\n\nLasers pierce the stunning dark skies of the Atacama Desert\n\nThe Atacama’s dark skies and other qualities lured organizations to build cutting-edge instruments such as the VLT, the ELT and the southern array of the CTAO. “The darker the sky, the fainter the astronomical object that can be examined,” notes a summary of the ESO’s report on the green-energy project.\n\nThe conditions in the Atacama also lured energy company AES Andes, a subsidiary of the AES Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. The company has proposed using the region’s intense sunshine and strong winds to generate solar and wind power. These would provide energy for the extraction of hydrogen from water, which could be collected from the nearby Pacific Ocean. Hydrogen made with renewable energy is often called green hydrogen.\n\nAES has proposed building a green-hydrogen complex that would include a port, ammonia and hydrogen production plants and thousands of electricity generators. The project’s main unit would be located 11 kilometres from Paranal Observatory, 5 km from the CTAO and 20 km from the ELT.\n\nDuelling numbers\n\nThe ESO’s latest analysis was conducted by Martin Aubé at the Center for Research in Astrophysics of Quebec in Sherbrooke, Canada, who studies light pollution at astronomical facilities, and other researchers led by ESO director of operations Andreas Kaufer. It is based on information in the environmental-impact report that AES submitted in early January to Chile’s Environmental Evaluation Service agency (SEA). The SEA will decide whether the AES project goes ahead.\n\n‘Einstein’ telescope high on Europe’s astronomy wish list\n\nThe ESO analysis found that the increase in artificial light from the AES project would make it harder for instruments to distinguish between celestial bodies. “Increasing the brightness of the sky is like reducing the size of the telescope mirrors,” said Eduardo Unda-Sanza, an astronomer at the University of Antofagasta in Chile.",

Although native to the African island after which it is named, for centuries it has been cultivated and used in medicinal practices around the world — including Chinese, Ayurvedic, European and African traditions — commonly as a treatment for diabetes, but also for malaria, asthma, toothache and other maladies.\n\nExtracts from the flower are used as a remedy for eye infections in the Caribbean, where Damian Cohall, a Jamaican-born ethnopharmacologist at the University of the West Indies in Cave Hill, Barbados, learnt of it through interviews with elder members of local communities. Research in his laboratory identified compounds in the plant that inhibit an enzyme that regulates insulin levels and could lead to treatments for type 2 diabetes (see go.nature.com/3djmhyr). “The fact that these anti-diabetic properties are known in traditional practices validates the Indigenous science that existed well before Western knowledge systems,” Cohall says.\n\nHow to support Indigenous Peoples on biodiversity: be rigorous with data\n\nThe case of the Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) not only demonstrates the value of knowledge held by Indigenous and local communities, but also illustrates how this expertise has often been exploited. In the 1950s, Western researchers intrigued by the plant’s widespread use discovered that the vinca alkaloids that it contained could treat cancer. Drugs derived from these compounds are still sold worldwide today for huge profits, which Cohall says have not been shared equitably with the local communities where the knowledge originated.\n\nSimilar dynamics have played out repeatedly over the past 500 years or more, as Western science has become imposed as the dominant knowledge system around most of the globe. In the process, many alternative ways of understanding the world have been marginalized. “There has been for a long time, and there is still, a distrust of Indigenous knowledge among scientists,” says Marie Roué, an environmental anthropologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Paris. She says that Indigenous knowledge is often dismissed because it incorporates religious or spiritual elements. It also tends to be passed on orally and through cultural traditions, making it hard to formalize in the manner prized by the Western empirical method.\n\nHowever, Indigenous and local communities hold unique insights that can enhance people’s shared understanding of the natural world and inform attempts to protect it. Recognizing this, scientists such as Cohall and Roué are working in partnership with Indigenous and local groups to preserve and amplify these insights, integrate them into their own research and co-produce fresh knowledge with these communities.\n\nDocumenting and validating traditional medicine\n\nCohall has also identified anti-cancer compounds in the sarsaparilla plant (Smilax regelii). Currently, his lab is investigating the wound-healing properties of the Christmas candle plant (Senna alata), “inspired by information from a traditional healer in Ghana”, Cohall says.\n\nThe sweet violet (Viola odorata) and pink Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) have a long history of use for a range of maladies.Credit: Historic Illustrations/Alamy\n\nResearchers who incorporate local traditions and Indigenous knowledge into their work need to be sensitive to a range of social and cultural factors, especially in the Caribbean. “It’s science,” Cohall says, “but at the same time it’s history, it’s globalization, it’s migration.”\n\nThroughout history, various communities have settled, or been forced to settle, in the Caribbean. Each of these groups brought their traditions and culture and produced unique insights through their interactions with the natural environment. Sometimes the groups brought medicinal plants with them, which Cohall says might have happened with the periwinkle. But this knowledge has since been dismissed or suppressed. “A lot of those traditional Indigenous practices were pushed to the side because they were considered to be more primitive or not advanced or sophisticated, which led to a major loss of information,” Cohall says.\n\nWeaving Indigenous knowledge into the scientific method\n\nThis loss continues today, in part because of the modern Westernized education system; “it might not directly suggest that you should not focus on Indigenous traditional practices,” Cohall says, “but it definitely emphasizes a different way of knowledge acquisition.” He also explains that urbanization has led more people to move to cities, away from the rural areas where they can experience nature and apply traditional practices. Although the Caribbean’s history is unique, these forces of suppression and cultural imposition are common threats to Indigenous and local knowledge around the globe.\n\nContextual understanding\n\nCohall says that he can investigate the efficacy of traditional medicine using Westernized lab methods because the basic aim of any medicine is the same: to treat illness safely and effectively. However, other forms of Indigenous and local knowledge fit less easily into different epistemological systems. Often, ways of understanding the environment are formed through direct experience of nature and can be altered by when, where and in whom the knowledge exists.\n\n“In our Western world, nature and culture are separated, and science pretends to be capable of giving knowledge without taking into account culture. Indigenous knowledge is more holistic,” says Roué. She has spent decades working with the Sámi reindeer herders of northern Sweden and notes that these less tangible ways of knowing can be seen in the Sámi’s understanding of the lands that their reindeer graze on.\n\nDuring winter, the Sámi’s reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) feed mainly on lichen that grows on the ground and is then covered by thick snow. This is dependent on a confluence of environmental factors, including the climate, soil and vegetation. If there’s no snow, the lichen is left exposed and is destroyed by the cold temperature and wind; if it rains, then a layer of ice can freeze on top of the lichen and prevent the reindeer from getting to it.\n\nReindeer in northern Sweden feed mainly on lichen that grows on the ground.Credit: Vasilisa Gagarina/Getty\n\nThe locations of good grazing areas therefore change constantly, which the Sámi have become sensitive to. This dynamic understanding of their environment is reflected in the Sámi word guohtun, which is most often translated as ‘pasture’. “They use ‘pasture’ because that’s the word in the other languages, but in their own language guohtun also encompasses how available the lichen is to the reindeer given the conditions today of the snow and wind,” says Roué. “They don’t speak about pasture like a botanist does -— as a permanent mix that is more or less good for an animal — they speak through their experience of ever-changing conditions.”\n\nFrom exploitation to empowerment: how researchers can protect Indigenous peoples’ rights to own and control their data\n\nAttempts to integrate this experiential and contextual local knowledge into scientific frameworks that prioritize stable truths can cause friction. For example, forestry companies have, with good intentions, attempted to work with the Sámi to map where reindeer graze and enable a productive dialogue between land users. But Roué says that the Sámi’s input has largely been ignored because the changeable concept of guohtun cannot be represented easily on maps. “That permanency doesn’t exist,” she says, “When you ask the Sámi, ‘What is the best place?’ or ‘When are you going to do the migration this year?’, they tend to tell you, ‘I don’t know, it depends,’ and Western people think the Sámi know nothing.”\n\nSuch thinking is, to some, infuriating. “I think that there’s an extraordinary arrogance that runs through many Euro-American knowledge systems,” says Luci Attala, a UK-based anthropologist and chair of the Tairona Heritage Trust, in Swansea, UK, which works to amplify the voices of the Indigenous Kogi people of northern Colombia. To her, researchers in the mainstream scientific establishment are culpable for the marginalization of Indigenous and local knowledge. “They’re part of the problem,” she says. “They’re part of the world that has spent years discounting other ways of being and assuming that their methodology is the one and only route to truth.”\n\nThe power of co-production\n\nTo tackle the issues that come with bridging distinct knowledge systems, Roué advocates scientists working with Indigenous and local groups to co-produce knowledge. For instance, the research of eco-anthropologist Samuel Roturier, who has worked with the Sámi for more than 15 years, shows how co-production can empower local communities and enrich conservation strategies.\n\nRoturier, who works at AgroParisTech (part of Paris-Saclay University), has researched ways to increase forest biodiversity and lichen availability, especially through artificial lichen dispersal. The Sámi have to ensure that there are diverse habitats for their reindeer, so that there are always areas where the animals can graze during fluctuations in the weather, which are becoming more volatile because of climate change. But Roturier explains that the biodiversity of the forest is steadily decreasing “because of commercial forestry and the introduction of modern forest-management practices”.\n\nControlled burning is commonly used to manage forests around the world, but is not widely used by Swedish forestry companies. Although there is no evidence to suggest that the Sámi have traditionally used the technique, the idea that fire can benefit biodiversity is conserved in the Indigenous language. “There is a Sámi word, roavve, that means ‘a forest that has burnt in the past’ but also ‘a forest that is rich in lichen’,” says Roturier.\n\nPharmacologist Damian Cohall researches medicinal plants.Credit: Brian Elcock\n\nLars Nutti, a Sámi reindeer herder from the Sirges community, recognized the significance of this linguistic artefact. “Roavve is a description of an old sparse forest with good grazing for reindeer,” he says, “but recreating such forests is largely impossible with today’s policies.” After an expanse of forest burnt down near where Nutti lives, he approached Roturier with the idea of running a research project to investigate whether dispersing lichen in this area would result in healthier pastures. “And the results actually showed that it worked very well, beyond our expectations,” says Roturier.\n\nNutti has since co-authored 2 papers, the latest reporting on 11 years of the project1, and the findings offer insights that can inform forest conservation strategies. Discussions with forestry companies about further projects are under way, but Nutti is sceptical as to whether they will result in tangible progress. “We will probably have to continue to wait for some breakthrough with the forest companies to make large-scale attempts to restore lichen,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York sparked outrage among Democrats in his party last week when he helped to pass a Republican-led spending bill.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThe US government averted a shutdown late last week after President Donald Trump signed into law a spending agreement that is likely to lock in modest cuts to science funding this year. But a larger crisis for science still looms as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress continue to seek massive cuts to the federal budget for 2025 and beyond.\n\nTrump team orders huge government lay-offs: how science could fare\n\nIf federal spending follows current trends, the 15 March ‘continuing resolution’ agreement means that overall funding for research and development during the current fiscal year, which ends on 30 September, will probably ring in around US$193 billion — a relatively modest 3.5% cut compared with spending in the last fiscal year, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC. Part of that cut is coming out of the budget for the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. The spending agreement calls for a 67% reduction in funding for the agency through the 21st Century Cures Act, which includes investments in the 2016 Cancer Moonshot programme and the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative; total funding under the act will drop by $280 million, to $127 million.\n\nThe spending bill, drafted exclusively by Republicans in Congress, omits many of the usual line-item details directing agencies precisely where to put their money. This gives the Trump administration leeway to decide where the money goes — one of the reasons why many Democrats in Congress threatened to shut down the government, rather than vote for the bill. Late last week, however, a small group of Democratic senators, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, went against the rest of the party and advanced it to keep the government’s doors open.\n\nWhether the Trump administration will actually spend the money allocated in the continuing resolution remains to be seen. Over the two months since Trump took office, his team has ignored previous spending laws passed by Congress by freezing and terminating federal grants, including those from the NIH, that the administration does not support. The latest spending agreement is unlikely to change that dynamic, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “We are in a different era right now, where nothing is normal.”\n\nNothing normal\n\nPolicy specialists say that the Trump team might still try to slash this year’s budgets with a legislative package of ‘rescissions’ — which are implemented through a process separate from the appropriations one used to fund the government. This would be the easy — and legal — way for the White House to push through many funding cuts for this year, policy watchers say.\n\n‘My career is over’: Columbia University scientists hit hard by Trump team’s cuts",

Detailed records from ancient periods such as the early Holocene are needed to constrain estimates of future sea-level rise2,3, but the records are sparse and uncertain. Writing in Nature, Hijma et al.4 address this knowledge gap by producing an early-Holocene sea-level record from the North Sea that has unprecedented temporal resolution.

          "abstract": "Health-care staff in Texas are racing to vaccinate infants against measles as an outbreak in the state spreads.Credit: Jan Sonnenmair/Getty\n\nA measles outbreak in the United States is growing , with no end in sight. As of 18 March, 279 cases had been reported in Texas, 38 in neighbouring New Mexico and as many as 4 in Oklahoma, which also borders Texas. Measles has killed an unvaccinated six-year-old child in Gaines County, Texas, the centre of the outbreak, and is the suspected cause of death of an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico.\n\n“We haven’t yet seen signs of the outbreak slowing down,” says William Moss, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nEven as health officials try to stop the outbreak, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who has a long history of anti-vaccination activism, has offered only tepid support for the measles vaccine, a safe and potent way to prevent infection. Kennedy has also promoted treatments including cod liver oil, steroids and antibiotics, none of which are known to be effective against measles. (Kennedy has said that he does not oppose vaccination, but that it should be a “personal” choice.)\n\nNature asked specialists how bad things could get.\n\nHow big could the outbreak become?\n\nThat’s hard to predict. A measles outbreak is like a forest fire throwing out sparks, Moss says. If a spark lands in a state such as Maryland, which has a 97% measles vaccination rate, it will just fizzle out. But “if the sparks from this initial fire land in communities where vaccination rates are low, then we’re going to have multiple large outbreaks”, Moss says.\n\n“I think it could get to thousands and thousands of cases,” says virologist Paul Offit at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhy is measles so incredibly infectious?\n\nMeasles is the most contagious disease that is transmitted directly between people. Epidemiologists use a metric called R0 to indicate how many people, on average, one person with a given illness is expected to infect. The R0 for measles is a whopping 12–18. By comparison, the R0 for COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic was estimated to be about 1.4–2.5, and the R0 for influenza is about 1–2.\n\nMeasles is so contagious that in 1991, a single athlete with measles in a sports stadium infected 16 other people, including 2 sitting at least 30 metres away (about the length of a gymnasium).\n\nParticles of measles virus (artificially coloured), one of the most infectious pathogens known.Credit: Cavallini James/BSIP/SPL\n\nMeasles is virulently contagious partly because the dose needed to infect someone is very small. Moreover, the measles virus spreads through airborne droplets when an infected person so much as breathes. If someone with measles passes through a room, infectious droplets can hang in the air or rest invisibly on surfaces for two hours afterwards.\n\nWhat’s more, in the first 2–4 days, the illness often features symptoms — such as a fever, cough and runny nose — that can fool people into thinking they have a cold. As a result, people with measles might not isolate when they are highly contagious. The disease’s telltale red spots don’t usually appear until several days into the illness.\n\nWhat are the long-term effects of measles?\n\nMeasles can kill: between about one and three cases in every 1,000 unvaccinated children is fatal. Roughly 5–6% of infected people develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death in young children with measles. Measles can also cause blindness or hearing loss.\n\nOne of the most eerie long-term effects is a rare, almost always fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It develops years after a measles infection and is characterized by cognitive decline, personality changes and dementia.\n\nAnother long-term effect is ‘immune amnesia’. Measles can wipe out large numbers of antibodies that store the body’s memory of how to fight other diseases. There’s evidence that measles could leave the immune system more susceptible to other diseases for some 2–3 years after infection1.\n\nEven acute symptoms of measles can be very unpleasant. They include mouth ulcers, ear infections, croup, laryngitis and diarrhoea.\n\n“The way we stop this is to vaccinate,” Moss says.",

Four incentivized public-goods experiments ( N = 2,823) find that the vertical communication of trust maintains cooperation upon the removal of centralized (Study 1), third-party (Study 2a, 2b), and peer punishment (Study 3), and this effect extends beyond single interactions (Study 4).

Our study uncovered empirical evidence of the PAR program’s impact on forest quality. Through a multiperiod difference-in-differences analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we found that the PAR program significantly curbed deforestation in the participating counties and reduced forest-clearing activities among the resettled households, even those relocating to rural villages.

          "abstract": "Internal states like motivation fluctuate substantially over time. However, studies of the neurocomputational mechanims of motivated behavior have failed to capture this. Here, we examined how naturalistic ups and downs in state motivation influence the subjective value of reward and effort. In a microlongitudinal design (N = 155, state timepoints = 3,344, decision-making tasks = 845), we captured fluctuations in state and effort-based decision-making using smartphone-based momentary assessments as people went about their daily lives. We found that both state and trait have independent and multiplicative effects on decision-making. State–behavior coupling was particularly pronounced in individuals with higher trait apathy, meaning that their choices were even more state dependent. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that state motivation prospectively boosted reward sensitivity, making people more willing to exert effort in future. Our results show that day-to-day fluctuations in state and cognition are tightly linked and critical for understanding fundamental human behaviors and mental ill-health.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial cells (human keratinocyte cells and the canine MDCK cell line), traditionally viewed as electrically non-self-excitable and involved primarily in physiological functions such as barrier presentation, absorption, secretion, and protection, are shown here to exhibit traveling extracellular electric charge when they recover from spatially focused, laser-induced wounding of confluent monolayers cultured on a multielectrode array chip. Voltage spikes measured on these electrodes display depolarization, repolarization, and hyperpolarization phases with amplitudes similar to the action potentials of neurons but with the markedly slower duration of 1 to 2 s. Some propagate distances up to hundreds of μm from the wound with a mean speed of around 10 mm s −1 . Generation and transmission of bioelectric signals are significantly influenced by the perturbation of mechanosensitive cationic ion channels. These direct measurements confirm bioelectric signaling that previous work has hypothesized to regulate epithelial cell development and may have relevance to the frequency parameter selection of bioelectric devices.",

          "abstract": "The origin of birds represents a pivotal transition in vertebrate evolution, marked by significant changes in both brain size and feeding biomechanics. The evolution of the avian skull involved dramatic modifications, such as a segmented palate and the development of powered cranial kinesis in neognath birds. Powered kinesis, the ability to move parts of the skull independently, is considered a key innovation behind the dietary diversity and evolutionary success of birds. However, the processes driving the emergence of avian kinesis have remained unclear until recently. By analyzing data from Mesozoic birds, including reinterpretations of palate homology, 3D jaw muscle biomechanics, and linkage analysis, researchers have quantified changes in muscle forces and their effects on palate mechanics during the transition from theropods to birds. As the neurocranium expanded in non-avian theropods, temporal muscles shifted to more rostrocaudal positions in birds, aiding in the segmentation of the pterygoid. This musculoskeletal transformation increased fore-aft muscle force in neognaths, enabling powered cranial kinesis. A critical change was the separation of the epipterygoid ossification from the braincase, leading to the breakdown of primitive kinematic linkages and the development of a new basicranial joint, which allowed for greater cranial flexibility. These findings shed light on how the neurosensory and feeding systems coevolved during bird origins and offer new methods for identifying cranial kinesis in extinct vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) signals to the striatum play critical roles in shaping and sustaining stimulus-reward associations. In primates, however, the dynamics of the DA signals remain unknown since conventional methods are not necessarily appropriate in terms of the spatiotemporal resolution or chemical specificity sufficient for detecting the DA signals. In our study, fiber photometry with a fluorescent DA sensor was employed to identify reward-related DA transients in the monkey striatum. This technique, which directly monitors local DA release, reveals a reward prediction error signal in the anterior putamen originating from midbrain DA neurons. Further, DA transients in the head of the caudate nucleus exhibit a value-based response to reward-predicting stimuli. These signals have been found to arise from two separate groups of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The present results demonstrate that fluorescence DA monitoring is applicable to detect DA signals in the primate striatum for investigating their roles.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic processes involving biomolecules are essential for the function of the cell. Here, we introduce an integrative method for computing models of these processes based on multiple heterogeneous sources of information, including time-resolved experimental data and physical models of dynamic processes. First, for each time point, a set of coarse models of compositional and structural heterogeneity is computed (heterogeneity models). Second, for each heterogeneity model, a set of static integrative structure models is computed (a snapshot model). Finally, these snapshot models are selected and connected into a series of trajectories that optimize the likelihood of both the snapshot models and transitions between them (a trajectory model). The method is demonstrated by application to the assembly process of the human nuclear pore complex in the context of the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic cell division, based on live-cell correlated electron tomography, bulk fluorescence correlation spectroscopy–calibrated quantitative live imaging, and a structural model of the fully assembled nuclear pore complex. Modeling of the assembly process improves the model precision over static integrative structure modeling alone. The method is applicable to a wide range of time-dependent systems in cell biology and is available to the broader scientific community through an implementation in the open source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software.",

Here, integrating transcriptomic and proteomic approaches with AI-guided structure predictions, we discover a group of evolutionarily conserved leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins in velvet worm slime that readily adopt a receptor-like, protein-binding “horseshoe” structure. Our structural predictions suggest dimerization of LRR proteins and support their interactions with conserved β-sheet-rich domains of high-molecular-weight proteins, the primary building blocks of velvet worm slime fibers. This suggests that LRR proteins might be involved in reversible, receptor-based supramolecular interactions in these biofibers, providing potential avenues for fabricating fully recyclable (bio)polymeric materials.",

Here, we show that static mechanical stretch of cells in 3D tissues can either increase or decrease fibroblast activation depending upon recursive cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) feedback and demonstrate control of this activation through integrated in vitro and mathematical models. ECM viscoelasticity, signaling dynamics, and cell mechanics combine to yield a predictable, but nonmonotonic, relationship between mechanical stretch and long-term cell activation.

          "abstract": "Conventional computational models of climate adaptation frameworks inadequately consider decision-makers’ capacity to learn, update, and improve decisions. Here, we investigate the potential of reinforcement learning (RL), a machine learning technique that efficaciously acquires knowledge from the environment and systematically optimizes dynamic decisions, in modeling and informing adaptive climate decision-making. We consider coastal flood risk mitigations for Manhattan, New York City, USA (NYC), illustrating the benefit of continuously incorporating observations of sea-level rise into systematic designs of adaptive strategies. We find that when designing adaptive seawalls to protect NYC, the RL-derived strategy significantly reduces the expected net cost by 6 to 36% under the moderate emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 (9 to 77% under the high emissions scenario SSP5-8.5), compared to conventional methods. When considering multiple adaptive policies, including accomodation and retreat as well as protection, the RL approach leads to a further 5% (15%) cost reduction, showing RL’s flexibility in coordinatively addressing complex policy design problems. RL also outperforms conventional methods in controlling tail risk (i.e., low probability, high impact outcomes) and in avoiding losses induced by misinformation about the climate state (e.g., deep uncertainty), demonstrating the importance of systematic learning and updating in addressing extremes and uncertainties related to climate adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Transmembrane channel-like protein 1 (TMC1), a pore-forming component of the mechano-electrical transducer (MET) channel in cochlear outer hair cells, is subject to numerous mutations causing deafness and hair cell death. We studied mice harboring semidominant mutations Tmc1 p.T416K, p.M412K, and p.D569N, which all display functional MET channels at postnatal day (P)6 but become deaf by P21. Early signs of concomitant hair cell apoptosis were assayed in neonatal Tmc1 mutants by labeling with Calcein-acetomethyl ester (AM), MitoTracker, and Annexin V, the latter labeling scramblase externalization of phosphatidyl serine. Reduced labeling with Calcein-AM was correlated with reduced MitoTracker, the targeting of mitochondria being confirmed with the uncoupling agent carbonylcyanide p -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and use of MitoLight to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential. These markers demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction in Tmc1 mutants, even at P6 when MET currents were still present. Acoustic brainstem responses established that Tmc1 p.D569N and Tmc1 p.M412K mice were deaf by P15 and Tmc1 p.T416K by P21. Two methods of blocking the stereociliary PMCA2 Ca 2+ pump both elicited scramblase activity, suggesting that apoptosis is promoted by elevation of hair bundle [Ca 2+ ]. Reduced PMCA2 density was found in the stereocilia of Tmc1 mutants and was correlated with a decrease in MET channel Ca 2+ permeability. Cre-Lox excision of the mutant M412K exon at P1 fully preserved hearing across all frequencies by P19 and promoted recovery to wild type of PMCA2 density. These results demonstrate that hair cells in Tmc1 mutants have embarked on apoptosis at P6 and argue for connections between stereociliary PMCA2 density, hair cell apoptosis, and deafness.",

The variability declined continuously along this axis from within-network to between-network connections and from the edges linking association networks to those linking the sensorimotor and association networks. This connectional axis of functional variability is associated with spatial pattern of structural connectivity variability. Moreover, the connectional variability axis evolves in youth with an flatter axis slope. We also observed that the slope of the connectional variability axis was positively related to the performance in the higher-order cognition. Together, our results reveal a connectional axis in functional variability that is linked with structural connectome variability, refines during development, and is relevant to cognition.",

          "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is a prominent force shaping genome evolution, and understanding why recombination rates vary within and between species has remained a central, though challenging, question. Variation in recombination is widely thought to influence the efficacy of selection in purging transposable elements (TEs), prevalent selfish genetic elements, leading to widely observed negative correlations between TE abundance and recombination rates across taxa. However, accumulating evidence suggests that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence of this relationship. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked an approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches–analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing TE landscape can actively modify recombination, shaping genome evolution within and between species.",

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this condition remain unclear. Transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3), a TRP channel that is activated by downstream of the Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) axis, is expressed in the somatosensory system. Therefore, the present study investigated its pathophysiological role in neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Here, partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL) elicited mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in wild-type mice, which was suppressed in TRPC3-KO mice. In situ hybridization revealed that TRPC3 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Furthermore, spinal dorsal horn neuron-specific downregulation using miRNA attenuated pSNL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Spinal TRPC3 activation elicited acute mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, its genetic ablation reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by spinal NK 1 R or PLC activation. These findings demonstrate that TRPC3 in spinal dorsal horn neurons facilitates the development of neuropathic pain. Therefore, TRPC3 may be a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury.",

          "abstract": "Mixed-species plantations are increasingly recognized for their potential to maintain forest biodiversity and soil health; however, a comprehensive assessment of their global effectiveness is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 7,045 paired observations between mixed-species and monoculture plantations, derived from 311 studies across diverse forest ecosystems worldwide. Our results show that mixed-species plantations significantly increased understory plant biomass, cover, and species richness by 32.6%, 55.4%, and 32.2%, respectively, compared to monocultures. Furthermore, the Shannon and Pielou diversity indices increased by 28.2% and 8.6%, respectively, and the Simpson index increased by 9.6%. When understory shrub and herbaceous species were considered separately, species mixing had significantly positive effects on shrub diversity but had no effect on herbaceous diversity. Moreover, mixed-species plantations markedly improved soil physical and chemical properties compared to monocultures. These improvements include increases in soil nutrient content (9.6 to 17.8%) and nutrient availability (14.7 to 33.5%), soil microbial biomass (17.2 to 28.8%), and soil carbon sequestration (7.2 to 19.9%). These enhancements were particularly pronounced in plantations that included legumes. Our findings reveal that the benefits of species mixing are influenced by climatic conditions, geographic location, and stand age, with the most substantial effects observed in temperate regions and mature stands. This study underscores the critical role of mixed-species plantations in promoting sustainable forest management and mitigating the ecological limitations of monocultures.",

Our analysis reveals that forested wetlands can significantly attenuate storm waves (35% over 3 wavelengths) except in rare near-submerged cases. Notably, 19 of the 20 existing formulations for vegetation drag coefficient, a key parameter for wave attenuation modeling, are inapplicable in storm conditions. Hence, we introduce an new approach to reliably predict wave attenuation during storms, without the need for drag coefficient determination nor modeling expertise.

          "abstract": "Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food production, accounting for a substantial portion of water withdrawals worldwide. As the world’s population grows, so does the demand for water in agriculture, leading to alterations in regional water–energy balances. We present an approach to identify the influence of agriculture on the water–energy balance using empirical data. We explore the departure from the Budyko curve for catchments with agricultural expansion and their associations with changes in the water–energy balance using a causal discovery algorithm. Analyzing data from 1,342 catchments across three Köppen-Geiger climate classes—temperate, snowy, and others—from 1980 to 2014, we show that temperate and snowy catchments, which account for over 90% of stations, exhibit distinct patterns. Cropland percentage (CL%) emerges as the dominant factor, explaining 47 and 37% of the variance in deviations from the Budyko curve in temperate and snowy catchments, respectively. In temperate catchments, CL% shows a strong negative correlation with precipitation-streamflow (P-Q) causal strength (Spearman ρ = − 0.75 ), suggesting that cropland exacerbates precipitation-driven deviations. A moderate negative correlation with aridity-streamflow (AR-Q) causal strength ( ρ = − 0.42 ) indicates additional influences of cropland through aridity-driven interactions. In snowy catchments, CL% is similarly influential, with a positive correlation with P-Q causal strength ( ρ = 0.51 ). However, the negative correlation with AR-Q causal strength ( ρ = − 0.45 ) underscores the role of aridity as a secondary driver. While vegetation and precipitation seasonality also contribute to the deviations, their impacts are comparatively lower. These findings underscore the need for inclusion of agricultural activities in changing water–energy balance to secure future water supplies.",

Photoexcited carrier transfer from QDs to microbes is driven by complex interactions, with emerging insights into the relevant thermodynamic and kinetic factors. The heterogeneities of both microbes and QD ensembles pose significant challenges in mechanistic understanding, which is critical for designing advanced nano–bio hybrids. We used fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to analyze charge transfer between a CdSe QD film and Shewanella oneidensis microbes. We correlated the spatiotemporal fluorescence data with an analytical model. Our analysis revealed two distinct distributions of QD de-excitation pathways. The characteristics of these distributions: 1) a faster transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 1 = 1.5   10 9   s - 1 ), with a lower acceptor number ( N ¯ a 1 = 0.03 ) and 2) a slower transfer rate ( k ¯ E T 2 = 4.1   10 8   s - 1 ) with a higher acceptor number ( N ¯ a 2 = 0.18 ). We assign these distributions to the indirect and direct electron transfer mechanisms, respectively. Our findings demonstrate how spectroscopic imaging can uncover fundamental electron transfer mechanisms at complex interfaces, offering valuable design principles for future nano–bio hybrids.",

          "abstract": "Diatoms, a highly successful group of photosynthetic algae, contribute to a quarter of global primary production. Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe—a specialized slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behavior and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.",

Here, we develop spin noise spectroscopy for spin liquid studies by considering Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 , a material hypothesized to be either a quantum or a spiral spin liquid (SSL). By enhancing techniques introduced for magnetic monopole noise studies [R.

The resulting power spectral density of magnetization noise S M ω , T reveals intense spin fluctuations with S M ω , T ∝ ω - α ( T ) and 0.84 &lt; α T &lt; 1.04 . Both the variance σ M 2 T and the correlation function C M t , T of this spin noise undergo crossovers at a temperature T ∗ ≈ 450   mK . While predictions for quantum spin liquids are inconsistent with this phenomenology, those from Monte–Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional (2D) SSL state in Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 yield overall quantitative correspondence with the measured frequency and temperature dependences of S M ω , T ,   C M t , T , and σ M 2 T , thus indicating that Ca 10 Cr 7 O 28 is an SSL.",

          "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus are critical for memory retrieval, decision making, and emotional regulation. While ventral CA1 (vCA1) shows direct and reciprocal connections with mPFC, dorsal CA1 (dCA1) forms indirect pathways to mPFC, notably via the thalamic reuniens nucleus (Re). Neuroanatomical tracing has documented structural connectivity of this indirect pathway through Re however, its functional operation is largely unexplored. Here, we used in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology along with optogenetics to address this question. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse brain slices revealed both monosynaptic excitatory responses and disynaptic feedforward inhibition at Re–mPFC synapses. However, we also identified a prolonged excitation of mPFC by Re. These early monosynaptic and late recurrent components are in marked contrast to the primarily feedforward inhibition characteristic of thalamic inputs to the neocortex. Local field potential recordings in mPFC brain slices revealed prolonged synaptic activity throughout all cortical lamina upon Re activation, with the late excitation enhanced by blockade of parvalbumin neurons and GABA A Rs. In vivo Neuropixels recordings in head-fixed awake mice revealed a similar prolonged excitation of mPFC units by Re activation. In summary, Re output produces recurrent feedforward excitation within mPFC suggesting a potent amplification system in the Re–mPFC network. This may facilitate amplification of dCA1-&gt;mPFC signals for which Re acts as the primary conduit, as there is little direct connectivity. In addition, the capacity of mPFC neurons to fire bursts of action potentials in response to Re input suggests that these synapses have a high gain.",

There are many well-known rules that can combine a set of arbitrarily dependent P -values (for the same hypothesis) into a single P -value. We show that essentially all these existing rules can be strictly improved when the P -values are exchangeable, or when external randomization is allowed (or both). For example, we derive randomized and/or exchangeable improvements of well-known rules like “twice the median” and “twice the average,” as well as geometric and harmonic means. Exchangeable P -values are often produced one at a time (for example, under repeated tests involving data splitting), and our rules can combine them sequentially as they are produced, stopping when the combined P -values stabilize. Our work also improves rules for combining arbitrarily dependent P -values, since the latter becomes exchangeable if they are presented to the analyst in a random order. The main technical advance is to show that all existing combination rules can be obtained by calibrating the P -values to e-values (using an α -dependent calibrator), averaging those e-values, converting to a level- α test using Markov’s inequality, and finally obtaining P -values by combining this family of tests; the improvements are delivered via recent randomized and exchangeable variants of Markov’s inequality.",

The motor program is dependent on the sensorimotor part of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and on synaptic plasticity in the thalamostriatal synapses. New findings from several laboratories have revealed a highly precise spatially interactive organization within the basal ganglia [DLS, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the thalamostriatal parafascicular nucleus (PF)] and with precise input from the cortex. The DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop is subdivided into many parallel loops. I now propose that these parallel loops can act to reinforce the activity of the different striatal projection neurons in the DLS that take part and that the synaptic transmission in DLS becomes potentiated each time the motor sequence is performed successfully, if rewarded through a dopamine burst. It is argued that after learning the DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop can operate in isolation.",

In this Perspective article, we address this problem by surveying the landscape of well-characterized metamorphic proteins and noting that a significant fraction of them display temperature sensitivity. We then make the case that the dependence on temperature, in particular cold-denaturation effects, is likely to be an underlying property of many metamorphic proteins regardless of their ultimate triggering mechanisms, especially those with a single domain. The argument is supported by rigorous analysis of hydrophobic effects in each well-characterized metamorphic protein pair and a description of how these parameters relate to temperature. The conclusion discusses the relevance of these insights to a better understanding of prediction, evolution, and de novo design strategies for metamorphic proteins.",

Our results thus challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational response of the structure exhibits a nonlinear and universal behavior regardless of the ratio of asymmetry. Leveraging the independence of the binding angle to the pulling force, we finally introduce the λ -test—a visual measurement technique to characterize membranes through simple mechanical coupling.",

Species radiations established by long-distance, and especially transoceanic, dispersal can cause substantial shifts in regional biodiversity. Here, we investigate the occurrence and timing of the greatest known long-distance oceanic dispersal event in the history of terrestrial vertebrates—the rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji. Iguanas are large-bodied herbivores that are well-known overwater dispersers, including species that colonized the Caribbean and the Galápagos islands. However, the origin of Fijian iguanas had not been comprehensively tested. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary timescale of the iguanid lizard radiation using genome-wide exons and ultraconserved elements (UCEs). Those data indicate that the closest living relative of extant Fijian iguanas is the North American desert iguana and that the two taxa likely diverged during the late Paleogene near or after the onset of volcanism that produced the Fijian archipelago. Biogeographic models estimate North America as the most probable ancestral range of Fijian iguanas. Our analyses support the hypothesis that iguanas reached Fiji via an extraordinary oceanic dispersal event from western North America, and which spanned a fifth of the earth’s circumference (&gt;8,000 km). Overwater rafting of iguanas from North America to Fiji strengthens the importance of founder-event speciation in the diversification of iguanids and elucidates the scope of long-distance dispersal across terrestrial vertebrates.",

          "abstract": "The high resource intensity of industrial beef in high-income economies has prompted growing interest in alternative, potentially lower environmental impact beef production pathways. Of those, grass feeding is promoted by some as one such alternative, but rigorous quantification of this claim is required. Motivated to bridge this knowledge gap, we integrate empirical evidence with a model based on authoritative equations governing beef cattle performance to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions of producing grass-fed beef. Because geographical specificity and dependence on agricultural intensity are key, we model widely varied herds, from extensive operations on semiarid, marginal rangelands to partially industrial, intensive ones in lusher, more accommodating settings. We find that emissions per kg protein of even the most efficient grass-fed beef are 10 to 25% higher than those of industrial US beef and 3- to over 40-fold higher than a wide range of plant and animal alternatives. Soil sequestration enhancement by rangeland grazing reduces these emissions from 280–390 to 180–290 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , still somewhat above industrial beef’s 180 to 220 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 , and well above nonbeef alternatives’ 10 to 70 kg CO 2eq (kg protein) −1 . These differences prove robust across a broad set of combinations of grass-fed beef operation types, management practices, and ration qualities. Consequently, even with maximal credit for putative sequestration enhancement, grass-fed beef is still no less carbon intensive than industrial beef, and severalfold more intensive than nonbeef alternatives.",

Here, we present a generic and scalable strategy to purify mammalian respiratory complexes I, III and the ATP synthase from enriched mitochondria in enzymatically fully active form, and procedures to reassemble the complexes into liposomes. A robust functionality can be shown by in situ monitoring of ATP synthesis rates and by using selected inhibitors of the respiratory chain complexes. By inclusion of cytochrome c oxidase, our procedures allowed us to reconstruct the entire mitochondrial respiratory chain (complexes I, III, IV, and V) in ubiquinone Q 10 containing liposomes, demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen driven ATP synthesis. The system was fully coupled at all levels and was used to probe cardiolipin as an essential component to activate the mammalian respiratory chain. Structural characterization using electron cryomicroscopy allowed us to resolve apo-state complex III and complex V at high and medium resolution, respectively, using in silico particle sorting, confirming the presence of all protein subunits and cofactors in native stoichiometry and conformation.

Upon severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, platelets become hyperactivated, releasing molecules such as cytokines, granule contents, and bioactive lipids. The key effector biolipids produced by platelets include 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and 12-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (12-HETrE), produced by 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), and prostaglandins and thromboxane, produced by cyclooxygenase-1. While prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 were previously associated with lung inflammation in severe COVID-19, the role of platelet 12-LOX in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using mice deficient for platelets’ 12-LOX, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in higher lung inflammation characterized by histopathological tissue analysis, increased leukocyte infiltrates, and cytokine production relative to wild-type mice. In addition, distinct platelet and lung transcriptomic changes, including alterations in NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP1) inflammasome-related gene expression, were observed. Mass spectrometry lipidomic analysis in 12-LOX-deficient-infected mice revealed significant changes in bioactive lipid content, including reduced levels of 12-HETrE that inversely correlated with disease severity. Finally, platelet 12-LOX deficiency was associated with increased morbidity and lower survival rates relative to wild type (WT) mice. Overall, this study highlights the complex interplay between 12-LOX-related lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) single particle analysis, we present seven cryo-EM structures of piccolo NuA4 (pNuA4) in complex with wild-type H2A.Z or H2A.Z-mutant-containing nucleosomes in the absence or presence of acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA). We revealed that, in the absence of Ac-CoA, pNuA4 adopts multiple conformations to search for its substrates. After adding Ac-CoA, the single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and cryo-EM data indicated that pNuA4 prefers to bind H4 and undergoes a dynamic conformational change to complete the acetylation. We also obtained previously unseen structures in states associated with the acetylation of H2A.Z. These cryo-EM structures and smFRET results suggest a complex acetylation process on H4 and H2A.Z by pNuA4. The results provide a comprehensive picture of the mechanism by which pNuA4 acetylates its substrates within an H2A.Z-containing nucleosome.",

We describe a progressive transition from homogeneous meadows to extinction through dynamical regimes that allow the ecosystem to avoid the typical ecological tipping points of homogeneous vegetation covers. A predictable sequence of distinct dynamical regimes is observed as mortality is continuously increased: turbulent regimes, formation of spirals and wave trains, and isolated traveling pulses or expanding rings, the latter being a harbinger of ecosystem collapse, however far beyond the tipping point of the homogeneous cover. The model used in this paper is general, and the results can be applied to other plant–soil spatially extended systems, regardless of the mechanisms behind negative and positive feedbacks.",

Epidemiological dynamics of many infectious diseases have highlighted the importance of considering the demographics of the societies in which they spread, particularly with respect to age structure. In addition, the waves of the recent COVID-19 pandemic driven by variant replacements at an unprecedented speed show that it is vital to consider the evolutionary aspects. The classic trade-off theory of virulence addresses aspects of pathogen evolution, but here we explore in more detail the possibility of society-specific evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) during an unfolding pandemic. Theory posits the existence under some conditions of an ESS representing the evolutionary endpoint of change. By using a demographically realistic model incorporating infection rates that vary with age, we outline which evolutionary scenarios are plausible. Focusing on the rate of infection and duration of infectivity, we ask whether an ESS exists, what characterizes it, and as a result which long-term public-health consequences may be expected. We demonstrate that the ESS of an evolving pathogen depends upon the background age-dependent frailty and mortality rates. Our findings shed important light on the plausible long-term trajectories of highly evolvable novel pathogens.",

          "abstract": "The phenological timing of leaf out in temperate forests is a critical transition point each year that alters the global climate system, which in turn, feeds back to plants, driving leaf out to occur nearly 3 d earlier per decade as temperatures rise. To improve predictions of leaf out timing, urban heat islands (UHIs) or densely developed areas that are hotter than surrounding undeveloped regions are often used to approximate warming via space-for-time substitutions (i.e., rural-to-urban temperature gradients). However, more than just environment changes along these gradients—urban regions are highly managed systems with limited-to-no within species diversity. We demonstrate here that recent observations that UHI gradients underpredict leaf out response to temperature when compared to temperature gradients through time is likely because both genetics and environment are changing across rural-to-urban gradients, whereas only environment is changing through time. We tested this hypothesis using genomic, phenological, and temperature data of northern red oak ( Quercus rubra ) over several years between an urban and rural site. Across our gradient, models that included just temperature predicted moderate advancement of leaf out. However, if we account for the genetic diversity of our trees in our model, leaf out phenology is predicted to advance significantly more in response to temperature. We demonstrate that this stronger relationship between phenological timing and climate is because urban trees have reduced genetic diversity as they are planted from limited stock by humans and, moreover, are most closely related to individuals at the rural site that leaf out later on average.",

          "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen responsible for numerous antibiotic-resistant infections. Identifying vulnerabilities in S. aureus is crucial for developing new antibiotics to treat these infections. With this in mind, we probed the function of GdpS, a conserved Staphylococcal membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic GGDEF domain. These domains are canonically involved in cyclic-di-GMP signaling processes, but S. aureus is not known to make cyclic-di-GMP. Using a transposon screen, we found that loss of GdpS is lethal when combined with disruption in synthesis of the glycolipid anchor of a cell surface polymer called lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or with deletion of genes important in cell division. Taking advantage of a small molecule that inhibits LTA glycolipid anchor synthesis, we selected for suppressors of Δ gdpS lethality. The most prevalent suppressors were hypermorphic alleles of dgkB , which encodes a soluble diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase required to recycle DAG to phosphatidylglycerol. By following up on these suppressors, we found that the GGDEF domain of GdpS interacts directly with DgkB, orienting its active site at the membrane to promote DAG recycling. DAG kinase hypermorphs also suppressed the lethality caused by combined loss of gdpS and cell division factors, highlighting the importance of lipid homeostasis for cell division. GdpS’ positive regulation of DAG kinase function was dependent on the GGDEF domain but not its catalytic residues. As the sole conserved GGDEF-domain protein in Staphylococci, GdpS promotes an enzymatic process independent of cyclic-di-GMP signaling, revealing a new function for the ubiquitously conserved GGDEF domain.",

          "abstract": "Protein therapeutics such as antibodies require in-depth in vivo characterization during development and consequently account for a large proportion of laboratory animal consumption in the pharmaceutical industry. Currently, antibody candidates are exhaustively tested one-by-one in animal models to determine pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profiles. The simultaneous analysis of antibody mixtures in single animals, called cassette-dosing, could in principle overcome this bottleneck, but is currently limited to small cassette sizes. Here, we demonstrate how the use of genetically encoded peptide tags (flycodes), designed for maximal detectability in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, can allow for the simultaneous characterization of large pools of drug candidates, from single cassette–dosed mice. We demonstrate the simultaneous assessment of PK parameters for a group of &gt;20 marketed/development-stage antibodies. Biodistribution experiments in mice bearing EGFR-expressing tumors correctly identified the two pool members recognizing EGFR, while organ analysis registered liver accumulation of an antibody targeting glucagon receptor, a protein profoundly expressed in that organ. In analogy to an early-phase drug development campaign, we performed biophysical and PK analysis for a cassette of 80 unique bispecific DARPin-sybody molecules. The data shown in this study originate from only 18 cassette-dosed mice, thereby demonstrating how flycode technology efficiently advances preclinical discovery pipelines allowing a direct comparison of drug candidates under identical experimental conditions.",

Although rich in vertebrate fossil deposits spanning the Middle and Late Miocene, associated geochronology has been limited by the lack of available volcanic materials that allow radioisotopic dating and geochemical correlation. As a result, calibrating mammalian evolution has been largely restricted to the semicircular application of paleomagnetic inferences combined with temporally ill-constrained and geographically remote biochronological deductions. For example, fossils from three Greek localities and one Anatolian locality assigned to the primate genus Ouranopithecus lack datable samples, leaving its ages poorly constrained.

          "abstract": "Why are jellyfish round? Animals get their shapes as they develop. After development, however, how animals keep their shapes is less understood. Moon jellies respond to perturbations to body shape, such as being halved or quartered, by reorganizing existing body parts and regaining radial symmetry, i.e., their round shape. The robust recovery of radial symmetry led us to investigate, in this study, how being round is encoded. We tested perturbing shape by grafting body sections in varying configurations. Testing these perturbations confirms the moon jellies’ ability to recover their round shape from many perturbations. However, in response to some perturbations, the jellies can also adopt other stable body shapes, such as oval, quadrilateral, and triangular. Thus, although the jellies are characterized by a radially symmetrical body plan, perturbations can lead to them recovering to bilateral shapes. Employing mathematical modeling, we find that interactions between forces from muscle contractions and viscoelastic tissues can explain the recovery to different shapes. A stable body shape is achieved when the mechanical forces are locally balanced, regardless of symmetry. Consistent with the model prediction that stable shape is the outcome of balancing mechanical forces, modulating the mechanical parameter in the system, i.e., the muscle contraction rate, can produce shape-shifting. Maintaining shapes dynamically as the balance of mechanical forces may enable the animals to readily adapt to changing physical environments.",

Microbial competition for these scarce resources can be alleviated insofar as the intensity of nutrient uptake and assimilation activities are distributed heterogeneously across organisms over periodic input cycles. Recent analysis of community transcriptional dynamics in the nitrogen-limited subtropical North Pacific gyre revealed evidence of temporal partitioning of nitrogen uptake and assimilation between eukaryotic phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria over day-night cycles. Here, we present results from a Lagrangian metatranscriptomic time series survey in the Sargasso Sea and demonstrate temporally partitioned phosphorus uptake in this phosphorus-limited environment. In the Sargasso, heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria express genes for phosphorus assimilation during the morning, day, and dusk, respectively. These results support the generality of temporal niche partitioning as an emergent mechanism that can structure uptake of limiting nutrients and facilitate coexistence of diverse microbes in open ocean ecosystems.",

To date, there is no fundamental understanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and alters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have identified a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well’s radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.",

          "abstract": "As infants grow, they develop greater attentional control during interactions with others, shifting from patterns of attention primarily driven by caregivers (exogenous) to those that are also self-directed (endogenous). The ability to endogenously control attention during infancy is thought to reflect ongoing brain development and is influenced by patterns of joint attention between infant and caregiver. However, whether measures of infant attentional control and caregiver behavior during infant–caregiver interactions relate to patterns of infant brain activity is unknown and key for informing developmental models of attentional control. Using data from 43 infant–caregiver dyads, we quantified patterns of visual attention with dyadic, head-mounted eye tracking during infant–caregiver play and associated them with the duration of infant EEG microstate D/4 measured during rest. Importantly, microstate D/4 is a scalp potential topography thought to reflect the organization and function of attention-related brain networks. We found that microstate D/4 associated positively with infant-led joint attention rate but did not associate with caregiver-led joint attention rate, suggesting that infant-led coordination of joint attention during play may be critical for the neurobiological development of attentional control, or vice versa. Further, we found that microstate D/4 associated negatively with infant attention shift rate and positively with infant sustained attention duration, suggesting that increased stability of microstate D/4 may reflect maturation of attentional control and its underlying neural substrates. Together, our findings provide insights into how infant attentional control abilities and infant–caregiver visual behavior during play are associated with the spatial and temporal dynamics of infant brain activity.",

          "abstract": "The importance of macrophages in kidney diseases has been well established; however, the mechanisms underlying the infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys are not well understood. RGMb is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family. RGMb can be expressed on the cell surface but a large portion of RGMb is localized intracellularly. Among various immune cell types, macrophages express the highest levels of RGMb, but the biological functions of RGMb in macrophages remain largely unknown. We find that RGMb promoted macrophage migration in vitro and that in vivo, RGMb enhanced infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys and aggravated kidney inflammation and injury in mice. Mechanistically, RGMb bound to TAB1 inside the cell and facilitated the interaction between TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAB1, thereby promoting TRAF6-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of TAK1, followed by increased αTAT1 phosphorylation and α-tubulin acetylation. The resulting changes in the cytoskeleton promoted macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Rgmb in macrophages markedly reduced TAK1 phosphorylation, αTAT1 phosphorylation, and α-tubulin acetylation and attenuated macrophage infiltration, renal inflammation, tubular injury, and interstitial fibrosis during kidney injury. Our results suggest that macrophage RGMb promotes kidney disease by increasing macrophage infiltration via the TRAF6-TAB1-TAK1/αTAT1/α-tubulin cascade.",

However, achieving this goal has long been challenging due to the diffraction of low-frequency (long-wavelength) audio waves in linear acoustics. Here, we introduce an approach for creating remote audio spots, dubbed audible enclaves, by harnessing the local nonlinear interaction of two self-bending ultrasonic beams with distinct spectra. The self-bending ultrasonic beams created by acoustic metasurfaces, though inaudible, can bypass obstacles such as human heads. At their intersection behind obstacles, highly localized audible enclaves are formed due to the local nonlinear interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the ultrabroadband capabilities of our metasurface-based implementation both numerically and experimentally, spanning from 125 Hz to 4 kHz (6 octave bands), covering the majority of the audible frequency range. The practicality of our proposed technique is underscored by its compact implementation size (0.16 m, equivalent to 0.06 wavelengths at 125 Hz), as well as its robust performance under wideband transient audio signal excitation and in a common room with reverberations. Our proposed audible enclaves hold significant potential for various applications in advanced audio engineering, including private speech communications, immersive spatial audio reproduction, and high-resolution sound/quiet zone control.",

Through the use of single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell spatial transcriptomics analyses, a spatiotemporal atlas of MC in human fetuses from 7 to 15 wk postconception was established, highlighting the role of MC in the ossification of the mandible. Importantly, we revealed that two populations of MC contributed to mandibular ossification through different mechanisms. The anterior MC can differentiate into osteolineage cells, as shown in an in vivo lineage tracing mouse model. The intermediate MC facilitates intramembranous ossification through cell–cell communications, possibly through signaling ligands like BMP5 , BMP7 , SEMA3A , PDGFC , and FGF7 . This study suggests that MC plays a crucial role in mediating mandibular ossification through distinct mechanisms, providing valuable insights for understanding oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders in the future.",

Away from the exactly solvable regions, the steady state can be obtained numerically for 100s to 1,000s of sites.

          "abstract": "At the end of their growth phase, Drosophila larvae remodel their bodies, glue themselves to a substrate, and harden their cuticle in preparation for metamorphosis. This process—termed pupariation—is triggered by a surge in the hormone ecdysone. Substrate attachment is achieved by a pupariation subprogram called glue expulsion and spreading behavior (GSB). An epidermis-to-CNS Dilp8-Lgr3 relaxin signaling event that occurs downstream of ecdysone is critical for unlocking progression of the pupariation motor program toward GSB, but the factors and circuits acting downstream of Lgr3 signaling remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific RNA interference and behavioral monitoring, we identify Myoinhibiting peptide (Mip) as a neuromodulator of multiple GSB action components, such as tetanic contraction, peristaltic contraction alternation, and head-waving. Mip is required in a pair of brain descending neurons, which act temporally downstream of Dilp8-Lgr3 signaling. Mip modulates GSB via ventral nerve cord neurons expressing its conserved receptor, sex peptide receptor (SPR). Silencing of Mip descending neurons by hyperpolarization completely abrogates GSB, while their optogenetic activation at a restricted competence time window triggers GSB-like behavior. Hence, Mip descending neurons have at least two functions: to act as GSB command neurons and to secrete Mip to modulate GSB action components. Our results provide insight into conserved aspects of Mip-SPR signaling in animals, reveal the complexity of GSB control, and contribute to the understanding of how multistep innate behaviors are coordinated in time and with other developmental processes through command neurons and neuropeptidergic signaling.",

However, the brain mechanisms that process linguistic input are highly specialized, showing little response to diverse nonlinguistic tasks. Here, we examine constructed languages (conlangs) to ask whether they draw on the same neural mechanisms as natural languages or whether they instead pattern with domains like math and programming languages. Using individual-subject fMRI analyses, we show that understanding conlangs recruits the same brain areas as natural language comprehension. This result holds for Esperanto (n = 19 speakers) and four fictional conlangs [Klingon (n = 10), Na’vi (n = 9), High Valyrian (n = 3), and Dothraki (n = 3)]. These findings suggest that conlangs and natural languages share critical features that allow them to draw on the same representations and computations, implemented in the left-lateralized network of brain areas. The features of conlangs that differentiate them from natural languages—including recent creation by a single individual, often for an esoteric purpose, the small number of speakers, and the fact that these languages are typically learned in adulthood—appear to not be consequential for the reliance on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. We argue that the critical shared feature of conlangs and natural languages is that they are symbolic systems capable of expressing an open-ended range of meanings about our outer and inner worlds.",

Strikingly, when a shaft of light illuminates a thin, initially uniform suspension of the two, the chemotactic influx of bacteria to the photosynthetically active region leads to expulsion of the algae from that area. We propose that this effect arises from advection by the inhomogeneous bacterial concentration.

Utilizing a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we find that the WNT signaling pathway negatively regulates HLA-G expression in EVT.

We observed a widespread and relatively abundant bacterial phylum (CSP1-3) in deep soils and evaluated its phylogeny, ecology, metabolism, and evolutionary history. Genome analysis indicated that members of CSP1-3 were actively replicating in situ and were widely involved in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles. We identified potential adaptive traits of CSP1-3 members for the oligotrophic deep soil environments, including a mixotrophic lifestyle, flexible energy metabolisms, and conservation pathways. The ancestor of CSP1-3 likely originated in an aquatic environment, subsequently colonizing topsoil and, later, deep soil environments, with major CSP1-3 clades adapted to each of these distinct niches. The transition into the terrestrial environment was associated with genome expansion, including the horizontal acquisition of a range of genes for carbohydrate and energy metabolism and, in one lineage, high-affinity terminal oxidases to support a microaerophilic lifestyle. Our results highlight the ecology and genome evolution of microbes in the deep Critical Zone.",

          "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) primarily infects macrophages. In vitro without antibiotics, wild-type Mtb hastens death of the macrophages, but the processes leading to rapid cell death are not well understood. Our earlier work indicated that the death of Mtb-infected mouse macrophages in vitro is markedly exacerbated by induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) [L. Zhang et al., J. Exp. Med. 18 , e20200887 (2021)]. Here, we identified a key downstream response to IFN-β in the context of Mtb infection as the massive induction of cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), not only in its canonical subcellular localization in mitochondria but also in the cytosol, where it bound to the lysosome-stabilizing protein HSP70. ACOD1’s product, itaconate, protected Mtb-infected macrophages. However, the contrasting and predominant effect of high-level ACOD1 expression was to act in a noncatalytic manner to promote HSP70’s degradation, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Mtb-induced macrophage death was markedly diminished by inhibitors of cysteine proteases, consistent with lysosome-mediated cell death. Neither ACOD1 inhibitors nor cysteine protease inhibitors are suitable for potential host-directed therapy (HDT) of tuberculosis. Instead, this work directs attention to how ACOD1 acts nonenzymatically to promote the degradation of HSP70.",

          "abstract": "A sustained blood supply is critical for tumor growth, as it delivers the nutrients and oxygen required for development. Targeting of blood vessel formation via immunotherapies is an area of great importance. Knowing that certain embryonic genes, such as carcinoembryonic antigens (CEA) and oncofetal fibronectin, become reexpressed in malignant transformation, we hypothesized that a similar phenomenon holds true for tumor endothelial cells (TECs) as well. An approach for identification of highly selective tumor endothelial markers was conducted to develop targeted antiangiogenic immunotherapies. We first queried the transcriptome that is present during embryo development. We then performed a systematic search for genes selectively expressed in the mouse embryo at days E11 and E18, as compared to the transcriptome of the adult mouse. Subsequently, we queried for expression of these embryonic genes in sorted murine TECs. This approach identified among others the tumor endothelial antigens fibrillin-2 (Fbn2), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 2 (Emilin2) as well as the tumor endothelial antigens lysyl oxidase (Lox) and serine/cysteine protease inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1; Pai-1). For these selected genes, functional involvement in angiogenesis was confirmed in in vitro bioassays. We subsequently used iBoost conjugate vaccine technology to develop vaccines against the selected targets. For all four targets, vaccination readily induced target-specific antibody responses in mice, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Access to highly specific tumor endothelial markers provides opportunities for direct targeting of the tumor vasculature with high specificity, without affecting healthy vasculature.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between humans and pigs has changed dramatically since their domestication in southwest Asia and subsequent human-induced introduction into Europe. Introgression between incoming southwest Asian pigs and European boar resulted in the gradual replacement of southwest Asian ancestry in European pigs. However, we currently lack genomic data required to explore the regional trajectories, nature, and extent of contact between European boar and pigs that led to this turnover, and how this process was facilitated by human activity. We addressed this deficit by sequencing four Mesolithic boar and seven Neolithic pig samples from six archaeological sites in the Netherlands and Britain ranging from the Mesolithic (5500 BCE) to Neolithic (2500 BCE). Our data show that despite continuous gene flow with European boar, Neolithic European pigs show varying levels of southwest Asian ancestry. The low and varying southwest Asian ancestry in pigs from the Early Neolithic Dutch settlement Swifterbant indicates a high contribution of wild ancestry. The genetic profile, enriched δ 15 N values, on-site presence, and wide size distribution of Swifterbant Sus scrofa suggest a commensal relationship. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) imply that both closed-breeding and free-ranging management occurred in Neolithic communities, where the former showed an extreme burden of long segments of ROH. We further show selection signatures, associated with coat color and behavior, in Neolithic herds despite recurrent wild gene flow. Altogether, our results show distinct husbandry practices through space and time in Neolithic Europe, with heavy reliance on boar recruitment via the commensal pathway in northwest Europe.",

In this work, we identify FPR2 as a membrane receptor that specifically binds long-chain ceramides (C14-C20). In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis via G i -cyclic AMP signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors. Our findings provide a structural basis for adipocyte thermogenesis mediated by FPR2.",

Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22.

In this work, by leveraging remote-sensing data and physics-informed deep learning, we provide evidence over several ice shelves that the flow law follows a grain size–sensitive composite rheology in the compression zone. In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf–wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts.

Sunlight induces substantial and consistent N 2 O production under oxic abiotic conditions in fresh and marine waters. We measured photochemical N 2 O production rates using isotope tracers and determined that nitrite is the main substrate and that nitrate can also contribute after being photoreduced to nitrite. Additionally, this N 2 O production was strongly correlated to the radiation dose. Photochemodenitrification exceeded biological N 2 O production in surface waters. Although previously overlooked, this process may contribute considerably to global N 2 O emissions through its occurrence in fresh and marine surface waters.",

Unlike the highly diverse melanosomes discovered in feathered dinosaurs, hairs in six mammaliaforms of different lineages and diverse ecomorphotypes showed uniform melanosome geometry, corresponding to dark-brown coloration consistent with crypsis and nocturnality.

These maps provide improved extinction corrections for astronomical observations. We find that R ( V ) varies with extinction, consistent with dust grains growing by accretion in low-extinction regions and by coagulation in higher-extinction regions.

          "abstract": "Distributed across two continents and thousands of islands, the Asian tropics are among the most species-rich areas on Earth. The origins of this diversity, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal and classify contributions of individual tropical Asian regions to their overall diversity by leveraging species-level phylogenomic data and new fossils from the most species-rich Asian palm lineage, the rattans and relatives (Arecaceae, Calamoideae). Radiators (Borneo) generate and distribute diversity, incubators (Indochina, New Guinea, and Sulawesi) produce diversity in isolation, corridors (Java, Maluku, Sumatra, and the Thai-Malay Peninsula) connect neighboring regions, and accumulators (Australia, India, Palawan, and the Philippines) acquire diversity generated elsewhere. These contrasting contributions can be explained by differences in region size and isolation, elucidating how the unique island-dominated geography of the Asian tropics drives their outstanding biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "Although the global economy requires geological resource mining, production has substantial environmental impacts, including the use of regional available water. In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible. Future demand for geological resources is expected to require a considerable increase in water consumption. Considering the constraints of water resources in geological resource production is crucial for sustainability.",

We report the observation of the piezoelectric (PE) effect in half-Heusler (HH) narrow-bandgap semiconductors TiNiSn, ZrNiSn, and TiCoSb. These materials exhibit shear PE strain coefficients that reach ~38 and 33 picocoulombs per newton in ZrNiSn and TiCoSb, respectively, which are high values for noncentrosymmetric nonpolar materials. We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor. The PE effect in HHs remains thermally stable up to 1173 kelvin, underscoring their potential for high-temperature applications. Our observations suggest that these HH narrow-bandgap semiconductors may find promising applications for advanced multifunctional technologies.",

In this work, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of DMTs from two trypanosomatid species, Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata , at resolutions up to 2.7 angstrom. The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior. Our study shows that proper B-tubule closure is critical for flagellar motility, exemplifying how integrating structural identification with systematic gene deletion can dissect individual protein contributions to flagellar motility.",

          "abstract": "The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4 + T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt + APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses.",

Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting.",

The ability to measure and monitor the dynamic progression of tissue stiffness is important for generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. Methods to measure tissue properties in vivo have been emerging but present challenges with spatial and temporal resolution especially in 3D, by their reliance on highly specialized equipment, and/or due to their invasive nature. Here, we introduce light sheet elastography, a noninvasive method that couples low-frequency shear waves with light sheet fluorescence microscopy by adapting commercially available instruments. With this method, we achieved in toto stiffness mapping of organ-stage mouse and zebrafish embryos at cellular resolution. Versatility of the method enabled time-lapse stiffness mapping during tissue remodeling and of the beating embryonic heart. This method expands the spectrum of tools available to biologists and presents opportunities for uncovering the mechanical basis of morphogenesis.",

A 30-m-long sediment core from the Great Blue Hole, a marine sinkhole offshore Belize, provides the longest available, continuous, and annually resolved TC-frequency record. This record expands our understanding, derived from instrumental monitoring (73 years), historical documentations (173 years), and paleotempestological records (2000 years), to the past 5700 years. A total of 694 event layers were identified. They display a distinct regional trend of increasing storminess in the southwestern Caribbean, which follows an orbitally driven shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Superimposed short-term variations match Holocene climate intervals and originate from solar irradiance–controlled sea-surface temperature anomalies and climate phenomena modes. A 21st-century extrapolation suggests an unprecedented increase in TC frequency, attributable to the Industrial Age warming.",

Montmorillonite was selected for supporting biofilm formation due to its cation-exchange capability and clearly defined biosafety. The montmorillonite-LA biofilm was effectively protected by the microparticles and markedly improved the intestinal retention. Upon oral administration, the composite microparticles notably alleviated colitis in mice, including reducing the inflammatory response, improving intestinal barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiota. Consequently, the composite microparticles show high potential for enhancing probiotic delivery efficacy and present a promising strategy for UC treatment.",

          "abstract": "Endoreplication is characterized by multiple rounds of DNA replication without cell division and determines the growth and final size of endoreplicating cells and tissues in eukaryotes. The cyclic ubiquitination and degradation of several cell cycle regulators are required for endoreplication progression. However, the deubiquitinase that deubiquitinates and stabilizes key factors to modulate endoreplication remains unknown. Here, we found in the endoreplicating Drosophila salivary gland and Bombyx silk gland that the depletion of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) led to endoreplication arrest and a decrease in gland size. Mechanistically, we showed that USP8 interacted with the Fizzy-related (Fzr) protein, a conserved master regulator of endoreplication, thereby deubiquitinating and stabilizing Fzr to modulate endoreplication. Moreover, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) mediated proper folding of Fzr and increased the interaction between Fzr and USP8, thereby promoting the deubiquitination and stabilization of Fzr. Together, our study demonstrates that USP8 and Hsp70 regulate endoreplication by synergistically maintaining Fzr stability though deubiquitination.",

Here, we describe a nickel-catalyzed asymmetric radical-based electrochemical functionalization of silyl polyenolates at α-, γ-, ε-, and η-positions. Driven by electric current, this methodology provides a sustainable route to access enantioenriched dicarbonyls via vinylogous radical pathways. It demonstrates excellent functional groups tolerance, mild reaction conditions, broad substrate compatibility, formation of quaternary stereocenters at remote positions, and high levels of regio- and enantioselectivity (up to 98% enantiomeric excess). Mechanistic investigations indicate that ferrocene-based electron transfer mediators are pivotal in the anodic oxidation process, facilitating the generation of nickel-bound α-carbonyl radicals while suppressing the undesired oxidation of silyl polyenolates, thus guiding the selection of mediators for electrocatalytic systems. The versatility of catalytic asymmetric electrosynthesis is highlighted by the preparation of valuable enantioenriched building blocks and the total synthesis of (-)-ethosuximide.",

It also improved cerebral and multiorgan perfusion. Mechanistically, LIPUS activated pathways related to sympathetic nerve excitation and vascular smooth muscle contraction, increasing plasma catecholamines and stimulating blood pressure–regulating neural nuclei. Partial sympathetic nerve transection reduced LIPUS efficacy, while complete inhibition of these nuclei abolished the response. Preliminary clinical trials demonstrated LIPUS’s ability to raise blood pressure in shock patients. The findings suggest that LIPUS enhances sympathetic nerve activity and activates blood pressure–regulating nuclei, offering a noninvasive, neuromodulation-based approach to shock treatment.

After use in affinity selection, treatment with dithiothreitol enables near-quantitative reduction, rendering linear peptide analogs for standard tandem mass spectrometry.

Structure-activity relationship studies of an initial cadherin-binding peptide [ CBP ; apparent dissociation constant ( K d ) = 53 nanomolar] reveal residues responsible for driving affinity (hotspots) and mutation-tolerant residues (coldspots). Two original macrocyclic libraries are prepared in which these hotspots and coldspots are derivatized with nonnatural amino acids. Following discovery and validation, high-affinity ligands are discovered from the coldspot library, with NCBP-4 demonstrating improved affinity ( K d = 29 nanomolar).

The abundance of labile proteinaceous material diminishes from epipelagic to mesopelagic waters but notably increases in bathypelagic waters, where it exhibits a short turnover time (days) and resembles surface plankton in molecular composition. This observation coincides with peak zooplankton biomass recorded over the year. The nonmonotonic depth trend suggests a deep-sea replenishment of organic particles from mesopelagic migrating zooplankton.

Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to Dmd mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids.

We analyzed 22 steroids from 148 serum samples of individuals aged 20 to 73, using 98 samples for model training and 50 for validation. Our model reflects the often-overlooked fact that aging heterogeneity expands over time and uncovers sex-specific variations in steroidogenesis. This study leveraged key markers, including cortisol (COL), which underscore the role of stress-related and sex-specific steroids in aging. The resulting model establishes a biologically meaningful and robust framework for predicting BA across diverse datasets, offering fresh insights and supporting more targeted strategies in aging research and disease management.",

This nanosensor, designed to respond to the proteolytic activity of AS-associated dysregulated enzymes, entails CQDs as signal reporters to convert AS-associated proteolytic activity to fluorometric readings enabling a sensitive and cost-effective urine-based assay for early AS detection. Our findings demonstrated that the nanosensor provided distinct signals in atherosclerotic versus healthy mice at early AS stages, indicating its diagnostic potential. Moreover, toxicity tests showed no notable adverse effects, supporting its safety for diagnostic applications.

Previously, we identified a nucleus-encoded dynamin-like protein, called ETP9, that localizes at the endosymbiont division site of A. deanei . Here, we found by comparative genomics that endosymbionts throughout the Strigomonadinae lost the capacity to autonomously form a division septum. We describe the cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization of ETP9 that follows accumulation of the bacterium-encoded division protein FtsZ at the endosymbiont division site. Furthermore, we found that ETP9 is essential in symbiotic but dispensable in aposymbiotic A. deanei that lost the endosymbiont. In the symbiotic strain, ETP9 knockdowns resulted in filamentous, division-impaired endosymbionts.

SlGATA6 up-regulates the expression of SlLAX2 and SlIAA3 .

As a proof-of-principle demonstration, a special Schottky heterojunction film composed of gold and alkaline magnesium-iron mixed metal oxides (Au/MgFe-MMO) was constructed on the titanium implant. Once bacteria contacted this implant, the Au/MgFe-MMO film continuously captured the proton and electron participated in respiratory chain of bacteria to impede their energy metabolism, leading to the deficit of adenosine 5′-triphosphate. Prolonged exposure to this starvation state inhibited numerous biosynthesis processes and triggered severe oxidative stress in bacteria, ultimately leading to their death due to DNA and membrane damage. In addition, this heterojunction film was comfortable for mammalian cells, without inhibiting mitochondrial function.

PPDPF was predominantly expressed in healthy proximal tubules of human and mouse kidneys via single-cell analysis. Further investigations revealed that PPDPF functioned as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase to maintain cellular NAD + levels. Deficiency in PPDPF disrupted NAD + and mitochondrial homeostasis by impairing the activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferases (NMNATs), thereby compromising the function of proximal tubules during injuries.

          "abstract": "Perovskite quantum dots (QDs) show an excellent application perspective in semiconductor optoelectronic devices. However, problems of ligand loss during the growth, purification, film formation, and storage process always induce the aggregation and ripening of QDs, adversely affecting QDs’ and QD-based devices’ performance. Here, we use a bidentate molecule to control ripening toward a notable performance boost in CsPbI 3 QDs. The strong interaction between QDs and the bidentate molecules maintains stable surface states of QDs, inhibiting QDs’ undesirable ripening and generation of defects. We fabricate QD-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.0% at 686 nm and an operating half-life of 10,587 hours at an initial radiance of 190 mW sr −1 m −2 (equivalent to a luminance of 100 cd m −2 for green perovskite LEDs). Benefiting from the high storability of the target QDs, the as-fabricated devices based on the QD solution storing for 1 month show a maximum EQE of 21.7% (20.3% for 3 months).",

In this work, the cause of coloring in the STRAP-recycled polyethylene (PE) resins from postindustrial printed films was identified as decomposed diarylide pigments. Two different approaches are needed to completely remove the dissolved colorants during the STRAP process including (i) adding an activated carbon (AC) adsorbent to the solvent after polymer dissolution and (ii) proper mechanical filtration of the polymer-solvent cake to remove as much solvent from the cake as possible. Colorless recycled PE can be produced by a combination of the proposed approaches (choosing the proper solvent, adding an AC adsorbent, and doing proper mechanical filtration) with minimal accumulation of colorants in the recycled STRAP solvents. This study demonstrated that high-quality STRAP low-density PE can be obtained from printed plastic films, enhancing the potential circularity of these packaging materials.",

Due to limitations such as lack of selectivity, traditional antibiotic therapies face obstacles in eliminating intratumoral bacteria. Herein, this work proposes the use of therapeutic vaccines to selectively target and eliminate harmful bacteria within tumors. A multivalent vaccine encapsulating both insoluble and soluble bacterial antigens was developed, addressing the shortcomings of traditional antibacterial vaccines by balancing broad antigen coverage with effective immune activation. This vaccine induces robust downstream immune responses to eliminate F. nucleatum , S. sanguis , E. faecalis , and S. xylosus , demonstrating notable therapeutic and preventive efficacy in bacteria-induced cancer metastasis models. Unexpectedly, vaccinated infected mice showed even slower tumor metastasis than uninfected mice. Overall, this study validates the potential of nanovaccines in modulating the intratumoral microbiome for tumor therapy and highlights tumor-associated bacterial infections as potential promising antitumor targets.",

This study focuses on the fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.",

However, one of the major roadblocks in implementing OAM-based applications with their full potentials is the absence of an ideal OAM-mode detector. Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any previous information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100. We expect our work to substantially boost the OAM-based photonic quantum technology efforts.",

Herein, we propose an oxygen vacancy–rich (BiFe) 0.9 (BaTi) 0.1 O 3− x nanoreactor as a piezoelectric sonosensitizer by spatiotemporal ultrasound–driven sono- and chemodynamic tandem catalysis to amplify antibacterial efficacy. The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O 2 and H 2 O, efficiently generating H 2 O 2 . The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H 2 O 2 /Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death. Thus, the porous titanium scaffold, engineered with a piezoelectric nanoreactor, demonstrates superior antibacterial efficacy under ultrasound and facilitates osteogenesis via piezoelectric immunomodulation–activated therapy.",

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment. This research fills a critical gap in adhesion physics.",

However, the PM components responsible for observed health effects remain unclear. Oxidative potential (OP) has gained increasing attention as a key property that may explain PM toxicity. Using online measurement methods that impinge particles for OP quantification within seconds, we reveal that 60 to 99% of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and OP in secondary organic aerosol and combustion-generated PM have a lifetime of minutes to hours and that the ROS activity of ambient PM decays substantially before offline analysis. This implies that current offline measurement methods substantially underestimate the true OP of PM. We demonstrate that short-lived OP components activate different toxicity pathways upon direct deposition onto reconstituted human bronchial epithelia. Therefore, we suggest that future air pollution and health studies should include online OP quantification, allowing more accurate assessments of links between OP and health effects.",

Here, combining first-principles calculations and machine learning molecular dynamics, we unravel the interplay between perovskite octahedral lattice dynamics and energy barrier associated with ion migration. Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties.

The hydrogen bonds shorter than 2.5 angstrom are expected to accelerate the ion transport. However, short hydrogen bonds (SHBs) can hardly form naturally because of the electron-withdrawing capability of O atom, which impedes its applications in water-mediated ion transport. This work develops an interlayer confinement strategy to construct SHB networks in a two-dimensional (2D) nanocapillary assembled by bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets and boost the ionic conductivity of HEMs. With confined nanochannels and adjustable hydrophilic groups in BiOI-based HEMs, the number of SHBs increases by 12 times, creating a shortcut for the Grotthuss-type anion transport, which in turn affords a high ionic conductivity of 168 millisiemens per centimeter at 90°C, higher than polymeric HEM and 2D-based HEM. This work demonstrates the facile approach to generating SHB networks in 2D capillaries and opens a promising avenue to developing advanced HEMs.",

The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes.",

Nevertheless, conventional spike sorting methods face limitations in recognizing diverse spike shapes. Here, we introduce PseudoSorter, which uses self-supervised learning techniques, a density-based pseudolabeling strategy, and an iterative fine-tuning process to enhance spike sorting accuracy. Through benchmarking, we demonstrate the superior performance of PseudoSorter compared to other spike sorting algorithms before applying PseudoSorter on MEA recordings from hippocampal neurons exposed to subneuronal concentrations of monomeric Tau as a model for Alzheimer’s disease. Our results unveil that Tau diminishes the firing rate of a subset of neurons, which complement our findings observed using conventional electrophysiology analysis, and demonstrate that PseudoSorter’s high accuracy and throughput make it a valuable tool for studying neurodegenerative diseases, enhancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms, as well as for therapeutic drug screening.",

          "abstract": "Stretched-exponential protein refolding kinetics, first observed decades ago, were attributed to a nonnative ensemble of structures with parallel, non-interconverting folding pathways. However, the structural origin of the large energy barriers preventing interconversion between these folding pathways is unknown. Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics.",

By combining RNA sequencing of nuclear, cytoplasmic, and newly synthesized transcript fractions with biophysical modeling in mouse embryonic stem cells, we demonstrate that transcriptional changes caused by TIP60 depletion are offset by corresponding changes in RNA nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability, indicating gene-specific buffering. Disruption of the unrelated ATAC coactivator complex also causes gene-specific transcript buffering. We propose that cells dynamically adjust RNA splicing, export, and degradation in response to individual RNA synthesis alterations, thereby sustaining cellular homeostasis.",

While direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are highly effective, timely and accurate HCV diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings. The current two-step HCV testing process is costly and time-intensive, often leading to patient loss before treatment. Point-of-care (POC) HCV antigen (Ag) testing offers a promising alternative, but no FDA-approved test meets the required sensitivity and specificity. To address this, we developed a fully automated, smartphone-based POC HCV Ag assay using platinum nanoparticles, deep learning image processing, and microfluidics.

          "abstract": "The amplified wintertime Arctic warming has accelerated in recent decades. However, whether and how the warming can cause Eurasian cooling remains debated. By identifying daily Arctic warming events, we find direct observational evidence that the Arctic warming tends to cause substantial Eurasian cooling and an increase in occurrence frequency of Eurasian cooling events with a roughly 2-day lag. We propose a mechanism explaining the causality. We find that the Arctic warming causes a large suppression in activities of daily weather disturbances (referred to as synoptic eddies) over high-latitude Eurasia. This produces a meridional dipole in geopotential height anomalies characterized by an equivalent-barotropic anomalous low (high) and a lower-level cooling (warming) over mid-latitude Eurasia (the Arctic) via a nonlinear eddy–to–mean flow feedback. The feedback induces near-surface northeasterly anomalies that enlarge the Eurasian cooling via cold advection. Thus, we conclude that the warm Arctic versus cold Eurasia is essentially an intrinsic dipole determined by synoptic eddy–mean flow interaction.",

Water also serves as the prototype for directional hydrogen bonding at ambient conditions. However, the question of whether supercritical water is still hydrogen-bonded or how water molecules interact en route to the supercritical regime is a matter of controversial discussions. We present terahertz (THz) spectra, which directly probe the intermolecular interactions of water under these extreme conditions. While we spectroscopically detect the liquid-gas phase transition just below the critical point, THz spectra of the high-temperature gas phase are indistinguishable from those of supercritical water at the same density. The accompanying ab initio simulations provide the molecular underpinnings: The water-water contacts at supercritical conditions are essentially orientationally random.",

We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, redefining standards in reflectometry. Our method, prior-amortized neural posterior estimation (PANPE), combines simulation-based inference with adaptive priors that inform the inference network about known structural properties and controllable experimental conditions. PANPE networks support key scenarios such as high-throughput sample characterization, real-time monitoring of evolving structures, or the corefinement of several experimental datasets and can be adapted to provide fast, reliable, and flexible inference across many other inverse problems.",

By performing a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we identified the transcription factors IRF1 and TFAP4 as key regulators for Galectin-9 expression by binding its regulatory elements. Whereas IRF1 was observed exclusively on the promoter, TFAP4 binding was detected at an enhancer solely in T-ALL cells associated with higher Galectin-9 levels. Together, our results show that IRF1 is responsible and indispensable for Galectin-9 expression and TFAP4 further fine-tunes its expression.

Spd-2/CEP192 proteins, defined by a conserved “Spd-2 domain” (SP2D) comprising two closely spaced AspM-Spd-2-Hydin (ASH) domains, play a critical role in centrosome assembly. Here, we show that the SP2D does not target Drosophila Spd-2 to centrosomes but rather promotes PCM scaffold assembly. Crystal structures of the human and honeybee SP2D reveal an unusual “extended cradle” structure mediated by a conserved interaction interface between the two ASH domains. Mutations predicted to perturb this interface, including a human mutation associated with male infertility and Mosaic Variegated Aneuploidy, disrupt PCM scaffold assembly in flies. The SP2D is monomeric in solution, but the Drosophila SP2D can form higher-order oligomers upon phosphorylation by PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1). Crystal-packing interactions and AlphaFold predictions suggest how SP2Ds might self-assemble, and mutations associated with one such potential dimerization interface markedly perturb SP2D oligomerization in vitro and PCM scaffold assembly in vivo.",

This mechanism exhibits low robustness due to its high dependence on the physical properties and flow conditions of fluids. Here, we report a robust emulsification mechanism—wetting-induced interfacial instability—for droplet emission. We find that, when pendant microdroplets in the air contact with an immiscible wetting bulk phase, it triggers interfacial instability in the hanging droplets and then their rapid breakup into the bulk phase. This simplifies the monodisperse microdroplet production using a nozzle positioned above an air-liquid interface, requiring no complex microchannels. We demonstrate that this method exhibits highly scalable production and exceptional robustness against variations in physical properties and flow conditions of fluids, including highly viscous non-Newtonian fluid (56,600 millipascal-seconds). This mechanism provides a simpler alternative to the traditional Rayleigh-Plateau instability for emulsification, offering opportunities for industrial applications and insights into microscale interfacial science.",

To achieve this, we developed a photoacoustic polarization–enhanced optical rotation sensing (PAPEORS) system, capable of estimating optical rotation from photoacoustic signals and correlating it with chiral molecular concentration for depths up to 3.5 mm. Experiments were conducted using aqueous glucose solutions, naproxen, serum-based glucose samples, and ex vivo chicken tissue. PAPEORS achieved a detection limit of 80 mg/dl while using circularly polarized light with serum samples, demonstrating the potential for deep-tissue chiral molecular sensing.

This transition capability is achieved by mastering the complex transport of large-size polycations within the channel through well-designed drain electrodes. Frame drains positioned atop the organic channel act as ion barriers, regulating the penetration and relaxation of polycations. This regulation allows our multilevel synaptic OECTs to transform from short-term depression (STD) to STD-based long-term memory, and eventually to long-term depression (LTD). Conversely, placing frame drains beneath the channel exposes the polyelectrolyte fully, hence yielding high-density logic OECTs, which have been successfully used to construct unipolar integrated circuits such as NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These achievements represent a substantial advancement in manipulating polyelectrolyte-based ionic-electronic interactions, introducing more possibilities beyond small ion-based OECTs.",

Despite the known links between the medial habenula (MHb) and nicotine avoidance, the ionic mechanisms underlying MHb neuronal responses to nicotine remain unclear. Here, we report that MHb neurons use a long-lasting refractory period (LLRP) as an unconventional inhibitory mechanism to curb hyperexcitability. This process is initiated by nicotine-induced calcium influx through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which activates a calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC). Owing to high intracellular chloride levels in MHb neurons, chloride efflux through CaCC, coupled with high-threshold voltage-gated calcium channels, sustains MHb depolarization near the chloride equilibrium potential of −30 millivolts, thereby enabling LLRP. Concurrently, calcium-activated BK potassium channels counteract this depolarization, promoting LLRP termination. Our findings reveal an atypical inhibitory mechanism, orchestrated by synergistic actions between calcium-permeable and calcium-activated channels.

          "abstract": "With the advancement of magnetization-based spintronic applications, there has been considerable interest in spin-orbit torque as an electric technique to dynamically manipulate magnetization. In this study, gate-induced ON-OFF switchable spin-orbit torque in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device using the ionic gating technique is reported. By canceling the spin currents from Pt layers, the OFF state is attained in Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device. Notably, under a strong negative gate electric field applied to the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device, the damping-like spin-orbit torque is markedly enhanced over sixfold compared with the applied positive gate electric field. We show that the gate modulation of the spin-orbit torque in the Pt/Co/Pt spin-orbit device can be explained by considering the change of the spin-charge interconversion by electric gating. This research serves as a promising avenue for electrically programmable spintronic devices.",

In this study, we engineered neutrophil membrane–fused mitochondria (nMITO), which combine the injury-targeting and anti-inflammatory properties of neutrophil membrane proteins with the cell repairing function of mitochondria. nMITO effectively blocked inflammatory cascades and restored mitochondrial function, targeting both key mechanisms in acute organ injuries. In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage. These findings suggest that nMITO is a promising therapeutic strategy for managing acute organ injuries.",

They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, modifying light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay enables spectral shaping for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities. Here, we propose a framework that uses interference of multiple transverse modes within a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our method applies to orthogonal modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, offering potential for sensing, calibration, metrology, and computing.",

Here, we use an extended dynamical adjustment method to separate the effects of internal dynamics and thermodynamically forced BKS warming on atmospheric circulation, relying solely on observations. Evidence shows that the observed link between BKS warming and Eurasian cooling is influenced by both atmospheric internal variability and forced BKS warming. Internal variability, particularly the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly contributed to the observed Eurasian cooling from 1991 to 2012. While BKS warming has a weaker impact on Eurasian cooling on interannual to interdecadal timescales, it notably affects multidecadal scales, contributing to the observed “warming hole” in central Eurasia during 1980–2022. Our findings suggest a weak but non-negligible Eurasian cooling response to BKS warming on multidecadal timescales.

However, the mechanism by which assembly occurs remains poorly understood, and few intermediate states are available to illuminate the expansion of meta-stable procapsids into robust mature capsids. Here, we present the structure of a partially expanded phi29 procapsid that reveals distinct conformations of MCPs and allows visualization of SPs in multiple oligomeric states. These results suggest that formation of SP dimers, tetramers, and higher-order oligomers drives dissociation of SP from MCP to actuate capsid expansion. Hexons expand first, and we propose penton maturation is delayed by a symmetry match with SP oligomers. We further show that the prolate shape of phi29’s capsid is possible due to concave hexons in the equatorial region of the capsid that may alter interactions with SP and explain the observed dependence of the prolate shape on SP.",

Here, we have designed a hierarchical Si-based photocathode for l -Phe synthesis by photoelectrochemical coupling of waste CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, achieving a high yield rate of 37.5 μg·hour −1 ·cm −2 and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 21.2% at low applied potential under 1 sun illumination. The hierarchical structure with CuO-TiO 2 -C mixtures dispersed in amorphous TiO 2 layer/n + p-Si creates an internal built-in electric field and forms plentiful conducting channels to efficiently realize the injection of electrons into Cu and Ti sites. These Cu and Ti sites adsorb and activate the CO 2 and nitrophenyl ethane, respectively, cooperatively facilitating the l -Phe synthesis.

We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials.",

Results reveal a key period between weeks 4 and 6 with elevated intra-organoid oxygen tension, altered energy homeostasis, and rapid neurogenesis within the organoids.

For this purpose, an assemblage with restored Corallium rubrum colonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales.",

Myofibroblasts further differentiate into osteoblast-like cells and produce calcium nanoparticles, driving valve calcification in males. We hypothesized that the lysine demethylase UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked) decreases methylation uniquely in male VICs responding to nanoscale extracellular matrix cues to promote an osteoblast-like cell phenotype. Here, we describe a hydrogel biomaterial cell culture platform to interrogate how nanoscale cues modulate sex-specific methylation states in VICs activating to myofibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells.

How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that the Drosophila ABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus, Eato deficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additional Eato loss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescue Eato loss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases.",

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of LIPT1 in regulating DNA damage and chromosome stability and may suggest a means to enhance therapeutic outcomes with DNA-damaging agents.",

Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.",

Targeted delivery is demanded because of the off-target accumulation of drugs in normal lung tissues caused by inhalation and the limited motion dexterity of clinical bronchoscopes in tortuous bronchial trees. Herein, we developed microrobotic swarms consisting of magnetic hydrogel microparticles to achieve intrabronchial targeted delivery. Under programmed magnetic fields, the microgel particle swarms performed controllable locomotion and adaptative structure reconfiguration in tortuous and air-filled environments. The swarms were further integrated with imaging contrast agents for precise tracking under x-ray fluoroscopy and computed tomography imaging. Magnetic navigation of the swarms in an ex vivo lung phantom and in vivo delivery into deep branches of the bronchial trees were achieved. The on-demand reconfiguration of swarms for avoiding the microgel particles from entering nontarget bronchi and the precise delivery into tilted bronchi through climbing motion were validated.",

Here, we introduce a liquid-bodied antibiofilm robot constructed by a dynamically cross-linked magnetic hydrogel. Leveraging the viscoelastic response of the robot enables it to adapt to complex surface topographies such as medical meshes and stents. Upon actuation, the robot can mechanically destroy the biofilm matrix, chemically deactivate bacterial cells, and collect disrupted biofilm debris. The robot’s antibiofilm performance is studied in vitro and demonstrated on a medical mesh and a biliary stent. Tracking and navigation under endoscopy and x-ray imaging in an ex vivo porcine bile duct are demonstrated.

Molecular docking and enzyme activity experiments have demonstrated that Z24 can affect the function of Bcthi4. Last, mechanistic studies show that Z24 inhibits thiamine biosynthesis by binding to Bcthi4 and induces up-regulation of alternative splicing [alternative 5′ splice site (A5SS)] of the Bcthi4 gene.

Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature.",

          "abstract": "Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and Max-like protein X (MLX) form a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that couples intracellular sugar levels to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway–specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.",

Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear. We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.",

Enteroviruses use the cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5′ end of the genome to balance these two processes. Cloverleaf acts as a promoter for RNA synthesis and forms a complex with viral 3CD protein, the precursor to 3C pro protease, and 3D pol polymerase. The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3C pro domain, yet how 3C pro promotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3C pro complex, wherein two 3C pro molecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3C pro dimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3C pro is a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein. We show that 3CD protein also dimerizes on cloverleaf RNA and binds the RNA with higher affinity than 3C pro . The structure provides insight into the RNA-binding mechanism of 3C pro or 3CD with other cis-acting replication elements.",

We find that these expectations directly modulate the perception of pain in the thermal grill illusion. Quantitative microstructural brain imaging further revealed that individual variability in computational parameters related to uncertainty-driven learning and decision-making is reflected in the microstructure of brain regions such as the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, cerebellum, as well as basal ganglia and brainstem.

Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years. Our research indicates that moderate hydrological fluctuations throughout the crisis sustained this refugium, likely making it one of the sources for the rapid radiation of terrestrial life in the early Mesozoic.",

By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies.

          "abstract": "Understanding plastics’ harmful impacts on wildlife would benefit from the application of hypothesis agnostic testing commonly used in medical research to detect declines in population health. Adopting a data-driven, proteomic approach, we assessed changes in 745 proteins in a free-living nonmodel organism with differing levels of plastic exposure. Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in &lt;90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic. The proteomic signatures reflect the effects of plastic distal to the site of exposure (i.e., the stomach). Notably, metrics commonly used to assess condition in wildlife (such as body mass) do not provide an accurate description of health or the impacts of plastic ingestion.",

          "abstract": "Brain age gap (BAG), the deviation between estimated brain age and chronological age, is a promising marker of brain health. However, the genetic architecture and reliable targets for brain aging remains poorly understood. In this study, we estimate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based brain age using deep learning models trained on the UK Biobank and validated with three external datasets. A genome-wide association study for BAG identified two unreported loci and seven previously reported loci. By integrating Mendelian Randomization (MR) and colocalization analysis on eQTL and pQTL data, we prioritized seven genetically supported druggable genes, including MAPT , TNFSF12 , GZMB , SIRPB1 , GNLY , NMB , and C1RL , as promising targets for brain aging. We rediscovered 13 potential drugs with evidence from clinical trials of aging and prioritized several drugs with strong genetic support. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of brain aging, potentially facilitating drug development for brain aging to extend the health span.",

          "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is an inevitable stage in the progression of most chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment of liver fibrosis are crucial for effectively managing chronic liver conditions. However, there lacks a noninvasive and sensitive imaging method capable of early assessing fibrosis activity. Here, we report a molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe for imaging fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) even in very early fibrotic livers. This method relies on FAP-catalyzed in situ self-assembly of its substrate probe that leads to the increase of the rotational correlation time (τ R ) of probe, thereby notably amplifies T 1 MRI signal. Thanks to the superior specificity and efficiency of enzymatic reaction, our method has been validated as highly selective and sensitive to FAP in two liver fibrosis mouse models. By establishing a direct correlation between MRI signals and fibrosis activity, our method enables continuous monitoring of liver fibrotic disease progression and assessment of treatment responses.",

          "abstract": "Polymer blend films exhibit unique properties and have applications in various fields. However, understanding their nanoscale structures and polymer component distributions remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy–based technique called oxygen-excluded nanoimaging. By using point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography with sulfonate-based dye molecules, we achieved nanoscale imaging of polymer blend films while specifically labeling non-oxygen domains and excluding oxygen-containing domains. This selectivity is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the dye molecules and the oxygen atoms in the polymer side chains. We demonstrate the applicability of oxygen-excluded nanoimaging to various polymer blend films, enabling domain identification and visualization of nanoscale structures. Our oxygen-excluded nanoimaging technique provides unique insights into the complex phase separation behavior of polymer blends at the nanoscale, opening possibilities for the nanoscale characterization of a wide range of materials beyond polymer blends.",
