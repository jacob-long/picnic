          "abstract": "Bacteria use diverse mechanisms to protect themselves against phages 1–6 . Many antiphage systems form large oligomeric complexes, but how oligomerization is regulated during phage infection remains mostly unknown 7–12 . Here we demonstrate that the bacterial immunity protein ring-activated zinc-finger RNase (RAZR) assembles into an active, 24-meric ring around the circumference of large ring structures formed by two unrelated phage proteins: a putative recombinase and a portal protein. Each multi-layered, megadalton-scale complex enables RAZR to cleave RNA nonspecifically to inhibit translation and restrict phage propagation. The recognition of unrelated phage proteins that form rings with similar diameters indicates that these proteins not only bind to RAZR but also enforce a geometry crucial to activation. The lack of large ring structures in the host probably prevents auto-immunity and RAZR activation before infection. The infection-triggered oligomerization of RAZR mirrors pathogen-induced oligomerization in eukaryotic innate immune complexes 13 , underscoring a common principle of immunity across biology.",

          "abstract": "Scientific progress depends on the ability of researchers to synthesize the growing body of literature. Can large language models (LLMs) assist scientists in this task? Here we introduce OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented language model (LM)1 that answers scientific queries by identifying relevant passages from 45 million open-access papers and synthesizing citation-backed responses. To evaluate OpenScholar, we develop ScholarQABench, the first large-scale multi-domain benchmark for literature search, comprising 2,967 expert-written queries and 208 long-form answers across computer science, physics, neuroscience and biomedicine. Despite being a smaller open model, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 6.1% and PaperQA2 by 5.5% in correctness on a challenging multi-paper synthesis task from the new ScholarQABench. Although GPT-4o hallucinates citations 78–90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts. OpenScholar’s data store, retriever and self-feedback inference loop improve off-the-shelf LMs: for instance, OpenScholar-GPT-4o improves the correctness of GPT-4o by 12%. In human evaluations, experts preferred OpenScholar-8B and OpenScholar-GPT-4o responses over expert-written ones 51% and 70% of the time, respectively, compared with 32% for GPT-4o. We open-source all artefacts, including our code, models, data store, datasets and a public demo.",

          "abstract": "Photoreceptor proteins regulate fundamental biological processes such as vision, photosynthesis and circadian rhythms1. A large photoreceptor subfamily uses vitamin B12 derivatives for light sensing2, contrasting with the well-established mode of action of these organometallic derivatives in thermally activated enzymatic reactions3. The exact molecular mechanism of B12 photoreception and how this differs from the thermal pathways remains unknown. Here we provide a detailed description of photoactivation in the prototypical B12 photoreceptor CarH4,5 from nanoseconds to seconds, combining time-resolved and temperature-resolved structural and spectroscopic methods with quantum chemical calculations. Building on the crystal structures of the initial tetrameric dark and final monomeric light-activated states5, our structural snapshots of key intermediates in the truncated B12-binding domain illustrate how photocleavage of a cobalt–carbon (Co–C) bond within the B12 chromophore adenosylcobalamin triggers a series of structural changes that propagate throughout CarH. Breakage of the photolabile Co–C5′ bond leads to the formation of a previously unknown adduct that links the C4′ position of the adenosyl moiety to the Co ion and can subsequently be cleaved thermally over longer timescales to allow release of the adenosyl group, ultimately causing tetramer dissociation4,5. This adduct, which differentiates CarH from thermally activated B12 enzymes, steers the photoactivation pathway and acts as the molecular bridge between photochemical and photobiological timescales. The biological relevance of our study is corroborated by kinetic data on full-length CarH in the presence of DNA. Our results offer a spatiotemporal understanding of CarH photoactivation and pave the way for designing B12-dependent photoreceptors for optogenetic applications.",

          "abstract": "Body–brain communication has emerged as a key regulator of tissue homeostasis 1–5 . Solid tumours are innervated by different branches of the peripheral nervous system and increased tumour innervation is associated with poor cancer outcomes 6–8 . However, it remains unclear how the brain senses and responds to tumours in peripheral organs, and how tumour–brain communication influences cancer immunity. Here we identify a tumour–brain axis that promotes oncogenesis by establishing an immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Combining genetically engineered mouse models with neural tracing, tissue imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that lung adenocarcinoma induces innervation and functional engagement of vagal sensory neurons, a major interoceptive system connecting visceral organs to the brain. Mechanistically, Npy2r -expressing vagal sensory nerves transmit signals from lung tumours to brainstem nuclei, driving elevated sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment. This, in turn, suppresses anti-tumour immunity via β 2 adrenergic signalling in alveolar macrophages. Disruption of this sensory-to-sympathetic pathway through genetic, pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches significantly inhibited lung tumour growth by enhancing immune responses against cancer. Collectively, these results reveal a bidirectional tumour–brain communication involving vagal sensory input and sympathetic output that cooperatively regulate anti-cancer immunity; targeting this tumour–brain circuit may provide new treatments for visceral organ cancers.",

          "abstract": "Fractionalization of the electron charge e is one of the most striking phenomena arising from strong electron–electron interactions. A celebrated example is the emergence of anyons with fractional charges in fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Recently, zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCIs)14,15,16,17,18,19, lattice analogues of the FQHE states that form without Landau levels, have been realized20,21. FCIs provide a unique platform to investigate anyons, yet their detection remains a challenge. Here we report the observation of anyon–trions, a new type of excitonic complex formed by binding a trion with a fractional charge in twisted MoTe2 bilayers. Photoluminescence spectroscopy of quantum-confined excitons reveals emergent peaks that appear only within slightly doped FCI states. The new spectral features are red-shifted relative to the trions in undoped FCIs, but share the same electric field, temperature and magnetic field dependence. These observations suggest their origin as trions binding with elementary quasi-particles, that is, anyon–trions. Crucially, the ratio of binding energies between the anyon–trions in the −2/3 and −3/5 FCI states matches the expected fractional charge ratio of e/3 to e/5. This provides strong evidence for fractional charges in FCI—an essential property of anyons. Our results address a fundamental question in FCI physics and establish trion spectroscopy as a powerful probe of fractionally charged excitations, complementary to transport- and tunnelling-based approaches.",

          "abstract": "Animals use 18–33-nucleotide PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to silence transposons in germ cells 1–3 . In addition to transposon-silencing piRNAs, placental mammals make pachytene piRNAs 4,5 , an abundant class of testis-specific small RNAs derived from long noncoding RNA precursors. Although the sites of pachytene piRNA precursor transcription are often conserved among placental mammals, the sequences of the piRNAs themselves are rapidly diverging, even in the human population 6 . Consequently, the biological function and mechanism of action of pachytene piRNAs remain debated. Here we report that most mouse pachytene piRNAs have no biological function but instead ‘selfishly’ promote their own production. Our data suggest that pachytene piRNAs direct endonucleolytic cleavage of partially complementary targets and neither activate nor repress mRNA translation. Although many pachytene piRNAs guide cleavage of specific mRNAs, few alter the steady-state abundance of their targets. The minority of pachytene piRNAs that reduce target mRNA abundance enhance sperm fitness, thereby ensuring production of the entire pachytene piRNA repertoire. Together, our findings explain the lack of conservation of most pachytene piRNA sequences and suggest that these ‘selfish’ small RNAs persist in mammalian evolution because target cleavage by a tiny minority of piRNAs supports male fertility.",

          "abstract": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an essential adaptor in the cytosolic DNA-sensing innate immune pathway1. STING is activated by cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) produced by the DNA sensor cGAMP synthase (cGAS)2,3,4,5. cGAMP-induced high-order oligomerization and translocation of STING from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles are critical for STING activation6,7,8,9,10,11. Other studies have shown that phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PtdInsPs) and cholesterol also have important roles in STING activation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we demonstrate that cGAMP-induced high-order oligomerization of STING is enhanced strongly by phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5)P2, and by PtdIns4P to a lesser extent. Our cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal that PtdInsPs together with cholesterol bind at the interface between STING dimers, directly promoting the high-order oligomerization. The structures also provide an explanation for the preference of the STING oligomer to different PtdInsPs. Mutational and biochemical analyses confirm the binding modes of PtdInsPs and cholesterol and their roles in STING activation. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of STING mediated by specific lipids, which may underlie the role of intracellular trafficking in dictating STING signalling.",

Existing algorithms1,2 capable of near-T2T assembly all require Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) ultra-long reads, which are costly and experimentally challenging to obtain and are thus often unavailable for samples without established cell lines3. Here we introduce hifiasm (ONT), an algorithm that can produce near-T2T assemblies from standard ONT simplex reads, eliminating the need for ultra-long sequencing. Compared with existing methods, hifiasm (ONT) reduces computational demands by an order of magnitude and reconstructs more chromosomes from telomere to telomere on the same datasets.

          "abstract": "Promoters are the core regulatory elements of all genes. Their activity ensures the correct transcription level of each individual gene, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and responses to a wide range of signals. One of the major challenges in genomics is to build computational models that accurately predict genome-wide gene expression from the sequences of regulatory elements1. Here we present promoter activity regulatory model (PARM), a cell-type-specific deep-learning model trained on specially designed massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) that query human promoter sequences. PARM is experimentally and computationally lightweight so that cell-type-specific and condition-specific models can be generated that reliably predict autonomous promoter activity across the genome from the DNA sequence alone. PARM can also design purely synthetic strong promoters. We leveraged PARM to systematically identify binding sites of transcription factors that probably contribute to the activity of each natural human promoter and to detect the rewiring of these regulatory interactions after various stimuli to the cells. We also uncovered and experimentally confirmed substantial positional preferences of transcription factors that differ between activating and repressive regulatory functions and a complex grammar of motif–motif interactions. Our approach provides a highly economic strategy towards a deeper understanding of the dynamic regulation of human promoters by transcription factors.",

          "abstract": "Multiple mosquito species serve as competent vectors to carry and transmit numerous flaviviruses1,2. Several long-standing scientific questions remain to be answered, including identification of the fundamental factors that facilitate flavivirus infectivity in mosquitoes and the genetic basis that contributes to the naturally occurring interspecies specificity of mosquitoes to flaviviruses3,4,5,6,7,8, such as Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to dengue virus (DENV). Here we report that circulating mature virions are inactivated by the acidity of mosquito haemolymph; thus, extracellular vesicles carrying replication-competent viral nucleocapsids serve as the predominant means of intercellular viral dissemination. Mechanistically, mosquito valosin-containing protein (VCP) binds to the viral capsid, thereby allowing the incorporation of nucleocapsids into extracellular vesicles. The capsid of a flavivirus (such as DENV) selectively binds to the VCP of its natural vector (Ae. aegypti), but not to that of an incompetent vector (for example, Culex quinquefasciatus). Replacing the DENV capsid with that of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) renders DENV infectious in the haemolymph of the natural JEV vector, Cx. quinquefasciatus. Furthermore, two amino residues in Aedes (D723/N728) and Culex (E723/E728) VCP determine its binding specificity for viral capsid, thus contributing to interspecies specificity of mosquitoes to flaviviruses. In vivo ectopic expression of the Cx. quinquefasciatus VCP mutant E723D/E728N renders Cx. quinquefasciatus susceptible to DENV2 via intrathoracic microinjection. Our study provides a major molecular mechanism contributing to the selectivity and compatibility between mosquito vectors and flavivirus species, enabling systemic virus dissemination after the virus reaches the haemocoel. Upstream mechanisms that determine specificity at the midgut level remain to be determined.",

Here we report trace-element ratios (including Nb–Sc–U–Yb) correlated with age and hafnium and oxygen isotope ratios for Hadean detrital zircons from the Jack Hills (JH), Western Australia, which record unprecedented insights into the timing and setting of early magmatism. More than 70% of Hadean JH detrital zircons have Sc/Yb &gt; 0.1, and 47% have U/Nb &gt; 20, fingerprints for continental-arc and subduction settings. The remainder are ocean-island-like with little evidence for ocean-ridge settings. Hadean JH zircons probably originated from distinct terranes with separate tectonic histories. Subduction-related magmatism in the Hadean, as documented by JH zircons, alternated with periods of magmatic quiescence. This contrasts with dominantly stagnant-lid-like signatures for most Barberton Hadean zircons. The diverse settings for Jack Hills and Barberton detrital zircons imply contemporaneous operation of different tectonic styles during the Hadean, as well as a broader diversity of early crustal origins than previously known.",

To investigate the role of the SCAN in PD pathophysiology and treatments (medications, deep-brain stimulation (DBS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and MRI-guided focused ultrasound stimulation (MRgFUS)), we built a large (n = 863), multimodal, multi-intervention clinical imaging dataset. Resting-state functional connectivity revealed that the substantia nigra and all PD DBS targets (subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus and ventral intermediate thalamus) are selectively connected to the SCAN rather than to effector-specific motor regions. Importantly, PD was characterized by specific hyperconnectivity between the SCAN and the subcortex. We therefore followed six PD cohorts undergoing DBS, TMS, MRgFUS and levodopa therapy using precision resting-state functional connectivity and electrocorticography recording. Efficacious treatments reduced SCAN-to-subcortex hyperconnectivity. Targeting the SCAN instead of effector regions doubled the efficacy of TMS treatments. Focused ultrasound treatment benefits increased when the target was closer to the thalamic SCAN sweet spot. Thus, SCAN hyperconnectivity is central to PD pathophysiology and its alleviation is a hallmark of successful neuromodulation. Targeting functionally defined subcortical SCAN nodes may improve existing therapies (DBS, MRgFUS), whereas cortical SCAN targets offer effective non-invasive or minimally invasive neuromodulation for PD.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic emissions of hydrogen (H2) are expected to rise if H2 energy technology is widely implemented as part of the green energy transition1,2. Although atmospheric H2 is not radiatively active, it warms the Earth’s climate through chemical effects on methane, ozone and water vapour1,2,3,4,5,6. Predicting the atmospheric response to anthropogenic perturbations is challenging, in part because of the limited duration of the modern instrumental record7. Ice core measurements of H2 can extend the observational record, providing information about anthropogenic and natural perturbations and the biogeochemical controls on H2 levels over long timescales. However, ice core measurements of H2 are challenging because of the high permeability of H2 in ice8,9. Here we present an ice core record of atmospheric H2 recovered from a Greenland ice core, spanning the past millennium. The record shows a 70–111% (2σ) rise in atmospheric H2 from the pre-industrial to the modern era, consistent with increasing direct emissions from fossil fuel burning and increased atmospheric concentrations of H2 precursors. The pre-industrial record also shows a 4–25% (2σ) decrease in H2 levels during the Little Ice Age (LIA), indicating that H2 biogeochemistry may be sensitive to climate change. The findings suggest that the sensitivity of H2 sources and sinks to climate warming should be considered in estimates of the radiative consequences of rising anthropogenic H2 emissions.",

          "abstract": "ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas are malignant brain tumours defined by fusions formed between the putative chromatin remodeller ZFTA and the NF-κB mediator RELA1. Here we show that ZFTA–RELA+ cells produce itaconate, a key macrophage-associated immunomodulatory metabolite2. Itaconate is generated by cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1; also known as IRG1). However, the production of itaconate by tumour cells and its tumour-intrinsic role are not well established. ACOD1 is upregulated in a ZFTA–RELA-dependent manner. Functionally, itaconate enables a feed-forward system that is crucial for the maintenance of pathogenic ZFTA–RELA levels. Itaconate epigenetically activates ZFTA–RELA transcription by enriching for activating H3K4me3 via inhibition of the H3K4 demethylase KDM5. ZFTA–RELA+ tumours enhance glutamine metabolism to supply carbons for itaconate synthesis. Antagonism of ACOD1 or glutamine metabolism reduces pathogenic ZFTA–RELA levels and is potently therapeutic in multiple in vivo models. Mechanistically, ZFTA–RELA epigenetically suppresses PTEN expression to upregulate PI3K–mTOR signalling, a known driver of glutaminolysis. Finally, suppression of ACOD1 or a combination of glutamine antagonism with PI3K–mTOR inhibition abrogates spinal metastasis. Our data demonstrate that ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas subvert a macrophage-like itaconate metabolic pathway to maintain expression of the ZFTA–RELA driver, which implicates itaconate as a candidate oncometabolite. Taken together, our results position itaconate upregulation as a previously unappreciated driver of ZFTA–RELA+ ependymomas. Our work has implications for future drug development to reduce pathogenic ZFTA–RELA expression for this brain tumour, and will advance our understanding of oncometabolites as a new class of therapeutic dependencies in cancers.",

          "abstract": "Deep mantle melting marks the onset of Earth differentiation1, yet a unifying framework for how buoyancy-driven mantle upwellings initiate melting and how such incipient melts evolve within the asthenosphere has remained elusive. Here we show that the first melts generated in any solid-state mantle upwelling are kimberlitic CO2-rich silicate melts that form at about 250 km depth through oxidation of elemental carbon to CO2 (refs. 2,3). Our experiments force a range of surface melts, derived from mantle plumes4 or broad upwellings5 (kimberlites, ocean island basalts and mid-ocean ridge basalts), into equilibrium with fertile mantle at adiabatic and super-adiabatic conditions at 7 GPa. The results define a framework in which redox melting at depth universally yields kimberlitic melts, which, while ascending through the asthenosphere by reactive porous flow6,7, evolve to higher degrees of melting, lesser volatiles and incompatible elements, but higher SiO2. Channelized flow7 in the lithosphere may then enable direct extraction of these melts, leading to kimberlites, where the lithosphere commences just above the C → CO2 redox front, to alkaline Si-undersaturated intraplate magmas where lithospheric thicknesses are 150–100 km, and to tholeiitic basalts below mid-ocean ridges where voluminous ‘dry’ melting becomes overwhelming. This framework is consistent with the widespread seismic low-velocity zone at about 250 km beneath mid-ocean ridges8,9 and aligns with ocean island and mid-ocean ridge basalts sampling the various geochemical mantle components at different degrees of melting in different proportions10,11.",

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality and there are limited therapies 1 . Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are implicated in HCC, the involvement of the UPR transducer ATF6α remains unclear 2 . Here we demonstrate the function of ATF6α as an ER-stress-inducing tumour driver and metabolic master regulator restricting cancer immunosurveillance for HCC, in contrast to its well-characterized role as an adaptive response to ER stress 3 . ATF6α activation in human HCC is significantly correlated with an aggressive tumour phenotype, characterized by reduced patient survival, enhanced tumour progression and local immunosuppression. Hepatocyte-specific ATF6α activation in mice induced progressive hepatitis with ER stress, immunosuppression and hepatocyte proliferation. Concomitantly, activated ATF6α increased glycolysis and directly repressed the gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 by binding to gene regulatory elements. Restoring FBP1 expression limited ATF6α-activation-related pathologies. Prolonged ATF6α activation in hepatocytes triggered hepatocarcinogenesis, intratumoural T cell infiltration and nutrient-deprived immune exhaustion. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) 4 restored immunosurveillance and reduced HCC. Consistently, patients with HCC who achieved a complete response to immunotherapy displayed significantly increased ATF6α activation compared with those with a weaker response. Targeting Atf6 through germline ablation, hepatocyte-specific ablation or therapeutic hepatocyte delivery of antisense oligonucleotides dampened HCC in preclinical liver cancer models. Thus, prolonged ATF6α activation drives ER stress, leading to glycolysis-dependent immunosuppression in liver cancer and sensitizing to ICB. Our findings suggest that persistently activated ATF6α is a tumour driver, a potential stratification marker for ICB response and a therapeutic target for HCC.",

By observing a metal–insulator (MI) transition on a 2D square lattice of atom-based quantum dots, we demonstrate independent and precise control of the on-site interaction U and tunnelling t . Magneto-transport measurements further indicate the formation of an insulating state driven by Mott–Hubbard/Anderson physics and promising signatures of correlated electron physics. These precision-engineered analogue quantum simulators provide a unique platform to simulate quantum materials on arbitrary 2D lattices and to explore many unanswered questions in the formation of quantum magnetism, interacting topological quantum matter and unconventional superconductivity.",

To define systematically the transcription factors (TFs) driving these states, we built a comprehensive atlas integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data across nine CD8 + T cell states and inferred TF activity profiles. Our analysis catalogued TF activity fingerprints, uncovering regulatory mechanisms governing selective cell state differentiation. Leveraging this platform, we focused on two transcriptionally similar but functionally opposing states that are critical in tumour and viral contexts: terminally exhausted T (TEX term ) cells, which are dysfunctional 5–8 , and tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells, which are protective 9–13 . Global TF community analysis revealed distinct biological pathways and TF-driven networks underlying protective versus dysfunctional states. Through in vivo CRISPR screening integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (in vivo Perturb-seq) we delineated several TFs that selectively govern TEX term cell differentiation. We also identified HIC1 and GFI1 as shared regulators of TEX term and T RM cell differentiation and KLF6 as a unique regulator of T RM  cells. We discovered new TEX term -selective TFs, including ZSCAN20 and JDP2, with no previous known function in T cells. Targeted deletion of these TFs enhanced tumour control and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade but did not interfere with T RM cell formation. Consistently, their depletion in human T cells reduces the expression of inhibitory receptors and improves effector function. By decoupling exhaustion T EX -selective from protective T RM cell programmes, our platform enables more precise engineering of T cell states, accelerating the rational design of more effective cellular immunotherapies.",

After binding to DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP as a second messenger that binds to stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a signalling adaptor protein anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)3,4,5. STING then traffics from the ER through the Golgi to perinuclear vesicle clusters, which leads to activation of the kinases TBK1 and IKK and subsequent induction of interferons and other cytokines6,7,8,9. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2; also known as PI(3,5)P2) is an endogenous ligand of STING that functions together with cGAMP to induce STING activation. Proteomic analyses identified a constitutive interaction between STING and PIKFYVE, an enzyme that produces PtdIns(3,5)P2 in mammalian cells. Deletion of PIKFYVE blocked STING trafficking from the ER and TBK1 activation. In vitro reconstitution uncovered a strong and selective effect of PtdIns(3,5)P2 on STING activation by cGAMP. PtdIns(3,5)P2 bound directly to STING in fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. Consistently, cryo-electron microscopy revealed that PtdIns(3,5)P2 promotes cGAMP-induced STING oligomerization10, functioning as a molecular glue. Similar to PIKFYVE depletion, mutation of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding residues in STING largely blocked its trafficking and downstream signalling. These findings reveal that PtdIns(3,5)P2 is a lipid ligand of STING with essential roles in innate immunity.",

However, battery development remains bottlenecked by the high time and energy costs required to evaluate the lifetime of new designs1,2. Notably, existing lifetime forecasting approaches require datasets containing battery lifetime labels for target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions before prototyping, thus limiting rapid feedback3,4. Here we introduce Discovery Learning, a scientific machine learning approach that integrates active learning5, physics-guided learning6 and zero-shot learning7 into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from educational psychology. Discovery Learning can learn from historical battery designs and reduce the need for prototyping, thereby predicting the lifetime of new designs from minimal experiments. To test Discovery Learning, we present industrial-grade battery data comprising 123 large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, including diverse material–design combinations and cycling protocols. Trained on public datasets of cell designs different from ours, Discovery Learning achieves 7.2% test error in predicting cycle life using physical features from the first 50 cycles of 51% of cell prototypes. Under conservative assumptions, this results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared with conventional practices. Discovery Learning represents a key advance in accurate and efficient battery lifetime prediction and, more broadly, helps realize the promise of machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery8.",

Reduced hair density coincides with acquisition of epidermal rete ridges, the developmental timing and molecular mechanisms of which are poorly understood despite their prominence in humans 1,6–9 . Examination of human and pig skin development has shown that rete ridges form through a mechanism independent from those of hair follicles 10,11 and sweat glands 3,4,12–15 by establishing interconnected epidermal invaginations. Here we document the occurrence of rete ridges across Mammalia, including in grizzly bears and dolphins, and show that neonatal pig wounds can regenerate them de novo. Multispecies spatiotemporal transcriptomics identifies significant signalling interactions between epidermal and dermal cells during rete ridge morphogenesis, particularly through bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). We also demonstrate that mouse fingerpad skin forms rete ridges and functionally requires epidermal BMP signalling. We propose that evolution of rete ridges in mammalian skin involved replacement of the molecular program for formation of discrete microscopic appendages, including hair follicles and sweat glands, with a distinct program for the interconnected appendage network. Broad epidermal activation of BMP is required for the development of rete ridge networks organized around underlying dermal pockets. Understanding rete ridge mechanisms may enable development of therapeutic approaches to regenerate epidermal appendages lost during wounding or disease in humans.",

          "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are key drivers of human diversity and disease risk1. Here we evaluate the role of CNVs across a broad range of human phenotypes and diseases by analysing CNVs from 470,727 UK Biobank whole-genome sequences and conducting a variant- and gene-level phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) with 2,941 plasma protein abundance measurements, 13,336 binary clinical phenotypes and 1,911 quantitative traits. Proteomic analyses validated functional associations of CNVs with nearby genes (cis-protein quantitative trait loci; cis-pQTLs)—with deletions and duplications typically associated with reduced and increased protein levels, respectively—and uncovered previously unknown protein–protein interactions (trans-pQTLs). Our PheWAS recapitulated known associations and uncovered associations in both coding and non-coding regions. Notably, we identified a rare deletion in ZNF451 associated with increased leukocyte telomere length and a non-coding deletion of a SLC2A9 enhancer associated with reduced gout risk. In addition, by combining CNVs with protein-coding single nucleotide variants and indels, we enhanced the power of our study to detect gene–disease associations. Finally, we leveraged this multiomics dataset to identify several pQTLs that constitute candidate biomarkers, including TMPRSS5 for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A. This multiancestry whole-genome-sequence CNV PheWAS offers insights into the roles of CNVs in human health outcomes and could serve as a valuable resource for therapeutic development.",

          "abstract": "Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moiré materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity1,2,3,4. However, understanding the relationships between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated parent states remains a challenge. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. Although the outer gap, previously associated with the pseudogap phase5,6, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile, in line with previous transport experiments1,2,4. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behaviour of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations. By comparing our results with recent topological heavy fermion (THF) models that include dynamical correlations7,8, we find that the outer gap probably arises from a splitting of the Abrikosov–Suhl–Kondo resonance9,10 owing to the breaking of the valley symmetry. Our results indicate an intricate yet tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene.",

          "abstract": "Thetis cells (TCs) are a recently identified lineage of RORγt+ antigen-presenting cells comprising four subsets including a tolerogenic subset, TC IV, that instructs tolerance to gut microbiota and food antigens1–6. A developmental wave of TCs during early life creates a critical window of opportunity for establishing intestinal tolerance1,5. Yet the ontogeny of TCs and the cues shaping their abundance and heterogeneity remain unknown, limiting efforts to harness their therapeutic potential. Here we identify a population of RORγt+ progenitors, termed Thetis-Lymphoid Tissue inducer progenitors (TLP), that give rise to the immediate TC progenitor (TCP) and the Lymphoid Tissue inducer progenitor (LTiP), and identify PU.1 as the transcription factor governing TC fate. Despite transcriptional similarity to myeloid-derived conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), we show that TCs descend from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). Deletion of the plasmacytoid DC (pDC) lineage-determining transcription factor TCF4 expands TLPs and TCs, suggesting a shared developmental branch with pDCs. TLPs are enriched in fetal liver; however, unlike LTi cells, TCs emerge postnatally, pointing to developmentally-timed environmental cues that promote TCP differentiation. We identify one such cue–RANKL provision by lymphoid tissue organizer cells–which is essential for TC I differentiation. Together, these findings define the ontogeny of TCs and the transcription factors that promote TC differentiation and heterogeneity, facilitating future investigations of these enigmatic cells and their therapeutic potential for tolerance induction in food allergy and autoimmunity.",

However, discovery of reactive metabolites is particularly challenging because they may not tolerate traditional bioactivity-guided isolation workflows 2 . Diazo-containing natural products are a subset of highly reactive microbial metabolites that display potent bioactivity 3 and enable powerful biosynthetic transformations 4,5 ; however, instability of the diazo group to light 6 , heat 7 , mild acid 8 and mechanical shock 9 has precluded their efficient discovery and application. Here we develop a reactivity-based screening approach to capture diazo-containing metabolites and facilitate their discovery by mass spectrometry. This workflow revealed two novel diazo-containing natural products, 4-diazo-3-oxobutanoic acid ( 1 ) and diazoacetone ( 2 ), from the human lung pathogen Nocardia ninae . Biosynthetic investigations revealed a distinct enzymatic logic for diazo formation involving hydrazone oxidation catalysed by the metalloenzyme Dob3, and its biochemical characterization suggests promising future applications in biocatalysis. Overall, our work highlights the power of reactivity-guided strategies for identifying reactive metabolites and facilitating the discovery of unique enzymatic transformations.",

In layered high-temperature cuprate superconductors, in which the Cooper pairs are confined to weakly coupled two-dimensional (2D) copper–oxygen (CuO2) planes4,5, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy at subgap millielectronvolt (meV) energies has provided crucial insights into the collective superfluid response perpendicular to the superconducting layers6,7,8,9. However, within the CuO2 planes, the collective superfluid response manifests as plasmonic charge oscillations at energies far exceeding the superconducting gap, obscured by strong dissipation2,6,9,10. Here we present spectroscopic evidence of a below-gap, 2D superfluid plasmon in few-layer Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x and spatially resolve its deeply subdiffractive THz electrodynamics. By placing the superconductor in the near field of a spintronic THz emitter, we reveal this distinct resonance—absent in bulk samples and observed only in the superconducting phase—and determine its plasmonic nature by mapping the geometric anisotropy and dispersion. Crucially, these measurements offer a direct view of the momentum-dependent and frequency-dependent superconducting transition in two dimensions.",

          "abstract": "Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moiré lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometre scales, leading to numerous ground-breaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. Here we introduce the atomic single electron transistor (SET), a new scanning probe that uses a single atomic defect in a van der Waals material as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential sensor. Built on the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform1, this probe leverages the capability of the QTM to form a pristine, scannable two-dimensional interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in a canonical moiré interface: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. The measured potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, minimal dependence on carrier density and a substantial amplitude of approximately 60 mV, even in the absence of carriers. Theory indicates that this symmetry arises from a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. The measured amplitude significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With 1 nm spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the atomic SET enables ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties across a wide range of quantum phenomena, including symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges and fractionalized quasiparticles.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved a wide array of defence systems to combat phage infection, many of which rely on complex signalling systems and large protein complexes to function1. Here we describe a 164-residue prophage-encoded protein that defends bacteria by sensing conserved oligomeric components of phage assembly. This protein, called ring interacting pore 1 (Rip1), is activated by the portal or small terminase proteins of infecting phages—oligomeric ring-shaped complexes that are essential for virion maturation. Rip1 uses these phage protein ring complexes as a template to assemble into membrane-disrupting pores that inhibit phage virion assembly and cause premature death of the host cell. Rip1 homologues are widely distributed across bacteria and provide robust defence against diverse phages. This study reveals a strategy by which a small defence protein integrates both sensing and effector activity by exploiting a conserved feature of viral assembly. The mechanism mirrors eukaryotic pore-forming immunity but is executed by a single protein, offering an evolutionarily streamlined solution to viral detection and defence.",

It broadly infects humans and other vertebrate animals and causes various diseases and malignancies2,3. However, no specific antiviral agents are available for each type or the whole family. gB is the common fusion protein vital for herpesvirus infection and an ideal target for broad vaccine development, while the lack of basis for gB as a universal antigen hinders such effort4. Here, we report the molecular basis for broad gB binding and cross-genus virus neutralization by an antibody Fab5 for the first time. This antibody confers effective protection against authentic virus challenges in immune-competent mice, non-human primates, and humanized mice with murine, rhesus, and human gammaherpesvirus. Cryo-EM structures revealed that Fab5 targeted a conservative and vulnerable epitope of gammaherpesvirus gB and antigenically exposed across pre- or post-fusion status. This finding not only demonstrates Fab5 as cross-genus antibody broadly reactive against gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis progression, but offers insights into potential common mechanisms for herpesvirus infection and facilitates the development of broad-spectrum vaccines against the gammaherpesvirus.",

Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks2–5. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters6, incorporating entanglement swapping4,7,8 and entanglement purification9–11 with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts12–25, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. Here, we demonstrate memory-memory entanglement between two nodes connected by 10 km of spooled fibre surviving beyond the average entanglement establishment time. This is enabled by the development of long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol26,27. As an application, we report a proof-of-principle device-independent quantum key distributio (DI-QKD) demonstration with finite-size analysis over 10 km and a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, with both distances exceeding previous work by more than two orders of magnitude28–30.

          "abstract": "The vacuum is now understood to have a rich and complex structure, characterized by fluctuating energy fields1 and a condensate of virtual quark–antiquark pairs. The spontaneous breaking of the approximate chiral symmetry2, signalled by the nonvanishing quark condensate \\(\\langle q\\bar{q}\\rangle \\), is dynamically generated through topologically nontrivial gauge configurations such as instantons3. The precise mechanism linking the chiral symmetry breaking to the mass generation associated with quark confinement4 remains a profound open question in quantum chromodynamics (QCD)—the fundamental theory of strong interaction. High-energy proton–proton collisions could liberate virtual quark–antiquark pairs from the vacuum that subsequently undergo confinement to form hadrons, whose properties could serve as probes into QCD confinement and the quark condensate. Here we report evidence of spin correlations in \\(\\Lambda \\bar{\\Lambda }\\) hyperon pairs inherited from spin-correlated strange quark–antiquark virtual pairs. Measurements by the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory reveal a relative polarization signal of (18 ± 4)% that links the virtual spin-correlated quark pairs from the QCD vacuum to their final-state hadron counterparts. Crucially, this correlation vanishes when the hyperon pairs are widely separated in angle, consistent with the decoherence of the quantum system. Our findings provide a new experimental model for exploring the dynamics and interplay of quark confinement and entanglement.",

          "authors": "Rongqin Li, Niko Dalheimer, Martin B. D. Müller, F. Ulrich Hartl",
          "abstract": "The essential chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC) (also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1 (CCT)) mediates protein folding in cooperation with the co-chaperone prefoldin (PFD) 1–5 . In vitro experiments have shown that the cylindrical TRiC complex facilitates folding through ATP-regulated client protein encapsulation 6–9 . However, the functional dynamics of the chaperonin system in vivo remain unexplored. Here we developed single-particle tracking in human cells to monitor the interactions of TRiC–PFD with newly synthesized proteins. Both chaperones engaged nascent polypeptides repeatedly in brief probing events typically lasting around one second, with PFD recruiting TRiC. As shown with the chaperonin client actin 8 , the co-translational interactions of PFD and TRiC increased in frequency and lifetime during chain elongation. Close to translation termination, PFD bound for several seconds, facilitating TRiC recruitment for post-translational folding involving multiple reaction cycles of around 2.5 s. Notably, the lifetimes of TRiC interactions with a folding-defective actin mutant were markedly prolonged, indicating that client conformational properties modulate TRiC function. Mutant actin continued cycling on TRiC until it was targeted for degradation. TRiC often remained confined near its client protein between successive binding cycles, suggesting that the chaperonin machinery operates within a localized ‘protective zone’ in which free diffusion is restricted. Together, these findings offer detailed insight into the single-molecule dynamics and supramolecular organization of the chaperonin system in the cellular environment.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing challenge for psychology and neuroscience is to understand the transformations by which past experiences shape future behaviour. Reward-guided learning is typically modelled using simple reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In RL, a handful of incrementally updated internal variables both summarize past rewards and drive future choice. Here we describe work that questions the assumptions of many RL models. We adopt a hybrid modelling approach that integrates artificial neural networks into interpretable cognitive architectures, estimating a maximally general form for each algorithmic component and systematically evaluating its necessity and sufficiency. Applying this method to a large dataset of human reward-learning behaviour, we show that successful models require independent and flexible memory variables that can track rich representations of the past. Using a modelling approach that combines predictive accuracy and interpretability, these results call into question an entire class of popular RL models based on incremental updating of scalar reward predictions.",

Here we provide causal evidence on the effects of language barriers on the speed and extent of knowledge diffusion by exploiting a change in US patent policy that resulted in earlier disclosure of English-language technical knowledge from Japan. Using a targeted sample of 2,770 citations from US-based inventors to Japanese inventions, we find that language barriers accounted for almost half the diffusion lag of Japan-originating knowledge to US-based inventors, relative to Japan-based inventors. This acceleration is significant only for firms with limited ability to translate (small research and development scale, or little involvement in the Japanese market) and is more pronounced for the diffusion of high-quality inventions, suggesting difficulties in quality-targeted translation. Thus, early publication of patent applications provides a substantial public good for cumulative innovation through accelerated access to translated foreign patents.",

          "abstract": "There are increasing calls for economic assistance in the form of social safety nets (SSNs) to be designed and implemented to promote women’s economic inclusion and agency, contributing to closing gender disparities globally. Here we investigate the extent to which SSNs affect women’s economic achievements and agency through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials implemented in low- and middle-income countries. We searched six databases utilizing search strings in English, French and Spanish through December 2024. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Our sample includes 1,307 effect sizes from 93 studies, representing 218,828 women across 45 low- and middle-income countries. Using robust variance estimation meta-analysis, we show significant overall pooled effects (Hedges’ g = 0.107, P &lt; 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.085–0.129), driven by increases in economic achievements (productive work, savings, assets and expenditures) and agency (voice, autonomy and decision-making). We find significant treatment effects for unconditional cash transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.128, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.097 to 0.159), social care services (Hedges’ g = 0.122, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.071 to 0.174), asset transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.115, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.071 to 0.160) and public work programmes (Hedges’ g = 0.127, P = 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.239). We find comparatively smaller effects for conditional cash transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.059, P = 0.019, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.108) and found no evidence of effects for in-kind transfers. SSNs can empower women economically and socially; however, limitations and evidence gaps remain, including the need for further rigorous testing of design and operational components, the role of contextual factors and cost–benefit analysis with a gender lens.",

          "authors": "Pia Dietze, Riana M. Brown, Maureen A. Craig",
          "abstract": "“More than 1 in 8 LGBTQ people live in states where doctors can refuse to treat them.” This headline describes a flurry of laws passed in 2025 allowing doctors to refuse treatment of LGBTQ patients based on personal beliefs. This and other laws like it limit healthcare access and exacerbate health inequality for LGBTQ individuals. But health is not the only domain in which LGBTQ individuals face disparities. Long-standing inequalities also exist in other domains of life, for example, gay men earn up to 32% less wages than their heterosexual peers. In the current research, we ask if exposure to LGBTQ inequality in one domain (e.g., health) motivates more support for action than exposure to inequality in other domains (e.g., economics). In six experiments (five preregistered), we test our hypothesis that emphasizing health-based LGBTQ inequality (vs. economics and belonging) spurs engagement with and support for mitigating action (S1-2). We also investigate why people support action (S1a-1b) and what boosts support (S3a-3c). As predicted and preregistered, we find greater support for action to mitigate health-based LGBTQ inequality, compared to economics and belonging. This occurs, in part, because people blame LGBTQ individuals less for health (vs. economic) disparities and perceive health inequalities to violate morally sacred values, which is associated with greater perceived injustice. Finally, we find that connecting economic inequality to health inequality in individuals’ minds can increase support for mitigating economic inequality.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral research has been criticized for relying on demographically narrow WEIRD samples-Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. While recent work has expanded to explore cross-country behavioral differences, the study of within-country variation has largely focused on gender, ignoring race and ethnicity—so much so that the “W” in WEIRD might as well stand for “White.” Using incentivized tasks and a large, stratified sample of U.S. adults, we document substantial racial and ethnic gaps in competitiveness and risk tolerance both of which are widely studied behavioral measures: (non-Hispanic) Whites are less competitive and more risk tolerant than Blacks and Hispanics. These gaps are comparable in magnitude to the corresponding gender gaps in our sample. Notably, gender differences do not generalize across racial and ethnic groups: Whereas Whites and Hispanics exhibit gender gaps in competitiveness and risk tolerance, Black women neither shy away from competition nor are they less risk tolerant than Black men. These findings challenge prevailing generalizations in the literature and underscore the importance of examining race and ethnicity in behavioral research.",

While numerous studies have found socioeconomic factors to be significantly associated with premature death everywhere in the world, the debate on the relative effect of such factors on mid-age (15 to 59 ages) has not received enough attention, particularly in low-income countries, where this question is pertinent due to scant resources in the healthcare sector. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the India Human Development Survey, we assess the relative importance of individual- and community-level education vs. income and wealth in India, where approximately 3 million premature deaths occur annually in mid-ages. We find a clear downward gradient in mid-age mortality with increasing education within each wealth category, whereas no consistent mortality advantage with increasing wealth status is visible within education subgroups. Multilevel logistic regression models show that the decline in the risk of death across the education spectrum by far exceeds (14% for male and 13% for female) the decline moving along the wealth distribution, even after controlling for other relevant demographic, socioeconomic, regional variables. Along with the direct effect of individual-level educational attainment, we also find a protective effect of education at the community level, particularly for women. Based on these findings, we infer that educational attainment is essential for reducing mid-age mortality in India. Population and health policies in developing countries, therefore, should focus on education to prevent adult mortality.",

In this study, we systematically map peer-reviewed literature that explicitly assesses the societal value of ESI across instrumental, intrinsic, and relational value types, and the diversity of approaches used to assess those values. Drawing from 13,823 publications across Scopus, Web of Science, and a curated library of ESI valuation studies, we identify 171 studies that applied ESI in a decision context and used a valuation method to compare outcomes with and without ESI. The majority of these studies employed decision analysis methods (e.g., Value of Information, Cost–Benefit Analysis), focusing primarily on quantitative instrumental values (e.g., profit, crop yield, lives saved), particularly in agricultural contexts. A smaller set of studies applied preference elicitation methods (e.g., stated preference, surveys, interviews, focus groups) to capture qualitative benefits and relational values including quality of life improvements, empowerment, and procedural justice. Many excluded studies demonstrated scientific value of ESI but did not explicitly translate that into societal value, revealing the need for a more systematic approach to ESI valuation. By promoting a more inclusive, interdisciplinary, and flexible portfolio of valuation methods, we aim to expand our understanding of the societal benefits of ESI to help guide investment in future missions, enhance public support, and ensure that science and policy goals are well aligned.",

          "abstract": "Conservation and environmental management are under increased scrutiny as the embeddedness of oppressive practices has gained wider societal and scholarly attention. As conservation and environmental practitioners and scholars grapple with foundational assumptions and practices of the field, there remains a pressing need to identify persistent problematic legacies and articulate a positive vision for conservation grounded in an ethic of justice. To help advance this conversation, we present a framework of four intersecting dimensions of oppression: 1) the physical or material manifestations of conservation and environmental management; 2) the knowledge practices and assumptions that inform and underpin conservation and environmental visions and decision-making; 3) the modes of governance associated with conservation and environmental practice; and 4) the forms of relational praxis implicitly and explicitly endorsed and/or imposed in conservation and other environmental arenas. We explain the framework through an analysis of the legacy of fortress conservation, then illustrate the framework’s wider application to diagnose ongoing elements of oppression in other environmental arenas (wildland fire, riverine flows). We then review prominent strategies and visions for moving forward for both nature and people to highlight both positive steps being taken and the utility of the framework in ensuring emergent environmental paradigms avoid the pitfalls of the past. Viewing each dimension of oppression as moveable levers to promote antioppressive conservation futures, we conclude with a set of questions to help conservation and environmental management scientists and practitioners identify where oppression might be manifest in their own work, and begin to embody antioppressive practices.",

          "abstract": "When outgroups are present, adults may endorse ingroup choices that are at odds with their personal preferences, in an outward show of ingroup loyalty. Here, we examined whether 2-y-old toddlers ( N = 108) might already understand such shows of loyalty. In three violation-of-expectation experiments, toddlers watched interactions among a target individual, an ingroup member, and an outgroup member; group memberships were marked with novel labels. In the critical trials, the target individual chose between an ingroup- and an outgroup-associated toy. When the outgroup member was present during this selection process, toddlers expected the target individual to conform to her group’s norm and select the ingroup-associated toy, even when they knew she preferred the outgroup-associated toy. This was true whether or not the ingroup member remained in the scene; as long as the outgroup member was present, toddlers expected the target individual to select the ingroup-associated toy and no other toy. When the outgroup member was absent, however, toddlers expected the target individual to act on her personal preference, if any. They also held this expectation if no information was provided about group memberships. Together, these results indicate that by 2 y of age, toddlers a) construe individuals as possessed of both a personal and a social identity, b) understand that individuals may produce different actions in different contexts depending on which identity has precedence, and c) expect individuals’ social identity to take precedence in intergroup contexts even when it conflicts with their personal identity, in a show of ingroup loyalty.",

          "abstract": "The removal of livestock grazers from historically grazed grasslands is widely proposed as a key strategy for the enhancement of soil organic carbon (SOC) for climate mitigation. Yet, accurate assessments of how grazer exclusion impacts SOC pools of differing stability are lacking, with most studies focusing on total SOC rather than the distribution of SOC within fast and more stable, slow-cycling pools. Here, we used 12 historically grazed grassland sites along an 800 km south–north gradient across the United Kingdom to test how particulate (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) pools were linked to long-term (&gt;10 y) exclusion of large domesticated grazers. We found that grazer exclusion was associated with relatively higher fast-cycling C pools, including plant and litter C, and to a lesser extent POC, but lower more stable, slow-cycling MAOC pools compared to grazed controls. Grazer exclusion was also associated with a marked shift in vegetation composition, with greater cover of ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) shrubs over arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) graminoids. This vegetation shift likely played a dual role in regulating SOC, contributing to higher POC via both the input of recalcitrant litter and by the enhancement of soil moisture and lower MAOC due to priming and decreased mineral protection of SOC. Our findings provide evidence that while the exclusion of grazers tends to favor fast-cycling C pools, it coincides with lower SOC persistence, potentially increasing the vulnerability of grassland SOC stocks to future climate change.",

Nuclear speckles, nuclear bodies enriched in RNA-processing factors, reposition around VRCs and undergo structural changes. While viral mRNAs are transcribed in VRCs and host transcription is largely suppressed, the nuclear routes used by viral and upregulated host transcripts and their relationship with nuclear bodies remain unclear. We show that immediate-early (IE) viral transcripts uniquely accumulate in nuclear speckles prior to export, unlike early or late transcripts, revealing a selective nuclear speckle-dependent pathway. Similarly, host mRNAs upregulated during infection traffic into nuclear speckles after transcription. Moreover, nuclear speckles are structurally remodeled, marked by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1 removal and increased dynamics of the nuclear speckle core protein SRRM2. Finally, we found that blocking mRNA export causes IE transcripts to accumulate in nuclear speckles and that nuclear speckle disassembly severely impairs IE mRNA export, preventing downstream viral gene expression. These findings establish nuclear speckles as dynamic regulatory hubs that selectively facilitate the processing and export of IE viral mRNAs during HSV-1 infection.",

Emerging evidence suggests that impaired microglial Aβ phagocytosis is a key feature in AD, highlighting the therapeutic potential of enhancing this innate immune function. Here, we demonstrate that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) ameliorated memory deficits and reduced Aβ burden in APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we show that PTP1B was highly expressed in microglia, and its deficiency promoted a transcriptional shift toward immune activation and phagocytosis. Consistently, PTP1B deletion in microglia enhanced phagocytosis and energy metabolism, supported by increased AKT-mTOR signaling, a pathway essential for meeting the energy demands of activation. Mechanistically, we identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), a key regulator of microglial phagocytosis, as a direct substrate of PTP1B. Inhibition of SYK showed that PTP1B modulates microglial activation in a SYK-dependent manner. These findings established PTP1B as a critical modulator of microglial activation and a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

          "abstract": "Double-strand break (DSB) repair is highly mutagenic compared to normal replication. In budding yeast, repair of an HO (homothallism) endonuclease-induced DSB at the mating-type α locus ( MAT α) can be repaired by using an ectopic heterochromatic HMR::Kl-URA3 donor, producing MAT::Kl-URA3 . Among MAT::Kl -Ura3− mutations arising during repair, 50% are base-pair substitutions. 30% are 1-bp indels in short homonucleotide runs, with −1 strongly favored over +1, whereas during replication, spontaneous −1 and +1 events are equal. Microhomology-bounded, repair-associated intragenic deletions (IDs) are recovered 12 times more frequently than tandem duplications (TDs). These data suggest a picture of the structure of the repair replication fork: IDs and TDs occur within the open structure of a migrating D-loop, where the 3’ end of a partly copied new DNA strand can dissociate and anneal with a single-stranded region of microhomology either within ~80 bp ahead or ~40 bp behind the 3’ end. Approximately ~10% of repair-associated mutations are interchromosomal template switches (ICTS), even though the Kluyveromyces lactis URA3 sequence in HMR is only 72% identical (homeologous) with Saccharomyces cerevisiae ura3-52 . ICTS events begin and end at regions of short (~7.5 bp) microhomology; however, ICTS events are constrained to the middle of the copied sequence. Whereas microhomology usage in intragenic deletions is not influenced by adjacent homeology, we show that extensive pairing of adjacent homeology plays a critical role in ICTS. Thus, although by convention, structural variants are characterized by the precise base pairs at their junction, microhomology-mediated template switching actually requires alignment of extensive adjacent homeology.",

          "abstract": "The heart can adapt its performance in response to changing metabolic demands of the rest of the body. A central mechanism intrinsic to the heart is to modulate the function of the cardiac contractile proteins via posttranslational modifications. Although phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin motor-associated regulatory light chain (RLC) by cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK) has been recognized as a key signaling pathway to increase myocardial contractile function, little is known about its molecular mechanism of action. Here, we show that phosphorylation of RLC is not a stochastic process but a spatially tightly controlled mechanism in the cardiac sarcomere. Myosin motors in the region of the thick filament associated with cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) are the primary target for phosphorylation by cMLCK. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of RLC likely only leads to activation of one of the two myosin motors of the dimeric cardiac myosin molecule. Using a combination of structural measurements using bifunctional fluorescent probes on the RLC and spatially explicit modeling we show that RLC phosphorylation increases the force-dependent recruitment of the myosin motors. We propose that RLC phosphorylation exerts its functional effects via increasing the gain of the mechanosignaling between different zones of the thick filament. A better mechanistic understanding of the role of RLC phosphorylation likely underpins the development of therapeutic interventions for both heart disease and heart failure.",

Three knock-in mouse models targeting this interface reveal a clear genotype–phenotype relationship: the L709P variant, which abolishes SEL1L–HRD1 association, causes complete neonatal lethality; the partially disruptive S658P variant results in partial lethality; and the P699T mutation preserves the interaction and yields normal viability. Mechanistically, our data show that the SEL1L–HRD1 interface is essential for ERAD complex formation and activity, enabling both substrate handoff and E2 enzyme recruitment, and that the L709P mutation effectively uncouples these core steps of the mammalian ERAD pathway. These findings establish SEL1L–HRD1 coupling as a core requirement for mammalian ERAD function and early postnatal viability.",

          "abstract": "Active matter refers to a broad class of nonequilibrium systems where energy is continuously injected at the level of individual “particles.” These systems exhibit emergent collective behaviors that have no direct thermal-equilibrium counterpart. Their scale ranges from micrometer-sized swarms of bacteria to meter-scale human crowds. In recent years, the role of topology and self-propelled topological defects in active systems has garnered significant attention, particularly in polar and nematic active matter. Building on these ideas, we investigate emergent collective dynamics in apolar active granular fluids. Using isotropic granular vibrators as a model experimental system of apolar active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck particles in a dry environment, we uncover a distinctive three-stage time evolution arising from the intricate interplay between activity and inelastic interactions. By analyzing the statistics, spatial correlations, and dynamics of vortex-like topological defects in the displacement vector field, we demonstrate their ability to describe this intrinsic collective motion. Furthermore, associated to these topological defects, we reveal the onset of a turbulent-like inverse energy cascade, where kinetic energy transfers across different length scales over time. As the system evolves, the power scaling of the energy transfer increases with the duration of observation. Our findings show that topological concepts can be extended to the nonequilibrium dynamics of apolar active matter, revealing a direct link between microscopic topological processes and emergent large-scale behaviors in active granular fluids that lack both a well-defined direction of motion and an intrinsic axis of orientation at the particle scale.",

We show that the strength of the negative relationship between species richness and PAR increases with increasing elevation and that species richness is more strongly correlated with intense PAR than with UV-B radiation, climate variables, and atmospheric nitrogen deposition. In addition to species richness, plant biomass was also negatively correlated with PAR at higher elevations, indicating that intense PAR also constrains plant biomass in montane grasslands. Furthermore, we show that the decrease in plant species richness with increasing PAR is mainly caused by a decrease in species richness of forbs, sedges, and rushes. In contrast, species richness of grasses was only negatively correlated with PAR at high elevations, and species richness of legumes was not significantly correlated with PAR.

          "abstract": "Cities are often warmer than rural surroundings due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island, which can be influenced by various factors, such as regional climate and land surface types. Under climate change, cities face not only the challenge of increasing temperatures in their surrounding hinterland but also the challenge of potential changes in their heat islands. However, even high-resolution global Earth system models (ESMs) with “urban tiles” can only properly resolve the largest urban areas or megacities. Here, we address these limitations by applying a process-based statistical learning model to ESM outputs to provide projections of changes in land surface temperature (LST) for 104 medium-sized cities of population 300 K to 1 M in the subtropics and tropics. Under a 2 °C global warming scenario, annual mean LST in 81% of these cities is projected to increase faster than the surrounding area. In 16% of these cities, mostly in India and China, mean LST is projected to increase by an additional 50-112% above ESM projections of the surrounding area.

          "abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) initiate the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. In forebrain excitatory neurons, NMDARs are heteromeric tetramers composed of two GluN1 subunits and two glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A (GluN2A) or GluN2B subunits. At birth, NMDARs contain primarily GluN2B, but within weeks, GluN2A-containing receptors predominate the forebrain, comprising over 65% of total NMDARs in adulthood. This rapid subunit switch is essential for neonatal cognitive development, yet mechanisms driving it remain unclear. Particularly, while GluN2B levels remain relatively constant, GluN2A increases several 100-fold, despite its mRNA rising by only ~10-fold, strongly suggesting involvement of unknown posttranslational regulation. Here, we show that in the neonatal mouse forebrain, the linear ubiquitination axis, composed of the E3 ligase complex LUBAC and the deubiquitinase OTULIN, shifts transiently toward higher activity, with HOIP upregulated and OTULIN downregulated. In neonatal mice, experimentally reducing the axis activity by OTULIN overexpression causes persistent synaptic immaturity and adult cognitive deficits. Using proteomic and biochemical assays, we identified GluN2A as a key substrate: Linear ubiquitination at six lysines in the GluN2A C-terminus stabilizes the subunit and promotes its synaptic expression, whereas disrupting this modification destabilizes GluN2A by promoting lysosomal degradation. Consistently, overexpression of wild-type GluN2A rescues OTULIN-induced synaptic immaturity, whereas the ubiquitination-deficient GluN2A-6KR mutant fails to rescue and further exacerbates this defect.

          "abstract": "The theoretical possibility for leukemia stem cells (LSCs) to produce both leukemia blasts and dysfunctional immune cells remains underexplored. Here, we investigate three major fusion transcription factor (fTF)-driven acute myeloid leukemia (AML) subtypes [ RUNX1(CBFα)::RUNX1T1 , PML::RARA , and CBFB::MYH11 ] using two optimized single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies to trace fTF expression in 24 de novo AML patients. We demonstrate that the fTFs are widely expressed not only in leukemia blasts but also in differentiated myeloid and lymphoid cells, indicating hematopoietic stem cells or multipotent progenitors (HSCs/MPPs) as LSCs that propagate altered cellular differentiation hierarchies, including immune cells. DNA-FISH confirms the presence of fTFs in T lymphoid and erythroid cells, and targeted sequencing of secondary mutations in sublineages of cells corroborates hierarchical and stepwise leukemogenesis. By tracking RUNX1::RUNX1T1 -expressing cells in patients with or without relapse post–frontline chemotherapy, we highlight the necessity of eradicating LSCs to achieve sustained long-term complete remission and restore a functional immune system capable of suppressing residual disease over time. Comparative single-cell transcriptome analyses further reveal that fTFs are associated with AML subtype-specific differentiation defects in both innate and adaptive immune compartments, suggesting an altered landscape of immune cell–cell communication networks that may facilitate the survival and proliferation of leukemic blasts. Through the examination of intercellular communications among various putative fTF + and normal cell populations, we developed a ligand–receptor (L–R)-based risk-scoring model with independent prognostic value. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the cells of origin of LSCs and the implications of fTF expression for the immune landscape of AML.",

Yet the mechanisms governing its distribution across species remain poorly understood, with competing hypotheses emphasizing either historical demography or contemporary ecological constraints. This debate limits our capacity to predict species' responses to environmental change. Here, based on systematic sampling and a unified analytical pipeline, we de novo assembled genomes for 120 songbird species breeding in the Himalayas–Hengduan Mountains (HHMs) and conducted population genomic analysis to examine the drivers of their genomic diversity. We observed a 6.5-fold variation in genome-wide heterogeneity and a 16.4-fold variation nucleotide diversity across species. Notably, these measures of genomic diversity showed no correlation with recent population dynamics, current population size, or other contemporary factors—such as elevational distribution, or life-history traits. Instead, historical demography strongly predicted genetic diversity, with ancestral population size during the late Pleistocene emerging as the sole correlate: Larger ancestral sizes consistently coincided with higher diversity. These findings underscore the critical influence of historical demography on contemporary genetic diversity in natural populations—an insight essential for designing effective conservation strategies.",

Yet dissecting this context dependency remains challenging because we lack methods for tracking nutrients such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). Here, we developed an approach to quantitatively estimate C and P fluxes in the AM symbiosis from comprehensive network morphology quantification, achieved by robotic imaging and machine learning based on roughly 100 million hyphal shape measurements. We found that rates of C transfer from the plant and P transfer from the fungus were, on average, related proportionally to one another. This ratio was nearly invariant across AM fungal strains despite contrasting growth phenotypes but was strongly affected by plant host genotype. Fungal phenotype distributions were bounded by a Pareto front with a shape favoring specialization in an exploration–exploitation trade-off. This means AM fungi can be fast range expanders or fast resource extractors, but not both. Manipulating the C/P exchange rate by swapping the plant host genotype shifted this Pareto front, indicating that the exchange rate constrains possible AM fungal growth strategies. We show by mathematical modeling how AM fungal growth at fixed exchange rate leads to qualitatively different symbiotic outcomes depending on fungal traits and nutrient availability.",

          "abstract": "Microalgae induce a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism (CCM) to maintain photosynthesis when CO 2 is limited. Because this system consumes a substantial portion of photosynthetically generated ATP, its suppression when CO 2 levels rise is critical for energy balance, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identify a nuclear repressor of the CCM in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . A pull-down screen for interacting partners of the master activator CCM1/CIA5 revealed an uncharacterized protein that tightly associates with CCM1. This protein, CCM1-binding protein 1 (CBP1), combines a CobW/CobW_C GTP-binding metallochaperone module with a WW-domain characteristic of protein–protein interactions. CBP1 colocalizes and interacts with CCM1 in the nucleus regardless of CO 2 conditions. Disruption of CBP1 does not affect growth or CCM induction under CO 2 limitation but derepresses 27 of 41 CCM1-dependent low-CO 2 inducible genes under high-CO 2 conditions. These include the periplasmic and intracellular carbonic anhydrases (CAH1 and LCIB) and inorganic carbon transporters/channels (LCIA, LCI1, BST1, and BST3). Consistently, cbp1 mutants accumulate CAH1 and LCIB proteins and exhibit 40% higher inorganic carbon affinity under high-CO 2 conditions; this phenotype is rescued by CBP1 complementation or by acetazolamide treatment. Crucially, cbp1 mutants exhibit significant growth delays under high-CO 2 conditions, especially when light is limiting, providing direct evidence that CBP1-mediated repression is essential for energy conservation. Thus, CBP1 prevents unnecessary CCM activity when CO 2 is abundant, acting upstream of both transporter/channel and carbonic anhydrase modules. Our findings suggest a regulatory mechanism potentially linking zinc-dependent protein chemistry to CCM gene repression, providing insights into energy-efficient CO 2 sensing in aquatic photosynthetic organisms.",

Here, we use immunofluorescence, mass spectrometry, and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize the spatial distribution, subunit composition, and structural architecture of native α1-containing GABA A Rs in the rat cerebellum. Confocal microscopy reveals robust colocalization of α1 and γ2 subunits across cerebellar layers, including prominent labeling at glomerular synapses. Biochemical purification and proteomic analysis identify a range of α, β, and γ subunits, along with abundant α6 and δ subunits. Using cryo-EM and automated subunit identification, we resolve eight α1-containing receptor assemblies, including the first structure of α6-containing receptors. We further determine the binding mode of the α6-selective pyrazoloquinolinone modulator PZ-II-029 at the α + /γ – interface, showing ligand-induced expansion of the entire extracellular domain (ECD). Together, our study defines the structure and subunit composition of the α1-containing cerebellar GABA A Rs and elaborates the molecular interactions between native receptors and pyrazoloquinolinone, thereby laying the groundwork for brain region and subunit-specific pharmacology.",

Activation of IPACL CRF neurons increased wakefulness, whereas their inhibition or deletion of NTS reduced wakefulness in novel environments. These neurons are activated in response to exposure to a novel environment and project primarily to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and release NTS, which modulates wakefulness. These findings suggest that NTS signaling from IPACL CRF neurons to the SNr is essential for sustaining wakefulness in unfamiliar or changing environments.",

This involved development of new mathematical models, patented equipment for analyzing photosynthetic efficiency, and the world’s largest open-air laboratory for understanding crop responses to atmospheric change. Long fundamentally changed our understanding of how crops respond to rising CO 2 and ozone. He inspired and led efforts to engineer photosynthesis to increase yield and respond maximally to rising CO 2 . He discovered that C 4 plants, that have highly efficient photosynthesis due to a CO 2 concentrating mechanism, could thrive in cold climates, which was a true paradigm shift as previously C 4 photosynthesis had been considered limited to tropical and subtropical climates. He provided a theoretical explanation, and his research led to the discovery that Miscanthus x giganteus could achieve the high yields in cool northern climate achieved by other C 4 plants in the tropics. This seminal finding led Long to experiment on the closely related and much more widely used maize plant, and he showed how it could be adapted to cooler conditions and achieve a significant yield jump in the Corn Belt. At a time when society critically needed new ways to achieve increases in productivity in ecologically sustainable ways, Long’s research and leadership changed the way we think about choices of plants and cropping systems.",

By retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or their uncertainties.

Our analysis separates the driving forces for compaction into two contributions: the entropic gain from the loss of hydration water around hydrophobic patches and the enthalpic stabilization from water H-bonded to PNIPAM. We find that the role of the solvent in polymer compaction is more active and complex than has been previously assumed. Our observations indicate that direct, intrachain hydrogen bonds between amide groups (N–H···O=C) are not the primary stabilizing force. Instead, the collapsed globule contains an N–H···N network of local side-chain interactions and is stabilized by a dynamic network of persistent, long-distance water bridges, where individual water molecules form hydrogen bonds with multiple parts of the polymer chain.",

PRC2 catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which is targeted for chromatin compaction by PRC1. Importantly, PRC2-associated cofactors regulate its distinct activities, as in the case of MTF2 and JARID2 that direct PRC2 to specific chromatin nucleation sites based on preferred DNA-binding motifs. Here, we investigated EPOP whose role in regulating PRC2 was not well-defined. We find that both EPOP and MTF2 stimulate PRC2 histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity in vitro. Unlike MTF2, EPOP is ineffectual in PRC2 chromatin recruitment as evidenced by an EED-rescue system in vivo but promotes H3K27me3 deposition de novo in cooperation with MTF2 and JARID2. Binding assays using reconstituted dinucleosome substrates revealed that similar to MTF2, EPOP promotes PRC2 chromatin-binding activity in a distinct DNA-sequence-dependent manner (GCN-rich and GA-rich, respectively). Thus, EPOP and MTF2 in conjunction with JARID2 foster PRC2-mediated HMT activity at chromatin sites comprising cofactor-preferred DNA-binding sequences during the formation of H3K27me3-chromatin domains.",

Pharmacotherapy is the most widely used treatment for these disorders, and effective improvement requires a reliable animal model of human anxiety. Although communication in rats using ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) has been reported as a biologically valid animal model of human anxiety, an equivalent model in mice has not yet been established. To identify such USVs, we conducted physiological, behavioral, and pharmacological experiments using ddY strain mice. Ultrasonic sine waves within a limited frequency range enhanced anxiety levels in male mice. When female mice were exposed to ethologically stressful situations, they emitted a specific type of USV that was not only quantitatively abundant and qualitatively distinct but also within a frequency range that induced increased anxiety in male mice. Playback of these female USVs induced anxiety-related affective changes in male mice. We believe that these findings represent a step toward demonstrating ultrasonic vocal communication of negative affective states in laboratory mice. This study offers a foundation for developing mouse models using USVs as a tool to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of human anxiety disorders and to develop neuropharmacological therapies.",

Through a combination of phenotypic, cytological, and transcriptomic approaches, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified key defense-related genes and pathways. Leveraging the biological and genetic variability present in a collection of natural M. polymorpha accessions, we highlight the role of horizontally transferred microbial-like terpene synthase genes, which may contribute to the exceptional terpene diversity of liverworts and potentially play a role in pathogen resistance. GWAS uncovered candidate loci associated with resistance traits, implicating both core immune components and specialized metabolic pathways. Transcriptomic analyses performed on two accessions with contrasting phenotypes after inoculation with C. nymphaeae revealed the upregulation of accession-specific and horizontally acquired genes.

Canonical discriminant analysis indicates that the raw materials of these carnelian beads do not primarily derive from south China, but the Yanshan Orogeny, Central Asian Orogenic Belt and some unknown sources that might be close to Hexi Corridor, pointing to raw-material sources located over 1,000 km to the north of the Sichuan Basin.

In mammalian cells, conditions that activate ERK to submaximal levels are sufficient to sustain proliferation, survival, and transformation, while stimuli that activate ERK to very high levels often lead to cell death or cell cycle arrest. But while this “Goldilocks effect” is well known, the mechanisms have never been fully explained. In particular, threshold responses have been shown at the level of transcription and cell state changes, but whether phosphorylation responses upstream of these events also respond to thresholds is unknown. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to ask if molecular events in the ERK pathway respond to different thresholds of signaling strength, by quantifying changes in phosphorylation of pathway targets against the occupancy of the two activating phosphosites in ERK. The results show that most phosphorylation events track ERK activation faithfully, responding linearly with increasing 2P-ERK occupancy. But some sites respond nonlinearly, reaching maximal phosphorylation when 2P-ERK exceeds lower thresholds (10 to 40%), or increasing substantially after 2P-ERK exceeds higher thresholds (&gt;60%). Low threshold sites are found on transcriptional repressors that facilitate proliferation when inactivated by ERK/ribosomal s6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylation. By contrast, high threshold sites are found on proteins that are recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks and mediate DNA repair.

          "abstract": "Brainstem white matter (WM) bundles are essential conduits for neural signals that modulate homeostasis and consciousness. Their architecture forms the anatomic basis for brainstem connectomics, subcortical circuit models, and deep brain navigation tools. However, their small size and complex morphology, compared to cerebral WM, makes mapping and segmentation challenging in neuroimaging. As a result, fundamental questions about brainstem modulation of human homeostasis and consciousness remain unanswered. We leverage diffusion MRI tractography to create BrainStem Bundle Tool (BSBT), which automatically segments eight WM bundles in the rostral brainstem. BSBT performs segmentation on a custom probabilistic fiber map using a convolutional neural network architecture tailored to detect small anatomic structures. We demonstrate BSBT’s robustness across diffusion MRI acquisition protocols with in vivo scans of healthy subjects and ex vivo scans of human brain specimens with corresponding histology. BSBT also detected distinct brainstem bundle alterations in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury through tract-based analysis and classification tasks. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle evidence for the prognostic utility of BSBT in a longitudinal analysis of traumatic coma recovery. BSBT creates opportunities for scalable mapping of brainstem WM bundles and investigation of their role in a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial cell polarization is essential for many physiological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, nutrient absorption, barrier integrity, and directional secretion. A defining feature of such polarization is the separation of plasma membrane (PM) lipids and proteins into distinct apical and basolateral compartments. It has long been suggested that the apical compartment is rich in glycolipids and cholesterol and that this composition arises through trafficking of self-assembled membrane domains (termed lipid rafts). However, neither the detailed composition nor the mechanisms of molecular sorting between epithelial cell PM compartments have been fully resolved. Particularly, the lipid profile of the basolateral membrane and consequently the lipid disparity between the apical and basolateral membrane remain undefined. We developed a method to separately isolate the apical and basolateral PM and used lipidomics and biophysical profiling to characterize the changes in membrane composition and properties between these compartments in polarized Madin–Darby canine kidney cells. We find that the apical membrane is enriched in cholesterol, saturated lipids, and glycolipids relative to the basolateral membrane and that its biophysical properties reflect a more ordered environment. Further, we evaluate the longstanding hypothesis that lipid rafts contribute to apical protein trafficking by assessing the relationship between transmembrane domain raft affinity and apical localization and find that lipid raft affinity only modestly influences apical versus basolateral sorting. These findings define the distinct compositional and biophysical features of apical and basolateral compartments of epithelial cells and suggest mechanistic evidence for their biogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Evaporation from a multicomponent aqueous mixture not only establishes a hydration gradient but may also lead to composition gradients in the other components. Here, we show that such a gradient induces a strong segregation between two phospholipids that differ only in the saturation of their acyl chains. Using high-resolution confocal Raman microscopy combined with small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, we simultaneously resolve local composition and structure along the evaporation direction. We find that the saturated phospholipid, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), accumulates near the air–liquid interface, while the unsaturated phospholipid, dioleoyl phosphocholine (DOPC), is displaced toward a more hydrated intermediate region, resulting in a complete inversion of their initial proportions. This nonmonotonic lipid gradient reflects the different water swelling capacities of the L β′ and L α lamellar phases favored by DPPC and DOPC, respectively. Despite the system being out of equilibrium, the segregation is quantitatively captured by a description based on local equilibrium chemical potentials and multicomponent diffusion with cross-coupling. Our findings identify hydration gradients as a robust driver of lipid segregation and establish a general framework for predicting transport and organization in evaporating soft-matter systems.",

Simultaneously, cancer cells offload damaged mitochondria to macrophages through extracellular vesicles (EVs), facilitating their clearance and promoting tumor development. To disrupt this mitochondrial exchange, we developed a responsive liposomal nanocarrier (L&amp;G@Lipo PPV ) coencapsulating L-778123 and GW4869 to simultaneously inhibit TNT-mediated and vesicle-mediated mitochondrial transfer. This work provides the first comprehensive evidence of mitochondrial transfer dynamics in the TME, with tumor cells as the central hub, and highlights L&amp;G@Lipo PPV as an innovative and effective strategy to block mitochondrial crosstalk.

          "abstract": "The ATR/CHK1 pathway governs a crucial intra-S-phase checkpoint that safeguards genome stability under replication stress by stabilizing stalled replication forks and ensuring high-fidelity DNA replication. Traditionally, activation of this pathway is thought to rely on replication protein A (RPA)-coated single-stranded DNA, which recruits the ATR–ATRIP complex to sites of stalling fork, positioning RPA as essential for ATR signaling. In this study, we report a surprising and previously unrecognized phenomenon: acute depletion of RPA2 triggers robust ATR/CHK1 activation through an RPA-independent mechanism. Using 293A and RPE-1 cells engineered with an inducible RPA2-dTAG degron system, we observed increased phosphorylation of CHK1 at Ser296 and Ser345 in the absence of RPA. Notably, this elevated CHK1 phosphorylation was abolished by ATR inhibition, confirming its dependence on ATR kinase activity. Mechanistic analyses further revealed that this RPA-independent activation requires the checkpoint mediators RAD9 and TOPBP1. These findings uncover dual mechanisms, both RPA-dependent and -independent, of ATR/CHK1 pathway activation, highlighting a robust and flexible replication stress response network that preserves genome integrity even when canonical signaling is disrupted.",

          "abstract": "Proteins often exhibit subdiffusive configurational dynamics, the origins of which are still unresolved. We investigate the impact of non-Markovian friction and the free-energy landscape on the dynamics of fast-folding proteins in terms of the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the mean first-passage-time (MFPT) of the folding reaction coordinate. We find the friction memory kernel from published molecular dynamics simulations to be well-described by a hierarchical multiexponential function, which gives rise to subdiffusion in the MSD for times shorter than the longest memory time, while for longer times the confining free-energy landscape produces subdiffusion. Thus, for a wide range of times, friction memory effects in fast-folding proteins dominate the scaling behavior of the MSD compared to effects due to the folding free-energy landscape. As a consequence, Markovian models are insufficient to fully capture the folding dynamics, as quantified by the MSD and the MFPT, even when including coordinate-dependent friction. Our results demonstrate the importance of memory effects in protein folding and conformational dynamics and explicitly show that subdiffusion in fast-folding protein dynamics originates mainly from memory effects, not from the free-energy landscape and not from coordinate-dependent friction.",

          "abstract": "Stress is not uniform in the Earth. Therefore, we must use natural experiments to measure the distribution of stresses and related quantities, rather than single values. For instance, dynamic triggering shows that faults are uniformly distributed over their loading cycles in Southern California. The probability that a fault ruptures across a barrier measures the in situ energy distribution. Fault roughness reflects the distribution of strength. These natural experiments produce observable distributions that are surprisingly consistent and suggest some degree of self-organization in the Earth’s crust. Once established, the functional form of the distributions can be used to track changes in response to earthquakes as well as to distinguish fundamentally different fault systems. Transient fault locking before stress release in laboratory experiments can be interpreted as a consequence of self-organization of fault stress. The robust self-organization of multiple variables in earthquake systems suggests that the most consequential mechanical outcome of earthquakes may be the redistribution of stress and the strain energy associated with it. The low friction on a fault during seismic slip as inferred by temperature measurements of the Tohoku earthquake is consistent with dissipation playing a secondary role to this redistribution process. Through stress redistribution and interaction, subduction zone faults tend to synchronize, perhaps due to their geometric simplicity, while the continental system of Southern California cannot synchronize, perhaps due to the complexity of the fault network. Earthquakes organize stress in the crust and produce a suite of well-defined, consistent distributions.",

          "abstract": "It is widely accepted that meltwater from northern ice sheets drove changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, impacting global climate. In contrast, data are lacking on the Antarctic Ice Sheet’s (AIS) effect on Southern Ocean overturning, despite the Southern Ocean’s central role in ventilating the ocean interior. Here, we present diatom-bound nitrogen isotope evidence indicating that during deglaciations, as wind-driven upwelling in the open Antarctic Ocean increased, AIS melting strengthened density stratification in the polar Antarctic Ocean. This change coincides with reconstructions of meltwater discharge and resembles model simulations of global warming including AIS meltwater forcing. The transient input of freshwater and, thus, buoyancy weakened Southern Ocean’s “lower cell” that outcrops in the polar Antarctic Ocean even as open Antarctic Ocean’s “upper cell” strengthened. Given evidence that deep-ocean ventilation and CO 2 release were ongoing early in deglaciation, our data suggest that the open Antarctic Ocean, and not solely the most polar Antarctic Ocean, can directly ventilate the deep ocean. During the last deglaciation, the strongest density stratification in the polar Antarctic Ocean occurred just before the Antarctic Cold Reversal, when southern hemisphere warming paused and the northern hemisphere warmed sharply (i.e., during the Bølling–Allerød period). We propose that when combined with stronger wind-driven upwelling, the freshwater-driven redirection of upwelled water away from deep water formation and toward the upper cell deepened the global pycnocline, working to restart North Atlantic deep water formation in the Bølling–Allerød period. If so, polar ocean freshening in both hemispheres drove the “bipolar seesaw” events of deglaciation.",

This transcription is unusually mediated by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) and occurs in a specialized nuclear body, the expression site body (ESB). While factors promoting active BES transcription and silencing inactive BESs are known, how these opposing activities are integrated remains unknown. Here, we identify ESBX (Tb927.3.1660) as a BSF-specific ESB protein necessary for this coordination. We show that ESBX RNAi knockdown prevents RNA Pol I localizing to the ESB and reduces active BES transcription, while also derepressing inactive BESs with low processivity transcription. Conversely, ESBX overexpression weakly activates inactive BESs in a distinct manner from ESBX knockdown, leading to processive transcription, without disrupting the active BES or forming supernumerary ESBs. ESBX knockdown causes a similar transcriptomic defect to ESB1 and VEX2 knockdown combined, establishing ESBX as a key factor linking transcriptional activation of the active BES with inactive BES silencing through the VSG exclusion (VEX) phenomenon. This allows us to suggest models for understanding the establishment and maintenance of monoallelic expression critical for parasite immune evasion.",

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited efficacy in ER-positive disease, highlighting the need for the development of combination immunotherapies for these patients. We previously established that nitroso-N-methylurea-induced mammary tumors in outbred Sprague-Dawley rats mimic immune evasive mechanisms and the heterogeneity of ICI response observed in patients. We identified a “luminal growing” gene signature in ER-positive tumors, which correlated with tumor growth and immune-related differences. Here, we evaluated targeting candidates from this signature KMT5B/C and IKBKE using inhibitors A-196 and IKBKEi respectively, alongside anti-estrogen (fulvestrant) and a TGFβ blocking antibody (NIS793), both individually and in combination with αPD-L1, within this rat model. Fulvestrant emerged as the most effective treatment, inducing regression of most existing tumors and reducing on-treatment tumor burden when combined with αPD-L1. A-196, while ineffective as a monotherapy, demonstrated enhanced response when combined with αPD-L1. Comprehensive tumor profiling through polychromatic flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that A-196 induced a luminal-to-basal shift in tumor epithelial cells, enhancing antigen presentation, whereas epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition was linked to fulvestrant resistance. Our findings underscore the value of the rat mammary tumor model for preclinical studies in ER-positive breast cancer and advocate for the further validation and potential clinical development of KMT5B/C inhibitors to enhance the efficacy and broaden the applicability of ICI therapy in cancer patients.",

Both functions are essential for the learning and expression of conditioned fear responses, but how these processes are integrated remains largely unexplored. In this study, we simultaneously recorded single-unit activity from the dorsal and ventral hippocampus during fear conditioning in male rats to identify the neural dynamics that may underlie these processes and their integration. As fear expression emerged, shifts in neural firing patterns were observed in both regions, with a stronger shift in ventral hippocampal activity, as expected. However, contrary to the prevailing view of the ventral hippocampus as central to anxiety and fear regulation, surprisingly, fear expression-related neuronal responses were more predominant in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, ventral hippocampal neuronal activity was more closely linked with the acquisition of conditioned fear. These features were combined in cell assemblies that emerged during fear conditioning, composed of both dorsal fear expression-responsive neurons and ventral fear learning-responsive cells. These multifactorial engrams, distributed along the hippocampal dorsoventral axis, provide a potential substrate for integrating fear acquisition and expression, thereby coordinating associative learning.",

Converging evidence implicates dopamine in postencoding hippocampal mechanisms inferred to support long-term memory, though there is a lack of direct evidence in humans. We address this gap using pharmacological functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). Using a motivated reward encoding task on and off oral methylphenidate, we tested whether individual differences in baseline dopamine ([ 11 C]raclopride PET D2/3 receptor density) relate to drug-induced changes in hippocampal postencoding processes. Our study focused on healthy older adults, who are among those most vulnerable to memory decline and may benefit from pharmacologically enhancing dopamine. We found that methylphenidate administration was associated with improved memory performance relative to placebo for both high and low reward conditions. Older adults with high receptor density showed greater persistence of hippocampal multivoxel patterns into postencoding rest and stronger hippocampus-midbrain resting-state connectivity following encoding while on methylphenidate. These findings support the view that enhanced dopaminergic tone, verified through PET, directly modulates hippocampal postencoding dynamics in humans. Substantial variation in neurobiological effects was associated with individual differences in baseline dopamine function as older adults with high dopamine receptor density profiles showed preferential benefit of drug on hippocampal function, though these insights are qualified by null associations between memory performance and postencoding hippocampal activity. Individuals with lower dopamine receptor profiles showed preferential benefit of reward incentives suggesting altered sensitivity to extrinsic motivational factors depending on endogenous dopamine function.",

          "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) enables animals to learn new tasks without erasing prior knowledge. CL in artificial neural networks (NNs) is challenging due to catastrophic forgetting, where new learning degrades performance on older tasks. While various techniques exist to mitigate forgetting, theoretical insights into when and why CL fails in NNs are lacking. Here, we present a statistical-mechanics theory of CL in deep, wide NNs, which characterizes the network’s input–output mapping as it learns a sequence of tasks. It gives rise to order parameters (OPs) that capture how task relations and network architecture influence forgetting and anterograde interference, as verified by numerical evaluations. For networks with a shared readout for all tasks (single-head CL), the relevant-feature and rule similarity between tasks, respectively measured by two OPs, are sufficient to predict a wide range of CL behaviors on classic benchmark tasks. In addition, the theory predicts that increasing the network depth can effectively reduce interference between tasks, thereby lowering forgetting. For networks with task-specific readouts (multihead CL), the theory identifies a phase transition where CL performance shifts dramatically as tasks become less similar, as measured by another task-similarity OP. While forgetting is relatively mild compared to single-head CL across all tasks, sufficiently low similarity leads to catastrophic anterograde interference, where the network retains old tasks and interpolates new training data perfectly but completely fails to generalize new learning. Our results delineate important factors affecting CL performance and offer theoretical insights into common heuristics for mitigation of forgetting.",

However, the understanding of templated amorphous silica mineralization remains limited, hindering the rational design of complex silica-based materials. Here, we report the finding of ultrastable and monodispersed cationic silica cluster (CSC) and their assembly using DNA nanostructures as programmable attachment templates. Cryo-EM imaging reveal that a typical CSC with a diameter of gyration of ~3.9 nm and an average molecular weight of ~8, 262 Da is characteristic of a branched hierarchical structure. We demonstrate high-fidelity silicification by tuning the composition and structure of CSC, providing a unified model of silicification by cluster attachment. Our findings pave the way toward the molecular tuning of pre- and postnucleation stages of sol–gel reactions and provide insights for the design of silica-based materials with controlled organization and functionality.",

The receptor-binding protein (RBP) binds host receptors whereas the fusion protein (F) merges viral and host membranes. Here, we use nonreplicative pseudoviruses to safely measure the effects of all F single amino acid residue mutations on its cell entry function and neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We compare mutational tolerance in F with previous experimental measurements for RBP and show that F is much more functionally constrained than the RBP. We also identify mutationally intolerant sites on the F trimer surface and core that are critical for proper function, and describe mutations that are candidates for stabilizing F in the prefusion conformation for vaccine design. We quantify how F mutations affect neutralization by six monoclonal antibodies, and show that the magnitude of mutational effects on neutralization varies among antibodies. Our measurements of mutational effects on Nipah virus F predict the ability of the antibodies to neutralize the related Hendra virus. Overall, our work defines the functional and antigenic constraints on the F protein from an important zoonotic virus.",

          "abstract": "Missense mutations play a critical role in human disease, contributing to both inherited disorders and cancer. However, accurately predicting their functional impact—particularly for cancer driver mutations—remains a major challenge due to limited validated labels and the complex molecular basis of oncogenesis. Here, we systematically characterized over 120,000 missense variants across pathogenic, benign, driver, passenger, recurrent somatic, and common population classes, using a comprehensive set of mechanistically grounded molecular features. By assessing the statistical burden of variations, we demonstrated that these features effectively discriminate among diverse variant classes and reveal a consistent enrichment of functional sites, structural integrity, and biophysical changes in pathogenic and driver mutations. Building on these insights, we developed MutaPheno, an interpretable framework for predicting the functional consequences of missense mutations. The model integrates 34 molecular-level features, encompassing structural, functional, physicochemical, and contextual descriptors, using a random forest algorithm. Trained exclusively on pathogenic and benign variants, MutaPheno achieved strong accuracy in predicting cancer driver mutations, outperforming both cancer-specific and general pathogenicity tools, while also demonstrating superior robustness when tested on unseen proteins. Our findings highlight the shared mechanisms between pathogenic and driver mutations and emphasize the role of molecular features in improving variant interpretation. MutaPheno provides a transparent and generalizable tool that can facilitate driver discovery and the development of targeted therapies.",

Two influential models, the drift-barrier hypothesis (DBH) and the mutational-hazard hypothesis, propose that effective population size ( N e ) shapes these traits via the efficiency of selection, predicting higher μ and larger genomes in small populations. A recent comparative analysis of vertebrates reported a significant negative correlation between N e and μ , interpreted as support for the DBH. Using phylogenetic path analysis, we reanalyze the same dataset of 55 vertebrate species spanning mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes, in which μ was estimated from high-coverage parent–offspring trios, while explicitly controlling for six life-history traits within a causal framework that tests model-implied conditional independencies. We show that the reported N e - μ association is entirely mediated by generation time (GT), which independently influences both variables; once this “back-door” path is blocked, N e has no detectable effect on μ . Once GT is accounted for, mating system shows the largest association with μ . Parallel analyses of GS within the same validated life-history framework reveal that GS is unrelated to N e , μ , or their interaction and is decoupled from the life-history covariation that strongly structures μ . These results are robust to alternative N e estimators and causal model formulations. Together, our findings indicate that N e provides little explanatory power for variation in μ or GS across vertebrates, challenging the presumed universality of drift-limited genome evolution.",

The question “what makes research findings trustworthy?” elicits different answers depending on whether the emphasis is on research integrity and ethics, research methods, transparency, inclusion, assessment and peer review, or scholarly communication. Each provides partial insight. We offer a systems approach that focuses on whether the research is accountable, evaluable, well-formulated, has been evaluated, controls for bias, reduces error, and whether the claims are warranted by the evidence. We tie each of these components to measurable indicators of trustworthiness for evaluating the research itself, the researchers conducting the research, and the organizations supporting the research. Our goals are to offer a framework that can be applied across methods, approaches, and disciplines and to foster innovation in development of trustworthiness indicators. Developing valid indicators will improve the conduct and assessment of research and, ultimately, public understanding and trust.",

          "abstract": "The Pliocene is the most recent epoch in which the Earth warmed under atmospheric CO 2 levels similar to today (&gt;400 ppm). The Pliocene then transitioned to the colder Pleistocene epoch, with the initiation of large-scale Northern Hemisphere glaciations. Although ocean temperature changes across these epochs are relatively well-known, quantitative estimates of the magnitude of land temperature change in the tropics are scarce. We provide a Plio-Quaternary quantitative air temperature record based on the distribution of bacterial branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) preserved in sediments of the Funza-II core in the Sabana de Bogotá, Colombia (~4°N). Using a refined age model based on new U-Pb zircon dates from ash layers, and a novel mixed-source model that disentangles contributions from lake- and soil-derived brGDGTs, we show that warm Pliocene (3.8 to 2.58 Ma) temperatures were 4 . 8 - 1.4 + 1.8 °C warmer than the last ~800,000 y of the colder Pleistocene. The evolution of Pliocene-Pleistocene temperature in our record largely mirrors long-term tropical sea surface temperature (SST) cooling, highlighting the linkages between sea and land temperatures in the low latitudes via greenhouse-gas forcing. The median amplitude of Pliocene-Pleistocene cooling in the northern tropical Andes exceeds that predicted by theory, highlighting the importance of regional feedbacks including lapse rate adjustments and/or changes in Pacific SST gradients to the long-term evolution of Andean temperature. This first quantitative terrestrial temperature reconstruction within 5° of the equator over the past 3.8 My highlights that both regional and global processes must be considered when constraining uncertainties for future warming scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Essential metals accumulate in the basal ganglia at elevated levels and induce incurable motor disease. But, unlike other motor diseases, the neuronal targets of essential metals are unknown, and this fundamental knowledge gap has limited therapeutic progress. Because metal efflux transporters have high specificity, we hypothesized that neuron-specific knockout or knockin (i.e., overexpression) of efflux transporters may alter metal levels in targeted neurons and define the neuronal targets of metal-induced disease. To test this, we focused on manganese (Mn)-induced motor disease, which is a public health problem. We generated six neuron-specific Slc30a10 mouse strains with knockout or knockin of the Mn efflux transporter Slc30a10 in dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic neurons. In the knockout strains, SLC30A10 was depleted and Mn levels were elevated in targeted brain regions. However, only dopaminergic- or glutamatergic-, but not GABAergic-, specific knockouts developed motor deficits without Mn exposure. Conversely, in the knockins, SLC30A10 was elevated and the increase in Mn levels after Mn exposure was attenuated in targeted regions. However, only dopaminergic- or glutamatergic-, but not GABAergic-, specific knockins were protected against Mn-induced motor deficits. Dopaminergic-specific Slc30a10 knockouts also exhibited deficits in dopaminergic neurotransmission that were consistent with their motor phenotype. Overall, 1) elevated Mn targets dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons to induce motor disease, and 2) neuron-specific knockout/knockin of efflux transporters is an effective strategy to isolate the neuronal targets and underlying mechanisms of metal-induced neurological disease.",

Here, we used trait data for a total of 3,299 ant species to explore how three key social traits (reproductive structure, colony size, and worker polymorphism) vary with environmental conditions globally. We show that trait compositions are strongly structured by biomes, indicating that habitat types, as well as environmental factors like temperature and seasonality, influence sociality.

However, current molecular classifications largely overlook its complex spatial organization and tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we performed spatial transcriptomics on 43 hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) ILC tumors with detailed morphological annotation and long-term clinical follow-up. By integrating spatial gene expression with histology and single-cell deconvolution, we characterized the composition and architecture of the TME and revealed high inter- and intratumor heterogeneity. Spatial clustering uncovered cell populations and pathways linked to clinical outcome. We then developed a multimodal classification of ILC by integrating gene expression, morphology, and spatial metrics, identifying four distinct subtypes: normal/stroma-enriched (NSE), proliferative (P), androgen receptor-enriched (ARE), and metabolic/immune-enriched (MIE). These subtypes, collectively termed ILC4TME, reflect the interplay between tumor and microenvironmental features. Gene signatures derived from the spatial data enabled subtype assignment in external bulk RNA-seq and microarray datasets (SCAN-B, METABRIC), revealing reproducible biology and significant associations with survival. In multivariable models, ILC4TME retained prognostic value beyond established gene signatures and clinicopathological variables. Notably, the P subtype was linked to poor prognosis, even in patients treated with endocrine therapy alone, while the NSE subtype was associated with favorable outcomes. Our findings uncover spatial and cellular heterogeneity in ILC that is not captured by existing classification approaches, offering a refined framework for risk stratification and therapeutic targeting based on tumor microenvironment architecture.",

Two main processes have been invoked, namely extreme differentiation of a peraluminous granitic magma and direct anatexis of a sedimentary protolith. We use geochemical modeling to quantify lithium enrichment via these two processes from a study of the Jiajika lithium pegmatite field, one of the largest of its type in the world. Based on a lithium–silicon–boron–barium (Li-Si-B-Ba) isotope study involving systematic sampling along 4,211-m of core from two deep boreholes and from the regional zonation of pegmatites at outcrops, we propose a three-stage model for the formation of the pegmatite field: i) generation of a rare metal-rich melt by deep anatexis, involving ~5% partial melting of metapelitic rocks in the presence of 10 to 30% metamorphic fluid; ii) gradual enrichment of rare metals along a path of continuous magma differentiation until 75% of the initial melt had crystallized; and iii) a final stage of lithium mineralization during the escape of the water-rich magma due to the overpressures created in response to massive fluid exsolution and the extensional stress in the granite dome structure. The study provides important insights into how lithium-rich pegmatites can be targeted during exploration for pegmatite-hosted resources of lithium.",

A primary in vivo target for GLOD4-mediated nitration is alpha-synuclein (α-syn), which is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related disorders. We document tyrosine nitration of α-syn by GLOD4 in vitro, in cells, and in a murine model of synuclein pathology. The data identified a function of GLOD4 and other structurally related proteins that catalyze the peroxynitrite-mediated selective protein tyrosine nitration.

          "abstract": "The transcription factor complex White Collar Complex (WCC) functions both as a photoreceptor and as the circadian positive element. In response to light, WCC acutely activates ~5% of all genes, whereas in the dark it influences expression of about 40% of the transcriptome. Among WCC targets is frq , which is acutely light-activated through the pLRE ( proximal Light-Response Element ) and circadian-regulated through the C-box ( Clock-box ) promoter element that is not responsible for light-driven expression. The FRQ–FRH complex (FFC), which includes CK-1a, represses WCC activity at the C-box by phosphorylating WCC at &gt;95 sites, but FFC has no described role in the light. We validated the expectation that FFC also silences C-box promoters in constant light, thereby confirming two classes of WCC targets: C-box -like genes that are normally repressed in light and pLRE -like genes that remain light-active despite FFC-driven WCC phosphorylation. Derepression of C-box -like promoters in frq -null fungi may explain reported noncircadian phenotypes such as reduced virulence and conidiation. Reanalysis of WCC circadian regulation revealed that, while most WCC is phosphorylated and repressed at dusk, subsequent circadian activation results from transient dephosphorylation of only a small subset of the WCC pool. This small active pool drives frq expression, nucleating the FFC, which rephosphorylates WCC to repress it again, generating a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle that can persist for days without new WCC synthesis. The realization that both FFC and WCC are regulated primarily through phosphorylation rather than protein turnover leaves the circadian oscillator looking much like a “phoscillator,” emphasizing the primacy of posttranslational regulation in timekeeping.",

During this time, executive functions mature alongside pronounced structural changes in the brain, including reductions in synapse density. Computational models suggest that synaptic pruning enhances performance by stabilizing neural dynamics—deepening attractor basins and accelerating return to baseline after perturbation. Here, we tested these predictions using EEG data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized controlled trial of foster care as an alternative to institutionalized care. Trial-by-trial EEG residuals during a Flanker task were modeled as a linear dynamical system, and changes in eigenvalue magnitude were tracked across adolescence. Across all groups, eigenvalues decreased with age, consistent with maturation of recurrent computations. However, children with histories of institutional care exhibited consistently higher eigenvalues, suggesting delayed or disrupted refinement of the neural dynamics. Importantly, higher eigenvalues were associated with poorer behavioral performance on the task, linking altered neural dynamics to altered executive functions. These findings demonstrate that early deprivation leaves a lasting imprint on the developmental trajectory of neural dynamics, affecting the maturation of brain systems underlying cognitive control.",

          "abstract": "Current methodologies for detecting the sequence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) require amplifying and denaturing the target into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to enable sequence detection through Watson–Crick base pairing. However, these approaches are limited by the risks of nonspecific amplification, reliance on complex, temperature-sensitive protein enzymes, and harsh reaction conditions, such as in strong base or acidic environments. Here, we introduce a dsDNA detection platform that integrates a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as the dsDNA denaturation agent, with multicomponent deoxyribozyme as the ssDNA detection tool, in a droplet-based system. This protein- and amplification-free method offers single-nucleotide resolution, detects down to a single dsDNA molecule, and delivers results within 1 h at room temperature. This work introduces a conceptually unique approach, that may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.",

This study employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to investigate rhodopsin structure using a megabody (Mb7) as a negative allosteric modulator. Three distinct cryo-EM structures were solved: ground-state rhodopsin, photoactivated rhodopsin, and apo-rhodopsin, all in complex with Mb7. Photoactivated rhodopsin and apo-rhodopsin, both in complex with Mb7, maintain a conformation remarkably similar to ground-state rhodopsin rather than adopting a Meta-II-like conformation. Structural elements, including the conserved residues of the NPxxY motif and the ionic lock, remain in positions corresponding to inactive rhodopsin. The megabody forms extensive interactions with rhodopsin’s extracellular loop 2, N terminus, and glycans. The findings demonstrate that Mb7 stabilizes photoactivated rhodopsin in a Meta-I-like conformation, preventing progression to the active Meta-II state through specific immobilization of the extracellular domain. This work establishes a foundation for cryo-EM-guided discovery of ligands modulating rhodopsin.",

          "abstract": "Quantum-chaotic systems exhibit several universal properties, ranging from level repulsion in the energy spectrum to wavefunction delocalization. On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the energy levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exists yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of the energy spectrum, such as the spectral compressibility χ , and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension D 1 of the Shannon–von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here, we study physical systems subject to local and nonlocal hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the random banded matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports the validity of the simple relation χ + D 1 = 1 in all systems under investigation. Hence, we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings, we derive a universal function D 1 ( r ) of the averaged level spacing ratio r , which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.",

          "abstract": "Eusocial hymenoptera recognize nestmates based on colony-specific profiles of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). While these profiles contain a variety of alkanes, the less abundant alkenes are crucial for nestmate recognition [F. R. Dani et al. , Chem. Senses 30 , 477–489 (2005)]. However, due to their carbon–carbon double bonds, alkenes can easily become degraded by oxidants. One of those oxidants, ozone, that usually reaches concentrations of 10 ppb in nonurban areas and ca 30 ppb in cities nowadays has been reported to often exceed 100 ppb in highly polluted regions, with levels above 200 ppb occasionally reported. Here, we show that short exposure to such elevated levels degrades alkenes in CHC profiles of all six investigated ant species and compromises nestmate recognition in five of them. Furthermore, a separate experiment with long-term exposure to such ozone levels corrupted brood care behavior within ant colonies, resulting in the death of larvae. The oxidizing pollutants like ozone have already been shown to corrupt interactions of flowers and their pollinators [B. Cook et al. , J. Chem. Biol. 46 , 987–996 (2020)] as well as sex pheromone communication in multiple species of flies [N. J. Jiang et al. , Nat. Commun. 14 (2023)].

          "abstract": "Stomata, specialized structures of plant epidermis, are crucial for gas (e.g., CO 2 , O 2 , and H 2 O) exchange between plants and the environment. Stomatal density and pattern are governed by ERECTA family (ERf) receptor-like kinases-controlled signaling. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a new mechanism for the internalization of receptors to activate the downstream signaling in animals. Here, we found that mutation of CME components resulted in formation of stomatal clusters and thus increased stomatal index. The adaptor protein 2σ (AP2σ) subunit of CME interacted with ERf. ERf receptor internalization required CME. Furthermore, the ERf receptor motifs were identified to be recognized by AP2σ. Genetic analysis showed that CME components CHC2, CLC2, and CLC3 acted downstream of EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR 1/2 while upstream of YODA and worked together with ERf to regulate stomatal development. Consistently, EPF2-induced MAPK activation was significantly reduced in chc2-2 clc2 clc3 and ap2μ clc2 clc3 mutants or when the ERf endocytic motifs were mutated, leading to stabilized SPEECHLESS protein and misregulated stomatal lineage progression. Overall, our findings demonstrate that activation of the ERf receptors via internalization is essential for stomatal development, establishing a mechanism of CME-mediated receptor internalization activation in plants.",

There is increased infiltration of villous but not crypt epithelium T cells bearing either αβ or γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) in CeD. Both T cell subsets are activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and are the predominant mucosal source of IFNγ. In response to this IFNγ, villous but not crypt enterocytes show an IFNγ signature, including nuclear phospho-STAT1 protein, class II HLA molecules and IFNγ-inducible chemokines known to recruit CTLs (e.g., CCL3, CCL4, CXCL10, and CXCL11) and receptors for these chemokines are expressed on the infiltrating CTLs. Villous enterocytes also display increased HLA-E and HLA-B mRNAs and proteins. Bioinformatic analyses (NICHES) and proximity ligation assays show frequent binding of both αβ and γδ TCRs with enterocyte HLA-E or HLA-B , but not HLA-DR . In contrast, NKG2C, proposed as an alternative trigger of CTL activation, is infrequently expressed and shows few interactions with HLA-E.

While GWIS detected no significant interactions, we identified 8,225 potentially important SNP–environment pairs across 1,732 genes, with childhood trauma contributing most prominently. Stratified heritability was higher among childhood trauma–exposed individuals (13.3%) versus those unexposed (6.0%).

To demonstrate this approach, we optimize an RCJ designed to replicate the trajectory of a human knee, achieving a 99.6% reduction in alignment error compared to revolute joints and a 99.3% error reduction compared to circular RCJs. Additionally, we show that optimized RCJs increase the load-carrying capacity of a two-finger gripper by more than 3.5 times compared to a comparable circular-jointed design, showcasing how joint optimization can enhance robotic performance.",

While extensive research has focused on the prevalence of this vector-borne pathogen in natural populations, increases of human cases and clinical manifestation, and pathogen structure, little is known about the movements of B. microti within vertebrate red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs are nonmotile due to their lack of cellular structures for active movement. Here, we report a phenomenon in which B. microti –infected RBCs exhibit an acquired motility compared to uninfected RBCs. Using live-cell tracking, we observed a subset (around 1% in whole blood and 10% in 1:100 diluted blood) of infected RBCs displayed active movement. This acquired motility suggests that B. microti may induce host cell modifications that facilitate its survival, dissemination, or immune evasion potential, allowing it to successfully move through the blood and infect new RBCs. Our findings highlight unconventional RBC dynamics and a potential broad aspect of B. microti pathogenesis. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon could provide insights into parasite–host interactions and reveal targets for therapeutic intervention in treatment and/or prevention of babesiosis.",

          "abstract": "The viral shunt is a fundamental ecosystem process which diverts the flux of organic carbon fixed through photosynthesis during algal bloom events from heterotrophic grazers to bacteria. Through the extracellular release of metabolites, lytic viral infections supply 2 to 10% of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the ocean for bacterial respiration. Despite its significance for the carbon cycle, we lack tools to detect the viral shunt in the natural environment and assess its ecological impact. Here, we investigated the use of exometabolites as biomarkers for the viral shunt by applying molecular, metabolomics, and oceanographic tools to study bloom dynamics of the cosmopolitan microalga Gephyrocapsa huxleyi (formerly Emiliania huxleyi ) across the Atlantic Ocean, spanning four biogeochemical provinces between Iceland and Patagonia. We mapped the distinct metabolic footprint of its viral infections using exo- and endometabolomics and detected nineteen organohalogen metabolites across the blooms, showing their global distribution. A time-resolved comparison of particulate and dissolved metabolite pools during an induced mesocosm bloom revealed that virocells—actively infected host cells—were the source of the halogenated metabolites. Three trichloro-iodo metabolites were present during the demise of all virus-infected oceanic blooms, highlighting them as suitable metabolic biomarkers for the viral shunt. The environmental stability of these halometabolites in the dissolved organic matter pool over a few days can recapitulate viral infections at earlier stages of phytoplankton bloom succession. The chloro-iodo metabolites thereby expand the existing repertoire of metabolic biomarkers for viral infections at sea and may advance efforts to trace the biogeochemical impact of alga–virus interactions in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Precise and adaptable movements are achieved by well-regulated muscle contractions, which are mainly governed by the excitability of motor neurons. Several neuromodulatory systems originating in the motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord regulate motor neuron excitability via the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and serotonin. However, these systems can have seemingly similar effects on motor neuron output, raising questions about interaction during movement. To address this, we investigated two modulatory systems in mice: the cholinergic V0c interneurons in the spinal cord and the serotonergic system in the brainstem. Electromyographic and behavioral recordings revealed that, when compared to control mice, mice whose V0c interneuron cholinergic output was genetically inactivated failed to display speed-dependent modulation of the gastrocnemius muscle, and exhibited lower amplitude bursting in the gastrocnemius muscle during swimming. c-Fos expression in this population during locomotion also indicated that they are active in a speed-dependent manner. Relative to control mice, those mice whose V0c interneurons had their cholinergic output inactivated showed upregulated activity in motor-related serotonergic populations while trotting at higher speeds but not while walking at lower speeds, indicating that serotonin plays a compensatory role in the absence of functional V0c interneurons. Last, we observed a progressive recruitment of these two populations in mice with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the recruitment of serotonergic neurons is hastened in those mice whose V0c interneurons had their cholinergic output inactivated. These findings highlight that modulatory systems scale their activity to match motor demand across various circumstances.",

          "abstract": "As well known, almost 80% of the total oceanic kinetic energy is contained within the mesoscale eddies, but the cross-scale energy transfers linking eddy generation and dissipation remain an open question. The Earth rotation controls the generation of mesoscale eddies that transfer energy toward larger scales via an inverse cascade, but a transfer to small scale is needed for dissipation: a coexistence of transfers is indeed required. However, the turbulent energy cascade, responsible for oceanic circulation energy balance and nutrient mixing, involves such a large range of scales making extremely challenging the investigation of the full spectrum of processes. This study examines how energy and enstrophy cascade across ocean scales in the inner shelf of the Great Bay Area of the South China Sea using high-resolution numerical simulations. By applying coarse-graining techniques, the results reveal a predominant inverse energy cascade scenario driven by the interplay between background stratification and rotation, particularly in areas affected by the Pearl River’s freshwater influx. Geographical heterogeneity significantly influences these dynamics, with shallow inlets experiencing increased frictional drag and energy dissipation due to complex bathymetry, while open-water areas show heightened submesoscale activity. Seasonal monsoon cycles further modulate these processes, with summer winds amplifying nonlinear energy transfers through increased wind stress and river discharge, in contrast to the tidally dominated, quasi-steady flows observed in winter. Understanding how wind and tide affect ocean mixing can help to develop more accurate climate models and better strategies for protecting coastal ecosystems.",

However, the mechanisms driving the transition from acute myocarditis to DCMi remain poorly understood. Although IL-17A-mediated inflammation is a well-known driver of this progression, the intracellular regulators that sustain and amplify this response remain unclear. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, which is upregulated in the hearts of DCMi patients and experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) mice, as a key amplifier of IL-17A-driven inflammation in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), promoting disease progression and fibrosis. TRIM21 deficiency significantly attenuates EAM progression, reducing inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic remodeling. Mechanistically, TRIM21 is induced by IL-17A in CFs and promotes K27-linked polyubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of IL-17A signaling, thereby establishing a self-reinforcing IL-17A-TRIM21–TRAF3 positive feedback loop. Finally, specific knockdown of TRIM21 in CFs via the AAV9-Postn strategy effectively alleviates EAM severity. These findings identify TRIM21 as an intracellular mediator of sustained IL-17A signaling in myocarditis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing progression to DCMi.",

Previous transcriptomic studies of the Drosophila ring gland—which is composed of the corpus allatum (CA), prothoracic gland (PG), and corpora cardiaca (CC)—have treated the ring gland as a single tissue. As a result, these approaches lacked the resolution necessary to dissect JH biosynthesis and its regulation in a cell-type-specific manner. To overcome this limitation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 7,919 cells isolated from the larval ring glands. This analysis resolved distinct transcriptional profiles for the CA, PG, and CC, and enabled the identification of CA-specific transcription factors. Among them, SoxNeuro (SoxN), was found to be essential for JH biosynthesis and functionally important for both metamorphosis and reproduction. We further demonstrate that SoxN physically interacts with Ventral veins lacking (Vvl) to form a transcriptional complex that directly regulates Jhamt , a rate-limiting enzyme in JH biosynthesis, via a defined promoter region. Together, this work presents a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the Drosophila ring gland and identifies the SoxN–Vvl complex as a critical regulator of JH biosynthesis, offering insight into the transcriptional control of insect endocrine function.",

          "abstract": "Actuators drive robotic motion, and their energy conversion efficiency is a key performance metric that informs power consumption. Soft electrostatic actuators promise new opportunities for bioinspired and wearable robotics, being driven by electrical signals and producing high-speed, muscle-like motion. Unlike electromagnetic motors, for which efficiency has been systematically studied, efficiency of soft actuators lacks a standardized definition and measurement method, highlighting the need for a unified framework for the evaluation of their efficiency. Here, we propose a comprehensive method to study electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion in soft electrostatic actuators by analyzing closed cycles on planes spanned by work-conjugate variables: voltage–charge and force–position; our experimental setup allows us to prescribe and measure in real-time all work-conjugate variables and thus, to evaluate efficiency as function of load, electric potential, frequency, and actuator materials. We introduce a practical work cycle to evaluate actuators, and, using Peano-HASEL (Hydraulically Amplified Self-healing ELectrostatic) actuators as a model system, we reveal that efficiency is highly dependent on applied voltage, force, and actuation frequency; within the tested range of parameters, we measure a maximum efficiency of 63.6%, which is more than three times the previously reported value for HASEL actuators. We further study energy losses inherent in mechanical and electrical cycles. We show the general applicability of our method across different electrostatic actuators by applying it to a pure-shear dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA), demonstrating efficiencies up to 62.9%. This comprehensive method will facilitate the study and development of electrostatic actuators for the next generation of highly efficient soft robots.",

          "abstract": "Deciphering the structure of variable sensory input is key to building an accurate model of one’s environment. Humans can accumulate evidence from sequences of stimuli to estimate their sensory statistics, predict the timing of upcoming stimuli, but also discover rules governing sequence generation. However, whether these three forms of inference operate independently or synergistically remains untested. Here, we report selective interactions between sensory integration, temporal prediction, and rule discovery in humans. Participants were exposed to rhythmic sequences of 10 stimuli governed or not by a latent rule—a predictable change in stimulus statistics after five stimuli—and then asked to predict the 10th stimulus from incomplete sequences. Individual differences in sensory integration timescale for rule-free sequences predicted efficient rule discovery. Conversely, discovering the latent rule shaped the timescale and format of sensory integration for rule-based sequences. Tampering with the rhythmicity of stimulus presentation impaired rule discovery without affecting sensory integration accuracy. Selective perturbations of recurrent neural networks trained in the same conditions confirmed these specific interactions. Together, these findings provide insights into the flexibility of human inferences based on variable yet predictable sensory input.",

          "abstract": "Energy is required for the expression and maintenance of complex traits. In many habitats, however, free energy available to support biosynthesis is in vanishingly short supply. As a result, many taxa have evolved persistence strategies that support survival in unfavorable environments. Among these is sporulation, an ancient bacterial program governed by a large genetic network that requires energy for both regulation and execution. Yet sporulation is a last resort, initiated when cellular energy is nearly exhausted. To resolve this paradox, we quantified the energetic cost of sporulation in units of ATP by integrating time-resolved genome, transcriptome, and proteome profiles. The full cost of the spore cycle, including both formation and revival, ranks among the most energy-intensive processes in the bacterial cell, requiring almost 10 10 ATP and consuming about 10% of the total energy budget. The majority of this cost arises from translation, membrane synthesis, and protein turnover. Despite its considerable upfront investment, sporulation enables long-term survival and becomes optimal when harsh conditions extend over timescales of months or longer. This trade-off between immediate cost and delayed benefit helps explain when sporulation is maintained or replaced by alternative strategies. By incorporating our estimates into mechanistic models, we show how metabolic constraints shape sporulation efficiency, while genome-wide mutation accumulation data reveal that even modest energetic burdens can become visible to selection, influencing the evolutionary fate of this complex and widespread trait.",

This trend is consistent with the previously published 2004 to 2021 value of –2.1 ± 1.2% per decade. A more careful analysis of uncertainty now provides a more robust likely (one-sigma) range. From analyses of a range of factors controlling the N 2 O lifetime, we find that the decrease in lifetime can be explained by recent changes in stratospheric circulation and temperature. Projection of the lifetime change to 2100 shows that this effect is comparable to differences across the shared socioeconomic pathways used for climate projections and cannot be ignored. An updated evaluation of the N 2 O chemical feedbacks shows that this effect produces a relatively small shift in atmospheric abundance over the 21st century, but still an important shift, –11%, in the global warming potential of N 2 O.",

Feeding tubes have essential functions as they complex with the host endomembrane system for nutrient uptake to sustain parasitism. Despite their significance, they remain one of the least understood aspects of nematode parasitism of plants. Their small size and location within giant-cells deeply embedded within galls encasing adult females has prohibited studies to isolate and discern their molecular composition. Here, we developed a protocol for the isolation and semipurification of root-knot nematode feeding tubes from giant-cell cytoplasm of several host plant species to provide a unique view of these structures at the light and scanning electron microscopy level revealing previously undescribed features of their structure. Our methods allowed for the isolation and solubilization of sufficient quantities of enriched feeding tubes enabling a comparative proteome analysis across host species that identified proteins with an increased likelihood to function in feeding tube formation. A comparison across root-knot nematode species further narrowed candidates to a conserved class of secretory proteins that specifically localized within secretory granules of the dorsal gland of adult females and in feeding tubes formed within host cell cytoplasm to unequivocally demonstrate these proteins as core components of feeding tubes. Our finding gives scientists a look into the protein composition of feeding tubes opening the door to a better understanding of their structure and function in nematode parasitism.",

          "abstract": "Proper crossover (CO) formation in meiosis serves dual roles in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and generating genetic diversity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CO number and distribution remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have implicated the ubiquitin–proteasome system in CO regulation, but specific regulators and mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ufd2p as a key regulator promoting efficient CO formation through a focused genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Deletion of UFD2 significantly reduces CO frequency by enhancing the strength of CO interference. Integrated multiomics analysis indicates that Ufd2p targets Topoisomerase II (Top2p) for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation during meiosis. Deletion of UFD2 results in Top2p accumulation, which resolves DNA negative supercoils excessively and enhances CO interference in the nucleus, ultimately reducing CO numbers. We further show that the mammalian homolog of Ufd2p, UBE4B, plays a conserved role in promoting efficient CO formation by regulating TOP2A-dependent DNA negative supercoils dynamics. Notably, expression of mouse or human UBE4B in yeast restores CO formation and meiotic progression in UFD2 deletion cells, demonstrating functional conservation across species. Together, our work identifies Ufd2p as a previously uncharacterized regulator of CO formation and provides important insights into the conserved molecular mechanism, which operates through Top2p-mediated supercoils homeostasis.",

The methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, of bacterial origin and conserved in plastid-bearing eukaryotes, including plants and apicomplexan parasites, produces isoprenoid precursors essential for growth and stress adaptation. Here, we identify methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) as a dual-function metabolite that serves both as a biosynthetic intermediate and a direct modulator of enzyme activity. Genetic perturbations and high light stress revealed step-specific MEcPP accumulation independent of transcriptional regulation. Biochemical and protease-protection assays showed that MEcPP destabilizes and inhibits methylerythritol cytidylyltransferase (MCT) while modestly stabilizing hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (HDS). Molecular docking analyses indicate that MEcPP interacts directly with the MCT catalytic site, displacing the natural substrate and thereby attenuating enzyme activity, suggesting a competitive, feedback-like mechanism of metabolic control. These results define MEcPP as a metabolic feedback signal that translates stress-induced changes into targeted enzymatic control. This mechanism illustrates how pathway intermediates dynamically coordinate biosynthetic activity with environmental cues, representing a broadly conserved strategy for metabolite-driven control of cellular metabolism.",

The postattachment membrane fusion process of MPXV is mediated by a multimeric protein machinery, termed as entry-fusion complex (EFC). Among EFC components, A30 and H2 are the earliest identified interaction pair and play important roles in virus entry. Here, we determine the crystal structure of MPXV A30/H2 subcomplex via the tandem-fusion strategy, and show that A30 undergoes large conformational rearrangements upon H2 binding. Structural analysis reveals extended intersubunit interface and highly conserved intermolecular interactions. In vitro binding data further clarify key residues and elements involved in the A30/H2 subcomplex formation. Finally, we show that the H2-A30 fusion protein, superior to A30 ectodomain alone or the ectodomain-mixture of H2+A30, can induce more potent neutralizing-antibody responses which could inhibit viral infection. These data provide valuable information for the understanding of poxvirus EFC assembly and the H2-A30-based immunogen design and optimization.",

          "abstract": "The control of particle trajectories in structured microfluidic environments has significantly advanced sorting technologies, most notably through deterministic lateral displacement (DLD). While previous works have largely targeted rigid, near-spherical particles, the sorting of flexible, anisotropic objects such as fibers remains largely unexplored. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to demonstrate how tilted pillar arrays enable efficient, length-based separation of flexible fibers. We find that these arrays act as band-pass filters, selectively inducing lateral migration in fibers whose lengths are close to the array period. Fibers significantly shorter or longer exhibit small lateral deviation. This migration arises from the interplay of fluid–structure interactions between fibers and the complex flow and steric interactions with the pillars. Depending on their length, fibers exhibit distinct transport regimes: short fibers zigzag in between pillars following the flow, intermediate length fibers exhibit wrapping and jumping from one pillar to another, leading to lateral displacement, and long fibers deform extensively, following mixed zigzag-jump trajectories with small lateral migration. We identify the mechanical tension that develops in the fiber when wrapped around the pillars as the driving mechanism of cross-streamline transport. Leveraging this band-pass effect, we designed a highly efficient separation device to collect monodisperse fiber suspensions. Our findings not only expand the functional scope of DLD-like systems but also open avenues for understanding transport of anisotropic objects in porous media.",

          "abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons provide precisely timed, context-dependent inhibition within cortical circuits. PV neuron firing properties are specialized among cortical neurons, suggesting that they express a unique complement of ion channels. Here, we show that the PV-specific silent voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit Kv6.4 (encoded by Kcng4 ) modulates both intrinsic and synaptic properties of cortical PV neurons. Kv6.4 does not form functional channels on its own but, as shown in prior work, assembles with Kv2 subunits to create heterotetrameric channel complexes, effectively reducing Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier current. We find that Kcng4 expression is enriched within a distinct Pvalb -expressing subclass in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex and emerges during postnatal development. In PV neurons, Kv6.4 loss reduces action potential (AP) height and width, hyperpolarizes the threshold and interspike potential, and accelerates AP upstroke particularly during repetitive firing. Kv6.4 loss, potentially due to the changes in AP waveform, also alters GABA release and paired-pulse depression at synapses made by PV onto pyramidal (PYR) neurons. The effects of Kv6.4 loss are amplified during high-frequency firing, within the physiological range of fast-spiking PV neurons, likely due to altered repolarization dynamics that accumulate across successive APs. These findings are thus consistent with the function of Kv6.4 in modifying Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier currents. Hence, Kv6.4 tunes the temporal precision of PV inhibitory output, a feature that may be critical for stable excitation–inhibition ratios and adaptive circuit function underlying learning and behavior.",

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a molecular platform for the direct conversion of solar energy to H 2 O 2 , however, they are persistently plagued by the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers, a phenomenon induced by σ-bond rotation under light irradiation, which typically leads to sluggish conversion kinetics and suboptimal efficiency. We herein present a molecular engineering strategy involving the construction of noncovalent trans rings (Nc-TRs) within COFs. This approach entails the precise introduction of noncovalent interactions between donor and acceptor moieties, thereby constraining the free rotation of σ bonds and substantially suppressing the recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the incorporation of Nc-TR within TAPT-DHBD COFs reduces the molecular dihedral angle from 37.33° to 0°, thereby optimizing molecular coplanarity and prolonging the photogenerated charge carrier lifetime by 820% compared to TAPT-TPD COFs devoid of Nc-TRs. Our findings further reveal that TAPT-DHBD COFs exhibit 5.0-fold and 3.6-fold enhancements in H 2 O 2 photocatalytic conversion kinetics and solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency, respectively, relative to TAPT-TPD COFs. We further demonstrate that H 2 O 2 solutions generated in the flow-type photocatalytic system under solar irradiation exhibit a record-high antibacterial efficacy of 10 7 cfu s −1 , and achieve a 100% wound healing rate within 7 d, markedly outperforming commercial physiological saline.",

Comparing the Sn and Lg seismic wave amplitude ratio ( Sn/Lg ) of an earthquake with that of nearby earthquakes distinguishes CMEs and, unlike previous methods, can be applied globally. We present a global distribution of CMEs that extends well beyond previous individual detections and areas of speculation. CME occurrence is widespread globally yet patterned regionally, reflecting local lithospheric structure and tectonic history. Our results highlight the value of CMEs for understanding continents and global tectonics.",

          "abstract": "Chemical protein synthesis enables the construction of specific protein architectures but is limited to millimolar reaction concentrations, restricting access to poorly soluble proteins. Potassium acyltrifluoroboronates (KATs) offer a promising alternative through fast and chemoselective amide bond formation, but their application to protein synthesis has been precluded by the lack of a masking strategy. We report chiral, zwitterionic organoboron complexes that mask amino acid–derived KATs. These molecules exhibit unexpected nitrogen-carbon-boron connectivity and are fully compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis and stereoretentive deprotection. We synthesized C-terminal KAT peptides and demonstrated KAT ligation at micromolar concentrations for the convergent synthesis of the aggregation-prone programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) immunoglobulin V domain. This work establishes organoboron chemistry as an enabling strategy for chemical protein synthesis at low concentrations far more suitable for handling large, aggregation-prone biomolecules.",

Using single-molecule tracking in living yeast, we quantified the kinetics of 58 proteins encompassing three RNAP machineries. RNAPI and RNAPIII pre-initiation complexes (PICs) engage in long-lived chromatin interactions, contrasting with transient RNAPII PIC. We further report kinetics of RNAPII-associated factors for elongation, histone modification, C-terminal domain (CTD) modification, RNA processing, and termination. Many elongation factors show brief rather than persistent association, suggesting dynamic interactions with factor exchange, allowing a potential repertoire of regulatory events. CTD truncation reduces U1 snRNP residence time and intron retention in ribosomal protein genes, providing insights into co-transcriptional splicing.

Toxicity is thought to result from the accumulation of either repeat RNAs and/or dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) translated from repeat-containing transcripts through repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. To disentangle RNA from DPR toxicity, we mutated a CUG codon predominantly used to initiate DPR translation from all three reading frames. This mutation disrupted DPR synthesis while preserving the expression of repeat-containing RNAs. Despite the accumulation of RNA foci, behavioral deficits and pathological abnormalities, including p-TDP-43 inclusions, STING activation, motor neuron loss, neuroinflammation, and increased plasma neurofilament concentration, were alleviated in C9ORF72 mice. Base editing of the CUG codon also improved molecular phenotypes and survival in patient induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neurons, which highlights the potential of therapeutically targeting DPR production rather than repeat RNAs.",

With trimethylchlorostannane, Si 5 R 5 − rearranges the Si 5 core to a tricyclic isomer confirming the pivotal role of the lithium cation for stability.

We further captured nuclei merging and oriented attachment processes in the early growth stage, which likely contributed to 2D single-crystal fabrication.

Finerenone stimulated follicle development in aged mice and restored antral follicle development in patients with POI following oral administration, resulting in mature oocytes and embryos. Mechanistically, finerenone reduced fibrotic deposition in the ovarian stroma, alleviating collagen-mediated suppression of follicular development. Building on this insight, we identified additional FDA-approved oral antifibrotic drugs as potential treatments for POI-related infertility.

These compounds contain nonplanar five-membered silicon rings with some pyramidalized silicon atoms and uneven silicon-silicon distances. The highly shielded 7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance signal of a lithium pentasilacyclopentadienide corroborates the presence of a diamagnetic ring current in the five-membered ring, which is indicative of at least some degree of aromaticity. Furthermore, a computational study revealed that bulky substituents and the delocalization of π-electrons stabilize the pentasilacyclopentadienide structure.",

Yet for all of that, things now are better than might have been expected a year ago. Just last month, congressional budget bills for science had their funding restored from the Trump administration’s original draconian cuts; legal challenges attempting to change indirect cost regulations were unsuccessful; and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation disbursed all the funds they had appropriated in 2025 to universities and research institutions before the money expired.

Kanzi, a lexigram-trained bonobo, correctly identified the location of pretend objects (e.g., “juice” poured between empty containers), in response to verbal prompts in scaffolded pretense interactions. Across three experiments, we conceptually replicated this finding and excluded key alternative explanations. Our findings suggest that the capacity to form secondary representations of pretend objects is within the cognitive potential of, at least, an enculturated ape and likely dates back 6 to 9 million years, to our common evolutionary ancestors.",

Transcriptional dysregulation is cell type specific, and not all loci with distal enhancers depend equally on cohesin extrusion. Using comparative genome editing, we demonstrated that enhancer-promoter communication over just 20 kb can require cohesin. However, promoter-proximal elements can support long-range, cohesin-independent enhancer action—even across strong CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) insulators.

          "abstract": "The racial landscape of US neighborhoods shifted tremendously over the past decade, raising questions about how these changes are reflected in local schools. This study combines school zone shapefiles with census and Civil Rights Database data to explore whether neighborhood racial change in Black populations predicts changes in Black-white school suspension disparities from 2010 to 2018. We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas. Our findings advance insights into processes of school and neighborhood change, school discipline, and racial stratification, with broad policy implications.",

          "abstract": "Human cooperation involves a set of interconnected behaviors that develop in conjunction with the cultural environment. Despite recent advances in Western, industrialized contexts, we know far less about how cooperative behaviors emerge across cultures, how normative environments shape their development, and how these behaviors relate to one another. Here, we examined the development of four cooperative behaviors—fairness, trustworthiness, forgiveness, and honesty—in children ( N  = 413) aged 5 to 13 from five societies: urban United States, rural Uganda, Canada, Peru, and the hunter-horticulturalist Shuar of Ecuador. We also collected normative judgments from peers ( N  = 163) and adults ( N  = 86) of each community. We find substantial variation in cooperative behaviors and norms across populations, but, more generally, that children’s behaviors and norms tend to converge toward community-specific norms in middle childhood. We also identify three cooperative strategies—maximization, generic cooperation, and partner-contingent cooperation—whose prevalence shifts with age and differs across societies. Together, these findings illuminate how cooperative behavior develops within and across cultures.",

          "abstract": "The idea that better cognitive functioning helps to close the gap between goals and behavior seems self-evident, yet empirical work has found unusually weak interindividual associations between cognitive task performance and real-world, goal-relevant outcomes. Here, we resolve this paradox by shifting from trait-level to state-level analysis. Leveraging a microtask design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students ( N  = 184, time points = 9248), we show that within-person upswings in domain-general cognitive processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal setting and achievement across both academic and nonacademic domains, even controlling for other factors. A one-standard-deviation change in cognitive precision had an effect statistically equivalent to ~40 min of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness. Our work addresses long-standing controversies and highlights the power of intraindividual analysis to reveal relationships missed by cross-sectional approaches.",

          "abstract": "Homogenizing the upper surface through posttreatment has made great progress in perovskite solar cells. In contrast to the exposed surface, there are no practical remedies if imperfections form randomly at the hidden buried interface after perovskite film generation. Here, we reveal a severe distribution of residual lead iodide, voids, and grain-surface concavities at the buried interface, which severely trap carriers in inactive regions. To address these challenges, we introduce a potassium dihydrogen phosphate competitive-binding interlayer that systematically reduces residual solvents at the buried interface through strong chemical interactions. Homogenized buried interface along with facilitated perovskite film quality and charge extraction have been achieved, enabling year-round improvements in photovoltaic performance and reproducibility. The resultant devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.3% (certified at 25.8%) for a 0.07–square centimeter device and 25.17% for a 1.028–square centimeter device. The device also demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 97% of its initial PCE after 1000 hours of continuous maximum power point tracking.",

          "abstract": "Cyclic peptides exhibit advantages in binding protein targets with high affinity and competency in inhibiting protein-protein interactions. Cyclic peptide phage display with more than a billion variants is an invaluable tool in drug discovery. However, achieving efficient peptide cyclization on phages remains a challenge because of the limited availability of reaction sites, which also restrict scaffold diversity. Here, we report an isothiocyanate-derived cross-linker featuring dual reactive groups: a bromide that covalently attaches to cysteine thiols and a thiocyanogen that selectively forms a thiourea bridge with either the N-terminal amino group or ε-amines of lysine, depending on pH. This strategy enables pH-modulated cyclization. At pH 6.5, head–to–side chain cyclization occurs, and at pH 9.5, side chain–to–side chain ligation is performed. Both processes simultaneously generate thiourea scaffolds. To demonstrate the versatility and biocompatibility of this approach, we constructed cyclic peptide libraries using both cyclization methods and successfully selected binders for several targets, including cyclophilin D, murine double minute 2, and Keap1, with dissociation constants ranging from micromolar to nanomolar. Given the broad pharmacological potential of the thiourea moiety, this phage display library opens previously unidentified chemical space with high scaffold diversity and the integration of a proven pharmacophore for the development of cyclic peptide therapeutics.",

The sparse material record of those myriad technologies limits our ability to formulate nuanced models about this critical period in human history. We present radiocarbon, Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry, and other taxonomic identification data from two of the largest Late Pleistocene perishable assemblages in the world, Cougar Mountain Cave and Paisley Caves, Oregon, US. These data include 66 radiocarbon dates on 55 items made from 15 different plant and animal taxa, including the oldest known physical remains of sewn hide. We provide data on eyed bone needles from four regional sites, showing that they are among the finest bone needles made in the Pleistocene.

          "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes thrombotic microangiopathy, yet the red blood cell (RBC)–centered mechanism has remained unclear. We identify the RTX-family hemolysin EhxA as the driver of RBC-mediated thrombogenesis. Deletion of ehxA abolishes Ca 2+ influx, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, progression from discocyte to echinocyte to spherocyte, thrombin generation, RBC-endothelium adhesion, and RBC aggregation. Genetic complementation restores these readouts to wild type, and purified EhxA in bacteria-free assays recapitulates them while localizing to intact RBC membranes. By contrast, Δ stx2 mutants do not elicit these RBC phenotypes, distinguishing this pathway from Shiga toxin–dependent effects. Multiple regression quantifies the link between PS exposure, morphology, and procoagulant outputs. In rats, infection with wild type increased RBC remodeling and venous thrombosis, whereas infection with Δ ehxA did not.

          "abstract": "Candida albicans –induced immunometabolic changes drive complex responses in immune cells. However, whether and how C. albicans causes remodeling of oral epithelial cell (OEC) metabolism is unclear. Here, we use in vitro experiments and patient biopsies to demonstrate that OECs undergo metabolic reprogramming when infected by C. albicans independently of candidalysin secretion, increasing glycolysis and decreasing tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Glycolysis and glucose transport inhibition show that these pathways support OEC cytokine release, highlighting the partial control of antifungal epithelial immunity by cellular metabolism. However, glucose supplementation disrupts OEC responses both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the fungus benefits from these metabolic shifts and that increased aerobic glycolysis in OECs is detrimental. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicted a shutdown of the TCA cycle and a previously unidentified role for glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1) in response to C. albicans , which was subsequently shown to be important for OEC survival during infection. This study reveals a fundamental role for hexose metabolism and identifies a GOT1-mediated TCA cycle shunt in regulating OEC survival and immune responses during mucosal fungal infections.",

The predominant hypothesis is that macroevolutionary dynamics and climatic niche conservatism explain today’s elevational patterns of biodiversity, but the alternative energy efficiency hypothesis emphasizes modern ecological interactions related to energy budgets. We test these competing hypotheses by examining seasonal elevational ranges for 10,998 bird populations in 34 mountain regions. Multiple lines of evidence support the energy efficiency hypothesis, including that many mountain birds do not seasonally track their thermal niche with high fidelity while simulation models based on optimal energy balancing under current environmental conditions yield predictions that tightly match empirical data. Our results reveal that altitudinal migration, which is widespread yet considerably understudied, is a behavioral mechanism fulfilling the same ecological function as long-distance latitudinal migration. Overall, this work provides a better understanding and predictive capacity for mountain birds under global change.",

Vaccination of older adults with the adjuvanted vaccine did not restore CD8 + defects but selectively enhanced T helper 17 (T H 17) CD4 + T cells and prevented their conversion into regulatory T cells, likely through lipid metabolic regulation.

To resolve the incompatibilities between these two features, we propose a differential stochastic mapping method by applying information theory principles. We demonstrate CLAP on a 130-nanometer memristor chip, validating its versatility across diverse information processing tasks. In an electrocardiogram data collection task, CLAP achieves device authentication with an area under the curve of 99.46% and efficient signal compression with a software-level percentage root mean square difference.

The cell biological basis underlying hybrid incompatibility remains largely unknown, especially in mammals. Here, we found that female hybrids between Mus musculus domesticus and Mus spicilegus mice are sterile due to the failure of homologous-chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis, producing aneuploid eggs. This nondisjunction phenotype was driven by the mislocalization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin overprotection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mistargeting. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus, Peromyscus , wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in mammalian speciation.",

The ~250-micrometer flexible guidewire incorporates a 460-nanometer luminescent core with an enhanced optoacoustic signature and a FePt magnetic tip for precise, steerable control. Proof-of-concept studies show that OptoMaG can be actively navigated with external magnetic fields to traverse a 3D human-scale cerebrovascular phantom and accurately reach target brain sites. Beyond navigation, the FePt tip enables localized thermal ablation under remote radiofrequency stimulation, highlighting its theranostic potential for tumor treatment. In addition, OptoMaG functions as a light source for photodynamic therapy, selectively activating photosensitizers to destroy tumor cells while preserving healthy tissue.

Fast-sinking marine snow particles, such as diatom aggregates, encounter a rapid increase in hydrostatic pressure during their descent. Using incubations in rotating pressure tanks, we found that pressure levels corresponding to 2- to 6-kilometer water depth induce leakage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from diatom aggregates equivalent to ~50% of their initial carbon contents. The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind. Pressure-induced DOM leakage likely weakens the gravitational “biological carbon pump” and supplies labile DOM to the pelagic microbiome of the deep ocean.",

We examine how volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides, and nitrous acid influence hydroxyl radical, ozone, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) based on three aircraft campaigns over the United States. Our analyses reveal variable, highly elevated hydroxyl radical concentrations in the first 2 hours, resulting in evident fire-to-fire variability in VOCs oxidation and in ozone and PAN production. About 40 to 70% of the variability is explained by chemical aging. Ozone production in the plumes is usually VOC-limited for the first 2 hours and then nitrogen oxide limited downwind. Box model results for hydroxyl radical, ozone, and most VOCs, using the full, explicit Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) mechanism, suggest no major gaps in the current best knowledge of gas-phase chemistry. However, the MCM sometimes overestimates PAN due to underestimated nitrogen oxide sinks. GEOS-Chem, a widely used chemical transport model with a reduced mechanism, generally underperforms because of incomplete VOC representation.

Tail amputation, however, induced expansion of MuSC potential yielding clonal contribution to muscle, connective tissue including cartilage, pericytes, and fibroblasts. This expanded potential was not observed during limb regeneration, and cross-transplantation showed that these differences in potential are likely intrinsically determined. Single-cell RNA sequencing profiling revealed that tail MuSCs revert to an embryonic mesoderm–like state. Through genetic manipulation involving the overexpression of constitutively active transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) receptors or Smad7 (antagonist of TGF-β signaling) in MuSCs, we demonstrated that the levels of TGF-β signal determine the fate outcome of MuSCs to connective tissue lineage or muscle, respectively.

To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying SCRE2 virulence function, we identify that SCRE2 interacts with Oryza sativa S-like ribonuclease family member OsRNS4. As a catalytically inactive RNase, OsRNS4 positively regulates rice immunity, depending on its RNA binding ability. OsRNS4 is unconventionally secreted through tetraspanin-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs). OsRNS4 binds to certain groups of rice miRNAs, whereas SCRE2 prevents the binding of OsRNS4 to miRNAs. Especially, OsRNS4-bound miR528-5p in rice is detected in false smut balls and silences the gene UvSfk1 essential for U. virens virulence. Thus, OsRNS4 might act as a carrier to transport miRNAs from rice into fungi, which target the virulence genes in U. virens and thereby contributes to rice resistance against fungal pathogens. As an unidentified counter-defense mechanism, SCRE2 suppresses cross-kingdom RNA interference to promote infection through inhibiting OsRNS4 binding to miRNAs.",

Here, we find that degradation-tagged protein reporters could exhibit transient oscillatory expression, which standard single-scale models do not capture. We resolve this discrepancy by developing Gene Expression Across Growth Stages (GEAGS), a dual-scale modeling framework that explicitly couples intracellular gene expression to logistic population growth. Using a chemical reaction network model with growth phase–dependent rate-modifying functions, GEAGS accurately reproduces the observed transient oscillations and identifies amino acid recycling and growth-phase transition as key drivers. We reduce the model to an effective form for practical use and demonstrate its adaptability by applying it to layered feedback circuits, resolving long-standing mismatches between model predictions and measured dynamics. These results establish GEAGS as a generalizable platform for predicting emergent behaviors in synthetic gene circuits and underscore the importance of multiscale modeling for robust circuit design in dynamic environments.",

TAK-779, a CXCR3/CCR5/CCR2 antagonist, enhanced GII.3 HuNoV replication and viral spread in a dose- and time-dependent manner, enabling successful passaging of GII.3 HuNoV in two different HIE lines and generation of viral stocks. Sequencing passaged virus revealed one consensus change in the major capsid protein and several dynamic adaptations, suggesting emergence of variants. TAK-779 also enhanced replication of GI.1 and GII.17 strains, but not GII.4, suggesting strain-specific host interactions. This breakthrough in passaging provides insight into HuNoV-host interactions, establishes a scalable in vitro system for virus propagation, and opens avenues for structural, biochemical, and therapeutic studies.",

          "abstract": "Archaic introgression introduced functionally relevant variants into modern humans, yet small-scale insertions remain understudied. Here, we leverage 2519 modern human genomes and four high-coverage archaic hominin genomes to systematically characterize nuclear mitochondrial DNA segments (NUMTs). We uncover 483 polymorphic NUMTs across globally diverse human populations and 10 in archaic genomes. By combining overlap with Neanderthal-derived and Denisovan-derived haplotypes, phylogenetic analyses, insertion time estimates, and haplotype colocalization, we identify five NUMTs introduced into modern humans via archaic hominin introgression. Functional analyses reveal that introgressed NUMTs can modulate gene expression, including allele-specific up-regulation of the immune-related gene RASGRP3 , and reshape three-dimensional chromatin structure at loci such as SCD5 and HNRNPD . These findings highlight an underappreciated mechanism by which archaic mitochondrial fragments shape nuclear genome function and evolution. Our study reframes NUMTs not as passive genomic fossils but as dynamic elements influencing modern human diversity and adaptation.",

However, realizing criticality enhanced quantum metrology is experimentally challenging, mainly owing to decoherence and critical slowing down associated with the corresponding quantum state preparation. We circumvent these problems by making use of the critical behaviors in the Jaynes-Cummings model, to which the signal field is coupled. The information is encoded in the qubit’s excitation number, which displays a divergent changing rate at the critical point, and is extremely robust against decoherence and nonadiabatic effects. We demonstrate such a metrological protocol in a superconducting circuit, where an Xmon qubit, interacting with a resonator, is used as a probe for estimating the amplitude of a microwave field. The measured quantum Fisher information exhibits a critical quantum enhancement, confirming the potential for quantum metrology.",

While basally dividing progenitors are implicated in neocortical growth, their developmental origins and relevance beyond the cortex remain unclear. We show here that double inactivation of spindle orientation regulators GPSM2 and SAPCD2 in mice completely reorients progenitor divisions in both the neocortex and retina. This shift increases basal progenitors over sixfold in the neocortex and induces their ectopic emergence in the retina, resulting in extra cell layers and ~30% tissue enlargement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the induced basal progenitors in the cortex resemble human outer radial glia, and both cortical and retinal progenitors show altered Hippo signaling. Last, macaque and human retinas display twice as many reoriented divisions as the mouse and naturally contain basal progenitors.

This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (&gt;5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers.

We find that 19% of peptides act as strong degrons, 30% as intermediate, and 51% as non-degrons. We identify both known and previously unidentified degradation signals and show that most depend on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome. Structural mapping shows that many degrons are buried and likely become active upon protein unfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to describe the degron properties and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions.",

          "abstract": "Aquatic animals such as octopuses use soft suction cups to solve the persistent challenge of wet attachment on rough surfaces. Detachment has long been described as smooth drainage governed by a Reynolds-type pressure gradient. Combining spatiotemporal pressure mapping with confocal imaging of the fluid layer between a suction cup-substrate interface, we reveal a two-stage, nonequilibrium pathway for pressure equalization that challenges this conventional view. Suction-induced elastic deformation dynamically remodels the interfacial fluid, producing a self-coupled pressure channel system. Stage I is governed by an outward-moving invasion-percolation suction front with diffusion-like scaling. When internal suction falls below a critical value, the network opens globally, and stage II follows classical Poiseuille drainage. This mechanism defines a self-modifying percolation in which the flow remodels its own pathways, which advances our understanding of biological suction and viscous adhesion and suggests design principles for long-lived wet adhesives and hydrogel microfluidics.",

We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t 5 / 2 . This result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a nonzero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on nonzero initial velocities.

Here, we report a scalable strategy to fabricate continuous-wave, electrically pumped WGM blue microlasers based on III-nitride semiconductors with low threshold current densities and high slope efficiencies across diverse diameters from 10 to 160 micrometers. This high performance was achieved through effective vertical optical confinement by the waveguide structures and minimal sidewall scattering from atomically smooth surfaces. We further converted the laser cavity from a microdisk to a microring, which suppresses high-order WGMs and allows for single-mode operation with a high Q factor of 17,066. The omnidirectional in-plane radiation of WGM microlasers demonstrates angle-independent, high-modulation bandwidths, enabling synchronous broadcasting communication with high data transmission rates.",

We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia.

Herein, we disclose that nanocollisions caused by endogenous bioparticles, such as extracellular vesicles, can induce localized membrane deformations. This spatially confined mechanical input activates Piezo1 at collision sites and promotes myosin IIA phosphorylation–mediated F-actin stabilization, enhancing DC intrinsic motility. Subsequent diffusion of Ca 2+ up-regulates chemotaxis machinery, improving their capacity of tumor microenvironment patrolling and lymph node homing for antitumor immunity. This finding reveals a previously unidentified mechanoimmunological mechanism of immune surveillance. To accelerate the translation of this mechanism into clinical therapeutics, we developed an ultrasound-responsive nanocollision generator using gas-liquid-solid triphase conversion.

Mesothelial cells were identified as notable components of ascites through morphological assessment, immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Almost all EOC cells were spheroids, with 60% containing mesothelial cells. EOC cells quickly generate aggregated spheroids with mesothelial cells, and these aggregated cancer-mesothelial spheroids (ACMSs) invade collagen or mesothelial layers. Mesothelial cells forming ACMSs initiated the invasion. RNA sequencing analysis revealed marked RNA expression changes in mesothelial cells, whereas the changes in EOC cells were minor. Transforming growth factor–β1–stimulated mesothelial cells showed increased invadopodium formation along with fascin-1 up-regulation.

Functionally, SiH nanosheet plays multiple roles in the nanothrombolytics: blocking the functional sites of urokinase to durably inhibit its activity in circulation to prevent systemic bleeding, followed by urokinase reactivation in response to SiH nanosheet self-degradation and prothrombotic microenvironment regulation through the in situ hydrogen generation, which mitigates the oxidative stress of vascular endothelial cells and inhibits their release of procoagulant factors.

In particular, we found that bovine S. aureus has evolved the capacity for protease-mediated degradation of casein, a protein abundant in bovine milk, to access nutrients for proliferation. This phenotype has evolved convergently in different S. aureus lineages via mutations in distinct gene loci driving overexpression of the protease aureolysin.

          "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in small vessel walls, often coexisting with Alzheimer’s disease due to impaired Aβ clearance. However, the spatial distribution of Aβ within the human brain remains unclear as the vascular network’s complexity and scale hinder visualization by conventional thin-slice analysis. To address this, we performed three-dimensional (3D) volumetric imaging of the cerebrovascular network and Aβ deposition in autopsied brains with CAA using advanced tissue clearing and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, labeling for smooth muscle actin (SMA) and Aβ. We found prominent Aβ deposition and SMA loss in leptomeningeal and superficial cortical segments, which were anatomically contiguous with deeper Aβ-positive segments, indicating a surface-to-deep progression pattern of Aβ extension. The perivascular plaque density was significantly lower around Aβ-positive vessels. This technology may provide further insights into CAA pathology and is recommended for research on the 3D pathology of neurological disorders.",

          "abstract": "The relationships between chronic exposure to wildfire smoke PM 2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm) and mortality remain poorly understood, with causal evidence being particularly scarce. In this ecological study, we used a doubly robust method, incorporating flexible generalized propensity score estimation that captured potential nonlinearity and interactions among confounders and relaxed the distribution form assumption for exposure, to estimate the effects of annual exposure to wildfire smoke PM 2.5 on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the contiguous United States from 2006 to 2020. We found that wildfire smoke PM 2.5 was associated with increased mortality rate for all studied outcomes, except for deaths from transport accidents or falls, which served as negative outcome controls. Wildfire smoke PM 2.5 was responsible for ~24,100 all-cause deaths per year in the contiguous United States. The exposure-response curve for all-cause mortality increased monotonically, with no evidence of a “safe” threshold. Among the six cause-specific outcomes, mortality from neurological disease showed the greatest increase per 0.1 μg/m 3 increase in smoke PM 2.5 exposure. Our study provided robust evidence for the chronic effect of wildfire smoke PM 2.5 on mortality, underscoring the urgent need for targeted measures to mitigate the substantial and escalating burden of wildfires.",

          "abstract": "Organ injury triggers nonneuronal electric currents essential for regeneration. However, the mechanisms by which electrical signals are generated, sensed, and transmitted upon damage to promote organ growth remain unclear. Here, we uncover that organ repair relies on dynamic electrochemical coupling between membrane potential depolarization and intracellular signaling, essential to activate cell proliferation. By subsecond live imaging of locally injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across time and space: a millisecond, long-range, membrane depolarization gradient, followed by second-persistent intracellular calcium responses. In the subsequent hour, voltage sensing phosphatase senses the injury-driven membrane potential change and autonomously translates the electric signal intracellularly, promoting tissue-wide cell proliferation. Connecting these dynamics with an electrodiffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin’s interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading. Our work reveals the coupling between fast electrical signals and slower intracellular signaling, ensuring complete organ recovery.",

          "abstract": "Internationally, it has been agreed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, a commitment partly underpinned by model-based scenario analyses showing that bending the trend is possible. These scenarios provide insights into alternative future biodiversity trends and their drivers. Our meta-analysis differentiates scenarios that project biodiversity loss and that halt or reverse the trend based on their quantitative outcomes and explores their key characteristics such as scenario assumptions, drivers of loss, biodiversity indicators and models used. We found that bending-the-curve studies are scarce, and mostly do no account for climate change, which risks suggesting that the trend can be bent too easily. Our findings indicate that bending is only achievable with integrated efforts across different sectors, such as nature conservation, sustainable food production, diet change, and reduced food waste. To better support policymaking, scenarios should be based on model intercomparisons and use standardize indicators to allow comparisons across studies, account for additional drivers of loss to represent the real threats to biodiversity, and include more ambitious cross-sectoral actions to effectively bend the curve.",

          "abstract": "Subsurface karst systems represent substantial but underexplored methane sinks, yet the identities and activities of cave-dwelling methanotrophs remain poorly characterized. We detected increased methane oxidation rates from 2.9 ± 0.1 to 90.7 ± 4.5 ng·g −1 ·hour −1 while supplied with 2 to 500 parts per million (ppm) CH 4 to cave sediments. Atmospheric methanotroph Upland Soil Clusters γ (USCγ), responsible for this oxidation, was further assigned to three genera within the family Candidatus ( Ca .) Methyloligotrophaceae, including two previously unrecognized genera. Nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) imaging and the produced 13 C-PLFAs (phospholipid fatty acids) and 13 CO 2 in 13 CH 4 -fed microcosm confirmed methane as both carbon and energy sources. These methanotrophs exhibited low half-saturation constant ( K m ; 138.8 ± 15.8 ppm), high carbon assimilation efficiency (&gt;50%), and metabolic versatility, as revealed by metagenomics and metatranscriptomics analyses. By extrapolating global distribution of Ca. Methyloligotrophaceae and comparing methane oxidation rates between caves and soil ecosystems, we conservatively estimate that subsurface karst in southwest China sequester ~0.56 Tg CH 4 annually. These findings highlight the ecological importance of karst ecosystems as a previously overlooked methane sink.",

A GLP1R natural missense variant, A316T, protects against T2D and cardiovascular disease. Here, we generated and characterized a human GLP1R A316T mouse model. Human GLP1R A316T/A316T mice displayed lower fasting blood glucose versus wild-type littermates even under metabolic stress, as well as slower weight gain and alterations in islet cytoarchitecture, glucagon secretion, and liver metabolism under a high-fat, high-sucrose diet. This was however associated with blunted responses to pharmacological GLP-1RAs in vivo. Further investigations in β cell models demonstrated that human GLP1R A316T exhibits characteristics of constitutive activation but dampened GLP-1RA responses. Results are further supported by cryo-EM analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of GLP-1R A316T structure, collectively demonstrating that the A316T variant governs basal GLP-1R activity and pharmacological responses to GLP-1R–targeting therapies.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety and insomnia are highly comorbid; however, the underlying brain-circuit mechanisms remain inadequately explored. Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets.",

However, understanding the ultrafast spin-electron-lattice coupled dynamics remains challenging, especially when the system is driven far from equilibrium. Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast light-induced spin-flip within 300 fs in Fe 3 GeTe 2 , a prototypical two-dimensional itinerant ferromagnet. Notably, by varying the laser fluence, we identify three distinct regimes that emerge assisted by a photoinduced single linear phonon mode, namely demagnetization, spin-flip, and spin-melting. We resolve the dominant role of displacively excited A 1g phonons, while nonequilibrium electron occupation is essential to break the degeneracy of the spin up and down states and lower the spin-flip energy barrier. Accompanying the spin-flip, we also observe a sign change of the Berry curvature, implying involvement of nontrivial band topology. Our results provide a general guidance for optical manipulation of spin orders, holding promises for advancing future spintronics and information technology.",

On 25 June 2024, Chang’e-6 successfully returned 1.935-kilogram samples from the lunar farside. The samples included local basalts with an age of 2807 ± 3 million years and the norites with an age of 4247 ± 5 million years likely corresponding to the age of the South Pole–Aitken basin. With these radiometric ages, we refined the lunar chronology function (CF) and verified that it is still consistent with a combination of an exponential decrease and a linear rate. We further derived the impacting rate and found it supports a smooth decay instead of abrupt changes of the impactor flux at early times. The refined lunar CF can be used to obtain more reliable ages for unsampled lunar areas and provide critical constraint for the lunar early impact history.",

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of abundant extracellular vesicles (EVs) in planarians. Using imaging and molecular analysis, we show conservation of biogenesis, morphology, and protein composition of planarian EVs. Environmental stressors significantly elevate EV release, indicating that planarians dynamically regulate vesicle production. Functionally, planarian EVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring regulatory signals: We find that they shuttle small RNAs that effect systemic RNA interference (RNAi) throughout the organism. Notably, gene knockdown experiments reveal a crucial role for AGO-3, a member of the Argonaute family of proteins, in modulating the association of small interfering RNAs with EVs, linking the intracellular RNAi machinery to EV-based signaling. These findings highlight EVs as pivotal mediators of cell-cell communication in planarians, with broad implications for understanding the coordination of gene regulation and tissue regeneration in animals.",
