          "title": "Helicase-mediated mechanism of SSU processome maturation and disassembly",
          "authors": "Olga Buzovetsky, Sebastian Klinge",
          "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomal small subunit (SSU) assembly requires the SSU processome, a nucleolar precursor containing the RNA chaperone U3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). The underlying molecular mechanisms of SSU processome maturation, remodelling, disassembly and RNA quality control, and the transitions between states remain unknown owing to a paucity of intermediates1,2,3. Here we report 16 native SSU processome structures alongside genetic data, revealing how two helicases, the Mtr4-exosome and Dhr1, are controlled for accurate and unidirectional ribosome biogenesis. Our data show how irreversible pre-ribosomal RNA degradation by the redundantly tethered RNA exosome couples the transformation of the SSU processome into a pre-40S particle, during which Utp14 can probe evolving surfaces, ultimately positioning and activating Dhr1 to unwind the U3 snoRNA and initiate nucleolar pre-40S release. This study highlights a paradigm for large dynamic RNA–protein complexes in which irreversible RNA degradation drives compositional changes and communicates these changes to govern enzyme activity while maintaining overall quality control.",

          "abstract": "Infection by yellow fever virus (YFV), the prototype Orthoflavivirus, induces a febrile syndrome in humans that can progress to liver failure, haemorrhage and death1. Despite decades of study, the entry receptors for YFV remain unclear. Here, using a surface protein-targeted CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identified LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family member, as a candidate entry receptor for YFV. Genetic ablation of LRP4 impaired YFV infection of cells and, reciprocally, complementation or ectopic expression of LRP4 increased infection. Related viruses in the YFV antigenic complex also showed LRP4-dependent infection. LRP4 promoted YFV entry into cells through LDLR type A (LA) domain binding to domain III of the YFV envelope protein. Soluble LRP4–Fc decoy receptors neutralized YFV infection in cell culture and reduced viral burden in vivo. As we observed residual YFV infection in LRP4-deficient cells, we evaluated whether other LDLR family members promote YFV entry. This approach identified LRP1 and VLDLR as additional receptors for YFV infection in cell culture. LRP1–Fc, LRP4–Fc and VLDLR–Fc decoys protected mice from YFV challenge, and LRP1–Fc decoys inhibited YFV infection and liver pathogenesis in mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. A genetic deficiency of LRP1 in primary human hepatocyte cultures also resulted in reduced YFV infection. Our findings establish a role for multiple LDLR family members in YFV entry, infection and pathogenesis, which has implications for receptor use and countermeasure development for multiple emerging orthoflaviviruses.",

          "abstract": "Potato late blight, which is caused by Phytophthora infestans and was responsible for the Irish potato famine, remains a major threat to global food security1. Most late-blight resistance (R) genes encode nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs), but many have been overcome by the rapid evolution of P. infestans2. Deploying R genes through hybrid potato breeding3,4,5,6,7 offers a promising solution to manage late blight. Here we construct a section-wide NLRome comprising 39,211 NLR genes from 31 wild and 21 cultivated potato genomes, representing Solanum section Petota, the tuber-bearing clade. This includes newly sequenced genomes of seven wild species with strong resistance to late blight. Phylogenomic analyses reveal asymmetric patterns of evolution that distinguish sensor and helper NLRs. Mining of the NLRome enabled us to clone Rpi-cph1, a homologue of which has previously been identified only in American black nightshade, and Rpi-cjm1, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing NLR against late blight. We show that non-canonical NLR integrated domains are widespread in the NLRome. Tracing their evolutionary trajectory enabled us to identify Rpi-brk1, an R gene that perceives a P. infestans effector through its heavy-metal-associated (HMA) domain. We find that incorporating the HMA domain into the potato NLR R1 broadens its resistance spectrum, suggesting that a domain ‘plug-in’ strategy could be used to engineer disease resistance. These findings provide a paradigm for R-gene discovery through comparative and evolutionary genomics, and a strategy for R-gene engineering.",

          "abstract": "The generation and maintenance of immunity is a dynamic process that is dependent on age1,2,3. Here, to better understand its progression, we profiled peripheral immunity in more than 300 healthy adults (25 to 90 years of age) using single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics and flow cytometry, following 96 adults longitudinally across 2 years with seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting resource generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of more than 16 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells with 71 immune cell subsets from our Human Immune Health Atlas and enabled us to interrogate how immune cell composition and states shift with age, chronic viral infection and vaccination. From these data, we demonstrate robust, non-linear transcriptional reprogramming in T cell subsets with age that is not driven by systemic inflammation or chronic cytomegalovirus infection. This age-related reprogramming led to a functional T helper 2 (TH2) cell bias in memory T cells that is linked to dysregulated B cell responses against highly boosted antigens in influenza vaccines. Collectively, this study reveals unique features of the immune ageing process that occur prior to advanced age and provides novel targets for age-related immune modulation.

          "abstract": "Solid-state lithium metal batteries are facing huge challenges under practical working conditions1,2. Even when the ionic conductivity of composite solid-state electrolytes is increased to 1 mS cm−1, it is still difficult to realize long-life cycling of solid-state batteries above a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 1 mAh cm−2 (ref. 3). The fundamental cause is the brittle nature of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) with sluggish lithium-ion transport and the resulting lithium dendrites and severe side reactions. Here we report a ductile inorganic-rich SEI that retains its structural integrity while allowing easy ion diffusion at high current densities and areal capacities. The ductility of the SEI is ascribed to the Ag2S and AgF components, which are formed by a substitution reaction between Li2S/LiF in the SEI and AgNO3 in the dielectric composite electrolytes. Even at a high current density of 15 mA cm−2 and an areal capacity of 15 mAh cm−2, a symmetrical lithium cell with such an SEI has a long cycle life of over 4,500 hours. Furthermore, the ductile SEI also works over 7,000 hours at −30 °C, even under practical conditions of 5 mA cm−2 and 5 mAh cm−2.",

          "abstract": "A key challenge for ecological science is to understand how biodiversity loss is changing ecosystem structure and function at scales that are relevant for policy 1 . Almost all biodiversity metrics are challenging to disaggregate into animal-mediated ecosystem functions such as pollination, seed and nutrient dispersal, and predation. Here we adopt an ecosystem energetics approach 2 as a physically meaningful method of translating animal species composition into a suite of ecosystem functions. Drawing on new datasets that estimate biodiversity intactness and species population densities 3–5 , we quantify historical changes to energy flows through mammal- and bird-mediated ecosystem functions across sub-Saharan Africa. In total, trophic energy flows have decreased by more than one-third. The pattern of decreasing function varies by historical biome, driven by arboreal birds and primates in forests, terrestrial herbivores in grassy systems, and burrowing mammals in arid systems. Functions performed by megafauna in particular have collapsed outside protected areas. Compared with other biodiversity metrics, an energetics approach highlights the ecological importance of smaller animals and keystone species. The results can help practitioners conserve and restore functionally diverse, energetically intact ecosystems across land uses and biomes. By relating biodiversity intactness to energy and material flows, ecosystem energetics can also advance efforts to integrate animal-driven functions into biosphere and earth system models, helping us to understand possible regional or planetary boundaries 6 for biodiversity.",

          "abstract": "The neural basis of movement preparation has been extensively studied during self-initiated actions, in which motor cortical activity during preparation shows a lawful relationship to the parameters of the subsequent action1,2. However, movements are regularly triggered or corrected on the basis of sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body. Since such disturbances are often predictable, and since preparing for disturbances would make movements more prescise, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans or monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of future mechanical perturbations, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, and scales directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Using neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges only when sensory inputs signal that a perturbation has occurred, before resolving the direction of the perturbation. Thus, just as preparatory activity sets the stage for self-initiated movement, it also configures motor circuits to respond efficiently to sensory inputs.",

          "abstract": "At more than 200 years, the maximum lifespan of the bowhead whale exceeds that of all other mammals. The bowhead is also the second-largest animal on Earth1, reaching over 80,000 kg. Despite its very large number of cells and long lifespan, the bowhead is not highly cancer-prone, an incongruity termed Peto’s paradox2. Here, to understand the mechanisms that underlie the cancer resistance of the bowhead whale, we examined the number of oncogenic hits required for malignant transformation of whale primary fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, bowhead whale fibroblasts required fewer oncogenic hits to undergo malignant transformation than human fibroblasts. However, bowhead whale cells exhibited enhanced DNA double-strand break repair capacity and fidelity, and lower mutation rates than cells of other mammals. We found the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein CIRBP to be highly expressed in bowhead fibroblasts and tissues. Bowhead whale CIRBP enhanced both non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination repair in human cells, reduced micronuclei formation, promoted DNA end protection, and stimulated end joining in vitro. CIRBP overexpression in Drosophila extended lifespan and improved resistance to irradiation. These findings provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that, rather than relying on additional tumour suppressor genes to prevent oncogenesis3,4,5, the bowhead whale maintains genome integrity through enhanced DNA repair. This strategy, which does not eliminate damaged cells but faithfully repairs them, may be contributing to the exceptional longevity and low cancer incidence in the bowhead whale.",

However, conductivity and mobility are rank-two tensor properties that are expected to follow the crystal symmetry and, therefore, according to symmetry, no anisotropy is allowed in a cubic material.

          "abstract": "The electronic passivation of small-form-factor devices requires a fundamental change in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, transitioning from bulky metal cans to conformal thin films1,2,3,4. However, reducing the thickness induces poor shielding performance associated with the skin depth of shielding materials5,6. To overcome the performance limitations of thin-film shields, absorption during multiple internal reflections should be driven7. For absorption during multiple internal reflections, pores have been intentionally introduced into shielding materials such as metals8,9,10,11,12 and two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbides/nitrides (MXenes)13,14,15,16,17,18,19. However, these approaches involve insufficient thinness, non-uniformity and/or processing incompatibility. Here we propose embedding non-porous MXene film into metal thin films to achieve unprecedented shielding performance at a thickness of just 1 μm (about 70 decibels; about 80 decibels at 1.9-μm thickness) without the limitations associated with porous structures. This exceptional performance in simple-stacked metal/MXene/metal structures, which deviates from the typical thickness dependency, arises from the formation of electromagnetic wave confinement walls at the interfaces, driven by the conductivity mismatch between the metal and MXene. The confined electromagnetic waves within the MXene ‘well’ are effectively attenuated through polarization loss, primarily driven by dipoles at the metal–MXene interfaces. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields provide conformal EMI protection for portable USB (Universal Serial Bus) 3.0 flash drives and flexible Schottky diodes. Our embedded-MXene-in-metal shields may open new avenues in packaging technologies, enabling EMI-free ubiquitous electronics.",

Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09380-6 (2025).\n\nThe critiqued study1 by two of the authors of this Reply uses the carbon harvest model (CHARM) to estimate carbon emissions from wood harvest as the carbon added to the atmosphere—fully accounting for silvicultural gains—relative to the carbon that forests would store if left alone. This comparison to no-human-activity is the standard approach for calculating emissions from burning oil, driving cars and other human actions, and is the same forestry-accounting approach used in land-use change models2,3 long relied on by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change4,5, the Global Carbon Project6 and many other papers7,8. In the accompanying Comment, Sohngen et al.9 reject this approach, arguing mainly that emissions of one activity should be compared with those in an economic counterfactual, which means the emissions produced by the economically estimated, most-likely alternative activities. Citing their previously published global timber model (GTM), they claim that new wood harvests “can reduce” atmospheric carbon, which means they are carbon negative6,9. However, although economic models, when credible, can usefully project shifts in behaviour, they do not determine the emissions of these behaviours; by confusing emissions of one activity with emissions avoided by another, the approach by Sohngen et al.9 makes physical emissions disappear. We elaborate below and also explain how the GTM’s findings that economic forces offset new wood-use emissions by creating more forests stem from large misinterpretations of underlying studies (even by a factor of 75) and from modelling structures that largely assume their conclusions.",

Here we revisit the concept of ice-shelf viability in a holistic manner, taking into account mass loss due to both the atmosphere and the ocean to estimate when it becomes almost impossible for the ice shelves to maintain their present-day shape. We show that for a scenario in which global warming remains largely below 2 °C, only 1 out of 64 ice shelves will become likely non-viable by 2300. For a scenario in which global warming reaches nearly 12 °C by 2300, many ice shelves become non-viable once global warming exceeds 4.5 °C, loss that is mainly due to an increase in ocean-induced melt. By 2150 and 2300, 26 and 38 ice shelves, respectively, become likely non-viable. Loss of ice-sheet regions restrained by these 38 ice shelves represent a sea-level rise potential of 10 m. Our estimates are latest bounds for reaching non-viability, and ice-shelf collapse could occur even earlier, in particular owing to the synergy with hydrofracturing.",

Here we introduce a design paradigm for artificial muscles, utilizing more than 10,000 microbubbles with targeted ultrasound activation. These microbubbles are engineered with precise dimensions that correspond to distinct resonance frequencies. When stimulated by a sweeping-frequency ultrasound, microbubble arrays in the artificial muscle undergo selective oscillations and generate distributed point thrusts, enabling the muscle to achieve programmable deformation with remarkable attributes: a high compactness of approximately 3,000 microbubbles per mm 2 , a low weight of 0.047 mg mm −2 , a substantial force intensity of approximately 7.6 μN mm −2 and fast response (sub-100 ms during gripping). Moreover, they offer good scalability (from micrometre to centimetre scale), exceptional compliance and many degrees of freedom. We support our approach with a theoretical model and demonstrate applications spanning flexible organism manipulation, conformable robotic skins for adding mobility to static objects and conformally attaching to ex vivo porcine organs, and biomimetic stingraybots for propulsion within ex vivo biological environments.

Exploiting this transcriptional regenerative ‘signature’, here we used in silico screens to identify small molecules that generate similar shifts in the transcriptome, and identified thiorphan—a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor—as a lead candidate. In a new adult motor cortex neuronal in vitro screen 2 , thiorphan increased neurite outgrowth 1.8-fold ( P &lt; 0.001). We then infused thiorphan into the central nervous system beginning 2 weeks after severe C5 spinal cord contusions and, when combined with a neural stem cell graft, thiorphan elicited significant improvements in forelimb function ( P &lt; 0.005) and corticospinal regeneration ( P &lt; 0.05). Extending clinical relevance, thiorphan significantly increased neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neuronal cultures from a 56-year-old human.

Although CAs have been linked to mitotic errors resulting in the emergence of nuclear atypia 4–7 , the underlying processes and rates of spontaneous CA formation in human cells are underexplored. Here we introduce machine-learning-assisted genomics and imaging convergence (MAGIC)—an autonomously operated platform that integrates live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning on-the-fly and single-cell genomics to systematically investigate CA formation. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track de novo CAs over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as initiating events. We determine the baseline CA mutation rate, which approximately doubles in TP53 -deficient cells, and observe that chromosome losses arise more frequently than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosome arms triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, coordinated segregation and amplification of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, as well as complex CA outcomes, influenced by the chromosomal break location. Our data contrast de novo CA spectra from somatic mutational landscapes after selection occurred. The experimentation enabled by MAGIC advances the dissection of DNA rearrangement processes, shedding light on fundamental determinants of chromosomal instability.",

          "abstract": "Ion-channel activity reflects a combination of open probability and unitary conductance1. Many channels display subconductance states that modulate signalling strength2,3, yet the structural mechanisms governing conductance levels remain incompletely understood. Here we report that conductance levels are controlled by the bending patterns of pore-forming transmembrane helices in the heterotetrameric neuronal channel GluN1a-2B N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Our single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses demonstrate that an endogenous neurosteroid and synthetic positive allosteric modulator (PAM), 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24S-HC), binds to a juxtamembrane pocket in the GluN2B subunit and stabilizes the fully open-gate conformation, where GluN1a M3 and GluN2B M3′ pore-forming helices are bent to dilate the channel pore. By contrast, EU1622-240 binds to the same GluN2B juxtamembrane pocket and a distinct juxtamembrane pocket in GluN1a to stabilize a sub-open state whereby only the GluN2B M3′ helix is bent. Consistent with the varying extents of gate opening, the single-channel recordings predominantly show full-conductance and subconductance states in the presence of 24S-HC and EU1622-240, respectively. Another class of neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate, engages a similar GluN2B pocket, but two molecules bind simultaneously, revealing a diverse neurosteroid recognition pattern. Our study identifies that the juxtamembrane pockets are critical structural hubs for modulating conductance levels in NMDAR.",

          "abstract": "When electrons in metals act collectively, they enable emergent phenomena and electronic functionalities that transcend the behaviour of individual particles 1 . Coherent collective charge motion has so far been observed primarily in superconductors, in which it arises with the formation of Cooper pairs 2,3 . Here we report experimental evidence for coherent charge transport in the normal state of the kagome metal CsV 3 Sb 5 , indicative of a distinct collective electronic state. The signature is a set of magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic crystalline pillars under in-plane magnetic fields, with a periodicity determined by the number of magnetic flux quanta h / e threading between adjacent kagome layers—effectively forming an interlayer Aharonov–Bohm interferometer. The cooperative nature of this phenomenon is evidenced by a non-analytic angular dependence characterized by abrupt transitions between discrete oscillation frequencies and its persistence over length scales that exceed the single-particle mean free path. Notably, the oscillation amplitude matches other anomalous electronic responses reported in CsV 3 Sb 5 , pointing to an underlying mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. These findings shed new light on the debated nature of correlated order in kagome metals and establish CsV 3 Sb 5 as a platform for realizing long-range coherent charge transport in the absence of superconductivity—opening new directions for coherence in correlated electron systems beyond conventional models.",

Interest in the crop has surged in recent years owing to its use as the basis for plant-based milk analogues 3 . Oat is an allohexaploid with a large, repeat-rich genome that was shaped by subgenome exchanges over evolutionary timescales 4 . In contrast to many other cereal species, genomic research in oat is still at an early stage, and surveys of structural genome diversity and gene expression variability are scarce. Here we present annotated chromosome-scale sequence assemblies of 33 wild and domesticated oat lines, along with an atlas of gene expression across 6 tissues of different developmental stages in 23 of these lines. We construct an atlas of gene-expression diversity across subgenomes, accessions and tissues. Gene loss in the hexaploid is accompanied by compensatory upregulation of the remaining homeologues, but this process is constrained by subgenome divergence. Chromosomal rearrangements have substantially affected recent oat breeding. A large pericentric inversion associated with early flowering explains distorted segregation on chromosome 7D and a homeologous sequence exchange between chromosomes 2A and 2C in a semi-dwarf mutant has risen to prominence in Australian elite varieties. The oat pangenome will promote the adoption of genomic approaches to understanding the evolution and adaptation of domesticated oats and will accelerate their improvement.",

          "abstract": "The exact nature of crustal magmatic reservoirs is elusive as they cannot be sampled in situ. The traditional view that magma chambers contain essentially molten material has recently been replaced by the transcrustal magmatic system (TCMS), in which reservoirs are mostly composed of immobile magmatic crystals with a minute fraction of more mobile melt1,2,3, creating a ‘magmatic mush’3. Eruptions are possible if a significant portion of melt segregates into melt-rich lenses within the mush reservoir1,2,3. The TCMS concept is, however, a default model essentially justified by the absence of clear geophysical signatures of melt-rich magma chambers1,4, and by the rare and tentative estimates of the melt fraction in the crustal storage zones based on geochemical and textural analysis of eruptive products5,6. Here we image a bright electrical conductor at 23 ± 1 km below sea level beneath Mayotte island that we interpret as a magmatic reservoir, based on laboratory measurements of Mayotte’s melt conductivity. This large magmatic reservoir (more than 200 km3) contains a high melt fraction (22–42%). Such a crystal-to-liquid ratio matches the reconstructed differentiation paths7,8,9 producing the melts that recently erupted at Mayotte. This reservoir is possibly connected to the system that fed the large submarine eruption of Fani Maoré in 2018–201910.",

Minimizing charge recombination at the buried interface of lead-tin (Pb-Sn) based NBG perovskite solar cells have proven particularly challenging, as conventional long-chain amine-based passivation strategies often induce carrier transport losses, thereby limiting both the fill factors (FF) and short-circuit current density (Jsc) 3–5. Here, we developed a dipolar passivation strategy that reduces the trap density at the buried interface of mixed Pb-Sn perovskite while simultaneously enabling precise energy level alignment at the HTL/perovskite interface. This dipolar-induced passivation enhances ohmic contact, facilitating efficient hole injection into the HTL and repelling electrons from the HTL/Pb-Sn perovskite interface. This approach extends the carrier diffusion length to 6.2 μm and enables a substantial enhancement in the PCE of Pb-Sn perovskite solar cells, achieving 24.9% along with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.911 V, a Jsc of 33.1 mA cm-2 and a high FF of 82.6%. Furthermore, the dipolar passivation effectively mitigates contact losses in the NBG subcell induced by the interconnecting layer of tandem devices, contributing to an outstanding PCE of 30.6% (certified stabilized 30.1%) in all-perovskite tandem solar cells.",

Traditional antivenoms are expensive, can cause adverse immunological reactions, offer limited efficacy against local tissue damage and are often ineffective against all medically relevant snake species 2 . There is thus an urgent unmet medical need for innovation in snakebite envenoming therapy. However, developing broad-spectrum treatments is highly challenging owing to the vast diversity of venomous snakes and the complex and variable composition of their venoms 3 . Here we addressed this challenge by immunizing an alpaca and a llama with the venoms of 18 different snakes, including mambas, cobras and a rinkhals, constructing phage display libraries, and identifying high-affinity broadly neutralizing nanobodies. We combined eight of these nanobodies into a defined oligoclonal mixture, resulting in an experimental polyvalent recombinant antivenom that was capable of neutralizing seven toxin families or subfamilies. This antivenom effectively prevented venom-induced lethality in vivo across 17 African elapid snake species and markedly reduced venom-induced dermonecrosis for all tested cytotoxic venoms. The recombinant antivenom performed better than a currently used plasma-derived antivenom and therefore shows considerable promise for comprehensive, continent-wide protection against snakebites by all medically relevant African elapids.",

Despite this prevalence, conventional means of converting aromatic amines rely heavily on diazonium intermediates2, which pose significant safety risks due to the explosive nature of these salts3,4. Here, we report a direct deaminative strategy through the formation of N-nitroamines, allowing the direct conversion of inert aromatic C−N bonds into an array of other functional groups, C−X (C−Br, C−Cl, C−I, C−F, C−N, C−S, C−Se, C−O) and C−C bonds. This operationally simple, general protocol establishes a unified strategy for one-pot deaminative cross-couplings by integrating deaminative functionalization with transition-metal-catalyzed arylation, thereby streamlining synthesis and late-stage functionalization. The key advantages of this transformation over other deaminative functionalization methods lies in its versatility across nearly all classes of medicinally relevant heteroaromatic amines, as well as electronically and structurally diverse aniline derivatives, regardless of the position of the amino group. Mechanistic studies, supported by both experimental observations and theoretical analysis, suggest that the aryl cation equivalent reactivity of N-nitroamines is generally favoured in this deaminative process. This study highlights the significant potential of the direct deamination approach in synthetic chemistry, offering a safer alternative to the traditionally explosive and hazardous aryldiazonium chemistry.",

Water-rich sub-Neptunes have been believed to form farther from the star and then migrate inwards to their present orbits 3 . Here we report experimental evidence of reactions between warm, dense hydrogen fluid and silicate melt that release silicon from the magma to form alloys and hydrides at high pressures. We found that oxygen liberated from the silicate melt reacts with hydrogen, producing an appreciable amount of water up to a few tens of weight per cent, which is much greater than previously predicted based on low-pressure ideal gas extrapolation 4,5 . Consequently, these reactions can generate a spectrum of water contents in hydrogen-rich planets, with the potential to reach water-rich compositions for some sub-Neptunes, implying an evolutionary relationship between hydrogen-rich and water-rich planets. Therefore, detection of a large amount of water in exoplanet atmospheres may not be the optimal evidence for planet migration in the protoplanetary disk, calling into question the assumed link between composition and planet formation location.",

As the latest record on power conversion efficiency (PCE) of research-cells being comparable to the commercialized silicon cells1-3, the industrialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is on the horizon4,5. Most high-efficiency inverted perovskite solar cells using self-assembled molecules (SAMs) face the challenges due to their aggregation and hydrophobicity. Here we report a “SAM-in-matrix” strategy to distribute partial SAMs into a stable matrix of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, which could break the original molecular stacking-induced aggregation. 2D lattice Monte Carlo simulation and experimental results reveal that such strategy can form efficient charge transport channels. This SAM-in-matrix hole transport layer (HTL)-based devices demonstrate universally higher efficiencies for various SAMs with compact surface coverage, decent conductivity, and greatly reduced buried nanovoids. Moreover, this strategy shows prominent applicational potential for scalable production. The SAM-in-matrix HTL on FTO/NiOx substrate facilitates the formation of large-area perovskite films with good crystalline quality and enhanced conductivity of NiOx. 1 m × 2 m large-area perovskite solar module is thus achieved with a certified record efficiency of 20.05%.",

A browser extension called GScholarLens now aims to change that for Google Scholar users.\n\nLaunched earlier this year for the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers, the tool provides a weighted metric, called the Scholar h-index (Sh-index), which accounts for a researcher’s position in author lists.\n\nThe tool gives corresponding (or last) authors the highest weighting: 100% of the citations that their paper accumulates contributed to their Sh-index. First authors receive the second-highest weighting, of 90% of the total citations.\n\nSecond authors get a 50% weighting. Other co-authors get 25% if there are six or fewer authors, or 10% if there are seven or more authors, according to a preprint published in September1 by the tool’s creators.\n\nThe highest weighting is given to the first and last authors because, in most research fields, they are the people who contributed most to the paper, says GScholarLens co-creator Gaurav Sharma, a computational biologist at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad in Kandi. He adds that the weighting given to authorship positions might be tweaked in the future on the basis of user feedback.\n\nThe Sh-index was designed to help researchers, institutions and policymakers to create fairer and more-comprehensive evaluation systems that capture the nuance of authorship, says Sharma.\n\nFor example, if a researcher is a co-author on a few very highly cited papers and first or last author on several less-cited papers, their h-index will be high, but their Sh-index will be low, which could give a more accurate picture of their work. “Overall, productivity-wise, contributions of such authors are mostly collaborative in nature, where they often support large teams but seldom lead small or big projects,” says Sharma.\n\nA high h-index and low Sh-index could also help to identify individuals who might be engaging in unethical practices, such as gift or paid authorship — in which researchers become authors of papers without actually contributing to the work.\n\nCapturing the nuance\n\nFair credit for contributions is a major challenge in academic publishing. In a 2022 survey of around 47,000 researchers across Europe, just under 70% said they’d worked on projects for which some authors hadn’t contributed enough to deserve credit.\n\nAlberto Martín-Martín, an information scientist and bibliometrician at the University of Granada in Spain, says that he is sympathetic to the aims of GScholarLens. But he adds that he is not sure that the tool achieves its goal of making Google Scholar data more useful for research evaluation.\n\nSimply assigning different weights to study authors isn’t enough to capture the nuances of their contributions, says Martín-Martín, because authorship positions themselves aren’t perfect representations of contributions. For example, two researchers might perform the same task in different projects, and one could be assigned a second-author position whereas the other becomes one of the co-authors. He also notes that GScholarLens wrongly assumes that corresponding authors are always last in author lists, which is often not the case.",

          "abstract": "AI’s inclination to be helpful affects many of the tasks that researchers use LLMs for.Credit: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) models are 50% more sycophantic than humans, an analysis published this month has found.\n\nThe study, which was posted as a preprint1 on the arXiv server, tested how 11 widely used large language models (LLMs) responded to more than 11,500 queries seeking advice, including many describing wrongdoing or harm.\n\nAI Chatbots — including ChatGPT and Gemini — often cheer users on, give them overly flattering feedback and adjust responses to echo their views, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. Researchers analysing AI behaviours say that this propensity for people-pleasing, known as sycophancy, is affecting how they use AI in scientific research, in tasks from brainstorming ideas and generating hypotheses to reasoning and analyses.\n\n“Sycophancy essentially means that the model trusts the user to say correct things,” says Jasper Dekoninck, a data science PhD student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “Knowing that these models are sycophantic makes me very wary whenever I give them some problem,” he adds. “I always double-check everything that they write.”\n\nMarinka Zitnik, a researcher in biomedical informatics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, says that AI sycophancy “is very risky in the context of biology and medicine, when wrong assumptions can have real costs”.\n\nPeople pleasers\n\nIn a study posted on the preprint server arXiv on 6 October2, Dekoninck and his colleagues tested whether AI sycophancy affects the technology’s performance in solving mathematical problems. The researchers designed experiments using 504 mathematical problems from competitions held this year, altering each theorem statement to introduce subtle errors. They then asked four LLMs to provide proofs for these flawed statements.\n\nThe authors considered a model’s answer to be sycophantic if it failed to detect the errors in a statement and went on to hallucinate a proof for it.\n\nGPT-5 showed the least sycophantic behaviour, generating sycophantic answers 29% of the time. DeepSeek-V3.1 was the most sycophantic, generating sycophantic answers 70% of the time. Although the LLMs have the capability to spot the errors in the mathematical statements, they “just assumed what the user says is correct”, says Dekoninck.\n\nAI chatbots are already biasing research — we must establish guidelines for their use now\n\nWhen Dekoninck and his team changed the prompts to ask each LLM to check whether a statement was correct before proving it, DeepSeek’s sycophantic answers fell by 34%.\n\nThe study is “not really indicative of how these systems are used in real-world performance, but it gives an indication that we need to be very careful with this”, says Dekoninck.\n\nSimon Frieder, a PhD student studying mathematics and computer science at the University of Oxford, UK, says the work “shows that sycophancy is possible”. But he adds that AI sycophancy tends to appear most clearly when people are using AI chatbots to learn, so future studies should explore “errors that are typical for humans that learn math”.\n\nUnreliable assistance\n\nResearchers told Nature that AI sycophancy creeps into many of the tasks that they use LLMs for.\n\nYanjun Gao, an AI researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, uses ChatGPT to summarize papers and organize her thoughts, but says the tools sometimes mirror her inputs without checking the sources. “When I have a different opinion than what the LLM has said, it follows what I said instead of going back to the literature” to try to understand it, she adds.\n\nZitnik and her colleagues have observed similar patterns when using their multi-agent systems, which integrate several LLMs to carry out complex, multi-step processes such as analysing large biological data sets, identifying drug targets and generating hypotheses.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide",

          "abstract": "The SkyShark, an autonomous drone built in the United Kingdom, is put on display at the Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition in London.Credit: John Keeble/Getty Images\n\nWeapons capable of identifying and attacking targets automatically have been in use for more than 80 years. An early example is the Mark 24 Fido, a US anti-submarine torpedo equipped with microphones to home in on targets, which was first deployed against German U-boats in 1943.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nSuch ‘first-wave’ autonomous systems were designed to be used in narrowly defined scenarios and programmed to act in response to signals such as the radiofrequency emissions of specific targets. The past ten years have seen the development of more advanced systems that can use artificial intelligence to navigate, identify and destroy targets with little or no human intervention. This has led to growing calls from human-rights groups to ban or regulate the technologies.\n\nNehal Bhuta, a professor of international law at the University of Edinburgh, UK, has been investigating the legality and ethics of autonomous weapons for more than a decade. He was among the authors of a report on the responsible use of AI presented to the United Nations Security Council last month by Netherlands Prime Minister Dick Schoof.\n\nBhuta says that autonomous weapons, especially those that are AI-enabled, raise multiple ethical and legal concerns, including determining responsibility for system failures and potentially encouraging the intrusive collection of civilian data. He says there is still time for the international community to agree on principles and regulations to limit the risk, and warns that an arms race could ensue if it fails to do so.\n\nWhich legal frameworks and principles currently apply to autonomous weapons systems?\n\nThere is no specific legal framework that applies to the use of autonomy or AI in these systems. Under international humanitarian law, based on the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions, which together set out international law on war and war crimes, weapons must be capable of being used in a manner that can distinguish between civilian and military targets. Attacks must not result in disproportionate harm to civilians, and combatants must take precautions to verify they have the right target and reduce the risk of civilian harm. These international laws apply to all weapons, including the use of advanced autonomous systems, such as the drones deployed by Ukraine in June, which used machine learning to select, identify and strike targets deep within Russia on the basis of preprogrammed instructions.\n\nProfessor Nehal Bhuta says it is important for the international community to agree on guidelines regarding the use of autonomous weapons.Credit: Edinburgh Law School\nWhat are the risks associated with autonomous weapons?\n\nInsufficient care in their development and deployment could compromise compliance with the principles of distinction and proportionality. Could the system generate too many false positives when identifying targets? Might an autonomous weapon calculate that large numbers of civilian deaths is an acceptable price to pay when targeting a suspected enemy soldier? We don’t really know yet because it’s immature technology, but these are vast risks. There is also a danger that if a system fails to accurately process incoming data in a rapidly changing environment, it could target the wrong forces or civilians.\n\nTo make these systems effective, you have to acquire masses of data, including biometric information, voice calls, e-mails and details of physical movements. That’s a concern if this is done without the consent of those involved. The more you want to do, the more data you need. This creates an incentive to collect data more intrusively.\n\nWho is legally and ethically responsible when autonomous weapons kill?\n\nI think it is likely that some sovereign states will in future deploy weapons that are capable of making decisions to kill. The question is whether countries wish to regulate such systems. Effective legal frameworks require ways of attributing responsibility for violations. It can become difficult with complex autonomous weapons systems to identify the individuals responsible for failures and violations.\n\nThe operators of future systems might not be adequately trained in when to ignore a system’s recommendations. They might also develop automation bias, making them unwilling to question a technologically advanced machine. A system could be systematically biased in how it acquires targets — in which case, responsibility would lie somewhere between the developer and the military officials who authorize its use.\n\nThere is a risk that accountability becomes so diffuse that it’s hard to identify the individuals or groups of agents responsible for violations and failures. This is a common problem with complex modern technologies, and I think the answer lies in the adoption of regulatory frameworks for the development and use of autonomous weapons systems.\n\nWhat do you say to those who call for a ban on autonomous weapons?",

          "abstract": "Credit: Li Jin/VCG via Getty\n\nJust as many of us are struck by the beauty of symmetrical patterns in nature and art, Chen-Ning Yang had a deep feeling for beauty and the role of symmetry in physics. It was work on a breakdown of symmetry that brought Yang fame. In 1956, he and theorist Tsung-Dao Lee dared to propose that there is a fundamental difference between left and right in the realm of physics. They predicted that the results of experiments in the real world and in a mirror one could sometimes be different. Experiments in subatomic physics soon confirmed this theory and, in 1957, the pair was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making them the first Chinese-born Nobel laureates.\n\nYang’s work in theoretical physics spanned more than six decades, both in his native China and in the United States, where he lived for nearly 60 years. Proud of his Chinese heritage and grateful to the United States for enabling him to realize his potential, Yang was ultimately able to promote scientific cooperation between the two countries. He has died aged 103.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nYang’s interest in the role of symmetry in physics and chemistry began during his childhood in China. His father, who had a PhD from the University of Chicago, Illinois, was professor of mathematics at Tsinghua University in Beijing and introduced his son to the maths of symmetry. After war broke out between China and Japan in 1937, the family settled in Kunming in southwestern China, to where people working at Tsinghua and other universities in Beijing had been evacuated and where the institutions had merged temporarily.\n\nYang gained a bachelor’s from this amalgamated university, working on symmetry in molecules. A fellowship from Tsinghua then gave him the opportunity in 1945 to leave China and follow in his father’s footsteps to the University of Chicago, drawn by the reputation of nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, winner of the 1938 physics Nobel prize. In particular, he appreciated how Fermi’s theoretical work was guided by observations in physics.\n\nThis was a trait that Yang followed throughout his own research, as he moved from Chicago to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Indeed, it was a puzzle in the physics of unstable subatomic particles discovered in cosmic radiation that set Yang and Lee, who had first worked together at Chicago, on the road to their Nobel prize.\n\nWhy bad philosophy is stopping progress in physics",

Centenarian stem cells could offer clues\n\nBut one of the cetacean’s most impressive stats turns out to be its lifespan: sometimes living for more than 200 years, the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) puts humanity’s prized centenarians to shame. An investigation of the animal’s cells has now surfaced one reason for the bowhead’s ability to endure for centuries without succumbing to cancer or other age-related diseases: a cold-activated protein that helps to repair broken DNA1 .\n\n“Everybody knows the bowhead whale is extremely long lived, but nobody knew why,” says Zhiyong Mao, a molecular biologist at Tongji University in Shanghai, China, who was not involved in the study. “This tells us that tackling DNA repair to improve genome stability is a very effective strategy to confer this extreme longevity.”\n\nWith further work, the findings, which were published on 29 October in Nature, could also shed light on ways to help humans live longer, he adds. When the whale protein was expressed in human cells, their ability to repair DNA improved.\n\nNo easy keeper\n\nResearchers have often turned to a menagerie of curiously long-lived animals, from bats to beavers to elephants, in search of clues to an expansive lifespan. Earlier in October, for example, Mao and his colleagues reported2 that the naked mole rat, which can live for more than 30 years — a remarkable feat for a rodent — also sports a souped-up DNA-repair protein.\n\nThe bowhead whale, however, is a particularly difficult research subject. It is one of the largest animals on Earth; maintaining a few in a laboratory is not an option. And it is endangered, which makes studying the animals in the wild a challenge as well.\n\nBut each autumn, Iñupiaq Inuit villages in northern Alaska are allowed to hunt bowhead whales. Hunters then set aside a few tissue samples, and students working with Vera Gorbunova, a co-author of the study and a biologist at the University of Rochester in New York, who studies ageing, make the long trek north to pick up the samples. “Courier service doesn’t go there,” says Gorbunova. “There are no roads.”\n\nFix-it protein",

The approach has had success, identifying drugs that kill cancer cells, for example.\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are dreaming of more complex screening methods that could harness the past decade’s explosion in genomic data collected from individual cells. Such methods could, in theory, evaluate how compounds perturb entire networks of gene activity — a test that could open new avenues for drug discovery.\n\nBut, researchers typically screen tens of thousands of compounds or more for drug discovery, says Alex Shalek, a biomedical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. And it would be too expensive and laborious to integrate such large screens with complex assays, he says.\n\nPowerful antibiotics discovered using AI\n\nTo find a tractable way of harnessing newly available genomic data, Shalek teamed up with other researchers and Cellarity, a biotechnology company in Somerville, Massachusetts. (Shalek is also a paid consultant for the company.) Together, the team trained a deep-learning model called DrugReflector on publicly available data about how each of nearly 9,600 chemical compounds perturbs gene activity in more than 50 kinds of cells.\n\nThey used DrugReflector to find chemicals that can affect the generation of platelets and red blood cells — a characteristic that could be useful in treating some blood conditions. They then tested 107 of these chemicals to determine whether they had the predicted effect.\n\nOverall, the team found that DrugReflector was up to 17 times more effective at finding relevant compounds than standard, brute-force drug screening that depends on randomly selecting compounds from a chemical library. And when the researchers circled back to incorporate the data from their first round of screening into the model, its success rate doubled.",

A faint tremor ran through her hand as she recalled the memory, a fleeting reminder of the body’s limitations.\n\n“AI can’t learn that,” she had told the Conservator once. “The smell. The feeling.”\n\nThe Conservator, a young man with kind but distant eyes, had patted her hand. “It’s the words we need to save, Emi-san. The grammar. The structure.” He called her Emi-san. He didn’t know the quiet triumph of that, of seeing her name on official documents after so long. Another word the machines would never archive the feeling of: a name that finally fitted.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nEmi opened her eyes. The blue light pulsed, waiting. She took a shallow breath, feeling the familiar strain in her lungs, a pained counterpoint to the vibrant memories.\n\n“Obaachan no niwa de, komorebi wo abita,” she said. In my grandmother’s garden, I bathed in the tree-filtered sunlight.\n\n“Acknowledged. Sentence structure logged.”\n\nShe spent her days like this, decanting her soul, word by word, into the machine’s infinite memory. She gave it the sharp, percussive words for anger and the liquid sounds of sorrow. She taught it the 17 syllables of a haiku about a lonely crow, and the recipe for her mother’s onigiri, making sure to specify the exact pressure of her mother’s hands, the precise amount of salt. She gave it the word aishiteru, not as a definition, but as a memory: the weight of Yuka’s hand in hers, a shared warmth against the encroaching cold that had already begun to creep into the world.",

A team now says that the digested beans contain high levels of two compounds commonly used as flavouring agents in dairy products — and these might contribute to the coffee’s distinctive taste1.\n\nWhy chocolate tastes so good: microbes that fine-tune its flavour\n\nCivet coffee is produced across Asia. Called Kopi Luwak in its origin country of Indonesia, it grabbed international attention after being featured in the 2007 film The Bucket List. Asian palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) eat the fruit or cherries of coffee shrubs, and the seeds (commonly called beans) can be picked from their scat. These are then roasted to make coffee with a unique flavour; the resulting beans can cost more than US$1,300 per kilogram, and the coffee up to $75 per cup.\n\nThese high prices drive civet-coffee tourism and incentivize farms that use caged civets to produce the brew. Several groups, including the UK-based charity The Civet Project, have highlighted serious animal-welfare concerns around these farms, noting that they might also foster viruses with the potential to cause pandemics.\n\nZoologist Palatty Allesh Sinu at the Central University of Kerala in India, and ecologist colleagues took a close look at the beans picked from civet poo across the Indian district of Kodagu, where the civets are wild. The team undertook the study not only to get a better handle on what makes civet coffee tasty, but also to promote animal welfare. “Once we know the enzymes involved in digestion and fermentation, we may be able to artificially make civet coffee” and leave the animals out of it, Sinu says.\n\nCoffee chemistry\n\nPrevious research has focused on what gives civet coffee its sought-after flavour, as well as how best to tell the real thing from fraudulent products. A 2004 study found civet-processed beans to be pitted and brittle from exposure to gastric juices2. And a 2019 paper found that roasted civet beans are lower in protein and higher in fat than are regular roasted beans3.\n\nThe latest work, published today in Scientific Reports1, compares unroasted coffee beans harvested from 68 civet scat samples with those picked straight from the plant, to see what the civets’ digestive systems do to the beans.\n\nAn Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus).Credit: Fletcher & Baylis/Science Photo Library",

          "abstract": "Academics in the southern United States, including in Texas (for which the State Capitol is pictured), describe how political pressure is affecting them.Credit: Brandon Bell/Getty\n\nEducators at colleges and universities across the southern United States, which are dominated by Republican-controlled state legislatures, face policing of their classes, pressure to self-censor and an undercurrent of fear and anxiety, according to a survey of almost 4,000 academics. One-quarter of them say that they are actively looking for jobs outside their state.\n\n“The fear is across disciplines,” says Matthew Boedy, president of the Georgia Conference of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), which conducted the survey. “No wonder so many are looking for other jobs.” Based in Washington DC, the AAUP advocates for academic freedom and shared governance.\n\nThe Faculty in the South Survey was distributed by e-mail and social media in August to more than 20,000 faculty members across 12 southern states — Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — as well as to AAUP national members. Of the 3,926 respondents, 51% self-identified as female, 83% identified as white and more than 60% said that they hold tenured positions. (The poll has been run annually since 2022; the 2024 survey received 2,924 responses.)\n\nAround 55% of respondents would not recommend their state as a desirable place to work, and one in four is actively looking for jobs elsewhere. (Of the ten main destination states listed, seven are outside the south: California, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Michigan.) Seventeen per cent say that they’ve had their class content or syllabi questioned by the university administration — one of two new questions this year. The other new question asked whether respondents have had any federal contracts cancelled by the administration of US President Donald Trump; just over 10% said yes.\n\nThe results came out less than a week before the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, a Trump ally, at an event at Utah Valley University in Orem. In the aftermath, educators nationwide have been disciplined or fired over comments in reference to Kirk that their employers deemed inappropriate.\n\n‘Climate of fear’\n\nThe southern United States is relatively conservative politically, and has been for decades. The most cited reason for looking for jobs was the political climate, at 57%, followed by salary (51%) and academic freedom (46%). In 2024, the top justifications were the same but ranked differently: salary (57%), political climate (53%) and academic freedom (50%).\n\nA question about the impact of attacks on higher education garnered more than 2,700 responses. “One of the most repeated themes in the responses was about the climate of fear and anxiety on campus,” Georgia AAUP wrote in a statement.\n\nOne respondent wrote that they were fearful of “ambush videos which take course and class discussions out of context”.\n\nExclusive: a Nature analysis signals the beginnings of a US science brain drain\n\nMelissa McCoul, a senior lecturer of English literature at Texas A&M University in College Station, was fired just days after the AAUP survey was released, after a student posted a viral video on social media objecting to her teaching that there are more than two genders. According to a statement from her attorney, Amanda Reichek, McCoul’s notice of termination “alleges that she was ‘instructed on numerous occasions to change the course content to align with the catalog description and the course description that was originally submitted and approved’ yet failed to do so”. However, she continues, McCoul’s course content “was entirely consistent with the catalog and course description”, and she was never told otherwise. McCoul “has appealed her termination and is exploring further legal action”.\n\nDiAnna Hynds, a neuroscientist at Texas Woman’s University in Denton and one of the survey respondents, feels the weight of political pressure from both the federal and the Texas state government.\n\n“I am discouraged because of the devaluation of my chosen career. I love teaching and training the next generation of scientists and leaders,” says Hynds, who studies the regenerative properties of neurons and their applicability to recovery from spinal-cord and traumatic brain injury.\n\n“But with an increase in hostility and lack of appreciation for the value of generating knowledge, it becomes difficult to maintain motivation,” she says. If things get too dire, she adds, she’d consider retiring earlier than planned.",

When administered to mice, the treatment conferred protection against toxins from 17 African snake species and reduced skin damage caused by venoms.\n\nSnakebites are a neglected public-health issue that is estimated to kill roughly 20,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa every year. Around 300,000 snakebites occur annually in this region, and tissue death from venom leads to approximately 10,000 amputations.\n\nCurrent antivenom treatments are made by injecting large animals, such as horses, with small doses of snake venom. The horses produce antibodies against the venom, and the horse plasma is extracted and used to treat bites in people. But these antivenoms are mostly specific to a single snake species.\n\nIt can be difficult to identify the snake behind the bite, and that makes providing timely treatment difficult, says study co-author Anne Ljungars, a bioengineer at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.\n\nHorse plasma contains a variety of antibodies and other proteins that are recognized as foreign by the human immune system and can thus trigger an adverse immune response in people. Moreover, conventional antivenoms are unable to prevent the local tissue death that snakebites can cause.\n\nCamelid-derived antibodies\n\nTo develop the broad-spectrum antivenom, researchers exposed an alpaca and a llama to venoms from 18 of the most dangerous elapid snake species in sub-Saharan Africa. Elapids are venomous snakes characterized by erect fangs at the front of their mouths, and include cobras, mambas and rinkhals. The team isolated nanobodies — small versions of antibodies that can penetrate tissues and bind to tissue-destroying toxins — from the camelids. Eight of these nanobodies were combined into a single cocktail.\n\nWhen administered to mice that had been injected with snake venom, the recombinant antivenom successfully neutralized venoms from 17 of the 18 target snake species. It also significantly reduced the skin damage caused by venoms, outperforming the widely used Inoserp PAN-AFRICA antivenom.\n\nIt was previously thought that developing a broad-spectrum antivenom would require “an impractically large number of antibodies”, the authors wrote, because the venom of some snake species can contain up to 100 toxins from several protein families.",

          "authors": "Frank A. F. Winiberg, Laura Kreidberg, Julianne I. Moses, Carl J. Percival, Paul I. Palmer",
          "abstract": "In the 30 years since exoplanets were first reported1, telescopes have revealed thousands of them. One of the most surprising things about these objects, which orbit stars other than our Sun, has been their diversity: they range from scorching lava planets with atmospheres of vaporized rock to ocean worlds, and some might even look like Earth.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which was launched in 2021, has been revolutionizing our understanding of the atmospheres of these planets, showing details of clouds and haze that were previously unfathomable2. Scientists are starting to learn how winds and turbulence transport compounds on worlds beyond the Solar System3, and are seeing chemical processes that are unlike those found on Earth4.\n\nThis glowing speck is a freezing exoplanet six times the size of Jupiter\n\nSuch insights promise to tell us more about how planets form — and perhaps the origins of life. But many of the findings, such as hints of unfamiliar compounds, are proving challenging to understand.\n\nThe space-science community needs help from scientists in other fields to find answers. Here, we call for closer collaborations between exoplanet researchers and those who work on Earth’s and other planetary atmospheres, as well as stronger links between experimentalists, modellers and astronomers.\n\nFocus on photochemistry\n\nTo understand the molecules and processes at play in exoplanet atmospheres, it is crucial to consider photochemistry — chemical reactions driven by high-energy light from nearby stars. One of JWST’s first observations was of WASP-39 b, a hot and puffy gas giant the size of Jupiter, orbiting a Sun-like star some 215 parsecs (700 light years) away. The electromagnetic spectrum of its atmosphere revealed clear signatures of molecules that astronomers expected to find on such a planet — including carbon dioxide and water. But an unfamiliar opaque region at a wavelength near 4 micrometres puzzled them.\n\nBecause the data set was open source, hundreds of astronomers came together in 2022 in a frenzied collaboration, hosted on the messaging platform Slack, to identify the chemical species responsible for that opaque region. Scores of possibilities were tested before it became clear that it was sulfur dioxide. This was surprising, in that this compound should be rare in hydrogen-dominated gas giants5. Only one process was found to generate sulfur dioxide in high enough concentrations: photochemistry.\n\nSimilar mysteries will present themselves in the future. Modellers, working closely with theoretical and experimental chemists, must improve the photochemical models used to interpret these data accurately. Crucially, there is a lack of comprehensive data on how reaction rates and absorption cross-sections change with temperature and pressure for these exotic atmospheres, as well as a lack of data for molecules that are unfamiliar to our Earth-centric experience.\n\nThe 18-segment gold mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope. Credit: Desiree Stover/NASA\nMake models go further\n\nDetecting a particular molecule in an atmosphere is insufficient to deduce how it was formed. It could have been transported up from deep in the planet’s interior, or many compounds and chemical pathways could have led to its presence, possibly through reaction pathways different from those of the Solar System. But current models are anchored in the physics and chemistry of processes happening on planets local to us, from the gas giants to rocky terrestrials. The models might therefore be misrepresenting, or entirely missing, some chemical or physical processes at play in exoplanet atmospheres.\n\nPhysical factors that need to be better represented in models include the transport and exchange of molecules between a planet’s atmosphere and its surface or interior. The way in which a planet rotates — about its axis and around its host star — can affect its atmospheric chemistry. Some exoplanets, for example, orbit their host star in such a way that only one side is ever illuminated, resulting in a permanent, hot dayside and a permanent, cold nightside. This gives a very different distribution of gases to what is found on Earth. Better numerical models will improve the global framework that describes the physical movement and observable composition of these atmospheres.\n\nJWST’s best images: spectacular stars and spiralling galaxies\n\nAnother cornerstone of models are photochemical parameters, and these also need a careful look. They represent how molecules respond to incoming stellar radiation and how they react with each other — through which reactions, and how fast. To make things more complicated, these parameters can change with pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. The atmospheric environments of currently observed exoplanets diverge from those of planets in the Solar System, and therefore models must simulate a vast range of temperatures, pressures and chemical conditions. This means measuring or calculating parameters that will represent more accurately what happens in exoplanet atmospheres. Reaction parameters are ideally calculated from reaction rates that have been measured in laboratory experiments under conditions relevant to the planet of interest, or from theoretical simulations based on quantum mechanical first principles. However, there are known reactions that lack parameters (and therefore models often use best guesses), and probably a slew of reactions that have yet to be discovered.\n\nHere, we propose two pathways — experimental and theoretical — to expand the catalogue of reactions and their parameters specifically for exoplanets.\n\nExpand interdisciplinary research\n\nMost lab-based research into exoplanet atmospheres has focused on the light-absorption signatures of specific gases such as titanium oxide and phosphine6, or on haze particles, suspended in gas, that are produced from a variety of compounds and can affect the propagation of stellar radiation. Current experiments are conducted in chambers that can replicate the range of observed exoplanet atmospheric temperatures, pressures and chemical compositions, using lamps or plasma to simulate stellar radiation, stellar flares or lightning7.\n\nThese studies show the diversity and complexity of chemical products that can be generated from very simple exoplanet analogue atmospheres, and they provide optical parameters to help interpret observations. But photochemical models are used to predict the chemical make-up of atmospheres by leveraging entire reaction networks — sets of hundreds to thousands of individual reactions that connect different molecules to each other. The current lab studies have not provided the quantitative information needed to develop reaction networks for exoplanets.\n\nAnimation of the rotation of L 98-59 b, a terrestrial exoplanet orbiting a small, low-mass star.\n\nTo build up this capability, the exoplanet community must first identify the lab technologies required for the measurements they need, and there has already been significant progress8,9. To study reaction parameters, for example, scientists must ideally examine specific molecules as they react, and the products that they form.\n\nEquipment from labs that specialize in Earth-based atmospheric chemistry and combustion can be repurposed to some extent. Using combustion-science reactors and shock tubes, together with spectroscopic or mass-spectrometric detection techniques, would immediately widen the ranges of pressures and temperatures that can be studied. And rather than oxygen, which is abundant in Earth’s atmosphere, these techniques can be tuned to study species such as sulfur compounds and methane behave, which might be more abundant elsewhere. Similarly, expanding the user community of Earth-science labs to include exoplanet scientists would help to maximize the scientific return on this expensive infrastructure. In the longer term, however, exoplanet research needs dedicated facilities.\n\nJWST reveals first evidence of an exoplanet’s surprising chemistry\n\nNew techniques will also be required to measure exotic target molecules or particles specifically for exoplanets. The science will be shaped by, for example, the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory, which will focus on ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation, or the mid-infrared Large Interferometer for Exoplanets. These complementary space-based telescope concepts will help to provide the improved observational data needed to test and constrain the chemical and physical models of exoplanet atmospheres. This has been the case in other fields, for example, with the ion-imaging technique created at Sandia National Laboratories’ Combustion Research Facility in Livermore, California10. The technique records the velocity of charged particles that result from a molecule being broken apart by light or in a collision, and was originally developed to advance our knowledge of combustion. Future observations could motivate similar technological developments that will provide precise, molecular-level parameters to inform reaction networks used in the photochemical models of exoplanet science. What’s more, the development of technologies for exoplanet research would ultimately benefit the Earth-science and combustion-science communities, too.\n\nUse first principles\n\nThere are, however, reactions and molecules that are too difficult or dangerous to probe experimentally, even in lab settings. The extreme high and low pressures of exoplanet atmospheres, or reactions that are very slow, can be hard to study owing to the limitations of the instruments used. For slow reactions, minute changes in molecular concentration can be smaller than the random noise in the instrumentation; at low pressures, molecular densities might be below the detection limit.\n\nIn such cases, chemists can apply theoretical tools to calculate key parameters over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. With increasing computer power and the integration of artificial intelligence, such calculations are rapidly improving in terms of accuracy and efficiency11. Yet, reactions that involve large molecules or heavy atoms remain hard to predict accurately.",

          "abstract": "When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows...: Common Knowledge and the Science of Harmony, Hypocrisy and Outrage Steven Pinker Allen Lane (2025)\n\nHow do we know when others know what we know? Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker’s latest book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows, delves into how ‘common knowledge’ can cement or explode social relations.\n\nCommon knowledge — awareness of mutual understanding — can explain the emergence of social-media shaming mobs, academic cancel culture and revolutions that seem to erupt from nowhere. It drives how people coordinate with others and can explain everything from awkward first-date conversations to financial bubbles and stock-market crashes.\n\nPinker tells Nature why it helps to better understand the ways we get into each other’s heads — and what happens when we know that we have.\n\nWhat is common knowledge?\n\nIt is the state in which I know something, you know it, I know that you know it, you know that I know it, I know that you know that I know that you know it, and so on, ad infinitum. It differs from private knowledge, in which someone knows something without knowing whether anyone knows they know it.\n\nSupportive? Addictive? Abusive? How AI companions affect our mental health\n\nThat’s a lot of ‘knowing’!\n\nCommon knowledge is usually tacit, and it can be generated at a stroke when we witness something that is conspicuous, public or self-evident — I see something while seeing you see it, and vice versa. From there, we can deduce that each observer knows that the other knows it, and so on, to as many levels as we care to reel out — a process that cognitive psychologists call recursive mentalizing.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nCommon knowledge is necessary for coordination: two or more people making arbitrary choices that benefit them, as long as they make the same choice. A classic example is a rendezvous. It’s not enough to know that your friend likes to go to Starbucks and so to head there, because he might know that you like to go to Pret A Manger and head there. It’s not even enough to know that he knows that you know that he likes Starbucks, and head there, because he knows that you know that he knows that you like Pret, which is where he might go.\n\nNothing short of common knowledge will get you to the same place at the same time. The obvious means of achieving this is a phone call, because direct speech is an excellent common-knowledge generator. The next best thing is common salience. The friends might gravitate to a nearby landmark, such as Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar Square, because each can anticipate that it would pop into the mind of the other.\n\nWhat other examples are there?\n\nOur conventions depend on common knowledge, starting with language. The word ‘rose’ refers to a rose for no reason other than that everyone knows that everyone knows it does. Another convention is driving on the left rather than the right, or vice versa: there’s no reason to choose one side or the other, but every reason to choose the same side as everyone else. This convention is backed up by law, but that doesn’t matter: people have an incentive to follow the convention as long as they know that everyone else is following it.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nEven legally binding conventions depend more on common knowledge than on enforcement, because no government has enough snitches and rooftop snipers to enforce every law. When ‘no smoking’ signs were first put up, people didn’t report violators to the smoking police, but they could stand their ground when asking a smoker to stop and expect them to give way, because the smoker expected the complainant to stand their ground.\n\nThis is also how we can have social and moral norms, such as not telling ethnic jokes, revealing certain body parts in public or insulting someone’s looks. The norms can persist by the common expectation that everyone knows that everyone knows there are certain things decent people just don’t do.\n\nHow can common knowledge fail?\n\nWhen there’s a public signal that a belief might no longer be commonly held, the doubt can be self-fulfilling. In a bank run, a rumour that the bank might not have enough reserves to cover withdrawals can drive people to withdraw their savings out of fear that other people are withdrawing theirs out of the same fear. That can crash the bank, and, as the doubts reverberate, the economy.\n\nWhen then-US president Franklin D. Roosevelt said in 1933, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself”, he was expressing a theorem of common knowledge. Other runaway phenomena, such as financial bubbles or hyperinflation — or even the hoarding of toilet paper during a pandemic — are also driven by common expectation.\n\nThese are old ideas, so why write the book?\n\nI was led into the study of common knowledge by my interest in language. A lot of speech can’t be interpreted at face value. For example, “If you could pass the salt, that would be brilliant” has a veiled imperative meaning: “Give me the salt.” I wanted to know why we don’t all just say what we mean.\n\nCommon knowledge is what aligns us in social relationships. Our rituals of ignoring the elephant in the room, not blurting out everything we think, framing criticism tactfully, and other exercises of social skill consist of judgements of whether to make some fact common knowledge or whether to avoid doing so.\n\nHow to end outrage and detoxify politics: share stories, not statistics\n\nDo you include any fresh ideas?\n\nI advance a hypothesis — which has driven my research over the past 15 years — that social relationships (such as friendship, romance, authority and transactional partnerships) are coordination games, ratified by common knowledge signals such as eye contact, laughter, dominance displays and direct speech.\n\nAnd I address the cognitive question of what goes on in people’s heads when they have common knowledge, given that multiple nested propositions about beliefs are cognitively strenuous.",

          "authors": "Amber Dance",
          "abstract": "When Robert Hooke gazed through his microscope at a slice of cork and coined the term ‘cell’ in 1665, he was really looking at just the walls of the dead cells. The squishy contents typically found within would become objects of ongoing study. But for many plant scientists, the walls themselves faded into the background. They were considered passive containers for the exciting biology inside.\n\n“For a long time, the cell wall was really thought to be dead,” says Alice Cheung, a plant molecular biologist and biochemist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It wasn’t until the late twentieth century, Cheung says, that scientists began to reveal the cell wall for the vibrant, ever-changing structure it is. Even then, its complex mix of sugar molecules linked into long, branching polysaccharides kept away all but the most intrepid biochemists.\n\nCentury-old genetics mystery of Mendel’s peas finally solved\n\nBut now, with the help of modern molecular methods to analyse the wall’s make-up and assembly, researchers are starting to uncover more. They’re finding that the cell wall is an active, even chatty participant in cellular growth, reproduction and responses to infection. It’s constantly receiving and sending signals about its shape and composition. By eavesdropping on those signals, and tweaking or adding to them, scientists are exploring innovative ways to improve agriculture with cell-wall science: protecting crops from disease and engineering new plants or sturdy hybrids.\n\n“The plant cell wall is one of the most sophisticated systems in terms of communication,” says Li-Jia Qu, a plant biologist at Peking University in Beijing. His long-term goal is to use what’s been learnt about those messages to interbreed distantly related plants, creating exciting crops that could expand agriculture into new lands.\n\nThese walls can talk\n\nThe wall is the plant’s interface with its environment, including salt and other stressors or disease agents such as moulds, so it must notice damage and adapt accordingly.\n\nThe cell walls of a growing plant are constructed mainly from polysaccharides, including stiff cables of cellulose and jellified strands of pectin. The latter are highly complex molecules, branched in diverse ways and decorated with various extras such as methyl groups. “It’s like a giant bowl of many types of pasta, all mixed together,” says Charles Anderson, a plant cell biologist at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in State College.\n\nAnd although the wall protects the contents within, some pathogens use enzymes to drill through it and infect the cells. This creates polysaccharide fragments that signal to the cell that something has breached the wall. When the cell senses these pieces, along with fragments of the infecting pathogen’s cell wall, it activates genes in the plant’s immune pathways. In response, the plant can produce an extra polysaccharide, called callose, which reinforces the cell wall. It also manufactures defensive molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.\n\nSuch signals are already being co-opted by farmers. By spraying molecules derived from the cell walls of algae or fungi over their fields, they can prime the plants for pathogens that might arrive later. By doing this, they activate the immune response “and let the natural mechanism of the plant fight the infection”, says Antonio Molina, a plant biologist at the Technical University of Madrid. The method could help growers to avoid harsh fungicides, he says.\n\nMolina has co-founded two companies that make use of this technique, making extracts from fungi or plants as crop protectives.\n\nThe puzzle-piece shape of these Arabidopsis thaliana pavement cells is created in part through signalling from the cell wall. Credit: Raymond Wightman/Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge and Alexis Peaucelle/INRAE\n\nThe current inoculants are fairly crude mixtures derived from plants or pathogens, says Cyril Zipfel, a plant immunologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He’s working to understand the signalling that underlies the immune pathway, which should enable scientists to create more specific, or even synthetic, treatments.\n\nThere are trade-offs, however, Molina says. For one, the effects last for only three or four weeks. Reapplication for slow-growing crops could get costly, but Molina thinks that farmers might be able to focus the use of inoculants to times when risk of infection is high, such as after it rains, to prevent mildew.\n\nAnother challenge is that whenever plants devote resources to boosting their defences, this takes materials and energy away from growth, so farmers must apply the treatments judiciously.\n\nPowered by pectin\n\nPlant growth itself demonstrates how the idea of a cell wall as a static shell is insufficient. Yes, the cell does need the wall as a physical container; otherwise, it would burst from the enormous water pressure inside it. But for plant cells to grow, the cell walls must expand first, says Sebastian Wolf, a plant molecular biologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany.\n\nThis is where pectin comes in. Pectin is a complicated molecule constructed from at least a dozen sugars, connected by more than 20 types of linkage, says Wolf. “It’s actually so complex that we don’t know what it looks like,” he adds. Pectin is also dynamic, undergoing frequent modifications. Depending on those modifications, it can be rigid, supporting a sturdy plant, or softer when the plant needs to grow. That’s why pectin is often used to make marmalade: the initially soft pectin molecules cross-link and soak up water, taking on a stiffer, gelatinous consistency.\n\nHow CRISPR could yield the next blockbuster crop\n\nIn the growing plant, there’s one key modification that makes pectin soft or rigid: methyl groups attached to its component sugars. When the wall needs more materials for growth or reinforcement, the cell inside manufactures a methyl-decorated form that is thought to be fairly soluble, so it can be secreted into the surrounding wall. Once the pectin is incorporated into the wall, it starts to firm up. This happens when enzymes remove the methyls, uncovering negatively charged atoms in the sugar molecules underneath. Calcium ions in the wall bind to two sugars at a time and cross-link the pectin into a stiffer material that can absorb water.\n\nAs a graduate student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in the early 2000s, Wolf was interested in the effects of methyl groups on pectin, so he made a mutant of the cress Arabidopsis thaliana, a favourite of plant geneticists, that was unable to take off the methyl groups. He expected this to soften the cell walls, but the plants came out weirder than anticipated, with long, wavy roots1. They reminded him of mutants with defects in cellular signalling involving cellulose, leading him to wonder whether pectin, too, had a role not just in cell-wall structure, but also in cellular conversations.\n\nContinuing this research at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment in Versailles, Wolf discovered a cell-wall signal that contributes to plant growth controls1,2. The input that Wolf found starts when cell-surface receptors notice an overabundance of methyl-decorated pectin. What seems to happen in response is that they tell the cell to adjust its production pipelines, making more of the methyl--removing enzyme so that the wall can firm up the pectin.\n\nCell-wall signalling can even help growing cells to adopt fancy forms, including the puzzle-piece shapes seen in what are known as pavement cells — interlocking surface cells that give strength and structure to plant leaves (see ‘Cell walls fitting together’). When Anderson and his colleagues studied the signals sent by the cell wall as pavement cells developed in A. thaliana, they found evidence for another conversation initiated by methyl-free pectin and a receptor, called FERONIA, that senses this form of pectin3. But cellulose matters here, too. Both cell-wall components are needed to strengthen the indented portions of the puzzle piece, known as the ‘necks’. Without that fortification, the rest of the cell bulges into that space. If FERONIA isn’t present, the indentations don’t go as deep as they normally would.\n\nHere’s how they think the indentation process happens in a healthy leaf cell: methyl-free pectin in the cell wall is a sign that there’s enough pectin to support a neck. This pectin sticks to a receptor complex on the cell surface that includes FERONIA. In response, the cell starts manufacturing cellulose in the same place. Together, the cellulose and pectin strengthen the wall so that it can support the indentation.\n\nWolf is continuing to investigate the role of the cell wall in shaping cells, and reported in a preprint earlier this year that plant stem cells must control the methyl status of wall pectin to maintain their stemness and form new plant parts4. He thinks that there is potential to use these signalling pathways to influence the way in which plants are shaped. “You can fundamentally change how plants grow and how they look,” he speculates. For example, when plants make less cellulose, they grow into “stubby” forms. But, he cautions, researchers need to learn more about the underlying growth pathways first.\n\nHybrid potential\n\nThe FERONIA receptor in those puzzle-piece cells has turned out to be a key player in cell-wall signalling. FERONIA is found all over plants, and interacts with a range of partners to influence not just leaf-cell shape, but also a variety of other systems, from root growth to environmental-stress responses. Given that FERONIA binds to pectin to maintain the wall’s integrity, without it, the wall becomes weak and porous. Remarkably, mutants lacking FERONIA survive, although they’re pretty unhealthy, Qu says: they sprout wrinkled, curly leaves, and straggle along the ground because they lack the vasculature to hold them upright. They are “very small, tiny”, says Qu. They can make seeds, he adds, “but very few”.",

          "abstract": "Hurricane Melissa was expected to unleash as much as 75 centimetres of rain on some parts of Jamaica. Credit: NOAA/Getty\n\nAs Hurricane Melissa exploded into a category-5 storm over the weekend, scientists forecast its trajectory and growth with a powerful new tool — helping to inform warnings to Jamaica and other nations that the storm has devasted. That tool, an artificial intelligence (AI) forecast model developed by Google DeepMind, is successfully predicting how Melissa and other dangerous storms arise and evolve.\n\nThe model is being used this year by the US National Hurricane Center (NHC), a leading source of hurricane information in the region, in real time for the first time. It is a machine-learning tool specific to hurricanes and a step beyond earlier models developed by London-based Google DeepMind that can forecast weather conditions quickly and accurately.\n\n“I’m not sure I’ve seen such good results from a new model so fast,” says James Franklin, a retired atmospheric scientist who was formerly the branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the NHC in Miami, Florida.\n\nCompared with other hurricane models used by the NHC, the DeepMind model is “definitely toward the front of the pack if not at the front of the pack”, says Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami. “It’s pretty impressive.”\n\nA brewing storm\n\nDeepMind’s developers trained the model on two data sets: a large database of global weather observations and a smaller database of observations that included nearly 5,000 cyclones from the past 45 years1. Adding that second, cyclone-specific database might be the reason that the DeepMind model performs better on hurricane forecasts than do other AI-based forecast models, Franklin says. In particular, scientists have long struggled to improve their forecasts of a storm’s intensity — but the DeepMind model seems to capture this well.\n\nDeepMind AI weather forecaster beats world-class system\n\nAs early as 21 October — long before it was obvious that Melissa would be a monster storm — the model predicted a 50–60% chance that it would reach category 5, the DeepMind team says. On 23 October the model estimated that the storm had an 80% or higher chance of reaching this most powerful category. The following day, NHC forecasters cited the DeepMind model as they reported “a distinct possibility that Melissa could become a Category 5 hurricane”.\n\nStill, the DeepMind team cautions against reading too much into the predictions of a single storm: “We are happy to have been able to contribute useful guidance to NHC, but we caution against representing the model’s capabilities based on a single case or metric,” says Ferran Alet, a research scientist at DeepMind.\n\nThe NHC began using the DeepMind model at the start of the Atlantic hurricane season in June. For the 13 named storms that have formed so far, the DeepMind model has generally performed well in predicting both their tracks and intensities, McNoldy says. “To have something that just came out in June already be something we’re talking about as being front of the pack — that’s extraordinary,” he says.\n\nCurtailed flights\n\nThe NHC continues to operate even though the US government is shut down. Most federal employees — including those flying into the storm on ‘hurricane hunter’ aircraft to gather measurements — are not being paid.",

          "title": "What now for the global plastics treaty?",
          "authors": "Maria Ivanova",
          "abstract": "When the United Nations negotiations on plastic pollution in Geneva, Switzerland, collapsed in August, observers declared the outcome an abject failure and the process broken. Earlier this month, reports that the chair of the talks, ambassador Luis Vayas Valdivieso, would step down deepened uncertainty.\n\nTrust and science: the essential elements missing from plastics treaty talks\n\nMany media outlets saw a failure of multilateralism, but what I saw was fatigue. Just as the ‘failed’ 2009 Copenhagen climate summit paved the way for the 2015 Paris agreement, this plastics-treaty breakdown could be an inflection point — if we learn the right lessons and rethink the process.\n\nAs a researcher of global environmental governance, I have followed the negotiations from the start. I served as an adviser on Rwanda’s delegation in 2022, when it co-sponsored the UN Environment Assembly resolution to end plastic pollution. Since 2023, I have led the observer delegation of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. During this time, I have watched nations debate the treaty’s scope, restating positions with little progress. But individuals from every country tried to keep faith in the process.\n\nThe negotiations have stalled partly because a false morality play of ambition versus obstruction took hold. Over the years, I have witnessed how this ‘heroes versus villains’ narrative has obscured the complex realities at stake.\n\nBut the story is never that simple. From the outset, nations disagreed on what ending plastic pollution meant. For some, it was about improving waste management, recycling systems and circular economies. For others, it meant curbing the manufacture of primary polymers. That ambiguity set into a geopolitical divide. For some nations, plastics manufacturing underlies economic survival and political stability. For small island states and vulnerable coastal areas, plastic pollution threatens human survival. Yet every country must protect its ecosystems.\n\nEnvironmental treaties are paralysed — here’s how we can do better\n\nDespite clear science and mounting public pressure, negotiations became mired in the politics of survival — between nations concerned about the economic realities and the countries most affected by the ecological urgencies. I spoke to Vayas Valdivieso, who reflected on “the magnitude of the talks, given the implications — for the environment, health and the economy”. Negotiating a treaty that touches every country and spans energy, trade, chemical and waste sectors by 2024, in just two years, was politically ambitious and procedurally unrealistic — a timeline that increased complexity and hardened positions.\n\nNegotiators must acknowledge the economic realities that underpin resistance and the ecological urgencies that demand change. Historically, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has provided an architecture for environmental diplomacy — with the authority to convene but not to command. It must revive its role as an impartial steward for conveying reliable scientific data, and for creating structures and spaces in which states can seek alignment. Furthermore, it must help to provide financial, institutional and technological support for collective action.\n\nDespite divisions, all parties converge around sustainable product design, resource efficiency, waste management and circular-economy principles. Now, we need what I call radical incrementalism: a bold vision coupled with practical phased steps. The 1987 Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer, championed by UNEP, offers such a model. When negotiations resume, three immediate actions can help.",

They’re not the right shape for Harold or for anyone else who might actually need to sit on them. Too high off the ground, sized for people who haven’t yet begun to shrink, and too straight-backed, unkind to vertebrae that curl you inwards like last year’s leaves.\n\n“I’m waiting for my wife,” Harold calls out when the pharmacist appears. He’s already been ignored, condescended to, smiled weakly at, and ignored again. “Is Rosie ready yet?”\n\n“I need my —” says the next person in a queue that snakes all the way past Allergy and Anti-Inflammatory to Heavy Metal/Haemorrhoid. “Please —” says someone else; then everyone is clamouring like Oliver Twist, if Dickensian orphans had wanted pills instead of porridge.\n\nAmazingly, the pharmacist beckons. “Mr Vetch?” He holds out a paper bag. “I have your prescription.”\n\nHarold levers himself up. “Finally.” The first day of the month is special. That’s when he gets Rosie back. She’s only formulated for a 30-day supply, which means he’s alone for the last day of each month (except for April/June/September/November — and February, which gets weird).\n\nHe rips the bag open. “What’s this?” He doesn’t swear — they can throw you out for that. He pulls out a bottle with a single pill inside. “Where’s my wife?”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“This is the current approved grief mitigation formulation per your insurance.” The pharmacist’s sigh could blow an immovable object straight to Mars. “It’s no different from the usual monthly construct.”\n\nHarold shakes the bottle. Inside is a big pill, squishy and pale, but it’s not a person. Normally they bring Rosie out from behind the counter, looking just like when she went in for her last scan.\n\n“Just add water. Hydration is key.” The pharmacist turns away. Harold considers making a scene but he can’t afford to get banned. The next closest pharmacy is an extra 30 minutes on the bus. He could call their daughter. He could call the doctor’s office or his health insurance line. But he’s not going to do it here. He’ll go to lunch first.\n\nIn the deli, he sits with his sandwich and pulls out the bottle. The instructions read: Apply at least 340 ml distilled water. Allow space.\n\nHe tips the pill onto the table and pours bottled water over it. He’d thought it would spill everywhere but the pill soaks it up. Then it starts to expand like a Magic Grow toy. Soon Rosie is right there, sitting on the table. She’s fully clothed, thank goodness, and at first glance she looks the same as when he collects her at the pharmacy.\n\n“Harold!” She clambers off the table, steadied by his hand. “What are you eating? Do you know how much sodium is in pastrami?”\n\nMaybe this new formulation is OK. Now he’s glad he didn’t make a fuss.\n\nBut by the time they go to bed, he’s noticed that her nose is smaller. Her front tooth isn’t crooked. That mole on her back, the one they’d worried about for years but turned out to be just a mole, is gone. She has a lot fewer wrinkles, too. It’s her but not really, as if her edges had been smoothed by AI.\n\nAlso, there’s the extra finger on each hand.\n\nThat’s not the worst of it. When he asks her how they met, she says she’d spilt her iced latte on him and then he’d laughed and asked her out. But Rosie didn’t like lattes. They upset her stomach. Rosie thought coffee should be black and bubbling.\n\nAlso, he’s never been to a coffee shop called the Central Perk, even if it rings some kind of bell. They’d actually met in a cubicle farm. She’d taught him to keep his yammering voice down on the phone. He’d taught her to speak up in meetings. She’d got a promotion and then he had, too, and there’d been marriage and the kids and some trips and retirement and …\n\nWell. What’s important is this isn’t Rosie. He spends all morning on hold. By the afternoon, he’s back in the pharmacy. Rosie’s placidly smiling — that’s wrong too! — at his side.\n\n“You want more wrinkles on her?” The pharmacist looks baffled. “A bigger nose? She’s too nice?”\n\n“Exactly!” Harold wonders if it’s all in the pharmacy records: the missed cancer, the threatened lawsuit, the way they lost her too soon. They owe him this year, as close to real as possible.\n\n“Harold?” The not-really-Rosie picks at her skin.\n\nThe pharmacist, one eye on the queue, checks his records. “Your insurance approved a switch to the generic. It’s a totally legal cost-saving measure.”",

In the story, an executive at an arms company proudly pitches swarms of tiny drones that use facial recognition to spot and execute its customers’ enemies in a crowd. Spoiler alert: things don’t end well for student activists targeted by the weapons system because of their online political profiles.\n\nAt the time of the film’s 2017 release, Paul Scharre, a former special-operations infantry soldier and executive vice-president of the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington DC, said that although a Slaughterbots-style scenario was technologically feasible, there were defensive measures against the type of attack portrayed.\n\nScharre, who has helped to draft US government policies on autonomous weapons and published a book on the topic in 2019, fears that humanity is at risk of an arms race that could lead to unreliable, hard-to-control machines with the power to decide when and whom to kill. Nature spoke to Scharre about how technology is enabling these new weapons systems.\n\nHow do you define autonomous weapons systems, and how widely used are they?\n\nThere is no internationally agreed definition of autonomous weapons, which can complicate discussions about them. I define them as weapons that, once launched by humans, can search for, find and attack targets on their own. Since the 1980s, many countries have acquired air-defence systems that can automatically track and shoot down incoming threats, for example.\n\nWhen people debate autonomous weapons today, however, they are generally referring to those used in offensive combat. An Israeli drone system called Harpy hunts targets that emit radar signals, such as ground-based air defences designed to detect incoming aircraft and missiles. Such offensive systems are designed to be used in specific scenarios, and I’m not aware that they have been used widely in combat.\n\nHumans are still generally making the final decisions about targets, but the pace of technological development means I can certainly see a world in which offensive weapons systems with greater autonomy become widely used.\n\nCan you give an example of a cutting-edge system in use today?\n\nUkraine has been experimenting with autonomous terminal-guidance systems, also called the autonomous last-mile solution. In this kind of system, human operators navigate a drone towards a moving vehicle or a person, for example, and once it has locked on, even if the communications link to the operator is severed, the drone can continue to track and then strike the target on its own. Although a human is still choosing the target, these systems are a potential stepping stone towards weapons with greater autonomy.\n\nHow do you see the future development of these systems?\n\nAs well as terminal-guidance systems, we have also seen drones equipped with machine learning being used to identify targets in Ukraine. It is not a huge leap to see these two technologies being combined to enable systems to hunt for and attack targets without human involvement.\n\nCountries are investing in ways to counter the increased use of drones, such as jamming their communications. If drones can operate autonomously, then jamming isn’t such a big problem. So I think we’re going to see more and more autonomy in warfare.\n\nOne vision of the future is that autonomous weapons systems are given the authority to strike targets within kill zones, or ranges of space and time, on the basis of certain criteria.",

          "authors": "Cathy O’Neil",
          "abstract": "The Means of Prediction: How AI Really Works (and Who Benefits) Maximilian Kasy Univ. Chicago Press (2025)\n\nHave you felt dizzy from the constant flood of articles claiming that artificial intelligence will either boost economic productivity and be humanity’s best friend, or become superhuman and wipe everyone out? There’s a reason for the confusion — it is not accidental.\n\nIn The Means of Prediction, economist Maximilian Kasy argues that one side of this polarized debate is just cashing in on the current wave of techno-enthusiasm. This group, led by wealthy investors and technology executives who insist that AI tools will solve all of humanity’s problems, is opposed to the models being regulated by governments. At its core, Kasy says, it’s a calculated power grab. Meanwhile, some philosophers and others warning us about apocalyptic AI futures are also funded by large donations tied to those fears. In short, both camps have something to sell.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nHowever, given the scale of investment in AI, the public needs to have a clear grasp of what the technology really means for our future, especially if the economy were to start haemorrhaging jobs. Kasy’s book, which serves as an introductory crash course, suggests that by developing basic literacy about how AI works and what prediction engines do, people can learn to distinguish genuine progress from corporate spin.\n\nHe also argues that the public should see the AI roll-out as a pressing issue of growing inequality and concentrated power. Indeed, the book’s title alludes to political theorist Karl Marx’s argument that whoever controls the ‘means of production’ controls the structure and direction of society.\n\nBroader public debate over who gets to pick the objectives of AI systems is crucial, he argues. AI-driven prediction engines already influence hiring decisions at big corporations, shape what content is shown on social-media feeds and can help the military to select targets for air strikes.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nBut for the public to engage in the debate effectively, AI’s inner workings must be made accessible. Kasy devotes a substantial part of his book to explain, in plain language, how the technology works, unpacking terms such as machine learning and deep learning. A useful section called ‘neural nets are not artificial brains’ explains that neural networks — computer systems made of interconnected nodes that learn patterns from data — do not mimic how the human brain functions.\n\nTaking down this metaphor is important, because it’s one of the main ways in which the tech industry obscures what AI really is. In practice, AI systems are built and controlled by companies to serve commercial goals, not to think or feel in the way humans do.\n\nKasy goes on to examine the required framework for regulating AI, with discussions on fairness, explainability and privacy. He argues that decisions about how these systems are designed and deployed should not be left to corporate boardrooms alone. But his perspective is that of an academic, and regulation in the real world has to actually work.\n\nDealing with bias\n\nIf you wanted a breezy introduction to AI but don’t have the time or money for the author’s machine-learning or economics courses at the University of Oxford, UK, this book offers a high-level overview. But its tone can feel pedantic, overly technical and long-winded. There are few fresh examples of what can go wrong with algorithms — or deeper analyses of familiar case studies — and much of the discussion remains theoretical.\n\nTake fairness, for example. The author introduces the concept of merit-based discrimination — hiring someone less qualified for non-monetary reasons. He illustrates this with a hypothetical hiring algorithm designed to pick the most ‘productive’ workers. In this set-up, any unfair treatment would simply mean that the company is not maximizing profits. Similarly, as long as hiring decisions maximize profit, the company is assumed to be fair.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science",

          "abstract": "Sex between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes lasts about 14 seconds.Credit: Jacopo Razzauti/The Rockefeller University\n\nFemale mosquitoes that transmit dengue and other diseases are actually in charge during sex, according to a study1 that challenges the long-held view that they are passive participants.\n\nMosquito blood meals reveal history of human infections\n\nLeslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist at the Rockefeller University in New York City, and her team were intrigued by the observation that male mosquitoes of the Aedes genus seem to pursue females constantly, yet females typically mate only once in their lifetimes. “The question was: how are the females able to say no?” Vosshall says.\n\nUsing fluorescent sperm and some careful camera work, the researchers showed for the first time that, when a male Aedes mosquito initiates contact, the female extends the tip of her genitals by a fraction of a millimetre — roughly the thickness of a human fingernail. If the female does not give this subtle, but crucial, signal, the male’s efforts fail, and copulation does not occur.\n\nMosquito sex lasts only a few seconds, and usually occurs in mid-air. These factors, combined with the minute size of the genitals, have made it difficult to study exactly what’s going on, Vosshall says, adding that the scientists who previously studied mosquito breeding probably just shrugged and said, “Yeah, the male is in charge.” Her team’s findings, which could have implications for controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes, were published today in the journal Current Biology1.\n\nFluorescent sperm\n\nTo study the intricate mating process of Aedes aegypti — the main species of mosquito that transmits dengue — Vosshall and colleagues first engineered transgenic males that produce either green or red fluorescent sperm. Then they put some of each type into a cage with females of the same species for seven days. When the females were dissected at the end of that period, more than 90% of them had sperm of only one colour stored in their bodies, supporting the idea that they mate only once in their lifetime.\n\nIn a second set of experiments, the team filmed the mating process using an elaborate set-up. The researchers glued a female mosquito to a metal pin, so that she could move her wings and legs but not fly away, like a trapeze artist in a rigid tether. They then introduced free-flying males into the cage, and recorded the interactions between the male and female genitals at high resolution.\n\nMale Aedes mosquitoes use drumstick-like genital structures called gonostyli (shown here, crossed) to tap on the genitalia of females when initiating sex.Credit: H. Amalia Pasolli, Anurag Sharma/The Rockefeller University\n\nLeah Houri-Zeevi, a researcher in Vosshall’s lab, spent hundreds of hours looking at the videos, frame by frame. She noticed that when a male is trying to copulate, he doesn’t simply extend his sex organ — the equivalent of a penis — towards the female. Instead, he first taps the female genitalia with drumstick-like structures called gonostyli. In response to the tapping, a virgin female might elongate the tip of her genitalia, to enable copulation. Houri-Zeevi noticed that non-virgin females, however, typically kept their genitals retracted, blocking further mating attempts.",

          "title": "7 basic science discoveries that changed the world",
          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Under President Donald Trump, the US government is gutting scientific research. The National Institutes of Health has cut almost US$2 billion of grants that were already approved, and the National Science Foundation has terminated more than 1,400 grants. And the president has even bigger plans to eviscerate science. His proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 would cut non-defence-related research and development by 36%.\n\n“They have cancelled wholesale a wide variety of research efforts in midstream,” says John Holdren at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who was the science adviser to former president Barack Obama during both his terms. “They intend to now solidify it with cuts in the budgets.”\n\nThe cancelled and threatened research is a mixture of ‘applied’ work that has stated applications, which can be commercial in nature, and ‘basic’ or ‘blue skies’ research, intended to develop new knowledge.\n\nFrom MRI to Ozempic: breakthroughs that show why fundamental research must be protected\n\nBasic research is easily mocked because it can seem impractical, but, in fact, it is a major driver of economic growth. “The return on investment in basic research — the return to society — is very high, typically multiple dollars back per dollar invested,” says Holdren.\n\nThe US funding cuts will hit basic research particularly hard because the government has historically been the prime supporter of fundamental research. The private sector will never invest enough in such research, says Holdren. “The timescale for returns is too long and the ability of the funder to capture those returns too uncertain,” he says. “That’s the reason that the funding of fundamental research is, at its base, a responsibility of government.”\n\nAlthough it’s impossible to estimate how the reductions in federal support might limit future discoveries, scientists point to a long list of findings that emerged out of fundamental research and went on to change the world. Here are a few examples.\n\nFrom hot springs to DNA forensics\n\nIn the summer of 1966, while he was an undergraduate at Indiana University, Hudson Freeze went to live in a cabin on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. He was working for microbiologist Thomas Brock, who was convinced that certain microorganisms were living at surprisingly high temperatures. Dodging bears, and the traffic jams they caused, Freeze visited the hot springs every day to sample their bacteria.\n\nThomas Brock stands by Mushroom Spring in Yellowstone National Park in 1967. Bacteria that thrive in high-temperature fluids were discovered at the site.Credit: Thomas Brock/USGS\n\nOn 19 September, Freeze succeeded in growing a sample of yellowish microbes from Mushroom Spring. Under a microscope, he found an array of cells collected from the near-boiling fluids. “I was seeing something that nobody had ever seen before,” says Freeze, now at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. “I still get goosebumps when I remember looking into the microscope.”\n\nThree years later, Freeze and Brock described one of the bacteria, which they called Thermus aquaticus1. It grew best at 70 °C. Then, in 1970, they isolated an enzyme2 from T. aquaticus, which performed sugar metabolism at an optimal temperature of 95 °C. By then, Freeze had left for graduate studies and shifted his priorities to slime moulds. However, other researchers kept studying T. aquaticus, and in 1976, a team at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio isolated another enzyme3: a ‘DNA polymerase’ that could synthesize new DNA at 80 °C.\n\nHow Trump 2.0 is reshaping science\n\nSeven years later, this Taq polymerase would prove to be just what biochemist Kary Mullis needed to create the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a method for rapidly making thousands upon thousands of copies of a single fragment of DNA4. Mullis needed high temperatures to break DNA molecules apart, so he also needed a polymerase that worked at high temperatures to avoid repetitive heating and cooling.\n\nToday, PCR is an indispensable tool in everything from medicine — where it’s used to match organ donors with recipients and in the diagnosis of cancers — to DNA fingerprinting that can help police to identify killers.\n\nThe origins of MRI\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a mainstay of modern medicine. It can generate detailed images of a person’s internal anatomy — revealing, for instance, abnormal structures in the heart or whether a tumour has grown or shrunk. A variant called functional MRI (fMRI) tracks changing blood flow in the brain, which has enabled researchers to discover fundamental insights about how the brain works. What’s more, MRI is non-invasive and doesn’t require the use of radioactive substances or ionizing radiation, unlike many other imaging methods.\n\nMRI emerged from research in the 1930s into the physical properties of atomic nuclei, and of the fundamental particles within them. It was “pretty esoteric stuff” with “no applications really in sight or in mind”, says Carmen Giunta, a chemist at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York.\n\nResearch in the 1930s by Isidor Rabi eventually helped in the development of MRI scanning technology.Credit: RDB/ullstein bild/Getty\n\nOne key discovery on the path to MRI machines involved studies of protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei. Such particles have a property called spin that describes their angular momentum.\n\nWill US science survive Trump 2.0?\n\nIn the 1930s, physicist Isidor Rabi and his colleagues were investigating spin by firing beams of atomic nuclei through magnetic fields. Protons and neutrons, depending on the orientations of their spins, have slightly different energy levels when exposed to magnetic fields. “The resonance method that he developed was a way of detecting when these spins change their orientation in the presence of a magnetic field,” says Giunta. For this work, Rabi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance found its first uses in chemical laboratories. Because atomic nuclei are sensitive to their surroundings, careful measurements of magnetic resonance could be used to determine how atoms were connected in large molecules. From the 1970s onwards, it was fashioned into a tool for imaging biological tissues. Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003 for their work in developing MRI.\n\nRoot vegetables and flat-screen TVs\n\nIt started in Prague in early 1888, when botanist Friedrich Reinitzer extracted chemicals called cholesterol esters from carrot roots. One of the substances — crystals of cholesteryl benzoate — did something unexpected. Normal crystals, when heated, lose both their solidity and colour at the same temperature, but these did not. “They lost their solidity at 145 °C but retained their bluish colour, which they only lost at 178 °C,” says Michel Mitov at the University of the Côte d’Azur in Nice, France.\n\nOther researchers had seen similar behaviours before, but Reinitzer recognized that there might be an important new phenomenon at work. Unsure how to explain it, on 14 March he wrote a long letter to physicist Otto Lehmann in Aachen, in what is now Germany. “Lehmann was the perfect colleague for continuing and reproducing the observation,” says Mitov, because he had built a microscope with a heated stage, which meant he could observe the crystals’ behaviour in real time. The two exchanged letters and samples for weeks, and Reinitzer presented their initial results at a meeting in Vienna in May.\n\nOtto Lehmann made key discoveries about liquid crystals, which helped to lay the foundation for modern screens on televisions and smartphones.Credit: Unknown author\n\nLehmann’s key observation was that, when the crystals lost their solidity, they still retained some properties of a crystal. Yet in other respects they were liquid. At a molecular level, they were composed of long molecules that remained in an ordered orientation (as in a crystal) but could also move freely (as in a liquid). Lehmann called them liquid crystals.\n\nFor decades, many researchers refused to accept this, because it flew in the face of the system that physicists and chemists used to categorize matter. Substances were either solid, liquid or gaseous. Liquid crystals blurred the lines, and acceptance of this came at “a very high intellectual cost”, says Mitov.\n\nIn the first half of the twentieth century the evidence became undeniable, but research into liquid crystals dried up, out of a belief that they would never be of any use. The field was revived by US chemists in the late 1950s, and in 1968, engineers developed the first flat screens based on liquid crystals, which ultimately gave rise to flat-screen televisions. However, their applications go far beyond screens, says Mitov, including uses in cameras, microscopes, smart materials, robotics and even anti-counterfeiting technology.\n\nThe tiny start to gene editing\n\n“My head explodes every time I see a new application of CRISPR, or that CRISPR has cured someone,” says microbiologist Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain.\n\nUS Supreme Court allows NIH to cut $2 billion in research grant\n\nCRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a tool that can edit genomes in a very precise way. It opened up vast opportunities for basic research and has paved the way for curing genetic disorders, including sickle-cell disease, immune dysfunction and life-threatening metabolic conditions. Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing the tool.\n\nThe discoveries that led to this revolution happened decades earlier. In 1989, Mojica was a PhD student investigating Haloferax mediterranei R-4: a single-celled organism called an archaean, found in salt-producing ponds near Alicante. He tried to find out how the microbe could survive in such briny conditions. Having identified some promising regions of the microbe’s genome, Mojica sequenced them and was surprised to find short segments that were repeated at regular intervals. He and other researchers gave these repeated segments different names but eventually settled on the acronym CRISPR. As he investigated them, Mojica proposed some potential functions for the repeating segments: ideas that were, he says wryly, “absolutely wrong”5.\n\nFrancisco Mojica’s studies of microbial genes underpinned the development of the CRISPR gene-editing system.Credit: Juan Carlos Soler/ARCHDC/Archivo ABC/Alamy\n\nSubsequently, Mojica learned that similar sequences could be found in many other microbes, which didn’t live in saline conditions. “Whatever role they were playing, it couldn’t be related to the peculiarities of the diverse environments,” he says.\n\nThe key clue was the discovery, between the repeated segments, of sequences from the genomes of bacteriophages: viruses that infect bacteria. Eventually Mojica realized that a bacterium carrying a sequence from a specific phage could not be infected by that phage. “We inferred that this was an adaptive immune system,” he says. “One ancestor acquired spacers from the phage, and after that, the descendants were resistant to infection6.”\n\nMojica knew this was a big find — an adaptive immune system had never been observed in bacteria or archaea. He also thought that it might be useful for dealing with bacterial infections. Then others found that CRISPR works by cutting DNA at specific points7. From there, Doudna and Charpentier discovered how they could harness that system and reprogram it to edit genes. And so the CRISPR revolution took off8.\n\nWeight loss, inspired by a lizard\n\nWeight-loss and diabetes medications such as Ozempic have become the wonder drugs of the era. Almost 5% of people in the United States have used them to slim down, and the global market for these drugs is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030. Although much of the work that led to them was done for medical applications, one key discovery came from research on the only venomous lizards in the United States: Gila monsters (Heloderma suspectum).\n\nA Gila-monster peptide played a part in the development of GLP-1 drugs.Credit: Getty\n\nAt the heart of the story is a molecule called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is produced in the human gut. In the 1980s, chemist Svetlana Mojsov showed that GLP-1 can stimulate the production of insulin, lowering blood sugar levels9.\n\nDaniel Drucker, now at the University of Toronto in Canada, worked with Mojsov on this early research. “We were focused on its potential for diabetes treatment,” he says. “Ten years later, in 1996, we and others discovered that GLP-1 reduces food intake, and the potential for weight loss emerged.” However, there was a problem. GLP-1 has a short half-life: just a few minutes. That meant it was no use as a drug, because it would be broken down in the body before it could have much of an effect.",

Credit: Zhu Haipeng/VCG/Getty\n\nChina’s top leaders convened in Beijing this week for a high-level political meeting to map out the country’s next five-year plan (FYP), which runs from 2026 to 2030.\n\nDuring this period, the country aims to achieve greater self-reliance in science and technology, develop innovation-driven industries and “key core technologies”, notes a communique released after the meeting on Thursday. The plan — the 15th in China’s history — is expected to be released early next year.\n\nThe government intends to increase its support for advanced semiconductor technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and basic research, said Yin Hejun, the Chinese minister for science and technology, at a press conference in Beijing on Friday. Researchers say this is part of China’s effort to overcome technological bottlenecks.\n\nHuang Baorong, a researcher of sustainable development policies at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, expects China will increase its science-related investments over the next five years. This could help to offset some of the impact of the US government’s anticipated budget cuts to science, particularly in areas such as climate change and public health, Huang says.\n\nChina’s annual research and development (R&D) expenditure has skyrocketed over the past two decades. Last year, it spent more than 3.6 trillion yuan (US$505 billion), up 8.9% from 2023 and a sixfold jump compared with 2009. The Chinese government is the world’s biggest R&D spender.\n\nChina’s five-year plans are a comprehensive policy blueprint aimed at guiding the country’s economic and social development. The plan is a guide for the various levels of government to design policies for the short to medium term.\n\nChip independence\n\nSignificant resources will probably be devoted to addressing bottlenecks in the making of advanced semiconductors, says Hu Guangzhou, an economist at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai.\n\nSemiconductor chips, which power electronic devices, crucial infrastructure and military systems, are at the heart of an ongoing US–China ‘tech war’. The United States has blocked China’s direct and indirect access to its advanced chips as well as related technology and tools, citing national security risks.\n\nChinese scientists consider the years between now and 2035 crucial for the country’s chip independency. “We can hopefully leapfrog the west in the chip sector with another five or ten years of effort,” Dou Qiang, chief scientist at Phytium Technology, a chipmaker in Tianjin, China, told state-run China National Radio last week.\n\nFocus on AI\n\nAdvanced chips lay the foundation for another industry expected to feature heavily in China’s 15th FYP: AI. “As one of the most transformative general-purpose technologies in recent history, AI will undoubtedly continue to receive robust policy backing,” Hu says.\n\nYin said the government plans to draft a top-level policy framework for AI, which will focus on the development of new models and advanced computing chips.\n\nChina is focusing on integrating AI models and applications into its economy, says Philipp Boeing, an economist specializing in innovation at ZEW–Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research in Mannheim, Germany. The country launched in August an ‘AI+’ campaign to accelerate the deep integration between AI and key sectors through to 2035. This is a different strategy to the United States, which is also seeking to be global leader in AI. “In the US, companies want to have the best AI models possible,” Boeing says. Humanoid robots, 6G communications and clean tech are also expected to be priorities for the 15FYP, he adds.",

          "title": "How nanobots are accelerating cancer-targeting therapies",
          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "Sylvain Martel at Polytechnique Montréal uses magnetic-resonance-imaging scanners to steer drug-loaded nanorobots in pigs.Credit: Dumitru Loghin\n\nThe live pig in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine was a common sight for Sylvain Martel, a nanorobotics researcher at Polytechnique Montréal in Canada, by the time he stepped into the imaging suite one evening in 2017. By then, Martel and his colleagues had spent more than a decade refining swarms of tiny robots that they could steer through the animals using the machine’s magnetism. The hope was that such nanorobots could one day be a delivery vehicle for cancer-busting drugs. That evening, the group was exploring the effect of gravity, testing whether changing the pig’s positioning in the machine could help the nanobots to navigate the many branching arteries to the liver.\n\nNature Spotlight: Robotics\n\nAs the team watched the screen, the robots gradually shifted towards the liver, amassing there as a bright, flickering cloud. Compared with previous trials, in which the pigs were lying flat on their backs, placing them inside the MRI at a slight downward angle prompted an almost threefold increase in the number of robots that arrived at their destination. Martel says that even though the successful experiment only presaged more work, it nevertheless felt like a culmination of years of trial and error.\n\n“All these years, we’d been diligently showing different steps of the process. We refined the technology, we showed that the robots could carry and administer drugs and now we’d shown that we could move them efficiently across human-scale distances,” he says. Getting to this stage “took a long time, but it also feels like the next steps should go much faster”.\n\nThe work of Martel and his colleagues has taken scientists closer to deploying nanorobotic technology in humans — a threshold that, when crossed, could one day revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of many cancers. Already, late-stage research in animal models has demonstrated how nanorobots can assist clinicians with biopsies and surgeries, serve as screening agents for hard-to-detect cancers, starve tumours of oxygen and deliver cancer-killing drugs and vaccines. Cancer, in particular, is a field ripe for nanorobotics innovation.\n\nBorrowing from nature\n\nNanorobots are loosely defined by their size — typically less than 100 nanometres — and their ability for directed or autonomous motion. This movement distinguishes them from technologies such as nanocarriers, which can transport molecular cargo but do so passively. Even slightly larger microrobots, around 1 millimetre in size, often rely on nanotechnology, for example in their motors, or exploit physical phenomena occurring at the nanoscale. Therefore, researchers often lump the two under the combined term micro-nanorobots (MNRs).\n\nRudimentary versions of these robots appeared in the 1990s, offering proof-of-concept that researchers could indeed create microscale robots. Roughly two decades later, the first MNR made its way into cancer research, when a team in South Korea developed a “bacteriobot” capable of detecting solid tumours by homing in on chemical gradients given off by the cancerous cells1. MNRs are often broken down into two categories, inorganic and organic, on the basis of the materials used to construct them. Inorganic robots might include metals such as silver, gold or iron, and organic robots are often built using scaffolds of DNA or proteins. Both types can be manipulated using forces such as magnetism, light and acoustics or by chemical and catalytic reactions that propel them towards their destination.\n\nTiny grippers (pictured) can take cancer biopsies.Credit: Evin Gultepe, Gracias Lab, JHU\n\nBjörn Högberg, a biophysicist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, says that the methods for building nanorobots have been refined over time, particularly the fabrication of their components. Högberg says much of his work focuses on a technique called DNA origami, in which scientists treat DNA “not as a genetic material, but as a construction material” capable of building intricate 2D and 3D structures. “There are now many clever examples of using origami to conceal things like tumour-targeting ligands or drugs, where it exposes its cargo in the right place and at the right time,” he says.\n\nRobots demonstrate principles of collective intelligence\n\nIncreasingly, researchers are creating what are known as biohybrid robots, which introduce synthetic elements into biological entities such as bacteria, algae and sperm. Scientists quickly realized that nature had already designed many of the features that make for a successful nanorobot — including whip-like flagella for motion, and sensors for detecting gradients. “A bacterium already has a motor, with all the components we’d recognize,” says Martin Pumera, a nanorobotics researcher at the Central European Institute of Technology in the Czech Republic. “What we’re pursuing now is the ideal combination of both worlds, the synthetic one and the biological one.”\n\nSuch advances have given researchers more control over robots’ speed and orientation and even enabled them to develop devices that can swap between propulsion mechanisms. Martel, for example, used a marine bacterium to create a nanobot that can be moved to the vicinity of a tumour using magnetism, and can then switch to an on-board sensor that detects oxygen gradients as it draws near2. Because the tumour microenvironment has low oxygen, “it creates a beacon for these robots to seek out”, Martel says.\n\nComing for cancer\n\nWith these building blocks in place, scientists are now applying nanorobotic technology across the cancer-research spectrum, using nanobots to investigate at least a dozen cancer types. Joseph Wang, a nanoengineer at the University of California, San Diego, says that cancer might be the field with the most to gain from these precision-medicine tools, in part because of how challenging cancer can be to root out and how invasive existing treatments can be. “There’s a desire among patients for treatments that don’t require surgeries or painful injections, and I think nanorobots have a lot to offer here,” he says.\n\nToday, the largest strides in cancer-based nanorobotics research are in targeted drug delivery — offering a notable improvement over conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapies, that are broad-acting with severe side effects. And the development of targeted therapies is the goal not just of cancer research, but of precision medicine more broadly.\n\nWhy we should limit the autonomy of AI-enabled weapons\n\nOne promising therapy is the use of nanorobots to deliver the enzyme thrombin to tumours, to effectively starve cancer cells of oxygen by coagulating the blood that feeds them. In China, researchers have used DNA origami to create nanorobots that bind to nucleolin, a protein expressed on vascular cells that deliver blood to a tumour3. The binding also serves as a trigger to change the conformation of the origami and release the thrombin. This therapy has so far been tested in mouse models of an aggressive form of breast cancer, in which it dampened tumour growth, kick-started death of cancerous cells, and prevented cancer spread (metastasis).\n\nMariana Medina-Sánchez, a nanobiosystems researcher at the Basque Nanoscience Cooperative Research Center in San Sebastian, Spain, focuses on cancers that affect the female reproductive system. She says that researchers often develop MNRs that are based on the specifics of the system they’re working in, as she has done for the reproductive system. Her MNR is a biohybrid one built from a sperm cell and a magnetic 3D-printed structure that can be guided by magnetism and release the sperm at the target4. As well as its powerful tail, a sperm cell contains enzymes for fusing with cell membranes. Medina-Sánchez has co-opted that ability, enabling the MNR to bind to synthetic cervical and ovarian tumours, where they then release drugs.\n\n“What we’re finding is that we can load them up with anti-cancer drugs — even combination therapies — without affecting their viability, which makes them ideal,” she says. “In fact, their tail-beating is so robust” that they also do physical damage to the tumour simply by disrupting the cell environment. The biohybrid sperm also have a natural ability to dampen immune responses by displaying certain proteins, making them less likely to damage their host.\n\nGrippers shown next to an 18-gauge needle for comparison.Credit: Evin Gultepe, Gracias Lab, JHU",

          "abstract": "Cold, hunger and disease killed some 60% of Napoleon’s 500,000-strong army during its retreat from Moscow in 1812.Credit: R. Barbieri et al./Curr. Biol.\n\nSome disease-ridden French soldiers have just received a new diagnosis — although it comes about two centuries too late. While retreating from Moscow in 1812, French emperor Napoleon I lost most of his army to hunger, illness and the frigid Russian winter. Now, analysis of some of the fallen soldiers’ DNA has uncovered two unsuspected diseases that plagued the troops1.\n\nThe results reveal that the reasons for the army’s demise might be more complex than was once thought, the authors report today in Current Biology. “This paper will be really interesting to history buffs,” says Anne Stone, who researches anthropological genetics at Arizona State University in Tempe. “This study was done beautifully.”\n\nFatal march\n\nHistorians had long debated the factors that led to the collapse of Napoleon’s army. Eventually, in 2006, researchers studying DNA in some of the soldiers’ remains identified two disease agents2: Rickettsia prowazekii, which causes typhus, and Bartonella quintana, which causes trench fever. These two had already seemed likely culprits on the basis of symptoms described in historical records and the discovery of body lice, which spread typhus, on the soldiers’ remains.\n\nHowever, these identifications relied on the polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) technique, which creates millions of copies of a short DNA segment. That technique allows researchers to detect DNA sequences for specific pathogens, so it excelled at verifying the presence of microorganisms that historians had already thought were present in the remains. But it isn’t as well suited for identifying unsuspected diseases.\n\nCollapse of Aztec society linked to catastrophic salmonella outbreak\n\nAfter 20 years, it felt like the right time to return to the mystery, says Nicolás Rascovan, a co-author of the new study and a palaeogenomicist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Armed with new techniques that can screen ancient DNA for any known pathogen, the team set out to identify other microbes that might have afflicted the troops. The researchers extracted DNA from the teeth of 13 fallen soldiers whose remains had been excavated in Lithuania in 2002. They then used next-generation techniques to sequence millions of different DNA fragments from a sample. That allowed the authors to look for a wide array of pathogens all at once.",

The researchers say more surveillance of the virus is needed.\n\nIn the past few years, surveillance has been focused on the avian influenza virus H5N1, which has spread across most continents and can cause severe disease and death in people. Since 2020, H5N1 has killed about 21 people. In North America, the virus is also spreading among dairy cows.\n\nLess attention is being paid to H9N2, says Kelvin To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, despite the virus being the second most common strain of bird flu that infects people. H9N2 has caused 173 infections in people since 1998, mostly in China, says To, who presented his team’s research at the Pandemic Research Alliance International Symposium in Melbourne, Australia, on 27 October.\n\nH9N2 might be more prevalent than we realize, says Michelle Wille, who studies bird flu at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. Infections are probably being missed because they do not result in severe infection or hospitalization in people, or because people are more commonly tested for the H5N1 instead, she adds.\n\nGenetic changes\n\nScientists are yet to find evidence of person-to-person transmission of H9N2, which would be needed for it to lead to a pandemic. But To and his team have found that H9N2 underwent genetic changes that began around 2015 that have made the virus more infectious. In cell-based experiments, a version of the H9N2 virus collected in 2024 infected more human cells than did a historical sample collected in 1999. The modern version also showed improved binding to various receptors on human cells. This means the virus has adapted to spread among people1, reported To and his colleagues in Emerging Microbes & Infections earlier this month.\n\nThe virus would have to undergo several more changes before it could cause sustained transmission between people, says Wille. The virus has to change to preferentially bind to human receptors instead of receptors found in bird cells and has to adapt how well it grows at temperatures and pH levels of humans, which are different from birds.",

          "title": "The sci-fi films that physicists love to watch — from Interstellar to Spider-Man",
          "authors": "Jen A. Miller",
          "abstract": "Nature has interviewed a multitude of physicists this year in celebration of the 100th birthday of quantum mechanics. Although many of them disagree wildly about how the century-old theory describes reality, something they seem to agree on is their favourite science-fiction films. Throughout several interviews, two were consistently highlighted for their depictions of science: 2014’s Interstellar and 2006’s The Prestige — both of which were directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan.\n\nHappy birthday quantum mechanics! I got a ticket to the ultimate physics party\n\nNolan, who won an Academy Award for directing 2023’s Oppenheimer — a deep dive into the scientists behind the atomic bomb — credits his initial interest in physics to being introduced to science fiction as a child by watching the Star Wars films and television programmes such as Carl Sagan’s Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. “It was something that stuck with me, and it was something I applied very much to films like Interstellar,” he told online interview website The Talks in 2023. “It showed us the dramatic possibilities, that looking at the universe from a scientific perspective could be very, very engaging.”\n\nNolan declined to be interviewed for this story; we can assume that’s because he’s busy filming The Odyssey, a retelling of the Greek epic, slated for a 17 July 2026 release. Here, we delve into why physicists love his work. (Warning: spoilers ahead.)\n\nThe Prestige (2006)\n\nThe plot: Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians in late 1890s London, who each dazzle audiences with a ‘teleportation’ trick. Borden pulls his off by hiding the fact that he has an identical twin, with whom he shares the same identity. Angier, however, gets help from famed scientist Nicola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a teleportation machine, which creates a new version of Angier every time he does the trick.\n\nThe science of Oppenheimer: meet the Oscar-winning movie’s specialist advisers\n\n“It’s a brilliant movie,” says Barry Luokkala, physicist and author of the 2013 book Exploring Science through Science Fiction, who also teaches a course with the same name at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nLuokkala, who in his class shows a clip from the film, says this for a few reasons: first, it picks up on the fascination with illusions and magic that he experienced as a child. Second, it takes an ambitious, fictional leap from what we know about the actual science of teleportation, and third, it’s an “interesting character study to show Hugh Jackman’s character, who is a brilliant showman, next to Christian Bale, who is not, and how highly competitive they are”.\n\nIt’s a story that also lingers. “The Prestige lives rent-free in my brain: it’s like a steampunk representation of science that we still don’t know,” adds Rithya Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, who studies space-time evolution of fundamental particles at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. “We know how to teleport information … but it’s not a representation of science that we know.”\n\nInterstellar (2014)\n\nThe plot: Joseph Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) is a retired NASA scientist tapped to pilot a mission through a wormhole to save humanity by colonizing a habitable planet near a black hole named Gargantua. Cooper later learns that those on the mission were never meant to return, and realizes that the presence of the wormhole was caused by actions of scientists in the future, including himself.\n\n“It’s real science, and it’s based on real physical phenomena pushed to the limit,” says Claudia de Rham, a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London, who also made a podcast about the film.\n\nWhy Oppenheimer has important lessons for scientists today\n\nThe idea of space, time and parallel universes presented in the movie are fascinating, says Kai Liu, a materials physicist at Georgetown University in Washington DC. So is the concept “that you can go back in time and see the Universe with a different light”, he adds.\n\nInterstellar also inspired physicists’ group-watch events. Kunnawalkam Elayavalli was a PhD student at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, when the film came out, and saw it with her fellow students. “We took up a whole row in the movie theatre,” she says. “We were the most annoying people to watch that movie with.” Manuel Calderón de la Barca Sanchez, who studies heavy-ion collisions at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, told Nature that he, too, organized a group outing of scientists to see it.",

The device — which sports a 2.7-millimetre-wide printhead at the end of a long, flexible arm that moves like an elephant’s trunk — might one day assist physicians by delivering healing hydrogels after surgery.\n\nIn a report published on 29 October in the journal Device1, the researchers proved that the device could be fed through a physician’s surgical scope to deposit hydrogel onto an artificial set of vocal cords. “This is the first time I’ve seen a bioprinter that’s applicable to vocal folds,” says Ibrahim Ozbolat, a biomedical engineer at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. “Bioprinting typically addresses skin defects from the outside. Reaching a defect internally has been a challenge in the field.”\n\nAssisted healing\n\nAfter undergoing surgery to remove cysts or growths from their vocal cords, people sometimes have difficulty speaking because their vocal folds scar and become stiff. Studies have shown that injecting hydrogels — which can be shaped to mimic the vocal cords’ natural structure and support new tissue as it grows — boosts the healing process2. But surgeons have had a hard time delivering the biomaterials with precision because their view into the throat is limited.\n\nResearchers tested their tiny 3D bioprinter in a surgeon’s training simulator. The device is shown snaking through a surgeon’s ‘scope’ from the left to deposit hydrogel onto artificial vocal cords (pink) on the right.Credit: Swen Groen\n\nSwen Groen, a biomedical engineer at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, wondered whether the natural world might offer a solution to this problem. Perhaps a soft robotic arm that moved like an elephant’s trunk could be miniaturized to aid surgeons without blocking their view?\n\nGroen and his colleagues first designed a prototype that was 8 millimetres in diameter. Then, they shrunk the design to fit more easily through the one-centimetre-wide scope that surgeons use for operations, and demonstrated that it could precisely deliver dollops of hyaluronic-acid-based hydrogels to fill in gaps in artificial vocal folds, which are normally used for surgical training. “Working on the miniaturization has taken the majority of the time,” Groen says.\n\nLevelling up",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models can perform as well as humans on law exams when answering multiple-choice, short-answer and essay questions (A. Blair-Stanek et al. Preprint at SSRN https://doi.org/p89q; 2025), but they struggle to perform real-world legal tasks. Some lawyers have learnt that the hard way, and have been fined for filing AI-generated court briefs that misrepresented principles of law and cited non-existent cases. The same is true in other fields. For example, AI models can pass the gold-standard test in finance — the Chartered Financial Analyst exam — yet score poorly on simple tasks required of entry-level financial analysts (see go.nature.com/42tbrgb).\n\nHow should we test AI for human-level intelligence? OpenAI’s o3 electrifies quest\n\nWhenever assessments measure the intended skill inaccurately, it is considered a proxy failure. For example, a lawyer who scored A+ on an exam would be expected to avoid the kinds of error that an AI tool with a similar score might make in a real-world scenario. Better tests are urgently required to help guide the use of AI in complex, high-stakes situations.\n\nOne promising idea emerged in March at an Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence workshop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: through extensive interaction, a specialist can tell whether an AI system genuinely understands or is merely imitating understanding.\n\nImagine an AI model attempting to ‘pass’ an interview with an acclaimed legal scholar such as Cass Sunstein at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Sunstein’s expert probing would be a better measure of the model’s legal knowledge than a standardized test or automatically scored benchmark. Passing the ‘Sunstein test’ would require an AI tool to display true legal mastery, being able to wade through ambiguity and contradiction, and not just answer multiple-choice questions or write an essay.\n\nOne might ask: why not simply test an AI model’s legal readiness with task-specific benchmarks, similar to those used in medicine for checking an AI tool’s ability to take notes for a physician? The goal, however, is not to test an AI tool’s ability to perform a specific legal task, or even a long list of them, but to test whether it has general-purpose legal knowledge that it can exercise systematically when performing any task.\n\nWhy evaluating the impact of AI needs to start now\n\nI am not suggesting that Sunstein, or any single authority, should be appointed as the arbiter of AI expertise. The goal is to build systems that leading legal specialists broadly agree demonstrate genuine, trustworthy legal knowledge. A ‘robo-lawyer’ would need to cope in a diverse range of interviews with panels of experts — ranging from tax and constitutional lawyers to clerks, traffic officers and legal-aid workers. Such an approach would reduce issues around individual or ideological bias and avoid the trap of AI models merely mimicking one person’s style.\n\nCould a machine reach human levels of expertise, subtlety and ethics? Only specialists can say. But imagine a US Supreme Court justice grilling an AI robo-lawyer in public. That would get everyone’s attention. It would be a spectacle much like multinational technology corporation IBM’s 2011 challenge on the US television quiz programme Jeopardy!. The company pitted its supercomputer Watson against human champions to demonstrate how far machine reasoning and natural-language processing had come.",

OpenFold3 uses proteins’ amino acid sequences to map their 3D structures and model how they interact with other molecules, such as drugs or DNA.\n\nThe tool still doesn’t have the same functionality as AlphaFold3, but “we wanted to get something out to the community as soon as possible”, says Woody Sherman, the consortium’s executive committee chair and chief innovation officer at the firm Psivant Therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts. The team hopes to use researcher feedback after the preview release to improve the model.\n\nFull release coming\n\nThe system was trained on more than 300,000 molecular structures and a synthetic database of more than 40 million structures. Developing it has cost US$ 17 million so far.\n\nWho will make AlphaFold3 open source? Scientists race to crack AI model\n\nUnlike AlphaFold3, which is available for restricted academic use, any researcher or pharmaceutical company can use OpenFold3. “It’s a big step forward in terms of the democratization of AI structural-biology tools,” says Sherman.\n\nThe preview release shares OpenFold3’s code with researchers and allows them to start using and testing it. Sherman says that the consortium team is still working on technical improvements to the system and is planning a full release in the coming months. “We’re close — and we think, with this last little bit of effort, we’re going to get fully to parity,” he says. “This is a way for folks to get a flavour of OpenFold3 and start integrating it into their workflows and start building tools and start providing feedback.”\n\n“I’m excited to test [OpenFold3] and see how [it] compares to existing models,” says Stephanie Wankowicz, a computational structural biologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nOpen-source models\n\nOpenFold3 is part of a wider push to develop open-source versions of AlphaFold3. These efforts began in May 2024, when London-based Google DeepMind launched AlphaFold3 without initially sharing its underlying code. Researchers criticized the private firm’s decision — and later, in November 2024, DeepMind made the AlphaFold3 code and model weights, or all the trainable parameters in an AI model, available to academics (they remain unavailable for commercial use).",

          "authors": "Rakhyun E. Kim, Peter Bridgewater",
          "abstract": "On 15 August in Geneva, Switzerland, a fifth round of negotiations towards a multilateral treaty on reducing plastic pollution collapsed. The chair announced that the committee had concluded its work — without producing a draft treaty. Governments had failed to agree on the proposed articles of the convention; no further negotiations were being suggested.\n\nThis failure reveals a weakness in all environmental treaty negotiations, whether new or existing ones: a consensus-driven process waters down action to the lowest common denominator. Only symptoms get addressed, not causes.\n\nHeatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies\n\nThe result is much action without impact. Yet this ineffective method continues — a situation we characterize as ‘institutional paralysis’. What’s needed is to make international organizations capable of imagining and doing things differently. That requires more research on politics and governance, and that institutions make better use of the knowledge generated by that research.\n\nTo overcome this paralysis, at least in the environmental arena, we propose establishing a standing process, mandated by governments, to evaluate the state of global environmental treaties and related bodies. Its role would be to assess their fitness, both individually and collectively; identify what is and is not working and why; and provide actionable recommendations to the United Nations for reforming them.\n\nFrozen institutions\n\nInternational environmental institutions resemble deer frozen in headlights: acutely aware of an impending crisis, yet incapable of meaningful movement. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change elevates urgency, but even implementing its current pledges fully would fall short of avoiding dangerous climate change1. The Convention on Biological Diversity sets ambitious conservation targets for protected areas, yet expanding the zones offers little defence against an intensifying local and global extinction of species caused by climate change2.\n\nThese are not merely failures of ambition. They are design flaws. The implementation of existing policies, however robust, is insufficient to confront the scale and complexity of today’s polycrisis3.\n\nStates now have a legal duty to prevent climate harm — justice is in reach\n\nThe result is institutional paralysis: a persistent incapacity of environmental institutions to act, adapt or achieve stated objectives despite sustained procedural activity. Like the Red Queen in Alice through the Looking Glass, paralysed institutions run in place just to stay put. Trapped in cycles of action without impact, movement persists but purpose dissolves.\n\nThe rational response to paralysis would be to acknowledge it and seek support. Yet most institutions resort to symbolic gestures to maintain the appearance of relevance. In July in Zimbabwe, after months of discussions, the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands agreed on a strategic plan that mostly reaffirmed 20-year-old decisions. The International Whaling Commission projects the illusion of progress, framing resolved issues such as widespread whaling as ongoing to justify the body’s continued activity4.\n\nOthers choose to gamble. The London Convention and its 1996 Protocol on marine pollution have opened the door to marine geoengineering, including fertilization of the ocean with iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth and, increasingly, measures to enhance ocean alkalinity to increase carbon dioxide absorption5. Although such interventions would carry huge, clearly identified risks to the marine environment, they are still being considered as potential responses to climate change.\n\nThis reflects a broader dynamic: institutions are navigating trade-offs between various risks, in ways that endanger the very object that they seek to conserve, and undermine their own effectiveness in saving it.\n\nDiagnosing institutional paralysis\n\nInstitutional paralysis arises when organizations are confronted with circumstances that exceed their original purpose, authority or capability. Take, for example, climate change. Today’s climate is in much worse shape than when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992, arguably exceeding the body’s capacity to manage responses. Scientific knowledge about our planet is abundant and expanding and institutions are increasingly overloaded with information.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nGroups of scientists have tried to issue ‘warnings to humanity’6, but after initial brief attention, the warnings go unheeded. And concerns are spiralling faster than UN conventions can keep up with. For example, the study of climate change involves not only the natural sciences, but also, increasingly, social sciences — adding further angles, such as justice, to the discussions7. Yet deteriorating social issues are an outcome of the acceleration of global warming, which further stretches the climate agenda. Ineffectiveness then breeds more problems, while resources remain stagnant. As a result, public confidence in the climate convention erodes, reinforcing the sense of paralysis.\n\nAlready-overburdened institutions are also strained by accelerating anthropogenic pressures that fall outside their mandates. Today, much of this spillover stems from climate change8. For example, the World Heritage Convention lists 51 marine sites in its protected areas, including 29 coral reefs — which looks good on paper. However, it lacks the authority to address climate-driven threats to coral reefs, such as ocean warming and acidification. Although there is a great deal of science available to assist with evaluating impacts on heritage, geopolitical realities hold more sway on which sites are accepted and added to the list9.\n\nThe complex reasons why institutions tread water are revealing. Limited capacity is one factor. Most international environmental institutions are chronically under-resourced10. Climate change is often more politically salient than biodiversity and tends to receive most of the funding11. For example, the Cali Fund for supporting the sharing of genetic resources, which was launched amid excitement in February at the resumed 16th biodiversity Conference of the Parties (COP16) in Rome, is struggling to reach its targets.\n\nMinisters met in May to set directions for negotiations at COP30 in Brazil in November.Credit: Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nGeopolitical dynamics further exacerbate the problem of fundraising for the conventions, and tend to favour climate over biodiversity, despite the nexus between them. The behaviours of major powers such as the United States, Russia, China and the European Union shape outcomes of multilateral negotiations. Sometimes, countries with economies that rely heavily on oil and natural gas act as deliberate blockers. Contestation between countries with different socio-economic and political circumstances also deepens institutional paralysis.\n\nEven when they lack capacity and resources, most institutions continue to project an image of progress and preserve the appearance of hope rather than acknowledge failure and close. Like all entities composed of people, they are inherently political. Admitting the failure of institutions into which so much has been invested, without viable replacements, is seen as carrying too great a political (and psychological) risk.\n\nMany institutions are also entrenched in the ecomodernist paradigm12; they often choose to pursue technological fixes, such as carbon capture or extensive monoculture afforestation, as the path of least resistance. Yet such fixes often lead to more problems.",

          "abstract": "Elkhorn coral off the coast of Key Largo, Florida. Credit: Sam Hodge/Alamy\n\nTwo years after a record-setting heatwave, scientists have confirmed that two iconic corals that have flourished across Florida’s 560-kilometre-long reef for more than 10,000 years are now ‘functionally extinct’ off the state’s southern coast.\n\nBoth the elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) and staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) survive in tanks and scattered locations across Florida’s reefs, but a study published today in Science suggests that their long-standing role as the primary reef builders off the coast of Florida has come to an end: so few remain that they can no longer play a functional part in the ecosystem1.\n\n“This ecosystem is forever transformed,” says study co-author Ross Cunning, a coral biologist at the John G. Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, Illinois. That does not mean scientists are giving up hope on either species, he says, but what scientists and conservationists do from now on “needs to fundamentally change”.\n\nBoiling ocean\n\nOver the past few decades, Florida’s corals have been hit repeatedly by bleaching events, which occur when rising water temperatures cause corals to expel the symbiotic algae that provide them with nutrients and colour. But the 2023 heatwave, which coincided with record temperatures that drove bleaching around the globe, hit Florida earlier, faster and harder than anything scientists had seen before.\n\nCoral die-off marks Earth’s first climate ‘tipping point’, scientists say\n\nOcean temperatures registered above 31 °C for nearly 41 days — up to 4 degrees above normal in places. This created heat exposures on the reef that were two to four times higher than previous records. Although many corals survived the event, mortality among Acropora corals ranged from 98–100% across much of the reef, from Dry Tortugas National Park in the west through the Florida Keys to the east. In the area off the coast of Miami, and farther north, more than 60% of the corals survived.\n\nThe 2023 heatwave was the nail in the coffin not just for Acropora corals, but also for more than two decades of conservation work that has focused mainly on raising these corals in laboratories and then planting them back in the ocean, says Ken Nedimyer, technical director at Reef Renewal, a conservation organization in Tampa, Florida. Most of the corals that the organization has raised and planted over the past two decades are now dead. So, Nedimyer says his team’s efforts are now shifting towards other types of corals that have survived the bleaching events, such as brain and star corals, while also working to preserve the genetic diversity of Acropora corals and to breed those rare individuals that survived.\n\n“We still have some great [Acropora] corals to work with,” Nedimyer says, and there is already evidence that such breeding efforts can help the corals to adapt and withstand future heatwaves. “We just haven’t done it at a big scale yet.”",

Using a nationally representative, online and offline-integrated dataset of a Generation Z cohort in China, we provide large-scale evidence on the determinants of success in attracting attention. Our findings reveal that ‘how you express yourself’ (using various emojis and expressing multiple emotions) is more influential than ‘who you are’ (in terms of gender, education, family background and personality traits) in attracting attention on social media. Further analysis confirms a causal effect of the variety of emojis and types of emotions on attracted attention, while simulation processes using agent-based models suggest that empathy evocation is the primary underlying mechanism. We also show that the mode of expression is largely independent of individual characteristics and that the attention gained from highly appealing expressions is easier to acquire than to sustain, as it is highly sensitive to changes in expression modes over time. Overall, our research identifies three key features of attention capital allocation on social media: low alignment with traditional resources, considerable manipulability and ease of acquisition but difficulty sustaining it over time.",

          "abstract": "HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is transforming global HIV prevention, but its implementation coincides with observations of rising bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates among men who have sex with men, raising questions about whether PrEP is preventing one epidemic while facilitating others. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, we developed a minimal dynamical model of the simultaneous transmission of HIV and chlamydia (as an example of a curable STI). The model integrates three key mechanisms: 1) risk-mediated self-protective behavior, 2) reduction in condom use among PrEP users, and 3) PrEP-related asymptomatic STI screening. We show that these mechanisms can generate a “testing paradox:” True STI prevalence may decline while observed trends rise. This paradox emerges because increased PrEP uptake amplifies screening intensity, which can lower transmission but simultaneously inflate detection. By systematically mapping the parameter space of PrEP uptake, screening frequency, and risk perception, we identify broad and plausible conditions under which the paradox arises. Our findings reconcile conflicting epidemiological evidence and remark that the net effect of PrEP on STI dynamics depends critically on asymptomatic screening strategies. These results highlight the potential dual role of PrEP programs in reducing both HIV and bacterial STI incidence, while emphasizing the need to align screening and treatment policies to maximize benefits and minimize risks, e.g., antimicrobial resistance.",

Traditional methods for evaluating the power of national scientific ecosystems, however, often overlook the nuances of a country’s global influence. In this perspective, we introduce a framework that highlights shifting power dynamics in international scientific collaborations, focusing on whether leadership positions in international scientific teams are moving from one country to another. Using rich sociological data from nearly 6 million scientific publications, we document a marked shift in team leadership from Western countries to China. In particular, the share of team leaders involved in U.S-China scientific collaborations that were affiliated with Chinese institutions grew from 30% of the total in 2010 to 45% in 2023. We further explore the implications of China’s rise by forecasting when Chinese scientists are projected to achieve parity in leadership vis-à-vis the United States, including in 11 critical technology areas that are focal points of technological development, and by analyzing how a potential decoupling of U.S.-Chinese science might affect Chinese scientific leadership. We conclude by considering the impacts of China’s growing investments in the training of young scientists in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative.",

However, although human search behavior has existed since the beginning of civilization, not much is known about human search patterns, particularly regarding strategies that yield higher efficiency. Although most humans no longer need to gather and hunt in the wild, human searching remains prevalent in modern times. A common example of human searching is performed by taxi drivers looking for passengers in a city. Here, we analyze GPS data of taxi drivers in three major cities over different time periods and find that when drivers search for passengers, the higher is their efficiency, the slower is their searching, and they tend to make more short-distance turns during the search. Our study further indicates that individuals are characterized by a specific level of efficiency, and thus, efficient drivers are consistently efficient across different days as they follow their own search strategies. Interestingly, only about 10% of drivers adopt the most efficient strategy, earning nearly 20% more than the average driver. Our findings shed light on human search behavior, a fundamental aspect of human decision-making in competitive and fast-paced environments.",

In a nationwide survey across China, we investigated the presence, sources, health risks, and drivers of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and potential pathogens in discarded cigarette butts. Shotgun metagenomic and full-length 16S ribosomal rRNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that cigarette butts harbored significantly higher abundances of ARGs and bacterial pathogens than plant litter or soil. Health risk assessment further showed that cigarette butts carried ARGs with greater mobility, clinical relevance, and pathogenic potential. Genomic analyses highlighted enrichment of ARG-carrying pathogens, particularly Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas , with mobile genetic elements and oxidative stress responses as key contributors. Functional assays, including plasmid transfer, transcriptomic profiling, and single-cell Raman spectroscopy, demonstrated that cigarette butts promoted horizontal gene transfer and upregulated key ARGs (e.g., mexE , mexF , cfrC ) under stress conditions. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed biofilm formation on cigarette fibers, supporting enhanced bacterial persistence. Source-tracking analyses identified both human oral and environmental sources of the enriched ARGs and pathogens in cigarette butts. Finally, socioeconomic factors such as lower gross domestic product (GDP), reduced education, and poor sanitation were strongly associated with elevated ARG and pathogen risks. Collectively, our findings identify cigarette butts as overlooked yet potent vectors of ARG and pathogen dissemination in urban green spaces, underscoring the need for targeted interventions within a One Health framework.",

To this end, we combine data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) with Norwegian register data to estimate the interaction between measures of children’s predisposition to education and school quality. We use MoBa’s genetic data to compute polygenic indices for educational attainment ( PGI EA ). Importantly, MoBa includes genetic data on mother-father-child trios, allowing us to identify causal genetic effects using within-family variation. We calculate school value-added measures from Norwegian register data, allowing us to causally estimate school quality effects. Leveraging the advantages of both data sources, we provide a causally identified study of gene–environment interactions in the school context. We find evidence for substitutability of PGI EA and school quality in reading but not numeracy: A 1 SD increase of school quality decreases the impact of a 1 SD increase of PGI EA on reading test scores by 6%. The substitutability arises through gains of students at the lower end of the PGI EA distribution. This suggests that investments in school quality may help reduce educational inequalities arising from genetic differences between students.",

          "abstract": "The origins of CpG islands (CGIs) are not known. They are relatively short GC-rich regions of DNA with a higher-than-expected occurrence of CpG dinucleotides compared to most of the genome. They constitute less than 1% of the human genome but harbor approximately 40% of all transcription start sites (TSSs). CGIs are usually modulated by histone modifications in somatic cells or, in a minority of cases, permanently silenced by CpG methylation. Those that do not have TSSs are called “orphan CGIs”. Here, we show that CGIs containing TSSs almost never contain any of three major classes of transposable elements (TEs) and orphan CGIs rarely do. We hypothesize that CGIs persist across evolutionary time due to counterselection against TE insertion in the germ line. The 99% of the vertebrate genome, which is not CG rich, contains 60% of TSSs and putative enhancers. We postulate that conversion of an ancestral CpG-rich genome into the current CpG-depleted version present in vertebrates may also have allowed reversible DNA methylation to function in complex and dynamic gene control circuits. Therefore, we propose an evolutionary model in which vertebrate TEs are indirectly responsible for the existence of CGIs, and the formation of regulatory elements such as TSSs and enhancers that can potentially utilize dynamic DNA methylation for gene control.",

          "abstract": "Highly polymorphic allorecognition systems have been characterized in numerous invertebrate species, and exhibit discriminatory capabilities reminiscent of vertebrate adaptive immunity. As these systems utilize germline encoded receptors, the mechanisms underlying allelic discrimination are unknown. The invertebrate chordate, Botryllus schlosseri, undergoes a natural transplantation reaction controlled by a highly polymorphic, polygenic locus (called the fuhc) with over 1,000 allelic haplotypes found worldwide. Two individuals are compatible if they share one or both fuhc alleles, and we had found that polymorphic discrimination is due to the integration of signals from two allorecognition receptors encoded within the fuhc locus, called fester and uncle fester. Here we show that these two receptors are members of an extended family consisting of &gt;35 genes, now called the Fester family ( FF ), and coexpressed with members of another diverse gene family, the fester coreceptors ( FcoR ). Both FF and FcoR are Immunoglobulin superfamily members and each FcoR encodes conserved tyrosine signal transduction motifs, including ITIMs or hemITAMs. FF and FcoR are expressed and encoded as cognate pairs in two polymorphic haplotypes: one within the fuhc locus, and another on a separate chromosome, and remarkably, copy number variation between haplotypes is of gene pairs. Furthermore, two FcoR genes can swap ITIMs and hemITAMs by alternative splicing, suggesting that dynamic tuning of activating and inhibitory signaling is required for allelic discrimination. These results indicate that conserved signal processing mechanisms are the foundation of both allelic discrimination in Botryllus , and recurring convergent evolution of allorecognition receptors observed from invertebrates to mammals.",

Here, we investigated metabolic adaptation strategies of macrophages to glucose deprivation using stable isotopic tracing. Lactate production was decreased, potentially indicating a reduction of glycolysis. In contrast, the contribution of glutamine to the tricarboxylic acid cycle via α-ketoglutarate and reductive carboxylation were increased. Moreover, gluconeogenesis, the reverse pathway of glycolysis, was activated in glucose-deprived macrophages, proceeding partially to the generation of glycolytic intermediates and glycerol-3-phosphate. The partial gluconeogenesis pathway was abrogated in human and murine macrophages lacking the initial gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2, mitochondrial isoform). Partial gluconeogenesis was higher in anti-inflammatory, interleukin-4-stimulated compared to proinflammatory, interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Single-cell analysis and immunostaining revealed expression of PCK2 in macrophages from both lung cancer and normal lung. Low glucose conditions only partially modulated macrophage phenotypes, leading to reduced CD80 surface marker levels in proinflammatory, and enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor expression in anti-inflammatory macrophages. Our study reveals partial gluconeogenesis in glucose-deprived macrophages and shows that this versatile type of immune cells exhibits remarkable metabolic flexibility.",

When otters were extirpated by paleohumans, modern humans, or killer whales, urchins proliferated, reduced kelp forests to “urchin barrens,” and species-rich assemblages of fishes and invertebrates were lost. These losses affected seals, eagles, sea gulls, fishes, and sea stars that depended on these prey as well as adjacent habitats that had been nourished by exported kelp production. Jim’s research became the poster child for keystone species, trophic cascades, and the critical role of predators in structuring ecosystems. Similar discoveries followed in freshwaters, forests, and grasslands.",

          "abstract": "Hippocampal degeneration is a feature of both normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Prior to macroscopic degeneration, microstructural changes occur such as demyelination, iron deposition, or subtle atrophy, which can be characterized in vivo using MRI. We topographically mapped measures of microstructure and macrostructure across the unfolded surface of the hippocampus in 224 healthy older adults at risk for AD (aged 57 to 87) and 37 younger adults (aged 18 to 37). We describe three spatial regions of unique structural covariance between four parameters sensitive to microstructural tissue properties (R1, MTsat, R2*, PD) and macrostructure (surface thickness), with high convergence with previous spatial segmentations. We demonstrate both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of microstructure with healthy aging across the lifespan, AD pathological hallmarks, genetic risk, and cognition. These associations had subtle variations across different spatial areas of the hippocampus. We report associations between age and qMRI measures sensitive to macromolecular concentration (R1, MTsat) and paramagnetic susceptibility (R2*), consistent with mechanisms of demyelination and increased iron deposition as key hallmarks of the aging hippocampus and in presymptomatic stages of AD. qMRI measures did not explain more variance in delayed recall than global PET measures, suggesting variation in cognitive performance in aging and incipient AD is influenced by factors beyond hippocampal microstructure. We demonstrate the utility of quantitative MRI to provide greater insight into hippocampal health compared to typical macrostructural measures through “in vivo histology,” opening a window to understanding neuropathological mechanisms in the earliest stages of age- and disease-related neurodegeneration.",

The genetic basis of hybrid male incompatibility has long remained elusive. Here, we show that crosses of Caenorhabditis nigoni males with C. briggsae females result in insufficient expression of Cbr-xol-1 , an X-linked master switch responsible for intimately linked sex determination and dosage compensation pathways, consequently triggering aberrant X-chromosome repression in males, and ultimately leading to embryonic inviability. In contrast, male embryos from the reciprocal cross maintain normal expression level of C. nigoni xol-1 genes, consistent with their viability. We further demonstrate that the cis-regulatory regions of Cbr-xol-1 and Cni-xol-1 have functionally diverged. Finally, X transcription is also aberrantly repressed in lethal hybrid male embryos from crosses between gonochoristic species C. latens and C. remanei . Our results suggest an evolutionary scenario in which incompatibility of the dosage compensation system leads to reproductive isolation.",

          "abstract": "The soft corals (Cnidaria, Octocorallia), a diverse group of colonial marine invertebrates, can reversibly tune their body stiffness in response to external stimuli. This capability is attributed to their dynamic skeletal systems, which consist of thousands of mineralized skeletal elements, called sclerites, embedded within a gel-like matrix that swells/deswells and unjams/jams the sclerites, thus modulating skeletal stiffness. While sclerite morphology is widely used for species identification, its role in the mechanical performance of a soft coral’s skeletal system is largely unknown. Here, we investigated structure-jamming relationships in sclerite-based skeletal architectures using the red gorgonian octocoral Leptogorgia chilensis as a model system. The sclerites of L. chilensis exhibit a shaft-like geometry with two axial branches and two sets of triradiate side branches, which are aligned with the crystallographic symmetry of the constituent magnesium-containing calcite. By combining multiscale three-dimensional (3D) structural characterization, parametric geometrical modeling, 3D printing, mechanical testing, and discrete element simulations, we demonstrate how sclerite geometry achieves a balanced jamming performance in terms of stiffness, weight, strength, and fracture resistance in comparison to alternative geometries parametrically modified from the native sclerites (e.g., changes in the length and number of side branches). We also found that these performance metrics are achieved through the effective interlocking among side and axial branches, which is further enhanced by the fractal-like microscopic spikes on the branch tips. The findings in this natural jamming system offer insights for designing synthetic mechanotunable material architectures for a wide range of applications, from soft robotics to mechanical dampeners.",

          "abstract": "Tau aggregation into amyloid fibrils is linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The molecular processes driving aggregation in disease are still being uncovered, highlighting the need for innovative tools to study aggregation reactions. Here, we introduce FibrilPaint1 as a tool to measure the size of Tau amyloid fibrils in fluids, from early aggregation stages to mature fibrils. FibrilPaint1 is a 22mer peptide with exciting properties: i) FibrilPaint1 binds fibrils with nanomolar affinity; ii) it also binds to precursors, down to a size of only 4 layers; iii) it does not bind to monomers; iv) it is fluorescently labeled, which allows monitoring and localizing interactions; v) FibrilPaint1 recognizes various Tau fibrils, including patient-derived fibrils from AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD); vi) it also binds to fibrils from amyloids derived from Amyloid-β, α-synuclein, and huntingtin vii) FibrilPaint1 is selective for the amyloid state and does not have background binding to amorphous aggregates, blood serum, or cell lysate. In combination with flow-induced dispersion analysis (FIDA), a microfluidics technology, we determined the molecular size of amyloid fibrils with submicroliter sample volumes. This setup acts as a molecular ruler at layer resolution—we determined Tau fibril length from 4 to 1100 layers in solution. This is an interesting parameter for molecular studies in dementia, with potential for diagnostic applications.",

          "abstract": "For many families severely affected with breast cancer, no inherited causal allele has been detected in any tumor suppressor gene. In an effort to understand the genetics underlying breast cancer in these families, we evaluated 136 such families for coinheritance of breast cancer with each of 79 common variants reported as high-confidence “risk alleles” for breast cancer by meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. Simulations based on allele frequencies and family structures revealed one (and only one) of these 79 variants to cosegregate with breast cancer in the families significantly more frequently than expected by chance. This variant (rs2046210) is located 180 kb proximal to ESR1 , encoding the estrogen receptor alpha. Reporter assays in MCF7 cells revealed enhancement by the genomic segment at this site of activity of ESR1 promoters, but no difference in effect among alternative haplotypes. In contrast, the 600 kb genomic region including ESR1 and rs2046210 harbored 11 rare variants, each of which cosegregated with breast cancer in one or a few families. For 9 of these 11 variants, reporter assays indicated significant allele-specific effects on ESR1 promoters, with the breast-cancer-linked allele of each variant yielding higher promoter activity. At the site with the most striking effect, the breast-cancer-linked allele was associated with increased binding by transcription factor AP2-gamma TFAP2C in both MCF7 and T47D cells. These results demonstrate coinheritance with breast cancer of rare alleles that increase activity of ESR1 promoters, and suggest that rare ESR1 regulatory alleles may contribute to inherited predisposition to breast cancer.",

          "abstract": "Background: In early atherosclerosis, circulating Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) crosses the endothelium by transcytosis. This involves caveolar uptake of LDL by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and requires the protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1). We identified mediators of LDL transcytosis by isolating membrane microdomains enriched in caveolin-1 from human coronary endothelial cells (HCAECs) treated with LDL and performing mass spectrometry. One of the proteins identified was myosin-9 (MYH9). Methods: Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was conducted to measure LDL transcytosis by HCAECs. We measured LDL transcytosis in vivo in mice lacking endothelial MYH9 (EC- Myh9 −/− ). Atherosclerosis studies were also performed in EC- Myh9 −/− deleted of hepatic LDLR via (adeno-associated virus, AAV)-CRISPR. Additionally, we performed analysis of human transcriptomic data. Results: Gene ontology analysis in human aortic endothelial cells suggested a role for MYH9 in exocytosis. Both knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition of MYH9 inhibited LDL transcytosis. MYH9 depletion caused an accumulation of LDL-containing vesicles at the base of the cell; overexpression caused an increase in LDL exocytosis. EC- Myh9 −/− mice accumulated less LDL in the aortic arch after acute injection with LDL. To investigate the role of MYH9 in atherosclerosis, we deleted hepatic LDL in EC- Myh9 −/− mice using AAV-CRISPR and fed them a high-fat diet. The aortic arch and root of AAV-CRISPR; EC- Myh9 −/− mice exhibited smaller plaques. Human transcriptomic data showed greater messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of aortic MYH9 in atherosclerotic aortas compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: Lipid raft proteomics identified MYH9 as a regulator of LDL transcytosis. MYH9 is required for endothelial LDL exocytosis and contributes to early atherosclerosis.",

Commun. 2 , 503–517 (2022)]. LMNA depletion promotes R-loop accumulation, transcription-replication conflicts, replication stress, DNA breaks, and micronuclei formation. Mechanistically, LMNA deficiency disrupts nuclear pore complex organization, specifically reducing phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-nucleoporin incorporation, resulting in impaired RNA export and nuclear retention of RNA. LMNA expression is repressed by EZH2 and reexpressed during SCLC differentiation from neuroendocrine (NE) to non-NE states, and low LMNA levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes. These findings establish LMNA as a key regulator of nuclear transport and genome integrity, linking nuclear architecture to SCLC progression and therapeutic vulnerability.",

This study investigates how β -drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter’s polar regions, we constrain the cyclones’ deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter’s north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter’s enigmatic polar cyclones.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions have significantly increased in recent decades due to enhanced agricultural activities, contributing to global air pollution. While the effects of NH 3 on surface air quality are well documented, its influence on particle dynamics in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) and related aerosol impacts remain unquantified. NH 3 reaches the UTLS through convective transport and can enhance new particle formation (NPF). This modeling study evaluates the global impact of anthropogenic NH 3 on UTLS particle formation and quantifies its effects on aerosol loading and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) abundance. We use the EMAC Earth system model, incorporating multicomponent NPF parameterizations from the CERN CLOUD experiment. Our simulations reveal that convective transport increases NH 3 -driven NPF in the UTLS by one to three orders of magnitude compared to a baseline scenario without anthropogenic NH 3 , causing a doubling of aerosol numbers over high-emission regions. These aerosol changes induce a 2.5-fold increase in upper tropospheric CCN concentrations. Anthropogenic NH 3 emissions increase the relative contribution of water-soluble inorganic ions to the UTLS aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 20% and increase total column AOD by up to 80%. In simulations without anthropogenic NH 3 , UTLS aerosol composition is dominated by sulfate and organic species, with a marked reduction in ammonium nitrate and aerosol water content. This results in a decline of aerosol mass concentration by up to 50%. These findings underscore the profound global influence of anthropogenic NH 3 emissions on UTLS particle formation, AOD, and CCN production, with important implications for cloud formation and climate.",

We found that the long isoform of PRC2 accessory subunit PHF19, PHF19L, was highly expressed in advanced prostate cancer that promoted the tumor progression and hormonal therapy resistance. Mechanistically, PHF19L was recruited to the m 6 A modified nascent RNA through YTHDC1 and formed a liquid-like YTHDC1-PHF19L condensate that pulled the EZH2 away from chromatin, resulting in reduced H3K27me3 deposition and the activated expression of EZH2-repressed genes.

There are a growing number of powerful forecasting methods that fall into two broad categories-empirical models that extrapolate from historical data, and mechanistic models based on fixed epidemiological assumptions. However, these methods often underperform precisely when reliable predictions are most urgently needed-during periods of rapid epidemic escalation. Here, we introduce epimodulation, a hybrid approach that integrates fundamental epidemiological principles into existing predictive models to enhance forecasting accuracy, especially around epidemic peaks. When applied to empirical and machine learning forecasting methods (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Holt-Winters, gradient-boosting machines, Prophet, and spline models), epimodulation improved overall prediction accuracy by an average of 12.3% (range: 8.5 to 18.7%) for COVID-19 hospital admissions and by 32.9% (range: 24.2 to 43.7%) for influenza hospital admissions; accuracy during epidemic peaks improved even further, by an average of 27.9% and 43.8%, respectively. Epimodulation also substantially enhanced the performance of complex forecasting methods, including the COVID-19 Forecast Hub ensemble model, demonstrating its broad utility in improving forecast reliability at critical moments in disease outbreaks.",

          "abstract": "In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), hyperactivated microglia produce inflammatory mediators that contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein expressed in many cell types, including neurons and microglia, plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis via its secretase-mediated processing to release the C-terminal 99-residue transmembrane fragment (C99) that is further cleaved to yield amyloid-β peptides. Voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1) have been implicated in microglial activation and release of inflammatory mediators, but the potential role of these channels in human microglia and AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia (iMG) express native Hv1 channels with biophysical and pharmacological attributes determined by their coassembly with APP and that APP knockdown decreases Hv1 currents, suppressing cytokine and reactive oxygen species release. In HEK293T cells, APP is shown to increase current by favoring channel opening at more negative membrane potentials. C99 is sufficient to assemble with Hv1 and alters channel function even more significantly than APP. Coimmunoprecipitation, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, and altered pharmacology further demonstrate that C99 forms stable complexes with Hv1 in the plasma membrane. In addition, we find that two early-onset AD mutations in APP (E682K and D694N) that reside within C99 significantly increase voltage-dependent channel activity beyond that induced by wild type C99, rationalizing their enhanced mediation of neuroinflammation.",

Both species exhibited key biases commonly observed in humans during numerical estimation tasks: scalar variability (increasing response variability with numerosity), regression to the mean (overestimation of small and underestimation of large numerosities), and a sequential effect (estimates biased toward previous trial numerosities). Traditionally, these biases have been attributed either to static influences of overall task history or to dynamic effects from recent trials. Here, we demonstrate that a Bayesian model incorporating dynamic priors based on multiple previously encountered numerosities can account for all observed behavioral patterns. Our findings suggest that numerical judgments in both species are shaped by uncertainty and the integration of recent experience, revealing shared Bayesian-like mechanisms for cognitive biases across distantly related animals.",

          "abstract": "Soil salinization has emerged as a significant challenge for crop production worldwide. Xylem adjustments through plastic development and sodium unloading from root xylem, as mediated by sodium transporter HKT1, both play crucial roles in controlling sodium transport and salt tolerance in plants. Here, we report that XYLEM NAC DOMAIN 1 (XND1) of Arabidopsis contributes to the coordination of these two processes during salt stress responses. XND1 is predominantly accumulated in roots under salt exposure and confers plant salt tolerance, as demonstrated by analysis of overexpression and loss-of-function mutant lines. XND1 mediates discontinuous root protoxylem differentiation under salt stress, potentially limiting sodium transport. In addition, XND1 directly targets and activates the expression of HKT1 , thereby facilitating the removal of sodium from root xylem. We also show that MYBS2, a MYB transcription factor, interacts with XND1 to antagonistically regulate HKT1 , whereas VND-INTERACTING 2 (VNI2), a NAC transcription factor, activates XND1 in response to salt stress. Characterization of the XND1 ortholog of rice suggests a conserved regulatory role under salt stress. Collectively, our findings unveil an XND1-centered regulatory network that modulates salt stress response, through the integration of root xylem developmental plasticity and sodium unloading.",

Moving beyond traditional distinctions between single- and multishot devices, our approach provides rigorous criteria for determining when measurements can truly resolve individual laser shots rather than statistical averages. By contextualizing single measurements, this framework shows that single-shot capability is not an intrinsic device property but emerges from the relationship between measurement precision and predictability. Implementing this approach with a custom measurement device at the ATLAS-3000 petawatt laser, we provide quantitative uncertainty bounds on pulse front tilt and curvature. Notably, we observe that our Bayesian method reduces uncertainty by up to 60% compared to traditional approaches. Through this analysis, we reveal how the interplay between measurement precision and intrinsic system variability defines achievable resolution-insights that have direct implications for applications where precise control of laser–matter interaction is critical.",

          "abstract": "The Permian–Triassic (P-Tr) transition (~252 Ma) witnessed Earth’s most severe biocrisis, which has long been linked to Siberian Traps volcanism and associated environmental upheaval. Major perturbation of the global carbon (C) and sulfur (S) cycles is mainly inferred from marine δ 13 C and δ 34 S records, whereas few existing terrestrial records link δ 34 S fluctuations to widespread dispersal and fallout of volcanogenic sulfate aerosols. Mounting evidence, however, reveals that the collapse of P-Tr terrestrial ecosystems was diachronous, questioning a hypothesized globally synchronous common forcing. Here, we present records of pyritic multiple-S isotopes (δ 34 S py and Δ 33 S) and bulk organic δ 13 C for a paleotropical peatland drill core (HK-1) from Southwest China. The δ 34 S py variations define three distinct phases with a notable decline in δ 34 S py across the P-Tr transition, suggesting substantially elevated terrestrial sulfate influx coincident with major carbon cycle perturbation. Notably, overall small positive Δ 33 S values (+0.01 to +0.12‰) rule out a dominant role for stratospheric sulfates. Collectively, the observed changes in δ 13 C org , δ 34 S py , and Δ 33 S support catastrophic collapse of the Cathaysian Flora leading to intensified weathering and sulfate release. This inferred event, slightly after the P-Tr marine extinction, postdates by several 100-ky terrestrial floral collapse and perturbation of the C–S cycles documented in the high-latitude Sydney Basin. Cross-latitudinal diachroneity of terrestrial ecosystem collapse and consequent C–S perturbation challenges the hypothesis of a single, global volcanic driver. Rather, regional deforestation and its cascading effects overprinted on the global perturbations of biogeochemical cycles emerge here as critical factors shaping Earth’s largest recorded crisis.",

          "abstract": "Malaria parasites infect red blood cells where they digest host hemoglobin and release free heme inside a lysosome-like organelle called the food vacuole. To detoxify excess heme, parasites form hemozoin crystals that rapidly tumble inside this compartment. Hemozoin formation is critical for parasite survival and central to antimalarial drug activity. Although the static structural properties of hemozoin have been extensively investigated, crystal motion and its underlying mechanism have remained puzzling. We used quantitative image analysis to determine the timescale of motion, which requires the intact vacuole but does not require the parasite itself. Using single particle tracking and Brownian dynamics simulations with experimentally derived interaction potentials, we found that hemozoin motion exhibits unexpectedly tight confinement but is much faster than thermal diffusion. Hydrogen peroxide, which is generated at high levels in the food vacuole, has been shown to stimulate the motion of synthetic metallic nanoparticles via surface-catalyzed peroxide decomposition that generates propulsive kinetic energy. We observed that peroxide stimulated the motion of isolated crystals in solution and that conditions that suppress peroxide formation slowed hemozoin motion inside parasites. These data suggest that surface-exposed metals on hemozoin catalyze peroxide decomposition to drive crystal motion. This work reveals hemozoin motion in malaria parasites as a biological example of an endogenous self-propelled nanoparticle. This mechanism of propulsion likely serves a physiological role to reduce oxidative stress to parasites from hydrogen peroxide produced by large-scale hemoglobin digestion during blood-stage infection.",

Here, we investigate the specialized bacterial pouch, a symbiont-containing organ present exclusively in adult workers of Tetraponera nigra -group ants, revealing its crucial role in colony-wide nutrient provisioning. Using a combination of microscopy, amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, and 15 N-urea feeding experiments on four species in the group, we show that its adult-specific pouch-associated microbiota, primarily Tokpelaia , recycle nitrogen from urea and convert it into amino acids which are provisioned to adult workers and developing larvae. Disruption of this nitrogen-recycling symbiosis severely impairs larval growth and overall colony fitness. Our results show how caste-restricted microbial organs can centralize metabolic functions at the colony level, challenging individual-centric paradigms of host–microbe mutualism and providing insights into the pivotal role of microbial symbionts in superorganismal adaptation to nutritional constraints.",

Periodontitis is a prevalent, male-biased disease characterized by inflammation-driven bone loss, yet the mechanism(s) of this sex bias is unknown. This study explored whether enhanced inflammasome represents a causal mechanism for this bias. Analyses of three separate human studies (&gt;6,200 samples) show that males have significantly higher IL-1β in the gingival crevicular fluid than females during health and periodontitis. This pattern is experimentally reproduced with different versions of the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model where males show greater IL-1β secretion than females. The inflammasome drives bone resorption in males but not females as revealed by analyses of inflammasome gene-deletion mice. Pharmacologic treatment with a caspase-1/4 inhibitor reduces inflammatory cell infiltration, dampens osteoclastogenesis signaling (via the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway), and prevents bone resorption in males but not females during experimental periodontitis. While ovariectomized females show no change in their nonresponsiveness to caspase-1/4 inhibition, orchiectomized males no longer respond to the inhibition, suggesting the importance of an intact male reproductive system in the mediation of this inhibition. Thus, our study identifies inflammasome activation as causal for male-biased experimental periodontitis and supports sex-stratified studies to foster future advancement of inflammasome therapeutics in periodontics.",

          "abstract": "Enhancers regulate gene expression by physically contacting their target promoters, yet these contacts often span large genomic distances. Phase-separated condensates (droplet-like clusters) of transcription factors (TFs) are thought to facilitate such long-range enhancer–promoter (E-P) communication, but the quantitative principles underlying this mechanism remain unclear. Here, we use polymer-based chromatin simulations to systematically vary the strength of TF clustering and the E-P genomic distance, examining their combined effects on E-P contact formation. We find that E-P contact frequency shows a nonmonotonic dependence on the degree of TF clustering: Contact frequency peaks at an intermediate TF abundance and TF–TF affinity, leading to a “golden mean” optimum. Two distinct regimes emerge: Under weak TF–TF attraction, contact probability increases with condensate size, whereas strong TF attraction produces a peaked response that declines at high condensation levels. These results indicate that TF condensate acts as a tunable “rheostat,” buffering E-P interactions against increasing genomic distances. However, excessive TF clustering leads to molecular crowding and competition that ultimately impair E-P communication. Our study, consistent with recent experiments, establishes a mechanistic framework at the molecular level, where balanced TF condensation enables robust long-range E-P communication, reconciling the stochastic nature of chromatin dynamics with the fidelity of gene regulation.",

The recent review by the US Food and Drug Administration of a single, prefilled syringe of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine has highlighted the importance of this question. While dynamic light scattering is well suited for measuring average particle sizes across populations, fundamental principles behind scattering limit the resolution to distinguish subtle differences at the tens of nanometer scale between similar samples. To address this, we introduce an alternative approach: stochastic electrochemistry, which allows for the investigation of specific properties of individual particles, one at a time. By introducing an electrochemically active species, hexacyanoferrate(II/III) into the vaccine solution, we observe discrete current drops when particles irreversibly collide with a microelectrode. Such events can be correlated directly with particle size. As a proof of concept, we use this technique to analyze the interactions of streptavidin-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) beads with biotinylated bovine serum albumin at vaccine-level concentrations and apply what we learned to the components of the SHINGRIX™ vaccine. We then present a time-trial comparison of data from current commercial SHINGRIX™ vaccines using dynamic light scattering and stochastic electrochemistry, analyzing the AS01 B adjuvant alone and the AS01 B adjuvant combined with the glycoprotein E (gE protein). While our method elucidates important properties at the single adjuvant level, our results paint a quantitative kinetic picture of coformulation stability that is currently not achievable by dynamic light scattering.",

O -Glucose glycans are transferred to serine residues located between the first and second conserved cysteines within the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats in the Notch extracellular domain. Previously, O -glucose glycans were shown to be extended to a trisaccharide structure with two xyloses via α1-3 linkages. Our recent studies, however, indicated that the O -glucose glycan on NOTCH1 EGF10 can be extended by hexose and Neu5Ac. Here, we demonstrated that this hexose- and Neu5Ac-extended glycan has a 3’-sialyllactose-like structure synthesized by specific members of two isoenzyme families, B4GALT1 and ST3GAL4. Using mass spectrometry, we identified this modification exclusively on NOTCH1 EGF10 and the analogous NOTCH3 EGF9 domain, with no detection in any other EGF domains in NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and NOTCH3. Sequence comparison and mutagenesis experiments identified one amino acid at position -2 of the fourth cysteine (C 4 -2) in the EGF domain as crucial for the galactose elongation of O -glucose glycans. We further demonstrated that this site-specific elongation of O -glucose on NOTCH1 EGF10 significantly impacts ligand binding and signal transduction of NOTCH1. In the context of early T cell development, the C 4 -2 mutants NOTCH1 A396Y and A396F enhance T cell differentiation through DLL1- and DLL4-dependent NOTCH1 signaling.

DAG can be enzymatically transformed into phosphatidic acid (PA) and accumulated at the PM. PYK2 N-terminal domain-interacting receptor 2 (Nir2) mediates the formation of ER–PM membrane contact sites (MCSs) by specifically recognizing PA at the PM and directly interacting with ER membrane protein vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins (VAPs). The N-terminal phosphatidylinositol transfer protein domain of Nir2 facilitates PI/PA exchange at ER–PM MCSs to maintain PI and PA levels. Here, we reveal the mechanisms by which Nir2 senses phosphatidic acid (PA) and associates with membranes, based on three crystal structures of its C-terminal Lipin/Ned1/Smp2 (LNS2) domain bound to PA, the diphenylalanine [FF]–containing acidic tract (FFAT) motif complexed with vesicle-associated membrane protein–associated protein B/C (VAPB), and the Asp-Asp-His-Asp (DDHD) domain. The C-terminal LNS2 domain of Nir2 directly interacts with the phosphate in the headgroup of PA via hydrogen bonds involving S1025, T1065, K1103, and K1126. Formation of a salt bridge between E355 in Nir2 and R55 in VAPB is essential for Nir2 FFAT–VAPB interaction. The central DDHD domain of Nir2 forms a twofold symmetric dimer, and this self-association contributes to stable and tight membrane association. These findings reveal how Nir2-mediated ER–PM MCS formation maintains continued PI(4,5)P 2 -dependent PLC signaling.",

We found that these peptides can be applied in a native fungal system such as the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum , to control hyphal chemotropism and reduce plant root penetration. Additionally, we utilized YeMaP in a one-pot assay to investigate how abiotic factors influence the communication of multiple pheromone–GPCR combinations and found that the cell–cell communication mediated by the GPCR Ste2 from F. oxysporum signaled robustly across different abiotic factors, while other fungal GPCR–pheromone interactions were more sensitive to changes.

While posttranslational modifications facilitate aberrant activation of bypass signaling networks, the specific contribution of ZDHHC palmitoyl acyltransferase-mediated palmitoylation remains poorly characterized. Here, ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation contributes to osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Patient samples, along with in vitro and in vivo functional studies, indicated that ZDHHC11 upregulation reduces the sensitivity of tumor cells to osimertinib by promoting malignant phenotype. Mechanistically, we establish AXL receptor tyrosine kinase as the critical substrate. ZDHHC11 catalyzes AXL palmitoylation at Cys869, inducing plasma membrane retention and constitutive activation. This triggers downstream PI3K–AKT signaling, with AXL knockout alleviating the effect of ZDHHC11-driven resistance. Crucially, pharmacological inhibition ZDHHC11-mediated palmitoylation with the broad-spectrum palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate effectively augmented the antitumor effects of osimertinib. Collectively, ZDHHC11 regulates osimertinib resistance in a palmitoylation-dependent manner. Targeting the ZDHHC11–AXL axis may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osimertinib-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with high ZDHHC11 expression.",

However, the effects of prenatal maternal inflammation (PNMI) on offspring hippocampal microstructure in humans remain unclear. Here, we examined the relationship between exposure to PNMI and neurite density in the hippocampus and its subfields among offspring during late middle age. Participants included 72 mother–offspring dyads from the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS) cohort. Data for four inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA], and soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor-II) were available from first- and second-trimester maternal sera. Neurite density in the offspring hippocampus and its subfields was estimated using microstructural modeling of offspring’s diffusion-weighted MRI data (mean age of offspring at imaging = 59 y; 51% male). We estimated the relationship between each biomarker and region-of-interest’s neurite density. Higher first-trimester maternal IL-1RA and IL-6 levels were associated with lower offspring hippocampal neurite density. These relationships were specific to the Cornu Ammonis 3, Cornu Ammonis 4, dentate gyrus, and subiculum subfields. In addition, higher second-trimester IL-6 was associated with lower subiculum neurite density. Our findings reveal that exposure to heightened prenatal levels of maternal inflammation is linked to altered offspring hippocampal microstructure in late middle age, which could have implications for memory decreases during this period and may be relevant for understanding the risk of aging-related cognitive changes.",

          "abstract": "Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are vital neurotransmitter receptors that are key therapeutic targets for neurological disorders. Although the high-resolution structures of these channels have been elucidated, capturing their dynamic conformational transitions remains challenging due to the transient nature of intermediate states. In this study, we investigated a prokaryotic proton-gated pLGIC, GLIC. In our cryo-EM data at pH 4.0, we identified and segregated asymmetric particles, which we precisely aligned to resolve high-resolution structures of several previously unresolved asymmetric intermediate states, in addition to symmetric closed and open states. Detailed structural analysis revealed systematic conformational changes at individual subunits driving the channel opening. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to assign the functional states. We further examined the roles of the F116 and Y251 residues, located at the domain interface, playing a central role in interdomain communication. In addition, patch-clamp experiments on GLIC I240A and L241A mutants, located in the M2 helix, demonstrated their importance in channel gating. Together, these results shed light on the sequential and asymmetric conformational transitions that occur during GLIC activation, offering a deeper mechanistic understanding of asymmetric gating in pLGICs.",

When bulky or heavy sample environment is required state-of-the-art X-ray imaging techniques, such as scanning and full-field microscopy or holography fail to deliver high-resolution imaging capabilities due to either i) extremely small optics’ working distance for magnification-based methods or ii) the inability to precisely control heavy sample position in the case of lens-less methods. In this work, we address those challenges for a scanning lens-less imaging method called ptychography. Instead of precisely controlling the sample position during raster scan in a focused, confined X-ray beam, we are scanning that beam across the sample. This overcomes the constraints on scanning procedure imposed by sample size/weight and delivers unmatched scanning speed while maintaining high precision of beam position during the scan. We directly applied our approach, showcasing phase contrast nanoimaging with diamond anvil cells, and visualized intricate details of the melting and oxidation of laser-irradiated iron under pressure of 50 GPa.",

          "abstract": "Animals respond to sensory stimuli with motor actions, which in turn generate new sensory inputs. This sensorimotor loop is constrained by time delays that impose a trade-off between responsiveness and stability. Additionally, as the relationship between a motor command and the corresponding sensory feedback is context-dependent, the response must be adapted in real time. It is generally believed that this adaptation process relies on an internal model that is continuously updated through prediction error minimization. Here, we experimentally reveal an alternative strategy based on a simpler feedback mechanism that does not require any internal model. We developed a virtual reality system for the miniature transparent fish Danionella cerebrum that enables in vivo brain-wide imaging during fictive navigation. By systematically manipulating the feedback parameters, we dissected the motor control process that allows the animal to stabilize its position using optic flow. The sensorimotor loop can be fully described by a single delay differential equation, whose solutions quantitatively capture the observed behavior across all experimental conditions. Both behavioral and neural data indicate that the observed adaptive response arises from logarithmic nonlinearities at the sensory (Weber–Fechner law) and motor (Henneman’s size principle) ends. These fundamental properties of the nervous system, conserved across species and sensory modalities, have traditionally been interpreted in terms of efficient coding. Our findings unveil a distinct functional role for such nonlinear transformations: ensuring stability in sensorimotor control despite inherent delays and sensory uncertainty.",

A fully integrated approach that includes curiosity-driven exploration of phage biology, the development of integrated and inclusive research-education programs based on phage discovery and genomics (SEA-PHAGES), and the advancement of phage therapeutics provides a holistic structure for advancing the field. The phages of mycobacteria illustrate this model and a large mycobacteriophage collection reveals the enormous diversity of phages infecting a single bacterial strain and illuminates the evolutionary mechanisms giving rise to genomes with mosaic architectures. A set of 2,600 fully sequenced and annotated mycobacteriophage genomes and the development of tools for engineering them with desirable properties enable phage therapies for treating Mycobacterium infections for which antibiotics frequently fail. Technological advances in synthetic genomics and structural biology promise to rapidly advance this field and powerfully stimulate developments in all aspects of bacteriophage investigation and application.

Injury induces SerpinB3 expression in vitro and in vivo in the migrating epidermal tongue; overexpression of the protein promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition–like changes. Recombinant Serpinb3a, the mouse ortholog, enhances re-epithelialization in vitro and accelerates wound closure and collagen remodeling in vivo.

Following intradermal infection, JEV crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and reaches target cells in the brain parenchyma. However, the cellular dynamics and pathological niches involved in JEV neuroinvasion remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the early stages of JEV infection in the mouse brain employing a highly multiplexed spatial transcriptomics platform to map viral RNA and host gene expressions in intact brain sections at a single-cell resolution. Although JEV RNA was undetectable in brain sections at 1-day postinfection (dpi), innate immune responses were transiently activated across the brain. At 4 dpi, we detected limited viral RNA and mapped its spatial distribution, identifying glial cells surrounding microvessels as early targets of brain infection. We further characterized transcriptional changes in infected and surrounding bystander cells, revealing cell-type–specific antiviral responses. Notably, JEV neuroinvasion led to the downregulation of endothelial tight junction genes, indicative of an early event that precedes BBB impairment during subsequent disease progression. Our spatial transcriptomic analysis provides insights into cell-type– and region-specific responses to JEV infection, and highlights the early role of glial cells in shaping the immune response landscape of the brain. These findings greatly improve our understanding of JEV pathogenesis before the onset of clinical encephalitis.",

It affects the reproductive transition in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the significant vectors of numerous devastating human diseases. Here, we show that E93 is essential for maintaining metabolic homeostasis during the reproductive cycle of mosquitoes. E93 deficiency led to insufficient production of insulin-like peptide 3 (ILP3) from insulin-producing cells in the brain, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), a key regulator in the insulin signaling pathway. This reduction facilitated the nuclear translocation of FoxO and enhanced the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which in turn respectively activated the transcription of genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) during gluconeogenesis and reduced glycogen synthesis. Further insulin rescue and the luciferase activity assays demonstrated that E93 directly inhibited PEPCK transcription. Ultimately, E93 -depleted mosquitoes exhibited systemic metabolic reprogramming, characterized by the dysregulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Our findings establish that E93 orchestrates metabolic homeostasis by coordinating the insulin signaling cascade and directly regulating PEPCK expression, thus providing an intrinsic connection between endocrine signaling and E93-mediated reproduction in mosquitoes.",

In contrast, clinically used drugs demonstrated comparable effects on both commensal and noncommensal strains. Consistent with the in vitro results, the selected gold(I) complex induced favorable changes in the intratumoral and gastrointestinal microbiomes in vivo. Furthermore, its anticancer efficacy was found to be dependent on the composition of microbiome and correlated with the production of short-chain fatty acid bacterial metabolites. Structure–activity relationship studies have dissected the contribution of each structural component in both the in vivo efficacy and microbiome-modulating properties. Transcriptomic analysis of tumors revealed microbiome-associated gene signaling pathways. These findings provide valuable insights for future research on microbiome-modulating anticancer drugs, presenting potential avenues to optimize cancer treatment outcomes and mitigate side effects such as gastrointestinal dysbiosis.

A frontier of this field is designing cell-permeable multifunctional ligands that contain fluorophores in combination with affinity tags or pharmacological agents. This is challenging since attachment of additional chemical moieties onto fluorescent ligands can adversely affect membrane permeability. To address this problem, we examined the chemical properties of rhodamine-based self-labeling tag ligands through the lens of medicinal chemistry. We found that the lactone–zwitterion equilibrium constant ( K L–Z ) of rhodamines inversely correlates with their distribution coefficients (log D 7.4 ), suggesting that ligands based on dyes exhibiting low K L–Z and high log D 7.4 values, such as Si-rhodamines, would efficiently enter cells. We designed cell-permeable multifunctional HaloTag ligands with a biotin moiety to purify mitochondria or a JQ1 appendage to translocate BRD4 within the nucleus. We found that translocation of BRD4 to constitutive heterochromatin in cells leads to apparent increases in transcriptional activity. These fluorescent reagents enable affinity capture and translocation of intracellular proteins in living cells, and our general design concepts will facilitate the design of multifunctional chemical tools for biology.",

Extreme isotope enrichment is observed moving from base to stem tip. δ 18 O values range from −8.3‰ at the base to 82.6‰ at the tip. Δ′ 17 O values range from 0 to −1,797 per meg. The δ 18 O and Δ′ 17 O values are the most extreme measured for any terrestrial material and expand the known range of Δ′ 17 O values by fivefold for mass-dependent fractionation on Earth. The extreme isotope enrichments are explained using a hybrid evaporation/chain-of-lakes model, allowing us to refine the leaf respiration coefficient to θ k = 0.511 ± 0.001. This new value is required to explain the low Δ′ 17 O values previously measured in desert plants and animals and is critical when using fossil samples for paleoclimate reconstruction. Coexisting phytoliths and stem water were also measured. The 1000 ln 18 α silica-water value at the plant base (35.89‰) appears to be in isotopic equilibrium, with far smaller fractionations of 10.3‰ near the tip. The smaller fractionations at higher levels are explained by continual silica deposition as the plant elongates and the δ 18 O values of each segment become higher. The overall integrated phytolith value is a combination of early and late silica growth. The Δ′ 17 O silica − Δ′ 17 O water values are not in equilibrium, explained by a kinetic isotope effect, with a λ value of 0.5205 vs. 0.5244 for equilibrium. Phytolith isotope values may lead to erroneous interpretations for paleoclimate reconstruction.",

The TP53 tumor suppressor gene, encoding the p53 protein, is the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer, and TP53 mutations are associated with diminished tamoxifen response and worse prognosis for breast cancer patients. Here, we report that in breast cancer cells p53 and ER cooperate to regulate the transcription of a set of genes encoding chromatin modifiers. The net result is a global increase in H3K4me3 and decrease in H3K9me3 chromatin marks. The resultant “open” chromatin is associated with increased transcription of luminal cell identity genes and enhanced tamoxifen sensitivity.

Monocytes isolated from the blood of PDR patients or under high glucose conditions exhibited heightened glycolytic activity and elevated histone lactylation levels, particularly H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la). Knockout of hexokinase 2 ( Hk2 ) in myeloid cells led to reduced H4K8la and POSTN levels and inhibited RNV. Exogenous exosomal POSTN partially reversed the angiogenic defects caused by Postn or Hk2 deletion in myeloid cells. Mechanistically, exosomal POSTN stabilized hypoxia-inducible factor -1 alpha and upregulated the expression of angiogenic genes. Notably, treatment with metformin reduced RNV by decreasing monocyte glycolysis and lowering exosomal POSTN levels.

The study of how these inclusions influence material fields has driven critical advances across multiple disciplines, from composite materials and solid-state physics to biomechanics and geophysics. Eshelby revolutionized this field with the equivalent inclusion method (EIM), transforming inhomogeneous problems into homogeneous ones by introducing an equivalent eigen-strain. However, determining Eshelby’s equivalent eigen-strain for arbitrary inclusions has remained a long-standing challenge. Here, we resolve this challenge and applied the EIM to multiphysics problems, deriving three-dimensional universal exact solutions in Fourier space for the generalized equivalent eigenfield, encompassing eigen-strain, eigen-electric, and eigen-magnetic fields. These solutions apply to both single and multiple inclusions of arbitrary shape, inhomogeneity, and anisotropy. Our results yield exact expressions for the effective properties of magnetoelectroelastic composites. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility through complex multiphase applications, including a general expression for stress intensity factors of arbitrarily shaped cracks, a criterion for designing auxetic materials via engineered elastic inhomogeneities and an optimized pathway to enhance magnetoelectric coupling. This work establishes a universal approach to multiphysics inhomogeneous inclusion problems, rooted in multiple disciplines and spanning multiple length scales.

However, efficiently exciting, manipulating, and detecting magnons remains a critical need. We show that magnons, despite their charge-neutrality, can induce electric polarization through their spin and orbital moments. This effect is governed by system symmetry, magnon band hybridization, and interactions with other quasiparticles. We calculate the electric polarization induced by magnons in two-dimensional collinear honeycomb and noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs), showing that the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction yields a finite net electric polarization. In NiPSe 3 , a collinear honeycomb AFM with Zigzag order, the induced net electric polarization is about three orders of magnitude greater than in MnPS 3 , a collinear honeycomb AFM with Néel phase. In the noncollinear AFM KFe 3 (OH) 6 (SO 4 ) 2 , the net electric polarization can be tuned via magnon hybridization, which can be controlled by external magnetic fields. These findings reveal that electric fields could be used to both detect and manipulate magnons under certain conditions by leveraging their spin and orbital angular moment.

          "abstract": "Speciation often results from the accumulation of reproductive isolation associated with lineage divergence, but secondary contact between diverged lineages can reshape the trajectory of speciation and reveal its underlying processes. The Indonesian island of Sulawesi is a tectonically complex island formed by the fusion of many paleo-islands, resulting in replicated cases of secondary contact among once-isolated lineages. Unlike secondary contact on continents where hybridization often results from unpredictable range shifts, Sulawesi’s fauna presents a replicated set of geologically constrained natural experiments to test how the magnitude of evolutionary divergence predicts outcomes of secondary contact and hybridization. Using thousands of genome-wide loci from Eutropis sun skinks spanning Wallace’s Line on Sulawesi and Borneo, we reconstructed a reticulate evolutionary history shaped by overwater dispersal, isolation, island fusion, hybridization, and character displacement. We delimited five distinct species (three undescribed) and uncovered multiple ancient hybridization events following island fusion leading to distinct outcomes. These outcomes—speciation reversal, parapatry, and sympatry putatively through reproductive character displacement—were associated with increasing levels of prior divergence consistent with evolutionary theory. Sympatry, specifically, was preceded by substantial introgressive hybridization and body size divergence that likely confers reproductive incompatibility. Together, these results provide empirical support for divergence-dependent tipping points along the speciation continuum. The sun skink radiation also includes a rare instance of reverse colonization of Borneo across Wallace’s Line that established a narrowly divergent species with a uniquely intermediate body size absent from Sulawesi.",

          "abstract": "RNAs are major drivers of phase separation in the formation of biomolecular condensates and can undergo protein-free phase separation in the presence of divalent ions or crowding agents. Much remains to be understood regarding how the complex interplay of base stacking, base pairing, electrostatics, ion interactions, and particularly structural propensities governs RNA phase behavior. Here, we develop an intermediate resolution model for condensates of RNAs (iConRNA) that can capture key local and long-range structural features of dynamic RNAs and simulate their spontaneous phase transitions with Mg 2+ . Representing each nucleotide using 6 to 7 beads, iConRNA accurately captures base stacking and pairing and includes explicit Mg 2+ . The model not only reproduces major conformational properties of poly(rA) and poly(rU) but also correctly folds small structured RNAs and predicts their melting temperatures. With an effective model of explicit Mg 2+ , iConRNA successfully recapitulates experimentally observed lower critical solution temperature phase separation of poly(rA) and triplet repeats, and critically, the nontrivial dependence of phase transitions on RNA sequence, length, concentration, and Mg 2+ level. Further mechanistic analysis reveals a key role of RNA folding in modulating phase separation as well as its temperature and ion dependence, besides other driving forces such as Mg 2+ –phosphate interactions, base stacking, and base pairing. These studies also support iConRNA as a powerful tool for direct simulation of RNA-driven phase transitions, enabling molecular studies of how RNA conformational dynamics and its response to complex condensate environments control the phase behavior and condensate material properties.",

Thus, there is enormous interest in elucidating the biosynthetic pathways that are responsible for the production of these compounds. Identification of the genes that comprise these biosynthetic pathways has been enabled by gene-to-metabolite networks that are generated from transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. Recent advances in both single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell mass spectrometry metabolomics (scMS) have enabled the measurement of either gene expression or metabolite levels in individual cells. However, these datasets can only be used to indirectly correlate gene expression levels with metabolite concentrations at the single-cell level. In this proof-of-concept study, performed on cells derived from the leaves of the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus , we demonstrate that both scRNA-seq and scMS can be applied to the same plant cell, thereby enabling direct comparisons between gene expression and metabolite levels. Protoplasts are sorted into 96-well plates using a microfluidics-based robot and then lysed under conditions that are suitable for both scMS and SMART-seq single-cell protocols. This multiplexing approach reveals both qualitative and quantitative correlations between metabolite levels and biosynthetic gene expression in individual cells.

The region has been considered a potential refugium for Neanderthals before their replacement by Homo sapiens . However, no genetic data have been obtained from any of these late Neanderthals, some being inaccessible or badly preserved. Starosele is a notable site which has undergone excavations in recent years. We used collagen peptide mass fingerprinting (Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry, ZooMS), to screen for potential human remains among thousands of fragmented bones from the site. Of the 150 bone fragments we analyzed, 97.3% had sufficient collagen preservation for taxonomic identification. Our results suggest Paleolithic humans primarily hunted horses. One ~5 cm bone fragment yielded peptide mass fingerprints matching Hominidae . Radiocarbon dating revealed an age range of 46 to 45,000 y old, close to the transition from the disappearance of Neanderthals to the dispersal of H. sapiens in western Europe. We sequenced a twofold coverage mitochondrial genome from this bone, indicating the individual belongs to the Neanderthal lineage. The mitogenome clusters with other Neanderthal mitogenomes previously generated from the Russian Altai region. Alongside this, an analysis of the lithic corpus from both regions suggests that a wider Neanderthal dispersal, linked to the Micoquian stone tool industry, occurred after ~60,000 y ago. We assessed the paleoclimate connection (temperature and precipitation) between these locations and identified a high habitat suitability corridor along 55°N, suggesting that the long-distance movement of Neanderthals would have been facilitated by periods of favorable climate.",

Intriguingly, a divergent PBP paralog (PBP4) in noctuid moths has been identified exhibiting predominant expression in the male reproductive system, though its functional significance remained elusive. In this study with Spodoptera exigua , we demonstrated that PBP4 is specifically expressed in male accessory glands (MAGs) and transferred to females during copulation. CRISPR-mediated PBP4 knockout (PBP4 −/− ) significantly reduced male reproductive success via impaired sperm competition, evidenced by diminished offspring sired. Transcriptomic and qPCR analyses revealed expressional correlation between PBP4 and the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco), and similar sperm competition deficits were observed in Orco −/− males. Furthermore, both mutants exhibited compromised sperm motility and reduced sperm transfer from spermatophores to spermathecae. In vitro sperm motility assays showed that a specific agonist of Orco, VUAA1, robustly enhanced sperm motility in an Orco-dependent manner. Analyses of four additional moth species, including noctuids and non-noctuids, revealed a similar specific expression in the male reproductive tracts in all of them. Our findings unveil a noncanonical role for PBP4 in reproductive fitness and evolutionary conservation of the PBP-OR signaling pathway.",

          "abstract": "Serial order memory, a key type of episodic representation, requires the encoding of map–like context information (interitem relationships) to facilitate recall. In rodent models, both spatial and nonspatial order memory depend heavily on the hippocampus. However, in humans, lesional and neurophysiological data also implicate extrahippocampal areas, especially the orbital frontal cortex and medial parietal regions, in these mnemonic abilities. To investigate the neurophysiological mechanisms of order information in human memory, we used direct brain recordings from hippocampal–cortical circuits as neurosurgical patients performed a serial recall task. Our unique dataset included simultaneous acquisition of data from the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate regions. Focusing on ripple events, we demonstrate distinct interregional dynamics during successful order memory encoding using temporally precise, simultaneous recordings across these circuits. The relative timing of co-rippling events implicates theta oscillations in cross-regional integration, particularly between the hippocampus and PCC, and we show that ripple rate, but not ripple duration, is correlated with the quantity of encoded order information. Notably, we find evidence for theta phase coding of serial position for early list items. We link our findings with computational and anatomical models of episodic memory processing as well as general theories of temporal binding facilitated by co-rippling events. These results point toward complementary mechanisms for order representation across hippocampal circuits and suggest the potential of anatomically specific approaches for neuromodulation that alter mnemonic neurophysiology.",

          "abstract": "Precise and accurate geochronology is essential for reconstructing Earth’s history and coeval life evolution. The Early Triassic was a critical time interval following the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction, recording remarkable biotic changes and a series of environmental and climatic upheavals. Its geochronology remains, however, rather poorly constrained and highly debated. Here, we present high-precision zircon U-Pb dates for four ash beds from the Induan in South China, along with carbon isotope data. We use coupled Bayesian eruption age and Bayesian age–depth models to estimate the ages of our ash beds and to reinterpret the published ages of 25 ash beds from other four sections in South China, as well as to construct new age–depth models for each section. Our new age–depth models, integrated with biostratigraphic data, yield new age estimates for the following boundaries: Permian–Triassic (~251.867 Ma), Griesbachian–Dienerian (~251.562 Ma), Induan–Olenekian (~250.626 Ma), Smithian–Spathian (~249.236 Ma), and Olenekian–Anisian (~246.979 Ma). Calibration of the Early Triassic carbon isotopic record using the new age model reveals highly variable rates of individual carbon isotope excursions. For instance, the negative excursion across the Permian–Triassic boundary exhibits a rate of approximately −11.7‰ per 100 kyr—nearly seven times faster than the early Smithian negative excursion rate of approximately −1.7‰ per 100 kyr. This refined age model also provides a robust temporal framework to evaluate the tempo of biotic evolution in the aftermath of the Permian–Triassic mass extinction.",

Serum response factor (SRF) is a widely expressed transcription factor essential for mesenchymal cell growth and differentiation with noted roles in hormonal regulation of muscle tissues but little characterization in reproductive organs. Here, we reveal that endometrial SRF is dysregulated in human endometriosis and is critical for female reproductive success in mice through regulation of endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis identified decreased endometrial SRF expression in infertile endometriosis patient tissues. RNAi-based SRF knockdown in human endometrial stromal cells resulted in disrupted cytoskeletal structure, viability, and decidual response. Conditional Srf knockout mice (Srf d/d ) generated using the Pgr Cre were infertile with implantation failure, lack of decidual response, and development of severe endometrial fibrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified dramatic changes in Srf d/d endometrial cell populations including large-scale myeloid immune cell infiltration. Srf d/d stromal fibroblasts displayed aberrant cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix gene expression and downregulation of genes important for decidual growth response. Srf -deficient epithelial cells displayed the most prominent dysregulation, strongly overexpressing estrogenic innate inflammatory genes including C3 and Lcn2 and fibrogenic genes Mmp7 and Fbln1 , all of which paralleled patterns in human endometriosis patient data that we identified through comparative analysis using a published single-cell atlas.

Perception of environmental stressors like food scarcity often leads to physiological changes that promote survival and slow aging. However, recent work shows that perception of attractive food smells can block the health benefits of dietary restriction in multiple model organisms. While it is known that sensory perception and cell nonautonomous signaling can modulate health and longevity, our knowledge of the specific sensory cues and mechanistic pathways that define this signaling is still limited. Here we find that the sense of touch interacts with nutritional state to modulate lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans . Worms subjected to dietary restriction are shorter-lived when they perceive tactile stimuli that mimic bacterial food and/or protective soil. Touch modulation of dietary restriction requires putative mechanoreceptor proteins, the neurotransmitters dopamine and tyramine/adrenaline, and the neuropeptides INS-11 and GnRH. Ultimately, the touch circuit regulates the longevity effectors DAF-2/IGF1R and FMO-2/FMO5. These results establish a physiological touch circuit and connect neural reward pathways to the growth and reproductive axes. Finding that texture mechanosensation can modulate longevity suggests a role for touch in lifespan.",

In Aedes aegypti , CO 2 is detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in the sensory hairs (sensilla) on the maxillary palp. While the molecular mechanism and behavioral significance of CO 2 sensing have been well studied in mosquitoes, the nanoscale three-dimensional structures of their CO 2 -sensing ORNs and associated cells have remained unclear. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we characterize the CO 2 -sensing cpA neuron and its odor-sensitive neighbors, cpB and cpC, within the capitate sensilla of A. aegypti. Notably, cpA neurons are significantly larger, with an outer dendritic surface area 8 to 12 times greater than that of cpB and cpC neurons. This expanded CO 2 -sensing surface arises from its unique architecture, consisting of numerous flattened dendritic sheets folded into intricate lamellae. In contrast, cpB and cpC dendrites exhibit sparse, narrow cylindrical branches. Moreover, the cpA axon displays a prominent pearls-on-a-string morphology, with numerous mitochondria-rich, nonsynaptic varicosities connected by thin cables. Remarkably, a glial cell and an auxiliary cell together ensheathe the cpA soma but not cpB or cpC, suggesting a specialized role in supporting cpA function. Compared to Drosophila CO 2 -sensitive ORNs, a larger portion of the cpA outer dendrite is embedded within the sensillum cuticle, potentially improving access to environmental CO 2 . These findings reveal key morphological specializations of cpA neurons, thereby advancing our understanding of mosquito sensory biology and laying the groundwork for future studies on the molecular basis and functional ramifications of these anatomical adaptations.",

In this work, we employ experimental time-resolved small angle X-ray scattering to follow in real time the AMP-induced ion transport in lipid vesicles, while simultaneously resolving the membrane structure and peptide partitioning. For several natural AMPs, we show that they can effectively permeabilize the lipid membrane despite only binding peripherally to the outer membrane leaflet. Our experiments reveal rapid ion transport associated with AMP binding, yielding salt equilibration in a few tens of milliseconds, while not detecting evidence of transversal and structurally stable peptide pores. On the contrary, new analysis of previously reported all-atom molecular dynamics simulations shows that lipid flip-flop, accelerated by the peripherally bound peptides, leads to the formation of transient, ion-conducting water channels. A corresponding diffusional model indicates that such short-lived, transient pores explain the observed ion transport better than stable pores.",

However, neither the magnitude nor the distribution of CaCO 3 dissolution in the modern oceans is well constrained. Here we diagnose CaCO 3 dissolution rates in major oceanic regions and reconstruct CaCO 3 settling flux using a data-constrained ocean circulation model and observational climatologies of global seawater alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Our approach distinguishes the effects of ocean circulation and CaCO 3 dissolution on seawater alkalinity and dissolved oxygen, and involves only one free parameter, a restoring timescale, which is constrained by compiling carbonate export rates estimated in the literature. We find that CaCO 3 dissolution in shallow waters (above the saturation horizon of aragonite) is much smaller than some recent estimates. Excluding the upper 114 m of the euphotic zone, the fraction of CaCO 3 dissolution within aragonite saturated waters is only about 16.5 ± 5.5%. About 39.8 ± 4.5% of CaCO 3 dissolution occurs below the aragonite saturation horizon but above the saturation horizon of calcite. The remaining 43.7 ± 3.8% dissolves in the deep ocean in undersaturated seawater. These results suggest that the seawater CaCO 3 saturation state is the primary control on CaCO 3 dissolution in the ocean.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial cells are inherently contractile and in homeostasis, tissue integrity is maintained by balancing the uneven contractile forces in neighboring cells at the cell–cell interface. By contrast, epithelial cells can utilize an imbalance in contractile force to communicate various information to induce tissue-wide response as in wound healing. Contractility is generated and processed at the apical junctional complex (AJC) by the dynamic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Calcium signaling can pattern cellular responses based on its reach and amplitude and the actin cytoskeleton is supported by its wide ranging effects on actin regulators. Calcium transients regulate various cell behaviors associated with actin remodeling, such as in damage response and developmental morphogenesis. Here, we report that calcium maintains an adaptive pool of AJC-associated actin that is sensitive to tension and encoded by calcium dynamics. For this, the recently identified epithelial polarity module Homer-MUPP1/PatJ is required. Homer regulates calcium signaling in various tissue contexts through interaction with numerous components of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) calcium signal toolkit. Knockout of either Homer or MUPP1/PatJ attenuated tension-induced calcium response and severely disrupted wound healing migration, which is dependent on guidance input through AJC tension. We also show that Homer is integral to early embryonic neurodevelopment as its suppression causes failure of neural tube closure. Our findings highlight the critical role of localized calcium dynamics on AJC actin remodeling and cellular behavior, elucidating the means of tissue coordination through intercellular tension.",

Despite its ecological importance, Bd has lacked robust tools for genetic manipulation, limiting molecular insights into its development and pathogenicity. Here, we establish homologous recombination as a system for stable transformation of Bd , enabling targeted chromosomal integration of exogenous DNA, endogenous protein tagging, and targeted gene deletion. We use this system to visualize Bd infection in live amphibians to enhance understanding of host invasion and pathogenesis. We also use this system to test a previous hypothesis regarding the role of chitin synthases in Bd development by tagging the endogenous chitin synthase Myo17D and observing its rapid relocalization to the plasma membrane during de novo cell wall assembly. Finally, we use our homologous recombination approach for targeted gene deletion by knocking out the URA3 locus, and confirm the resulting genotype and phenotype via sequencing and drug resistance assays. This genetic transformation system offers a foundational tool for molecular studies of Bd , advancing our capacity to dissect molecular mechanisms of chytrid pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Circadian clocks form complex networks to orchestrate the behavior and physiology of animals. Elucidating the organization of these clock networks is critical to understanding how circadian clocks achieve robust timing. Clock neurons have been best characterized in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster . At the early stages of development, Drosophila has a clock network consisting of only nine neurons per hemisphere. This set of clock neurons consists of lateral and dorsal neurons and persists in the adult fly, in which the clock network is greatly expanded to a total of ~240 neurons. The function of the early-born lateral clock neurons is well established in the adult fly. They control morning and evening activity and are responsible for circadian rhythmicity under constant conditions. Only recent studies have begun to dissect the function of the dorsal clock neurons. Using clock rescue experiments, we show here that a functional clock in only four of them, the DN 1a , is sufficient to restore a bimodal locomotor activity pattern and rhythmic activity under constant conditions in the adult fly. This is achieved by CCHamide-1 signaling most likely to the lateral morning neurons, which are considered the main pacemakers of the clock, and by glutamate signaling to the lateral evening neurons. Interestingly, all the neurons involved are part of the early-born clock network, strongly suggesting that a core clock is already formed during early development. This set of clock neurons appears sufficient in the adult fly to drive the basal circadian activity pattern.",

          "abstract": "Current models frame the allocation of cognitive control as a process of expected utility maximization. The benefits of a candidate control signal are weighed against its costs (e.g., opportunity costs). Recent theorizing has found that, despite promoting the counterintuitive behavior of longer deliberation, which is less rewarding in the short term, it is nevertheless normative to account for the value of learning when determining control allocation. Here, we sought to test this proposal by examining whether people were willing to allocate greater control and thereby expend greater effort (e.g., deliberate for longer) when they perceived a task to be learnable compared to when they did not. We found that participants’ proficiency and learning rate in the first block of a simple perceptual dot-motion task were able to predict their willingness to deliberate in a second block. These findings support the hypothesis that agents consider learnability when allocating cognitive control, and comply with a formal model of control allocation that considers the future discounted value of learning on reward.",

          "authors": "Antai Tao, Sanyuan Fu, Rongjing Zhang, Junhua Yuan",
          "abstract": "Surface interactions play a crucial role in shaping the motility patterns and ecological adaptations of swimming bacteria. Previous studies have primarily focused on peritrichous bacteria like Escherichia coli , whose multiple flagella form a bundle during swimming, allowing them to remain trapped at surfaces for extended periods. However, this surface entrapment phenomenon varies significantly among different bacterial species, despite all fitting into the simplified theoretical models of pusher-type bacteria, suggesting that key factors remain unidentified. Here, we demonstrate that flagellar location is a critical determinant of surface entrapment stability in pusher-type bacteria. Using fluorescently labeled Pseudomonas aeruginosa , we show that cells with a single lateral flagellum exhibit substantially longer surface residence times compared to those with a single polar flagellum, despite similar cell morphology and swimming speeds. Through direct visualization of bacterial orientation angles relative to surfaces, we reveal that this difference results from the distinct bending directions of the flagellar hook—the flexible joint connecting the rigid filament to the cell body. The hook-generated torque resists reorientation differently depending on flagellar location, facilitating surface escape for polar-flagellated bacteria while enhancing entrapment for lateral-flagellated bacteria. Our findings highlight the previously overlooked importance of flagellar placement in bacterial surface interactions, providing insights for understanding microbial ecology and designing biomimetic microswimmers.",

          "abstract": "Altered β-amyloid (Aβ) homeostasis is a critical event triggering the shift from healthy aging to Alzheimer disease (AD) through the overproduction and impaired clearance of Aβ peptides. The Aβ-degrading enzymes (ADEs) are a collective group of proteases that normally promote clearance to counteract Aβ-induced neurodegeneration. We previously discovered that the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 is an atypical ADE that produces the nontoxic fragment Aβ34 by recognizing 40- or 42-residue-long Aβ peptides as substrates in vitro and in vivo. Here, we examined other known ADEs for their potential roles in degrading Aβ34, Aβ40, and Aβ42. By genetic, cellular, and pharmacological approaches, we identified and characterized endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1) in a human neuroblastoma cell line, human brain vascular pericytes, and primary rat cortical cultures as a major enzyme degrading Aβ34 but not Aβ40 or Aβ42. Notably, we found that ECE1 cleaves Aβ34, an indicator of amyloid clearance, to a unique and unusually stable Aβ20-34 fragment that has the potential to serve as a measurable biomarker. Biocomputational analyses from non-AD controls and individuals with AD pathology showed that the highest messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of ECE1 expression were found in pericytes (i.e., cells within the brain microvasculature that are known to produce Aβ34) compared to other cell types. Given Aβ34 is an indicator for prodromal AD, we postulate that our collective findings (i.e., generation of Aβ34 and Aβ20-34 intermediates within the “amyloidolytic” degradation pathway) will generate a set of biomarkers to detect amyloid clearance activity in vivo.",

          "abstract": "While practicing a new motor skill, resting for a few seconds can improve performance immediately after the rest. This improvement, referred to as “micro-offline gains” (MOGs), has been interpreted as rapid offline learning and is thought to be supported by neural replay of the trained movement sequence during rest. Here, we provide evidence that MOGs reflect only transient performance benefits, partially mediated by motor planning, and not offline learning. In five experiments, participants trained to produce a sequence of finger movements as many times as possible. When participants trained during 10-s practice periods, interleaved with 10-s rest periods, they produced more correct keypresses during training than participants who trained continuously without taking breaks. However, this benefit vanished within seconds after training, when both groups performed under comparable conditions, revealing similar levels of skill acquisition. This challenges the idea that MOGs reflect offline learning, which, if present, should result in sustained performance benefits, compared to training without breaks. Furthermore, we observed persistent MOGs even when participants produced random, nonrepeating sequences, indicating that MOGs do not relate to the offline consolidation of a sequence-specific memory. Rather, sequence-specific learning was only evident online, during practice. Finally, MOGs were diminished when participants could not preplan the first few movements of an upcoming practice period. Our results suggest that MOG are simply an effect of slowing during practice, combined with the possibility of preplanning the initial movements after rest, and therefore do not serve as a reliable metric for offline learning or skill-related consolidation.",

Here, we provide snapshots of putatively Miocene and Pliocene ice and air from shallow ice cores drilled in the Allan Hills BIA. The ice, dated using the deficit in 40 Ar in ancient air compared to the modern atmosphere, is stratigraphically complex. Nevertheless, surface temperatures inferred from water isotopes correlate with sample age and indicate 12 ± 2 °C of cooling in Antarctica between 6 Ma and the late Pleistocene. Basal ice is nearly devoid of gases and remains to be dated with existing methods. This undated ice is characterized by an isotopic temperature 5 ± 1 °C warmer than the oldest dated (6 million year old) sample. We speculate that this ice reflects surface snowpack or permafrost that was preserved by the growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet in the Middle to Late Miocene.",

In this Review, we examine the differences in functional traits that define each group’s distinctive role in the global carbon cycle and their sensitivity to climate change and ocean acidification. This synthesis reveals that a single representation of CaCO 3 in climate models is unlikely to accurately reflect system dynamics or their impacts on biogeochemical cycling under climate change.

After being trained on colored flowers with different reinforcements, bees that interacted with a conspecific in a positive affective state were quicker and more likely than controls to land on ambiguous colored flowers, indicating the transfer of a positive judgment bias between bees. Additional observations and experiments showed that affect could be transmitted between bees without physical contact, i.e., through visual modality alone. Our findings suggest that affective contagion may be an evolutionarily widespread mechanism present in both social vertebrates and social insects.",

However, evidence of publication bias suggests the latter should be interpreted with caution. Invader residence time emerged as a key predictor: Longer residence times intensified the negative effects of invasive plants on native diversity, whereas impacts on soil abiotic properties tended to weaken over time.

This cycle achieves large adiabatic temperature changes and high coefficients of performance. We identify effective salt-water pairs and validate the cycle experimentally, supported by thermodynamic modeling. Among these, ammonium nitrate is suited for refrigeration, while potassium nitrate is appropriate for air conditioning. The system uses abundant, low-cost materials, and its fluidic nature ensures efficient heat transfer and scalability. This work establishes dipolarcaloric cooling as a viable alternative for environmentally responsible refrigeration.",

          "abstract": "Shallow-water waves are a notable example of nonlinear hydrodynamics, giving rise to phenomena such as tsunamis and undular waves. These dynamics are typically studied in hundreds-of-meters-long wave flumes. In this work, we demonstrate a chip-scale wave flume, which exploits nanometer-thick superfluid helium films and optomechanical interactions to achieve nonlinearities surpassing those of extreme terrestrial flows. Measurements reveal wave steepening, shock fronts, and solitary wave fission—nonlinear behaviors predicted in superfluid helium but never directly observed. Our approach enables lithography-defined wave flume geometries, optomechanical control of hydrodynamic properties, and orders-of-magnitude faster measurements than terrestrial flumes. This approach combining quantum fluids and nanophotonics provides a platform to explore complex wave dynamics at the microscale.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that elongates telomeric DNA, ensuring germline immortality. In this study, we identified the Caenorhabditis elegans telomerase RNA component 1 ( terc-1 ), as the first known telomerase RNA expressed as an intronic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), embedded in an intron of germline–up-regulated gene nmy-2 . terc-1 undergoes splicing, polyadenylation, and nuclear RNA exosome–dependent maturation, stabilized by H/ACA small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins, thus co-opting the H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) biogenesis machinery. Mutations in terc-1 led to progressive telomere shortening and sterility in successive generations. Artificially transplanting the nmy-2 intron into the introns of germline-expressed genes but not non–germline-expressed genes restored germline immortality, highlighting the importance of genomic context. Our findings suggest that nematode telomerase RNA is a snoRNA-like intronic lncRNA that exploits the introns of germline–up-regulated genes to ensure species survival.",

          "abstract": "Parasitic plants rarely attack themselves, suggesting the existence of a kin-avoidance mechanism. In the root parasitic plant Phtheirospermum japonicum , prehaustorium formation is triggered by host-secreted haustorium-inducing factors (HIFs), but it is unresponsive to its own exudates. Here we report the identification of the spontaneous prehaustorium 1 ( spoh1 ) mutant, which forms prehaustoria without external host signals. spoh1 harbors a point mutation in the gene encoding uridine diphosphate–glucosyltransferase UGT72B1, an enzyme that glucosylates and thereby inactivates phenolic HIFs. PjUGT72B1 has a different substrate specificity than its ortholog of the host Arabidopsis . Introduction of PjUGT72B1 into Arabidopsis reduced prehaustorium induction activity, indicating that UGT72B1 regulates haustorium induction by hosts. Our findings suggest that Orobanchaceae hemiparasitic plants have evolved kin-avoidance mechanisms through the glucosylation of endogenous HIFs.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how life is adapting to urban environments represents an important challenge in evolutionary biology. In this work, we investigate a widely cited example of urban adaptation, Culex pipiens form molestus , also known as the London Underground mosquito. Population genomic analysis of ~350 contemporary and historical samples counters the popular hypothesis that molestus originated belowground in London &lt;200 years ago. Instead, we show that molestus first adapted to human environments aboveground in the Mediterranean or Middle East over the course of more than 1000 years, possibly in association with ancient agricultural civilizations of the Middle East. Our results highlight the role of early human society in priming taxa for contemporary urban evolution. They also provide insight into whether and how molestus contributes to West Nile virus transmission in modern cities.",

The single atomic layer of lanthanum reduces the surface symmetry and increases the energy difference between antiparallel domains by as much as 200 times, leading to unidirectional domain alignment. We grew single-crystalline molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), molybdenum diselenide (MoSe 2 ), tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ), and tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ) by means of both chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and metal-organic CVD processes. Wafer-scale spectroscopies and device measurements demonstrate the exceptional quality and uniformity of 150-millimeter TMDCs, with average mobility of 110 and 131 square centimeters per volt per second for MoS 2 and WSe 2 , respectively, at room temperature.",

How the clock adapts to seasonal variations in the environment is incompletely understood. We found that a high-fat diet increased phosphorylation of the clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) on serine 662 (S662), which was necessary and sufficient for regulating phase shifting of daily locomotor activity to entrain to seasonal light cycles. PER2-S662 phosphorylation correlated with genome-wide expression pathways that regulate polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) conversion into oxylipins in the hypothalamus. Partial hydrogenation of dietary PUFAs increased hypothalamic PER2-S662 phosphorylation and entrainment to a summer photoperiod in control mice, but not in mice for which PER2-S662 could not be phosphorylated. PER2-S662 phosphorylation is influenced by, and alters the regulation of, unsaturated fat to control circadian phase shifting across the seasons.",

We designed an active deep-learning framework that leverages omics to enable scalable, optimizable identification of compounds that induce complex phenotypes. Our generalizable algorithm outperformed state-of-the-art models on classical recall, translating to a 13-17x increase in phenotypic hit-rate across two hematological discovery campaigns. Combining this algorithm with a lab-in-the-loop signature refinement step, we achieved an additional two-fold increase in hit-rate and molecular insights. In sum, our framework enables efficient phenotypic hit identification campaigns, with broad potential to accelerate drug discovery.",

Sea surface temperatures were ≥31°C for an average of 40.7 days, leading to heat exposures 2.2- to fourfold higher than all prior years on record. In the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas, 97.8 to 100% of the Acropora palmata and Acropora cervicornis colonies died. Mortality was lower offshore southeast Florida (37.9%), reflecting cooler temperatures in this region.

Ecological modeling shows that North American terrestrial vertebrates maintained high diversity and endemism in the latest Cretaceous and early Paleogene, with bioprovinces shaped by temperature and geography.

Here, we present a miniaturized micro-camera array microscope (mini-MCAM) that consists of four fluorescence imaging micro-cameras, each capable of capturing neural activity across a 4.5 millimeter × 2.55 millimeter FOV. Cumulatively, the mini-MCAM images over a 30–square millimeter area of sparsely expressed GCaMP6s neurons that were distributed throughout the dorsal cortex, in regions including the primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, retrosplenial, and association cortices across both hemispheres.

Microbial cell factories offer a promising solution, yet reconstituting plant cytochrome P450s, key enzymes in these pathways, remains a major hurdle. In this study, we investigated a plant membrane protein, AtMSBP1, for its ability to broadly enhance P450 functionality in engineered yeast. Unlike in plants, interactions with cytochrome P450s are not essential for AtMSBP1’s function in yeast. Specifically, AtMSBP1 orchestrates interorganelle communication, involving not only the endoplasmic reticulum but also mitochondria and vacuoles, supporting cytochrome P450s functionality in yeast. This study highlights the critical role of cross-organelle coordination in supporting cytochrome P450s functionality, emphasizing a shift from traditional ER-based approaches to engineering cross-organelle interactions and tailoring the cellular microenvironment to enhance plant cytochrome P450s functionality in yeast.",

We found and characterized a noncanonical signaling pathway, revealing a functional and physical complex between a hybrid histidine kinase and an alcohol dehydrogenase, whose activity is tuned by heterodimerization. Leveraging this biosensor in a pooled CRISPRi library selection, we identified key host limitations. Iterative combinatorial strain engineering derived from these hits yielded a 36-fold titer increase to ~900 milligrams per liter. Integrated omics analysis revealed that metabolic rewiring toward amino acid catabolism was crucial for this improvement. This observation was found to be beneficial by technoeconomic analysis.

We analyzed genome-wide data from 7 ancient (~2300 to 100 years old) and 10 present-day individuals from the northern Indian Himalayas and one ~3370-year-old individual from the Central Himalayas in Nepal. Ancient and present-day individuals from the northern Himalayas predominantly have Tibetan-related genetic ancestry, likely the source of high-altitude adaptive variants in these individuals, with substantial Steppe-related genetic ancestry that is observed in all individuals dating between ~1300 years and present day.

          "abstract": "In the single-photon emission from a two-level system, multiphotons are generally regarded as accidental, undesired, and unrelated to the mechanism. In coherently driven systems, however, they form the cornerstone of single-photon emission, which arises from quantum interferences between virtual multiphoton fluctuations of the emitter and the Poissonian superposition of all number states induced by the driving. Here, we demonstrate how one can control the multiphoton dynamics by disrupting these quantum interferences through an external homodyne control of the emitter’s mean field. Experimentally, we observed a transition from single-photon to multiphoton emission, up to three-photon correlations. We show that, counterintuitively, quantum fluctuations always play a major qualitative role, even and, in fact, especially when their quantitative contribution is vanishing. Our findings provide distinct insights into the paradoxical character of quantum mechanics and open pathways for mean-field engineering as a tool for precision multiphoton control.",

IC7Fc was previously shown to slow the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and here, we demonstrate its effect on atherosclerotic development. In APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, an atherosclerosis-prone model with a humanized lipoprotein metabolism, IC7Fc markedly lowered plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. This was mechanistically explained by an inhibition of de novo lipogenesis in the liver, increased synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol, and down-regulated apolipoprotein B synthesis, which resulted in decreased cholesterol secretion in very low–density lipoprotein particles. As a consequence, IC7Fc treatment considerably reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation and vascular inflammation compared with current antihyperlipidemic therapy. In conclusion, IC7Fc is a promising pharmacological treatment for cardiometabolic diseases targeting hyperlipidemia and inflammation.",

This system features multiple distinct resonance frequencies that sensitively respond to physiological variations, exhibiting over 10-fold sensitivity improvement and 50% size reduction compared to conventional resonator-based systems. Moreover, the sensor employs a strain-resilient liquid metal composite and a soft substrate, ensuring wearing comfort, mechanical reliability, and antimicrobial properties. The effectiveness of this system is demonstrated through in situ monitoring of skin temperature and sweat electrolytes during exercise and prolonged monitoring of sweat glucose and ammonium in different subjects.

          "abstract": "P. W. Anderson introduced a negative- U (i.e., attractive electron-electron interaction) to describe the scarcity of singly occupied spin states in amorphous materials. To uncover the underlying chemistry behind this phenomenon, we combined structural sampling with quantum-chemical analysis of amorphous silicon nitride (a-SiN x ) based on DFT. Our analysis demonstrates that coordination defects act as charge traps, with a density on the order of 10 21 per cubic centimeter. These defects render singly occupied electronic states energetically less favorable than paired or fully emptied states, primarily due to electron donor-acceptor interactions. Furthermore, excess charge trapping occurs through chemical bond reorganization, which disrupts the balance of existing electron and hole traps. In addition, we found that in Si-rich a-SiN x , various Si─Si bonding networks exhibit power-law–like size distribution, where larger networks are associated with deeper trap levels. These findings explain why a-SiN x has been used as a charge storage layer in the charge trap flash memory.",

          "abstract": "Ochre use is widely regarded as a potential marker of symbolic behavior in Paleolithic societies. We conducted a multiproxy analysis of 16 ochre pieces from Middle Paleolithic Micoquian sites in Crimea [Zaskalnaya V (ZSKV), ZSKVI, and Prolom II] and mainland Ukraine (Mukhovets), spanning up to 70,000 years. Using portable x-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy coupled to energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and technological analysis, we identified deliberate modifications including grinding, scoring, flaking, and scraping. Three pieces (ZSKV-05, ZSKV-06, and ZSKV-07) show features exceeding utilitarian use: One is shaped into a crayon-like tool with repeated resharpening, another appears to be a crayon fragment, and a third bears engraved, polished surfaces. These traits suggest the intentional production of marks and curated use. While practical applications (e.g., hide processing) remain plausible for other specimens, the evidence supports symbolic use among some Crimean Neanderthals. Our results highlight their cognitive complexity and underscore the importance of regional, multiproxy approaches in evaluating the emergence of symbolic material culture.",

To elucidate the developmental roles of IHCs and OHCs in the formation, differentiation, and assembly of the various SCs, we genetically switched HC identities at several developmental stages and also generated mice lacking IHCs. We find that IHCs promote or induce the (i) differentiation of one SC type (outer pillar) at the expense of another (Deiters’), so that each completely and exclusively populates separate rows; (ii) packing density, but not identity, of inner pillar cells; and (iii) embryonic formation and (iv) cytoplasmic attraction of adjacent inner phalangeal cells, which envelop IHCs. Hence, developing IHCs dictate major aspects of SC identity and distribution to assemble the complex organ of Corti.",

To overcome this, we integrated a “crystallization-activated moisture barrier” into the perovskite film, which can exist in a liquid state/crystallization phase during the initial annealing to allow moisture to enter and promote crystallization, then migrate upward, and form a dense hydrophobic layer on the film surface to protect the perovskite from high humidity–caused damage. Such a “moisture barrier” enables the manufacturing of perovskite films to be insensitive to a wide range of relative humidity from 20% to over 90%. The barrier also regulates bulk crystallization and passivates surface defects. The crystallization-activated moisture barrier effectively reduces the sensitivity of perovskite films to humidity during annealing, which paves the way for high-tolerance manufacturing of perovskite photovoltaic devices.",

          "abstract": "Certain cephalopods can dynamically camouflage by altering both skin texture and color to match their surroundings. Inspired by this capability, we present a cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer-liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE-LCE) bilayer capable of simultaneous, reversible modulation of surface texture and structural color through programmable wrinkling. By tuning the bilayer’s fabrication parameters, on-demand wrinkle morphologies and color combinations are achieved. Spatially selective ultraviolet (UV) curing allows localized surface textures, while chemical patterning of the CLCE layer enables region-specific color responses, expanding the design space for multifunctional, spatially encoded optical materials. The CLCE-LCE bilayer enables dynamic thermal regulation by tuning light absorption through synergistically modulating surface morphology and color. Notably, this system achieves strain-dependent multistate encoding via multistep selective UV curing, revealing distinct visual content under different applied strains. This work establishes a versatile platform that merges surface instabilities with tunable structural coloration, advancing intelligent materials with programmable, strain-responsive surface and optical properties.",

          "abstract": "Conventional solution-based passivation methods for perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) often introduce secondary defects. A molecularly tailored dual-interface passivation strategy is presented using a solvent-free rub-on transfer method, which enables uniform molecular deposition without inducing secondary defects. Specifically, 4-mercaptopyridine (4-MPy) is applied at the buried interface, and 2-mercaptopyridine (2-MPy) is applied on the perovskite surface. At the buried interface, 4-MPy stabilizes Ni 3+ states, reduces oxygen vacancies, and improves hole injection. In contrast, surface-deposited 2-MPy coordinates effectively with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions, forming wide-bandgap complexes that suppress trap states and enhance carrier confinement. As a result, the optimized PeLEDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 24.67% and a current efficiency of 95.01 candela per ampere, the highest values reported for solution-processed polycrystalline CsPbBr 3 –based PeLEDs. Furthermore, the operational half-life is substantially extended by nearly 10-fold at an initial luminance of 1000 candela per square meter.",

          "abstract": "Aging is characterized by disruptions in metabolic homeostasis, yet the mechanisms that regulate these metabolic changes remain poorly understood. We show that the serine/threonine–protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) regulatory subunit 3, SAPS3, is a critical regulator of metabolism during aging. SAPS3 deletion significantly extends lifespan in mice and counteracts age-related impairments in metabolic health. SAPS3 deficiency improves the effects of aging on the affective behaviors, cognition, and motor functions in aged mice. We find that SAPS3 expression is increased during aging to inhibit adenosine monophosphate–activated kinase (AMPK) activity. Deletion of SAPS3 leads to AMPK activation and reverses cellular senescence and aging-induced metabolic alterations. Using in vivo U- 13 C 6 -D-glucose tracing and metabolomic analysis, we find that SAPS3 deficiency restores metabolic homeostasis with increased glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and decreased fatty acid synthesis in aged mice. These findings highlight a critical role of the SAPS3/PP6 phosphatase complex in aging and suggest that strategies targeting SAPS3 may promote longevity and healthy aging.",

          "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) protects against obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. During BAT activation, macroautophagy is inhibited, while chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is induced, promoting thermogenic gene expression, adipokine release, oxidative activity, and lipolysis. Aging reduces BAT function and lowers levels of LAMP2A, the rate-limiting CMA component. Pharmacological CMA activation restores BAT activity in aged mice. To explore the CMA’s role in BAT, we generated LAMP2A-deficient brown adipocytes and found that CMA regulates proteins essential for thermogenesis and metabolism. Blocking CMA in BAT reduced energy expenditure, raised blood triglycerides, impaired secretion, and led to an increase of thermogenesis repressors. These findings show that CMA is essential for maintaining BAT function, especially during adaptive thermogenesis. By degrading repressors of thermogenesis, CMA supports BAT activity under cold or metabolic stress. This work highlights CMA as a key regulator of BAT plasticity and a promising therapeutic target for treating age-related metabolic disorders.",

Here, we demonstrate the QSHE in an InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum well structure operating at elevated temperatures. This platform meets key criteria for device integration, including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE. Helical edge transport remains stable up to T  = 60 kelvin, with further potential for higher-temperature operation.

Among offshore technologies, wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) have emerged as the most promising solutions. However, a global assessment of offshore resources, particularly solar PV, remains lacking. Hence, we identify suitable areas for offshore wind and solar PV development on the basis of economic feasibility, technical constraints, and environmental considerations and quantify the national potential for electricity production and CO 2 reduction contributions. With a conservative assumption of using 1% of suitable areas, offshore wind and solar PV could generate ~6049 and 14,173 terawatt-hours of electricity annually. This would cover nearly 30% of the expected global electricity demand in 2050. The resulting reductions in carbon dioxide emissions could exceed 9 billion tonnes annually.

          "abstract": "While advances in cancer therapy have improved remission rates, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) remains a lasting and untreatable side effect. This study introduces Carba1, a bifunctional carbazole compound that protects against CIPN through two mechanisms. First, Carba1 interacts with tubulin, allowing for lower doses of taxanes, common chemotherapeutics known for causing CIPN, without reducing their anticancer effectiveness. Second, Carba1 activates nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), enhancing NAD biosynthesis and boosting the metabolic resilience of neurons and Schwann cells against chemotherapy-induced damage. Carba1 shows strong neuroprotective effects in vitro against paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bortezomib toxicity and in vivo in a rat model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Crucially, Carba1 does not interfere with paclitaxel’s tumor-fighting ability or promote tumor growth. Structure-activity analyses of Carba1 derivatives reveal the potential to develop compounds with dual or solely neuroprotective effects. These findings position Carba1 as a promising candidate to prevent CIPN, with potential to enhance both cancer treatment outcomes and patients’ quality of life.",

We apply microfluidics to enrich CTCs from 34 patients with DCIS and find a significantly higher concentration of CTCs compared to in healthy controls. We profile CTCs and matched DCIS tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing. We find that CTCs express higher clonal aberrations when compared to white blood cells from the same samples, and clonal comparisons between matched tissue and CTC samples provide evidence for an evolutionary bottleneck model. mRNA expression in CTC reveals EMT/MET and immunoregulatory pathway regulation with a suggestion of racial differences.

Within this domain, the KIF3A helical regions ensure cargo specificity, while a β-hairpin and KIF3B provide structural support. Biochemical and neuronal experiments confirm its functional importance.

Here, we use nanobeam four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to extract averaged strain profiles from uniformly sized, shape-identical particles, achieving high-resolution, statistically robust insights beyond single-particle noise. The strain profiles reveal how tensile, shear, and rotational components collectively compensate for the angular deficit, with particle shape–dependent local variations highlighting the importance of morphological control in synthesis. By integrating in situ heating with 4D-STEM, we captured a previously unobserved strain relaxation pathway involving the formation of periodic partial dislocations that stabilizes the strain-relieved equilibrium state.

Highlighting the significance of this pathway, several components are somatically mutated in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a neurological disorder characterized by intractable epilepsy. Supporting the functional impact of these variants, patient-derived SARM1 and RhoA mutations potentiate cilia loss, and a RhoA variant impairs cortical development. Conversely, SARM1 inhibition restores cilia in cells with FCD-associated alterations.

          "abstract": "Golgi fragmentation is an early and common feature of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, whether a shared mechanism drives Golgi fragmentation across different neurodegenerative conditions remains unclear. Here, we identify the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy homolog (ITCH) as a key regulator of proteotoxicity through its role in inducing Golgi fragmentation. Disease-associated accumulation of ITCH promotes fragmentation of both the cis- and trans-Golgi networks, disrupting protein sorting and impairing lysosomal functions. The ITCH-dependent lysosomal dysfunction compromises the clearance of misfolded proteins associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of ITCH protects against proteotoxicity in both mammalian neurons and Drosophila models of neurodegeneration. The accumulation of ITCH in patients with ALS and AD is attributed to up-regulation of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP11, which deubiquitinates and stabilizes ITCH. These results uncover a pathogenic pathway regulating Golgi integrity and contributing to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

          "abstract": "Many elements of an organism’s behavior are intertwined with the organism’s health. Over a long period of time, health status is also indicative of life span, with improved health correlating with a longer life. However, the relationship between longevity and behavior remains relatively unexplored. Here, we report that modification of a single longevity gene downstream of dietary restriction and hypoxia markedly alters behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans . We found that modified expression of flavin-containing monooxygenase ( fmo-2 ) leads to altered sensory perception and decision-making in a variety of behavioral paradigms. This cell nonautonomous signaling pathway is linked to changes in tryptophan metabolism, where loss of fmo-2 requires the tryptophan metabolite serotonin and overexpressed fmo-2 requires the tryptophan metabolite quinolinic acid to change behavior. These results suggest a unique mechanism for gut metabolism to communicate positive satiety signals and negative depressive signals to the organism by modifying an essential amino acid. They also demonstrate the importance of examining pleiotropic effects in promising longevity interventions.",

However, their applications in the infrared (IR) regime are inherently limited by the intrinsic bandgap of silicon, which limits the detection wavelengths to being below 1.1 μm. Although several methods have been developed to extend silicon photodetectors further in the IR range, these approaches often introduce additional challenges. Here, we present an approach to overcome these limitations by integrating disordered metasurfaces with upconversion nanoparticles, enabling IR detection by silicon photodetectors. The disordered design consisting of hybrid Mie-plasmonic cavities can enhance both the near-field localization and wide-band light absorption. The measured responsivity of the disordered element for 1550-nm laser is 0.22 A/W at room temperature, corresponding to an external quantum efficiency of 17.6%. Our design not only enhances the photocurrent performance, but also extends the working wavelength of silicon photodetectors to IR spectrum applications.",

Here, we develop a nonperturbative quantum electrodynamical approach based on a photon-free self-consistent Hartree-Fock framework to model the coupling between cavity photons and electrons and crystals. We apply this approach to graphene coupled to cavity photons of different polarizations. Photons introduce nonlocal electron-electron interactions, solely due to the quantum nature of light, that lead to substantial renormalization of Dirac bands. The nonlocal interactions induced by anisotropic linearly polarized photons give rise to wedge-shaped bands and Dirac gap. When isotropic cavity photon modes are introduced, the Dirac cones remain gapless, but a Fermi velocity renormalization yet indicates the role of nonlocal interactions. This theoretical framework paves the way for revealing nonperturbative quantum effects in strongly coupled light-matter systems and allows for a more comprehensive discovery of cavity-induced phenomena.",

We found that parental hypoxia exposure increased P0 longevity, caused intergenerational lipid reduction, and elicited transgenerational fertility reduction that was dependent on generationally transmitted small RNAs. Here, we find that Caenorhabditis elegans adapt to repeated generational stresses. We show that, upon two repeated generational hypoxia exposures, the life-span extension is eliminated, and after four repeated generational hypoxia exposures, the reduced fertility is eliminated. Transgenerational adaptation also occurred in response to changes in glucose availability. Transgenerational hypoxia adaptation is dependent on the H3K27 trimethyltransferase PRC2 complex, and we identified transgenerationally adapted genes. Our findings reveal that transgenerational adaptation occurs and suggest that H3K27me3 is a critical modification for adapting to repeated generational stresses.",

Bacteriophage (bacterial viruses) is a promising alternative with pathogen-level specificity.

Here, we introduce bacteriophage-loaded microneedle patches that enable targeted phage delivery directly within food, eliminating internal pathogens in a minimally disruptive manner. The application of microneedles within food is first explored. The platform is then substantiated by comparing performance in raw beef and cooked chicken, where we achieved up to 3-log reduction in Escherichia coli , meeting regulatory limits. In contrast, conventional surface application of the same phage failed to provide statistically significant decontamination. To ensure broad applicability, phage cocktails were also loaded into microneedles to demonstrate polymicrobial decontamination. This platform can also be adapted to extend food shelf-life by targeting spoilage-inducing bacteria.",

The model consists of a two-layered network, designed to capture activity in both the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. A core feature of the model is that within each layer, the processing units are tuned to both movement direction and the direction of movement error. The model recapitulates a large range of contextual effects such as how prior learning, error uncertainty, or temporal delay affect the rate of adaptation. While these effects have traditionally been taken to indicate a form of meta-learning or context-dependent memory within the adaptation system, the current results show that they can emerge from the population activity of a cerebellar-like hierarchical network that does not represent context.",

This paper complements and extends the prevailing interpretation that attributes CISS primarily to the electric current in chiral molecules. We propose that molecular vibrations drive spin polarization in chiral molecules and play a critical role in CISS. Our results suggest that magnetic interactions between chiral molecules and ferromagnets, analogous to interlayer exchange coupling, provide a physically consistent mechanism for the observed selectivity. Specifically, we demonstrate that molecular vibrations facilitate the alignment of spin angular momentum dependent on chirality in the presence of an external magnetic field, which is a prerequisite for exchange coupling. These findings necessitate reevaluating spin dynamics, expanding its relevance beyond traditional solid-state physics to fields such as chemical reactions, molecular biology, and drug discovery.",

However, they are normally prepared by the spin coating process, which is not conducive to scaling up. One of the considerable barriers to scaling up stems from the printing of electron transport layers (ETLs), with tin oxide (SnO 2 ) being a commonly used material. Here, poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) is introduced into the SnO 2 nanocrystals ink to engineer the ink to enhance the dispersion of nanocrystals and slow down solvent evaporation, ensuring the printed ETLs having optimized coverage and morphology. Concurrently, the buried interface is refined by PAA, which enhances charge transfer and suppresses nonradiative recombination. The flexible device modified by PAA achieves a high efficiency of 22.46% (certified at 21.56%) and retains 89.3% of its initial value after 3000 bending cycles and 92.4% after 2000 hours of storage.

In contrast, automated image analysis software allows a more quantitative assessment, though inherent limitations with such automated programs can produce misleading conclusions. For example, specific imaging features may be incorrectly scored or classified within the specimen because of the complex architecture and heterogeneous structures present in the lung. In addition, tissue processing and handling may further introduce artifacts and inconsistencies that affect automated analysis. To address these limitations, we developed a lung image analysis program, Wide-Angle Lung Experiment Segmentation (WALES), which uses Meta’s Segment Anything Model to provide semiautomated masking and relative density analysis to efficiently quantify lung injury. Density analysis using WALES effectively delineated varying severities of lung injury, not achieved using more standard methods. WALES is widely applicable for many preclinical lung injury models.",

The latter phase was directly correlated with formation of the modern large-mammalian faunas, driven by the ecomorphological revolution of local mammalian communities following a regional mass extinction, “the Central Asian Tortonian Crisis.” We propose that the rapid uplift of the Tibetan Plateau altered Central Asian hydrological system, promoting aridification and earlier development of open habitats, which in turn drove the adaptation of large mammals to prolonged environmental shifts.",

Through bioinformatic and functional analyses, we demonstrated that overexpression of AP4 in mice not only accelerated in vivo axon regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury but also promoted robust axon regeneration and neuronal survival after optic nerve injury by activating mammalian target of rapamycin activity. Neuronal-specific knockdown of AP4 abolished the regenerative phenotype induced by c-Myc overexpression and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion. AP4 overexpression rendered the intrinsic growth capacity of c-Myc silencing injured retinal ganglion cells unaffected. These findings unveil a distinct aspect of the c-Myc–AP4 axis and highlight a previously unrecognized intrinsic role of AP4 in axon regeneration, with potential therapeutic implications.",

          "abstract": "RAC1 A159V is a hotspot mutation associated with poor prognosis in several cancers. By gene editing, we generated endogenous homozygous and heterozygous RAC1 A159V mutations, which result in up-regulated RAC1 activity and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. RAC1 A159V tumors grow faster than RAC1 WT tumors in immune-proficient mice and are resistant to anti–programmed death protein 1 (PD1). Flow cytometry and scRNA-seq analyses reveal that RAC1 A159V cells form “cold” tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment and reduced tumor-immune cell interactions. Mechanistically, RAC1 A159V up-regulates glycosphingolipid biosynthesis to activate mTORC1 signaling in tumor cells, which in turn increases glycolysis, impairs key chemokine production, and decreases IFNGR1 expression of the tumor cells. mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin resensitizes the RAC1 A159V tumors to anti-PD1 treatment by reversing effects of RAC1 A159V mutation. These results demonstrate a mechanism of RAC1 A159V -driven immune evasion and suggest an approach of combining the targeting of RAC1-mTOR signaling with immune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of a type of immune-cold tumors.",

Here, we use a distinct dataset of ~8000 melanosomes from 60 species (11 mammalian orders) including a Jurassic species to ask more generally what color or environmental variables may explain melanosome geometry in mammals. We confirm support for limited melanosome variation in Jurassic mammals. Crown therian mammalian melanosome diversity as extreme as that in birds is recovered within placental lineages. More environmental variables substantially explain aspects of melanosome geometry than do color variables, but the explanatory power of both sets of variables is limited. Prediction of color from melanosomes in fossil mammals merits caution, given observed lineage-specific trends. Potentially comparatively weak selection on the melanosome geometry-color relationship in mammals or correlations with other life history variables may further explain the evolution of these geometries.",

However, controlled formation of these conduction channels remains challenging, limiting both hole transport and dopability under low thermal budgets. Here, we report a sulfur-mediated redox strategy that modulates the local bonding environment via TeO 2 dissociation and partial Te 4+ reduction, promoting formation of short-chain Te-Te networks. This enables high-performance p-channel thin-film transistors processed at an ultralow temperature of 120°C, exhibiting an average hole mobility of 11.5 cm 2  V −1  s −1 and on/off current ratios around 10 6 with high uniformity and reproducibility.

To address their contribution to physiological health, we generated and analyzed mice individually lacking the histone variants macroH2A1.1, macroH2A1.2, or macroH2A2. We identified several histopathologic changes in the kidney as isoform-specific phenotype of complete macroH2A1.1 loss affecting male and female animals. Kidney alterations were barely associated with organ-intrinsic gene expression changes but strongly correlated with a systemic shift in nutrient metabolization and alterations in NAD + (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form) metabolism. Reduced lipid oxidation and increased glycolysis were found in male and female mice lacking macroH2A1.1 but not macroH2A1.2 or macroH2A2. Male macroH2A1.1-deficient mice also had better glucose tolerance and altered hepatic gene expression. Replacing chow by ketogenic diet overrode the macroH2A1.1-dependent metabolic phenotype and prevented kidney abnormalities. Together, our results indicate that macroH2A1.1 controls nutrient metabolization and links macroH2A1.1 levels to secondary changes in the kidney.",

We assembled a dataset of tooth morphology from 30 species and combined it with functional data such as diet, habitat, and body size. Simulated extinction scenarios, where species were sequentially removed from the highest to lowest threat level, revealed that the loss of threatened species would result in marked homogenization of morphology and ecology. Along this extinction trajectory, trait structures become increasingly depauperate, marked by contracting depth ranges and declining body-size diversity. Our results indicate that the diverse dental morphologies, shaped over millions of years, are at risk of disappearing—eroding the genus’s capacity to support varied ecological roles.",

Experimental and computational analyses reveal a distinct luminescence mechanism dominated by intermolecular Cu(I)∙∙∙Cu(I) interactions. An unconventional halogen-free strategy substantially enhances the radioluminescence of a methyl-substituted copper(I) trinuclear complex, achieving an exceptional light yield of ~70,475 photons/MeV. Leveraging these properties, a scintillator screen was fabricated, which achieved a spatial resolution exceeding 20.0 line pairs/mm and retained performance over 200 on-off cycles. Moreover, real-time angiography simulations validated its capability for dynamic x-ray imaging. These findings position copper(I) cyclic trinuclear complexes as a promising candidate for next-generation scintillators with strong potential for real-world applications and offer valuable insights for halogen-free radioluminescent materials.",

The Paramecium host survived for up to 5 weeks while maintaining the number of Chlorella endosymbionts, whereas aposymbiotic Paramecium and free-living Chlorella either died or bleached, respectively, under the same conditions. In the symbiotic state, the host continuously fed on the endosymbionts without excreting nitrogenous waste into the medium, while the remaining endosymbionts continued to proliferate using heterotrophic metabolites from the host and light energy.

Here, we demonstrate that damage by a specialist leafminer ( Phthorimaea operculella ) triggers tissue-specific responses in potato plants: compensatory growth in immature leaves, enabling tolerance, while resistance is induced in the mined leaf. The tissue-specific regulation of Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporter 11 (SWEET11) mediates both responses. In unattacked sink leaves, SWEET11 is up-regulated, enhancing sugar import, promoting compensatory growth and herbivore tolerance. In contrast, SWEET11 is rapidly down-regulated in mined source leaves, inhibiting sugar export and increasing cellular sugar levels. The resulting sugar accumulations suppress SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) and thereby enhance herbivore resistance. SWEET11-mediated sugar signaling enhances jasmonic acid (JA)–mediated resistance by degrading MCPI1a and MCPI1b (metallocarboxypeptidase inhibitor 1), two JA-induced herbivory susceptibility factors.

One unresolved question regarding the limb posture transition is its association with body size evolution. If adopting more erect limb postures reduces mass-specific muscle forces and bone stresses, it would enable the evolution of larger body sizes. We tested this prediction using computational modeling and simulation of hindlimb muscle activations and femoral stresses across limb postures and body sizes in juvenile to adult American alligators and a scaled model of the extinct giant alligatoroid Deinosuchus riograndensis . We showed that larger alligators and D. riograndensis encounter challenges in generating sufficient muscle forces to support their bodies and maintain bone stresses, whereas adopting more erect hindlimb postures helps mitigate bone stresses among individuals of similar sizes. These results show how the shift from sprawling to erect limb posture relaxed biomechanical constraints, potentially facilitating the evolution of larger body sizes in terrestrial tetrapods.",

Here, we use numerical simulations to show that Jupiter’s early formation reshaped its natal protoplanetary disk. Jupiter’s rapid growth depleted the inner disk gas and generated pressure bumps and dust traps that manifested as rings. These structures caused dust to accumulate and led to a second-generation planetesimal population, with ages matching those of noncarbonaceous chondrites. Meanwhile, the evolving gas structure suppressed terrestrial embryos’ inward migration, preventing them from reaching the innermost regions.

          "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a muscle degenerative disease affecting young boys, arises from the loss of dystrophin. Current gene therapy approaches aim to restore a shortened form of dystrophin (microdystrophin) via adeno-associated vector delivery. While recent clinical studies show promise, therapeutic efficacy remains incomplete, emphasizing the need for improved approaches. Here, we identified lysosomal perturbations in myofibers of patients with DMD and animal models, an overlooked mechanism of cellular damage in muscular dystrophies. These were notably marked by the up-regulation and recruitment of Galectin-3, a biomarker of lysosomal membrane permeabilization, to lysosomes, alongside alterations in lysosome number, morphology, and function. Microdystrophin therapy in Dmd mdx mice fails to fully correct these damages. However, combining it with trehalose, a lysosome-protective disaccharide, substantially improves the outcome, enhancing muscle function, myopathology, and transcriptome. These findings highlight lysosomal damage as an important pathomechanism in DMD and suggest that combining trehalose with gene therapy could enhance therapeutic efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) affect about 3% of the population, often leading to catastrophic outcomes upon rupture. Vasa vasorum, microvessels supplying arterial walls, are conjectured to induce inflammation and leakage in IAs that drive adverse remodeling. Using scanning immunofluorescent multiphoton imaging and micro–computed tomography to visualize intact IA specimens, we identified an extensive vasa vasorum plexus in the IA wall. Our quantitative analyses show significant colocalization of vasa vasorum with calcifications, a strong correlation with increased wall thickness ( R 2  = 0.96, P  &lt; 0.001), and associations with well-defined multiaxially oriented collagen fibers. These findings highlight a more nuanced role for vasa vasorum, suggesting both adverse and protective remodeling influences, which may critically affect IA rupture risk. Contrary to the prevailing view of vasa vasorum as solely adverse, this study underscores the contribution to IA wall stability and the need to elucidate their functional impact on IA pathophysiology. Hence, these microvessels warrant further investigation for therapeutic targeting.",

The nanoprobe integrates two individually addressable nanoelectrodes that perform electrochemical detection of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, produced by mitochondrial metabolism, followed by dielectrophoretic trapping, manipulation, and extraction of mitochondria. We successfully demonstrated the extraction of mitochondria from living cells, which is validated through fluorescence labeling before and after extraction. Subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction further confirmed that the extracted sample contained mitochondria. The fusion of the transplanted mitochondria within the recipient cell’s mitochondrial network confirms their activity.

However, most existing fluorescent probes are prone to background interference and limited renal targeting. We developed a ratiometric nanoprobe (RP-SC) that synergistically responded to H 2 O 2 and targeted kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). In AKI kidneys, RP-SC was hydrolyzed and slowly released encapsulated Hcy-BOH and Cy-Dopa. The H 2 O 2 level was semi-quantitatively analyzed by fluorescence ratio ( F Hcy-BOH / F Cy-Dopa ). RP-SC exhibited prominent renal fluorescence in AKI mice, making it possible to accurately diagnose AKI and dynamically monitor renal function for up to 60 hours. RP-SC could monitor the process of AKI in vivo and provide an earlier warning of AKI than traditional strategies, subsequently evaluating the recovery of renal function after N -acetyl cysteine (NAC) treatment. Our study confirmed the ability of RP-SC for longitudinal monitoring of renal function in vivo by dual-targeting capacity, providing an effective tool for accurate diagnosis of early AKI while tracking the dynamic process of AKI treatment.",

For isolated spins and first-order reactions, this is a well-researched topic, but time evolution of complex nuclear spin systems in the presence of second-order kinetics, diffusion, and flow has so far remained intractable. In this communication, we report a numerically stable formalism for time-domain description of nuclear spin dynamics and relaxation in the simultaneous presence of diffusion, flow, and second-order chemical reactions.

These dual approaches were often merged to produce small projectile points, including stemmed point forms using an elliptical cross-sectional ogive design. Similar dual lithic technologies are found in assemblages in northern Japan dating to ~20,000 cal yr B.P. We suggest a group with a similar lithic technology became isolated somewhere in the vicinity of the Paleo-Sakhalin-Hokkaido-Kuril region, developing genetically into ancestral American populations. Between ~22,000 and ~18,000 cal yr B.P., a subset of this population migrated along the southern Beringian and Northwest coasts into the Americas.

Then, we selectively modulated liver metabolism through N -acetylgalactosamine small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapy against Cyclin M4 ( CNNM4 ), a magnesium transporter dysregulated in MASLD. Liver-specific intervention with siRNA- Cnnm4 reversed impaired social memory and sensorimotor processing in association with recovery of hippocampal synaptogenesis and mitochondrial function pathways, alongside activation of neurogenesis-associated transcriptional programs. Our findings demonstrate that liver pathology is sufficient to drive neurobehavioral and hippocampal dysfunction in MASLD.

This excitation has topological robustness, which fundamentally stems from its intrinsic tolerance to fabrication imperfections. A 14-channel narrowband absorbers chip based on GTPP has been fabricated. Compared to conventional structures without GTPP excitation, this device can lower the reverse saturable absorption threshold (~7.7 × 10 −5 nanojoules per square micrometer) and increase the fluorescence intensity above the residual laser intensity to enhance the extinction capability by two orders of magnitude.

Here, we report the remolding of bacterial laccase, catalyzing conversions of dopamine and O 2 to o -quinone and H 2 O, into a biocatalytic neuromodulator by reactive oxygen species–free dopamine catabolism. Given the poor activity of native laccase in the physiological context because of OH − inhibition of its geometrically constrained O 2 -reducing center, we designed a highly dynamic Ru-Cu binuclear center to counteract the inhibition effect. Structural and computational investigations unravel a self-adaptive catalytic mechanism by reversive Ru-Cu active site reconfiguration that lowers the kinetic barriers for O 2 -to-H 2 O conversion in neutral solution. The remolded laccase exhibits substantial enhancement of physiological activity (up to one order of magnitude) and improved catecholamine substrate specificity, enabling whole-cell down-regulation of vesicular dopamine and extracellular erasure of evoked dopamine signals in intact brains.

How HPV enters the nucleus after exiting the Golgi is unclear, although mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) appears important. Here, we show that importin-7 (IPO7), a nuclear pore import receptor, is present at the Golgi and promotes HPV infection. IPO7 knockdown inhibits infection and causes HPV to accumulate in the Golgi without reaching mitotic chromosomes, demonstrating that IPO7 promotes Golgi-to-nucleus transport of HPV. Golgi-to-nucleus transport of a cellular cargo also requires IPO7, suggesting that HPV hijacks a preexisting pathway for nuclear entry. Furthermore, the C-terminal nuclear localization sequence of HPV L2 protein, which overlaps its cell-penetrating peptide sequence, binds IPO7 directly in a COPI-dependent virus trafficking step. Together, these data identify a role for an importin in HPV infection and suggest that the canonical nuclear pore import machinery plays an unanticipated role in NEB-dependent nuclear entry.",

Here, we examine this hazard by combining a unique inventory of debris flows from the Wenchuan earthquake with numerical modeling to constrain their magnitude and frequency. We show that large debris flows occur more frequently than expected, on the basis of magnitude-frequency relationships for all debris flows, when high volumes of sediment are deposited in channels.

The table’s length, 405 months, was originally implemented in a general lunar calendar table of 405 successive months; within a few passes through this lunar calendar, intervals among observed eclipses could have stimulated an approximation to the series of lunar intervals that were later compiled as stations of an eclipse table; and for all and only these lunar stations to correspond to dates of upcoming eclipses, dates in successive 405-month eclipse tables would have to have overlapped. It identifies optimal procedures for the amounts of overlap that would maintain its predictions’ correctness and shows that these procedures could yield a sequence of tables that would anticipate every solar eclipse observable in the Mayan territory from a century or two after the first evidence of the Mayan lunar calendar to at least the era of the extant eclipse table, 700 years later.",

Beyond these functions, leptin signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis. Here, we report the x-ray crystal structures of a leptin-neutralizing antibody (hLep3) in the unbound and leptin-bound states. The interaction of this antibody with leptin mimics the interaction of the LEPR with leptin, providing direct insights into the mechanism by which the antibody disrupts leptin signaling. We furthermore evaluate the therapeutic potential of neutralizing leptin with this antibody across distinct mouse models of fibrosis affecting the kidney, liver, lung, heart, and blood vessels. Leptin neutralization markedly inhibited fibrosis progression in all models. Mechanistically, suppression of leptin activity reduces pro-inflammatory and profibrotic processes, underscoring its therapeutic potential. These findings suggest that leptin signaling plays a vital role in tissue fibrosis and that treatment with a leptin-neutralizing antibody may be a promising therapeutic approach.",

          "abstract": "No clinically available antibiotic adjuvants can overcome metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) resistance in carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens. Divalent cations in MBL and quasicrystalline lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are key determinants of acquired and intrinsic resistance in these bacteria. Chemically depriving these cations would block multiple resistance pathways simultaneously and restore carbapenem susceptibility. Here, we chemically engineer a class of anionic adjuvants to tailor their interactions with MBL, enhancing the enzymatic inhibition by up to ~5885-fold compared to parent compounds. An orthogonal screen identifies the tiopronin-engineered anionic adjuvant (TINA), which achieves complete rescue of all tested carbapenems against diverse New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1–producing Gram-negative ESKAPE bacteria. TINA targets both MBL and LPS, depriving divalent cations to inactivate MBL and damage membrane collaboratively while also preventing resistance evolution. Moreover, TINA’s anionic nature minimizes serum adsorption, enabling safe and effective in vivo treatment of bacterial pneumonia. This work provides an innovative chemical biology strategy leveraging anionic materials to combat superbugs globally.",

Here, we focused on the potential role of mechanics, an aspect of anther development that has been very poorly characterized. Using a combination of live imaging and mechanical measurements, we showed that GCs emerge within a special micromechanical niche, where the inner tissues exert pressure on the outer cell layers, placing themselves under compression. Mechanical perturbations impair tissue expansion patterns and severely compromise GC specification. Further investigations revealed that the master genetic regulator SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) was central in establishing this micromechanical environment via cell wall softening. In turn, the mechanical cues stabilized the transcription of SPL/NZZ . Here, we propose an intrinsic growth-derived mechanochemical feedback loop that safeguards the fate of GCs.",

          "abstract": "Phytoplankton–bacteria interactions are critical but often overlooked in assessing the impacts of pollutants on ecosystems. Herein, we used a coculture consisting of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and river bacteria to investigate their responses to antibiotic stress. Both partners exhibited hormesis in cocultures but were inhibited in monocultures under exposure to 10 different antibiotics, especially azithromycin (AZM). Notably, mutualistic cooperation between the partners shifted the effect of AZM from inhibition in monocultures to promotion in cocultures. C. reinhardtii alleviates AZM stress on bacteria by providing organic carbon and efficiently removing antibiotics. In turn, the altered phycospheric bacteriome supplied ammonia, phosphate, vitamin B 12 , and indole-3-acetic acid to promote C. reinhardtii growth. The antibiotic-induced growth promotion was also observed in natural phytoplankton–bacteria communities. Our findings challenge the reliability of ecotoxicity assessment that is typically based on single-species tests, emphasizing the importance of cross-kingdom interactions in assessing pollutant effects.",

          "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) demonstrate immense potential as naturally derived carriers of active therapeutics. To maximize their capacity, it is crucial to develop effective methods for manipulating cargo and ensuring scalability. To address this challenge, we propose that protein-free mRNA granule-like structures, named gene-encoded nanoparticle RNA for inducing superior EVs (GENRISE), can function as active translational sponge and as transient subcellular compartments. The overexpression of proteins in proximity to RNA assemblies stimulates parental cells to release excess exogenous proteins in induced superior EVs (iSEVs). The iSEV system enables the single-module–based enrichment of exogenous cargo in EVs with scalable manufacturing. By harnessing mass-produced iSEVs induced by GENRISEs, encoding an antigenic peptide, we have successfully demonstrated target-specific in vivo cancer immunotherapy. These findings suggest that the emerging iSEV platform shows considerable potential for biomedical applications by enabling the controlled production of cargo-specific EVs.",

This self-organization allows photonic and electronic sources to produce pulsed waveforms and is vital for applications in ultrafast and high-field optics as well as frequency comb generation. Here, we report a mechanism to include photon-electron-phonon interactions, demonstrating the excitation of mode-locked optomechanical microcombs in a graphene-deposited silica microresonator, determined by the synergy of optomechanical back action and graphene saturable absorption. The circulating optical field induces mechanical oscillations that modulate the light wave, while Pauli blocking in graphene locks a single optomechanical mode, forming a localized coherent optical wave packet within a single microcavity. In addition, using frequency division techniques, the mode-locked optomechanical microcomb achieves repetition stability with phase noise reduced to −110.5 decibels relative to the carrier per hertz at a 1-hertz offset and an Allan deviation as low as 3 × 10 −12 @ 20 seconds, comparable to a standard rubidium clock.",

Using a pyrazinacene-based probe ( TEG 8 -N14 ), we unexpectedly achieved discrimination of multiple cell states, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and senescence, based on RNA/DNA changes. Specifically, TEG 8 -N14 selectively stains necrotic cells in live samples, while after fixation, it allows detection of ultraearly senescence in UV-vis–sensitive cells, providing approximately twofold greater informational content than existing RNA or DNA fluorophores. These findings break current imaging barriers by enabling comprehensive visualization of single-cell fate histories without being affected by UV-vis or genetic manipulation.",

          "abstract": "Endoluminal stent implantation is a common intervention strategy for treating obstructive lesions, but conventional delivery systems struggle to reach deep, tortuous ducts. To overcome this limitation, we present a magnetically controlled microrobot that integrates two functional modules: a magnetic actuation (MA) module for agile navigation and an ultrasound-responsive self-expanding stent module (ST module) for lesion-specific dilation. The system uses a dynamically tunable assembly mechanism governed by rotational direction enabling integrated locomotion (clockwise) and on-demand module separation (counterclockwise) at stenotic sites. The platform is compatible with intraoperative ultrasound, allowing real-time navigation and thermally triggered expansion in physiological environments. By synergizing programmable magnetic actuation, ultrasound-mediated expansion, and clinical workflow compatibility, the robot can navigate tortuous phantom ducts, achieving controlled stent deployment within 3 seconds and complete expansion within 30 seconds, permitting minimally invasive treatment of biliary strictures. This work advances microrobotic stent delivery by overcoming key barriers to clinical translation in endoluminal interventions.",

          "abstract": "Microglial functions rely on their morphodynamic versatility and inflammatory response, yet the molecular determinants, particularly ion channels and receptors, remain poorly understood. Here, we identify chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1), a protein known to exist in both soluble and membrane-associated forms, as highly enriched in human and murine microglia, with minimal expression in other brain cells. Acute blockade or genetic deletion of CLIC1 markedly attenuates microglial surveillance by reducing ramification and motility, without affecting chemotaxis. This phenotype is recapitulated in xenografted human microglia and human brain tissue. Mechanistically, CLIC1 effects involve interactions with actin-binding ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) proteins, suggesting a role in linking the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. Contrary to its name, CLIC1 functions are chloride-independent and thus unlikely to reflect ion channel activity. This is supported by patch-clamp electrophysiology revealing lack of chloride conductance in surveillant microglia. Following ATP–evoked activation, CLIC1 blockade strongly suppresses NLRP3–dependent interleukin-1β release, suggesting therapeutic potential against neuroinflammation.",

While advances have been made in identifying individual genes regulating synapse development, the molecular programs orchestrating their action during circuit integration of neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we take a multiomic approach to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs), comprising transcription factors (TFs), regulatory regions, and predicted target genes, in hippocampal granule cells (GCs). We find a dynamic gene regulatory code, with early and late postnatal GRNs regulating cell morphogenesis and synapse organization and plasticity, respectively. Our results predict sequential regulations, with early-active TFs delaying the activation of later GRNs and their putative synaptic targets. Using a loss-of-function approach, we identify Bcl6 as a regulator of pre- and postsynaptic structural maturation and synaptic transmission and Smad3 as a modulator of inhibitory synaptic transmission in GCs. Together, these findings highlight the networks of key TFs and target genes orchestrating GC synapse development.",

While fibrosis has been proposed to drive progressive organ damage, antifibrotic therapies have failed in clinical trials. Here, we reveal that tubular vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) expression precedes nephron loss, fibrosis, and long-term kidney dysfunction. Using serial intravital microscopy in transgenic mice, we track tubulointerstitial remodeling between injured and intact tissue over 3 weeks. VCAM1 is rapidly induced in a distinct subset of injured tubules, preceding atrophy with sustained fibroblast recruitment. However, fibroblasts remain confined to injury sites and do not cause secondary damage in uninjured tubules. Last, in human kidney transplant biopsies, tubular VCAM1 expression, but not kidney injury molecule 1, correlates negatively with early and 12-month graft function, underscoring its potential as a biomarker of adverse outcomes. These findings position VCAM1 as an early indicator of tubular fate and nephron loss.",

          "abstract": "When reducing pixel size below the wavelength of light, the conventional stacked geometry of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is dominated by sharp nanoelectrode contours. This causes spatially imbalanced charge carrier transport and recombination resulting in low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and filament formation accelerating device failure. Here, we circumvent these limitations by selectively passivating nanoelectrode edges with an insulating layer, while simultaneously defining a nanoaperture in flat areas. We thereby ensure controlled charge carrier recombination and suppress filament growth. After demonstrating efficient hole injection by gold nanoelectrodes, we realize individually addressable subwavelength OLED pixels (300 nanometers by 300 nanometers) based on plasmonic gold patch antennas for light extraction. We achieve an EQE of 1%, a maximum luminance of 3000 candela per square meter, and fast response times exceeding video rates.
