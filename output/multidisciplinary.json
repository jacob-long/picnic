          "abstract": "The Great Fear of 1789, a wave of panic and unrest in rural France fuelled by the spreading of rumours, was an important moment at the onset of the French Revolution, marking the collapse of feudalism and the rise of the new regime1. The Great Fear provides a vivid example of the role the spreading of rumours has in driving political changes that might be relevant today2,3. Here, we collect existing historical records related to the Great Fear and use epidemiology tools and models4 to reconstruct the network of its transmission from town to town. In this way, we quantify the spatiotemporal spread of the rumours and compute key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number. Exploiting information on the structure of the road network in eighteenth century France5, we estimate the most probable diffusion paths of the Great Fear and quantify the distribution of spreading velocities. By endowing the nodes in our reconstructed network with indicators related to the institutional, demographic and socio-economic conditions of the time6, including literacy, population size, political participation, wheat prices7,8, income and ownership laws9, and the unequal distribution of land ownership, we compute factors associated with spread of the Great Fear. Our analysis sheds light on unresolved historiographic issues on the significance of the Great Fear for the French Revolution, providing a quantitative answer to the unresolved debate between the role of emotions and rationality in explaining its diffusion.",

          "abstract": "Bipedalism is a human-defining trait1,2,3. It is made possible by the familiar, bowl-shaped pelvis, whose short, wide iliac blades curve along the sides of the body to stabilize walking and support internal organs and a large-brained, broad-shouldered baby4,5,6. The ilium changes compared with living primates are an evolutionary novelty7. However, how this evolution came about remains unknown. Here, using a multifaceted histological, comparative genomic and functional genomic approach, we identified the developmental bases of the morphogenetic shifts in the human pelvis that made bipedalism possible. First, we observe that the human ilium cartilage growth plate underwent a heterotopic shift, residing perpendicular to the orientation present in other primate (and mouse) ilia. Second, we observe heterochronic and heterotopic shifts in ossification that are unlike those in non-human primate ilia or human long bones. Ossification initiates posteriorly, resides externally with fibroblast (and perichondral) cells contributing to osteoblasts, and is delayed compared with other bones in humans and with primate ilia. Underlying these two shifts are regulatory changes in an integrated chondrocyte–perichondral–osteoblast pathway, involving complex hierarchical interactions between SOX9–ZNF521–PTH1R and RUNX2–FOXP1/2. These innovations facilitated further growth of the human pelvis and the unique formation of the ilium among primates.",

          "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is the primary target of the partial agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the psychoactive constituent of marijuana1. Here we report two agonist-bound crystal structures of human CB1 in complex with a tetrahydrocannabinol (AM11542) and a hexahydrocannabinol (AM841). The two CB1–agonist complexes reveal important conformational changes in the overall structure relative to the antagonist-bound state2, including a 53% reduction in the volume of the ligand-binding pocket and an increase in the surface area of the G protein-binding region. Furthermore, a twin toggle switch of Phe2003.36 and Trp3566.48 (where the superscripts denote Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering3) is experimentally observed and seems to be essential for receptor activation. The structures reveal important insights into the activation mechanism of CB1 and provide a molecular basis for predicting the binding modes of Δ9-THC, and endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids. The plasticity of the binding pocket of CB1 seems to be a common feature among certain class A G protein-coupled receptors. These findings should inspire the design of chemically diverse ligands with distinct pharmacological properties.",

          "abstract": "Chemical feedback is ubiquitous in physiology but is challenging to study without perturbing basal functions. One example is addictive drugs, which elicit a positive-feedback cycle of drug-seeking and ingestion by acting on the brain to increase dopamine signalling 1–3 . However, interfering with this process by altering basal dopamine also adversely affects learning, movement, attention and wakefulness 4 . Here, inspired by physiological control systems, we developed a highly selective synthetic physiology approach to interfere with the positive-feedback cycle of addiction by installing a cocaine-dependent opposing signalling process into this body–brain signalling loop. We used protein engineering to create cocaine-gated ion channels that are selective for cocaine over other drugs and endogenous molecules. Expression of an excitatory cocaine-gated channel in the rat lateral habenula, a brain region that is normally inhibited by cocaine, suppressed cocaine self-administration without affecting food motivation. This artificial cocaine-activated chemogenetic process reduced the cocaine-induced extracellular dopamine rise in the nucleus accumbens. Our results show that cocaine chemogenetics is a selective approach for countering drug reinforcement by clamping dopamine release in the presence of cocaine. In the future, chemogenetic receptors could be developed for additional addictive drugs or hormones and metabolites, which would facilitate efforts to probe their neural circuit mechanisms using a synthetic physiology approach. As these chemogenetic ion channels are specific for cocaine over natural rewards, they may also offer a route towards gene therapies for cocaine addiction.",

They are characterized by topological boundary modes that remain stable under symmetry respecting perturbations 1–4,6–8 . In clean, gapped systems without disorder, the stability of these edge modes is restricted to the zero-temperature manifold; at finite temperatures, interactions with mobile thermal excitations lead to their decay 9–11 . Here we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge mode 12–14 , which is protected by emergent symmetries and persists across the entire spectrum, in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. Through digital quantum simulation of a one-dimensional disorder-free stabilizer Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles for a wide range of initial states. We show that the interaction between these edge modes and bulk excitations can be suppressed by dimerizing the stabilizer strength, leading to an emergent U(1) × U(1) symmetry in the prethermal regime of the system. Furthermore, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence, despite the system being disorder-free and at finite temperature. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach 15–18 to experimentally study topological matter at finite temperature and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived, robust boundary qubits in disorder-free systems.",

          "abstract": "The mechanical properties of metallic materials often degrade under harsh cryogenic conditions, posing challenges for low-temperature infrastructures 1 . Here we introduce a dual-scale atomic-ordering nanostructure, characterized by an exceptionally high number density of co-existing subnanoscale short-range ordering (approximately 2.4 × 10 26 m −3 ) and nanoscale long-range ordering (approximately 4.5 × 10 25 m −3 ) domains, within a metallic solid-solution matrix in a CoNiV-based alloy to improve the synergy of strength and ductility at low temperatures. We observe an ordering-induced increase in dislocation shear stress as well as a more rapid dislocation multiplication owing to the dislocation blocking effect of nanoscale long-range ordering and the associated generation of new dislocations. The latter effect also releases stress concentrations at nanoscale long-range-ordered obstacles that otherwise would promote damage initiation and failure. Consequently, the alloy shows a strength–elongation product of 76 GPa % with a yield strength of approximately 1.2 GPa at 87 K, outperforming materials devoid of such ordering hierarchy, containing only short-range ordered or coherent precipitates of a few tens of nanometres. Our results highlight the impact of dual co-existing chemical ordering on the mechanical properties of complex alloys and offer guidelines to control these ordering states to enhance their mechanical performance for cryogenic applications.",

          "abstract": "Generative models cover various application areas, including image and video synthesis, natural language processing and molecular design, among many others 1–11 . As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge 12–14 . Here we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models 4 , where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create images never seen before following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of the images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multicolour images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, human faces and artworks, following the data distributions of MNIST 15 , Fashion-MNIST 16 , Butterflies-100 17 , Celeb-A datasets 18 , and Van Gogh’s paintings and drawings 19 , respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural-network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate images of handwritten digits and fashion products. In addition, we generated Van Gogh-style artworks using both monochrome and multiwavelength illumination. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient and scalable inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial-intelligence-generated content.",

          "abstract": "To orchestrate ribosomal peptide synthesis, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) must be aminoacylated, with activated amino acids, at their 2′,3′-diol moiety 1,2 , and so the selective aminoacylation of RNA in water is a key challenge that must be resolved to explain the origin of protein biosynthesis. So far, there have been no chemical methods to effectively and selectively aminoacylate RNA-2′,3′-diols with the breadth of proteinogenic amino acids in water 3–5 . Here we demonstrate that (biological) aminoacyl-thiols ( 1 ) react selectively with RNA diols over amine nucleophiles, promoting aminoacylation over adventitious (non-coded) peptide bond formation. Broad side-chain scope is demonstrated, including Ala, Arg, Asp, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser and Val, and Arg aminoacylation is enhanced by unprecedented side-chain nucleophilic catalysis. Duplex formation directs chemoselective 2′,3′-aminoacylation of RNA. We demonstrate that prebiotic nitriles, N -carboxyanhydrides and amino acid anhydrides, as well as biological aminoacyl-adenylates, all react with thiols (including coenzymes A and M) to selectively yield aminoacyl-thiols ( 1 ) in water. Finally, we demonstrate that the switch from thioester to thioacid activation inverts diol/amine selectivity, promoting peptide synthesis in excellent yield. Two-step, one-pot, chemically controlled formation of peptidyl-RNA is observed in water at neutral pH. Our results indicate an important role for thiol cofactors in RNA aminoacylation before the evolution of proteinaceous synthetase enzymes.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear due to incomplete circuit-level MPF characterization7. Here, using integrated neuroanatomical, physiological and behavioural approaches, we construct a comprehensive wiring diagram of the MPF, focused on the dorsal peduncular area (DP)—a poorly understood prefrontal area. We identify its deep (DPd) and superficial (DPs) layers, along with the infralimbic area, as major components of the visceromotor cortex that directly project to hypothalamic and brainstem structures to govern neuroendocrine, sympathetic and parasympathetic output. Notably, the DP functions as a network hub integrating diverse cortical inputs and modulating goal-directed behaviour through a largely unidirectional cortical information flow. On the basis of the mesoscale MPF connectome, we propose a unified network model in which distinct MPF areas orchestrate physiological and behavioural responses to internal and external stimuli.",

          "abstract": "The armoured ankylosaurian dinosaurs are best known from Late Cretaceous Northern Hemisphere ecosystems, but their early evolution in the Early–Middle Jurassic is shrouded in mystery due to a poor fossil record1,2. Spicomellus afer was suggested to be the world’s oldest ankylosaur and the first from Africa, but was based on only a single partial rib from the Middle Jurassic of Morocco3. Here we describe a new, much more complete specimen that confirms the ankylosaurian affinities of Spicomellus, and demonstrates that it has uniquely elaborate dermal armour unlike that of any other vertebrate, extant or extinct. The presence of ‘handle’ vertebrae in the tail of Spicomellus indicates that it possessed a tail weapon, overturning current understanding of tail club evolution in ankylosaurs, as these structures were previously thought to have evolved only in the Early Cretaceous4. This ornate armour may have functioned for display as well as defence, and a later reduction to simpler armour with less extravagant osteoderms in Late Cretaceous taxa might indicate a shift towards a primarily defensive function, perhaps in response to increased predation pressures or a switch to combative courtship displays.",

One such uncharacterized metabolism is the coupling of sulfide oxidation with iron( iii ) oxide reduction, a ubiquitous environmental process hitherto considered to be strictly abiotic 7,8 . Here we present a comprehensive genomic analysis of sulfur metabolism across prokaryotes, and reveal bacteria that are capable of oxidizing sulfide using extracellular solid phase iron( iii ). Based on a phylogenetic framework of over hundred genes involved in dissimilatory transformation of sulfur compounds, we recorded sulfur-cycling capacity in most bacterial and archaeal phyla. Metabolic reconstructions predicted co-occurrence of sulfur compound oxidation and iron( iii ) oxide respiration in diverse members of 37 prokaryotic phyla. Physiological and transcriptomic evidence demonstrated that a cultivated representative, Desulfurivibrio alkaliphilus , grows autotrophically by oxidizing dissolved sulfide or iron monosulfide (FeS) to sulfate with ferrihydrite as an extracellular iron( iii ) electron acceptor. The biological process outpaced the abiotic process at environmentally relevant sulfide concentrations. These findings expand the known diversity of sulfur-cycling microorganisms and unveil a biological mechanism that links sulfur and iron cycling in anoxic environments, thus highlighting the fundamental role of microorganisms in global element cycles.",

Hundreds of synthetic studies towards this end have been disclosed thus far, yet, a fully modular and scalable approach to the family remains elusive4-12.

Yet globally consistent LSP mapping has been hampered by methods that struggle to represent the full range of seasonal phenologies occurring across terrestrial biomes 14 , especially the subtle and complex phenologies of many arid and tropical ecosystems 1,15,16 . Here, using a data-driven analysis of satellite imagery to map LSP worldwide, we provide insights into Earth’s phenological diversity, documenting both intercontinental convergence between similar climates and regional heterogeneity associated with topoclimate, ecohydrology and vegetation structure. We then map spatial phenological asynchrony and the modes of asynchronous seasonality that control it, identifying hotspots of asynchrony in tropical mountains and Mediterranean climate regions and reporting evidence for the hypothesis that climatically similar sites exhibit greater phenological asynchrony within the tropics. Finally, we find that our global LSP map predicts complex geographical discontinuities in flowering phenology, genetic divergence and even harvest seasonality across a range of taxa, establishing remote sensing as a crucial tool for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of allochrony by allopatry.",

Therefore, the development of advanced technologies making use of chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and controlling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond timescales. Such endeavours have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized circularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been overcome 1,2 . Here we introduce chiroptical spectroscopy with attosecond pulses and demonstrate attosecond coherent control over photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) 3,4 , as well as the measurement of chiral asymmetries in the forward–backward and angle-resolved photoionization delays of chiral molecules. We show that co-rotating attosecond and near-infrared (IR) pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign compared with single-photon ionization. We demonstrate that chiral photoionization delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of photoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring 3D momentum resolution. We measure forward–backward chiral-sensitive delays of up to 60 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionization delays of up to 240 as, which include an asymmetry of about 60 as originating from chirality in the continuum–continuum transitions. Attosecond chiroptical spectroscopy opens the door to quantitatively understanding and controlling the dynamics of chiral molecules on the electronic timescale.",

          "abstract": "Prenatal stress (PS) is a repeated exposure to aversive situations during pregnancy, including high emotional strain, which is suspected to affect homeostatic systems in infants. Paediatric eczema develops quickly after birth at flexural sites subjected to continuous mechanical constraints1,2. Although epidemiological studies have suggested an association between PS and a higher risk of eczema in children3,4,5,6, no causative biological link has yet been identified. Here we show that eczema at birth originates from molecular dysregulations of neuroimmune circuits in utero, triggered by fluctuations in the maternal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. We found that offspring of stressed pregnant dams have dysregulated mast cells and skin-projecting neurons and quickly develop eczema in response to harmless mechanical friction. We demonstrated that PS transiently modulates amniotic fluid corticosterone concentrations, which directly alters the activation program of skin mast cells expressing the glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 and the adjacent sensory neurons conveying mechanosensation. Therapeutic normalization of maternal corticosterone concentrations or genetic depletion of Mcpt5+ mast cells during stressed gestation prevents fetal immune dysregulation and protects against eczema development after birth. Our findings support a new model in which early-onset paediatric eczema originates from dysregulations in the fetal immune system, caused by fluctuations in maternal glucocorticoids induced by stress.",

          "abstract": "Our knowledge of the brain processes that govern vision is largely derived from studying primates, whose hierarchically organized visual system 1 inspired the architecture of deep neural networks 2 . This raises questions about the universality of such hierarchical structures. Here we examined the large-scale functional organization for vision in one of the closest living relatives to primates, the tree shrew. We performed Neuropixels recordings 3,4 across many cortical and thalamic areas spanning the tree shrew ventral visual system while presenting a large battery of visual stimuli in awake tree shrews. We found that receptive field size, response latency and selectivity for naturalistic textures, compared with spectrally matched noise 5 , all increased moving anteriorly along the tree shrew visual pathway, consistent with a primate-like hierarchical organization 6,7 . However, tree shrew area V2 already harboured a high-level representation of complex objects. First, V2 encoded a complete representation of a high-level object space 8 . Second, V2 activity supported the most accurate object decoding and reconstruction among all tree shrew visual areas. In fact, object decoding accuracy from tree shrew V2 was comparable to that in macaque posterior IT and substantially higher than that in macaque V2. Finally, starting in V2, we found strongly face-selective cells resembling those reported in macaque inferotemporal cortex 9 . Overall, these findings show how core computational principles of visual form processing found in primates are conserved, yet hierarchically compressed, in a small but highly visual mammal.",

Although it has long been hypothesized that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of interface cells showed elliptical nuclei, suggestive of mechanical confinement by the adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including the acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs the contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2 high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug-resistant. Our results implicate the mechanical microenvironment as a mechanism that drives phenotype switching in melanoma.",

          "abstract": "The forthcoming sixth-generation and beyond wireless networks are poised to operate across an expansive frequency range—from microwave, millimetre wave to terahertz bands—to support ubiquitous connectivity in diverse application scenarios 1–3 . This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management 4 . However, existing electrical or photonic-assisted solutions face a lot of challenges in meeting this demand because of the limited bandwidths of the devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of system architectures 5 . Here we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless system. Leveraging the Pockels effect and scalability of the TFLN platform, we achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including baseband modulation, broadband wireless–photonic conversion and reconfigurable carrier and local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high-frequency stability and consistent coherence. Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we realize full-link wireless communication across nine consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a crucial ability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum environments. Our proposed system represents a marked step towards future full-spectrum and omni-scenario wireless networks.",

          "abstract": "Solution-processed semiconductor lasers promise lightweight, wearable and scalable optoelectronic applications. Among the gain media for solution-processed lasers, metal halide perovskites stand out as an exceptional class because of their ability to achieve wavelength-adjustable, low-threshold lasing under optical pumping 1–8 . Despite the progress in this field, electrically driven lasing from perovskite semiconductors remains a critical challenge. Here we demonstrate an electrically driven perovskite laser, constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED (PeLED) sub-unit. Under pulsed electrical excitation, the dual-cavity perovskite device shows a minimum lasing threshold of 92 A cm −2 (average threshold: 129 A cm −2 , at about 22 °C, in air), which is an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art electrically driven organic lasers 9,10 . Key to this demonstration is the integrated dual-cavity device architecture, which allows the microcavity PeLED sub-unit to deliver directional emission into the single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit (at a coupling efficiency of about 82.7%) to establish the lasing action. An operational half-life ( T 50 ) of 1.8 h (6.4 × 10 4 voltage pulses at 10 Hz) is achieved, outperforming the stability of electrically pumped organic lasers 9,10 . The dual-cavity perovskite laser can be rapidly modulated at a bandwidth of 36.2 MHz, indicating its potential for data transmission and computational applications.",

However, the vast excess of niche cells relative to HSCs challenges this perspective. To rigorously define the role of niche size in regulating HSC numbers, we developed a femur-transplantation system, enabling us to increase available HSC niches. Notably, the addition of niches did not alter the total HSC numbers in the body, suggesting the presence of a systemic mechanism that limits HSC numbers. Additionally, HSC numbers in transplanted wild-type femurs did not exceed physiological levels when HSCs were mobilized from defective endogenous niches to the periphery, indicating that HSC numbers are constrained at the local level as well. The notion of dual restrictions at systemic and local levels was further supported by other experimental approaches, including parabiosis and non-conditioned transfer of HSCs after bone transplantation. Moreover, we found that thrombopoietin has a pivotal role in determining the total number of HSCs in the body, even in the context of increased niche availability. Our study redefines key principles underlying HSC number regulation, providing insights into this critical biological process.",

This exploration–exploitation dilemma has been studied extensively in paradigms involving positive outcomes, and neural correlates have been identified in frontal cortices and subcortical structures2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, including the amygdala12. Importantly, exploration is just as essential for survival or well-being when trying to avoid negative outcomes, yet we do not know whether the single-neuron mechanisms that drive exploration are shared across positive and negative environments. Here we examined the dynamics of exploration when human participants engaged in a probabilistic learning task with intermixed loss and gain trials, while simultaneously recording single-neuron activity. We show that neurons of the amygdala and temporal cortex modulate their activity before a decision to explore in both loss and gain. Moreover, we find that humans exhibit more exploration when trying to avoid losses, and that an increase in the levels of noise in amygdala neurons contributes to this behaviour. Overall, we report that human exploration is driven by two distinct neural mechanisms, a valence-independent rate signal and a valence-dependent global noise signal. The results suggest a link between the heightened amygdala activity observed in mood disorders13,14 and higher exploration rates15,16,17 that underlie maladaptive and even pathological behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Quantum mechanics is unquestionably a robust and successful theory — so far, all its predictions have held, and scientists can build powerful technologies based on it. Yet, understanding what it tells us about the nature of reality and how we experience it has proven tricky. Physicists and philosophers have been grappling with it for a century, ironing out some of the early ambiguities, but some conceptual problems remain. And the non-intuitive nature of quantum physics makes it fertile ground for misunderstandings. Here, six physicists explore the origins of widespread myths about quantum history, theory and applications.\n\nMARIA VIOLARIS: Has quantum physics made time travel possible?\n\nIf you’ve been following quantum-science announcements in the past few years, you might think that experiments have managed to send quantum particles back in time. But despite intriguing theoretical proposals and experimental studies, that has not been achieved (yet).\n\nThe idea relies on exploiting quantum ‘time loops’ — hypothetical twists in space-time that allow a particle, or anything else, to come out of the loop at an earlier time than when it went in. These loops could exist in the Universe, for example through tunnels in the fabric of space-time.\n\nA century of quantum physics\n\nThe recent proposals were based on quantum teleportation of qubits, in which the state of a qubit is transported from one location to another, without physically moving between them. This can be done by using an entangled pair of qubits, one at each location.\n\nHowever, to avoid violating core principles, such as no faster-than-light communication, quantum teleportation can be successful at most only one-quarter of the time. For the remainder, the receiver needs to correct its teleported qubit using information from the sender. But researchers are looking into an alternative approach, in which they discard these failed cases, keeping only the successful one-quarter.\n\nThis selective version of teleportation has been proposed as a model for a quantum universe that allows time travel. Such a Universe could have laws of physics that automatically discard any paradoxical outcome arising from something changing the past. By following a similar protocol, but instead manually discarding certain measurement outcomes, researchers have achieved a quantum advantage in the field of metrology (the science of making precise measurements).\n\nThe experimental results look identical to those that would come from a real time loop, but the behaviour has been engineered from quantum entanglement. So, no one has really sent a particle to the past quite yet. But the general theory of relativity allows for time travel — and quantum models give promising ways to resolve its paradoxes. Quantum mechanics therefore could yet make time travel possible — but I’d need to read a paper sent back from the future to be sure.\n\nESTELLE INACK: Can quantum computers guarantee speedier calculations?\n\nThe promise of quantum computers and their abilities to solve a host of intensive computational problems — from how the quantum behaviour of electrons affects chemical reactions to optimizing routes in logistics — has spurred a booming industry that is attracting billions of dollars of investor cash. As excitement has grown, so has a misunderstanding about how quantum computers work, why they are potentially so powerful and fast at making calculations and what their limitations might be. It’s one thing to have a quantum computer, but another to extract the right answer for a complex calculation out of it. And it won’t simply speed up every existing application — we are not likely to need ‘quantum Word’ or ‘quantum Zoom’. Instead, they are promising tools for exploring very complex systems.\n\nQuantum devices are sometimes said to offer power and speed by relying on quantum bits (qubits) that are both 0 and 1 at the same time; by contrast, classical bits are either 0 or 1. This is misleading. What happens instead is that a qubit exists in a superposition of 0 and 1 classical states. And each time a measurement is taken, it has a probability of being measured as either 0 or 1.\n\nCould the Universe be a giant quantum computer?\n\nWhen putting many qubits together, say N of them, to form a quantum computer, their quantum superposition spans the same mathematical space as 2N classical bits; this is often referred to as quantum parallelism with exponential speed-up. When a quantum computation is performed, the system outputs one single state from those 2N possible ones.\n\nThe computation must be repeated many times (although fewer than 2N times, which would be impossible when N is large) to build a probabilistic picture of the system: the outcome with the highest probability gives you the correct answer. This overhead could reduce the advantages of quantum computers over classical computers. Algorithms that increase the probability of obtaining the correct (most likely) outcomes from each calculation are crucial.\n\nAnother limitation of quantum computers is that quantum states are very fragile and need to be protected from interactions with their environment, which can disrupt them. Researchers are exploring clever ways to do this through error-mitigating algorithms.\n\nThus, quantum computers are indeed powerful machines that rely on quantum superposition and parallelism — but innovations in algorithms, hardware and software are also needed to harness their full potential.\n\nSABINE HOSSENFELDER: Did Einstein reject the idea of entanglement?\n\nYou might have heard that what Albert Einstein referred to as ‘spooky action at a distance’ is technically known as ‘entanglement’, and that he insisted that entanglement couldn’t exist. Neither is true.\n\nThe ‘spooky action’ quote is a direct translation of the German phrase spukhafte Fernwirkung, which Einstein wrote in a 1947 letter to fellow physicist Max Born. He was referring to an idea that had long intrigued him — how to interpret the measurement process in quantum mechanics, which he had earlier described as relying on a “peculiar mechanism of action at a distance” (G. Bacciagaluppi and A. Valentini Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/p2ns; 2006).\n\nMathematically, the measurement process in quantum mechanics is instantaneous. Say you want to measure the position of a particle. Before you do so, the equations allow the particle to be in several places at the same time. Observe or measure it, however, and suddenly it is in only one place.\n\nDon’t believe the hype — quantum tech can’t yet solve real-world problems\n\nThis issue of reality apparently suddenly materializing out of uncertainty when you observe it is known as the measurement problem. The update happens faster than light, seemingly violating Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which says that no signal can exceed light speed. Of course, Einstein didn’t like it. That is why, together with physicists Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, Einstein argued in 1935 that quantum mechanics must be an “incomplete” theory (A. Einstein et al. Phys. Rev. 47, 777; 1935), in which measurement is just a probabilistic description of an underlying physical reality.\n\nThat same year, Erwin Schrödinger coined the term ‘entanglement’ to describe a correlation between two or more objects about which one has incomplete knowledge. You could, for example, have two particles, one on the left and one on the right, that can each have a state (usually physicists consider the property of ‘spin’, but it could be something else, such as momentum) of either +1 or –1, and both values must add up to 0. So, either the left particle has spin –1 and the one on the right spin +1, or the other way around.\n\nIn an experiment, you can flip the spin of one particle, say the left one, even without knowing what it is. If it was –1, it is now +1; if it was +1, it is now –1. If you do that, what happens to the particle on the right side? Nothing. The other particle itself has not changed, and the two particles are still entangled — just the correlation between them has changed. You have changed an entangled system into a different, also entangled system. There is no ‘spooky action’ in entanglement, no exchange of information that is faster than the speed of light.\n\nI think the reason why even some physicists get this mixed up is that in their 1935 paper, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen used what we now call ‘entangled particles’ to illustrate the problem with the instantaneous update of a system on measurement. The two concepts — measurement and entanglement — became entangled, so to speak.\n\nEinstein never claimed that entanglement, or quantum physics itself, is wrong. What he did was question the physical interpretation of the measurement: that a quantum system seems to exist in several possible superposed states but updates to a different state as soon as you observe it. That is an issue that still hasn’t been resolved.\n\nIllustration: Sandro Rybak\nNORMA SANCHEZ: Is general relativity irreconcilable with quantum physics?\n\nPhysicists have devised two grand theories to understand reality. The general theory of relativity dominates how things happen at large scales, such as across the cosmos. Quantum mechanics, meanwhile, covers atom-sized forces or smaller. Many physicists quibble that they might never be reconciled — although we have no real indication that it is not possible. In the past few years, progress and the potential for new observations, such as those of gravitational waves, gives me hope that we won’t need a completely new theory to encompass both.\n\nIn their current form, these theories produce pictures that are completely at odds with each other, impractical or unintelligible. Gravity, for example, is well explained by the general theory of relativity as a curvature of space-time in the presence of massive bodies. But because this formalism considers particles to have non-zero mass concentrated to a single point (with zero volume), following it at subatomic scales would make gravity infinite, which makes no sense.\n\nThe ‘quantum’ principle that says why atoms are as they are\n\nThere have been many attempts to reconcile the two frameworks. One is string theory — in which particles and forces arise from the vibrations of tiny one-dimensional ‘strings’. But this theory has run into problems: it does not explain the observed expansion of the Universe, or its structure, and no direct experiments have supported it. Other approaches that start with classical gravity and try to ‘quantize’ it have not succeeded either.",

          "title": "How did life get multicellular? Five simple organisms could have the answer",
          "authors": "Alla Katsnelson",
          "abstract": "For some three billion years, unicellular organisms ruled Earth. Then, around one billion years ago, a new chapter of life began. Early attempts at team living began to stick, paving the way for the evolution of complex organisms, including animals, plants and fungi.\n\nAcross all known life, the move to multicellularity happened at least 40 times, suggests one study1. But, in animals, it seems to have occurred only once.\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, researchers interested in this remarkable event made a series of unexpected discoveries. The prevailing view held that a flood of genes had to evolve to enable the key properties of multicellularity2: the ability of cells to stick together, communication using molecular signals and the coordinated regulation of gene expression that causes each cell to specialize and take its position in the organism. But studies found that some unicellular organisms express a slew of proteins that control key properties of multicellularity in animals3,4. The molecular toolkit required for multicellularity seems to have existed well before the first animals came to be.\n\n“This work has rewritten our understanding of animal origins,” says William Ratcliff, an evolutionary biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. “And it makes us ask different questions.”\n\nThe two teams behind much of this research were led by evolutionary biologist and geneticist Nicole King at the University of California, Berkeley, and by evolutionary biologist Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain. They have since expanded into a small community of scientists that has developed more than a dozen of these species into model organisms. All of these species are eukaryotes, which are distinct from prokaryotes in that they have a nucleus, and belong to lineages closely related to animals: choanoflagellates, filastereans, ichthyosporeans and corallochytreans (see ‘Animals’ unicellular relatives’). Many of the model species dabble in multicellularity by occasionally forming colonies.\n\nSource: Ruiz-Trillo, I. et al. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 77, 499–516 (2023).\n\nPart of what makes these organisms so interesting is how different they are — in appearance, life stages and genetic make-up — researchers say. Each of the organisms, five of which are featured here, offers a peek into the evolutionary paths that could have led to animals. Looking across several lineages to piece together this event has become “the philosophy of this scientific community”, says molecular biologist Elena Casacuberta, who jointly runs the laboratory in Barcelona with Ruiz-Trillo. “Only with a comparative approach can we attempt to have a more accurate picture.”\n\nThe top model\nWhen the single-celled choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta divides in the presence of bacteria, its daughter cells form a rosette pattern.Credit: Mark Dayel\n\nSalpingoeca rosetta was among the organisms that King investigated in her early work on multicellularity. It belongs to the choanoflagellates, which are the closest living relatives of animals. This group diverged from a common ancestor with animals more than 600 million years ago.\n\nLike other choanoflagellates, S. rosetta has a spherical cell body that sports a collar of thin membrane protrusions called microvilli, which are used to capture bacteria swept up for dinner by a long tail (known as a flagellum). It was isolated in 2000 from mudflats off the coast of Virginia; researchers haven’t managed to find it again in the wild. Under certain environmental conditions, S. rosetta cells divide clonally, producing genetically identical daughter cells that form colonies by circling up in a rosette pattern, with flagella undulating outward. But when King first started working with the organism in the lab, she could not budge it from its unicellular form. A chance experiment revealed that secretions by a specific prey bacterium act as a signal for the cells to start dividing.\n\nA ‘lost world’ of early microbes thrived one billion years ago\n\nIn addition to forming rosettes, the organism has at least one other multicellular conformation and a few distinct free-living cell types. When confined to a tight space, for example, S. rosetta cells withdraw their flagella and become amoeboid, lacking a firm shape and extending slender tentacles called filopodia to pull themselves along.\n\n“It has such an amazing diversity in response to a myriad of environmental cues,” says David Booth, a biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn 2003, King and her colleagues reported the presence of proteins involved in cell adhesion and cell signalling in choanoflagellate species3. They later identified a more in-depth toolkit for multicellularity when they sequenced the genome of S. rosetta5.\n\nSalpingoeca rosetta is the Drosophila of choanoflagellates — the most widely studied species and the one for which researchers have developed the most extensive tools for directly altering the genome. In 2018, during a postdoc in King’s lab, Booth and his colleagues managed to add DNA encoding fluorescent proteins into S. rosetta6 and, in 2020, found ways to edit its genome using CRISPR7. Such methods have made it possible to tinker directly with genes that researchers say could be key to multicellularity — and to study the proteins that those genes express.\n\nWith the tools’ help, microbiologist Arielle Woznica at the University of Texas at Austin, a former graduate student in King’s lab, is exploring how choanoflagellates respond to bacterial attackers. Biochemist Florentine Rutaganira, a former postdoc in King’s lab now at Stanford University in California, is investigating enzymes called tyrosine kinases — linchpins of cell signalling in animals that are present in similar numbers in S. rosetta.\n\nMaster aggregator\nEnvironmental cues can trigger aggregation in Capsaspora owczarzaki.Credit: H. Suga et al./Nature Commun.\n\nCapsaspora owczarzaki is a member of the filasterean lineage, which diverged from a common ancestor with animals perhaps a couple of hundred million years earlier than did choanoflagellates.\n\nRuiz-Trillo first became interested in the organism as a postdoc, just as King’s lab was setting up to study S. rosetta. He and his colleagues found that C. owczarzaki, too, seemed to be closely related to animals4. Ruiz-Trillo set out to study lineages other than choanoflagellates, because investigating several lineages could provide a fuller picture of the shared ancestor with animals. After sequencing the genome of C. owczarzaki, Ruiz-Trillo and his team reported in 2013 that it has many genes related to multicellularity, including some that choanoflagellates lack — such as those that encode cell-surface proteins called integrins, which help cells to stick to each other and to their environment8.\n\nThese bizarre ancient species are rewriting animal evolution\n\nDiscovered in 2002 inside a freshwater snail, C. owczarzaki spends most of its life cycle as a unicellular amoeba, but environmental cues can push the cells into a multicellular phase in which clusters swarm together and fuse into increasingly large aggregates. This path to multicellularity is different from the clustering through clonal division observed in choanoflagellates. Ruiz-Trillo says that clonal division is “the standard way in which people were thinking animals evolve”.\n\nDuring development in animals, a single cell divides into many cells with identical genomes, a process that probably avoids any genetic conflict arising between cells. It’s therefore an easy leap to assume that clonal division was also the evolutionary path to the first animals, Ruiz-Trillo says. But aggregation exists in many eukaryotic lineages as a fast and easy way for cells to form 3D structures, and he thinks this mechanism deserves a closer look.\n\nRuiz-Trillo and his colleagues found that C. owczarzaki uses some key genes related to multicellularity during this aggregated phase9. Perhaps aggregation was the essential step in the evolution of animals, Ruiz-Trillo says, or perhaps it was just one part of the process.\n\nCapsaspora owczarzaki is one of a handful of unicellular species that Casacuberta and Ruiz-Trillo happily send to other labs on request.\n\nThe dualist\nIn water from a tide pool, a colony of Choanoeca flexa cells that has taken on a cupped shape reverses its curvature. Another colony joins it, and their curvatures reverse again.Credit: Benjamin T. Larson\n\nThe serendipitous discovery in 2017 of another species of choanoflagellate, Choanoeca flexa, demonstrated how much variation exists in this group alone. Thibaut Brunet, an evolutionary cell biologist now at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, found C. flexa in Curaçao, with his colleagues while attending a workshop as postdoc in King’s lab. After collecting water samples from shallow marine tide pools while touring the island, he and his colleagues gaped at the scene under the microscope.\n\nIndividual cells, which look much like S. rosetta cells, form a cupped monolayer sheet, with all the flagella pointing in the same direction10. In response to light or darkness, “they could reverse their curvature in a few seconds, flipping inside out like a child’s toy or an umbrella”, says Brunet. “We were screaming and jumping up and down when we saw it — we were probably ridiculous.”\n\nThe secret lives of cells — as never seen before\n\nAlthough researchers are still developing methods to manipulate its genome, C. flexa has at least one big benefit as a model organism. Other organisms have been studied only in the lab after they were discovered, says evolutionary biologist Núria Ros-Rocher, a postdoc in Brunet’s lab. Researchers don’t know how or where to find them again. But C. flexa has been retrieved repeatedly from the tide pools in which it was first found. “We were very lucky, because we could go back to the natural environment to understand how it’s linked to the organism’s multicellular behaviour,” says Ros-Rocher.\n\nThose pools face whiplash changes — water often heats up and evaporates within days, leaving the organism afloat in sharply elevated salinity or beached on dried mud before the tide submerges it again. Brunet and his team found that C. flexa, like S. rosetta, can go from a unicellular to multicellular state by clonal division. But it can use aggregation, too, and sometimes combines both strategies at once.",

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.\n\nScientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.\n\nThe team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\n“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.\n\nOnly OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.\n\nThe study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.\n\nWhat’s behind the trend?\n\nAlthough the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.\n\nSecond, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.\n\nJan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.",

This evolution required muscle and skeletal adaptations — the human pelvis has a wide bowl-like shape that supports the weight of internal organs when the body is upright, whereas other living primates have a flatter, narrower pelvis. Writing in Nature, Senevirathne et al.1 describe their investigation of the developmental processes that underlie the distinctive shape of the human pelvis, reporting how these compare with those of primates that walk on four limbs. The authors also explore the genetics of this innovation.",

          "authors": "Maina Vakafua Talia",
          "abstract": "The salt spray of the Pacific Ocean is in my blood; I grew up watching the tides shape the shores of the islands of Tuvalu. But now, those tides are rising relentlessly, eroding lands, swallowing homes, decimating livelihoods and washing away the futures of communities. Entire islands are sinking. One-third of Tuvalu’s citizens are seeking ‘climate refuge’ in Australia.\n\nClimate change is not a distant threat; it is our daily reality.\n\nBut there is hope. At the end of July, in The Hague, the Netherlands, I bore witness to a historic moment. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered the advisory opinion that states have a legal duty to prevent climate harm and, importantly, that they can be held accountable for the consequences of their actions, through financial compensation or other forms of restitution.\n\nA message from island leaders: protect the Pacific Ocean from deep-sea mining\n\nThe ruling means that climate justice is no longer simply a moral obligation, but a matter of international law. This feels like a seismic shift. The relentless cries from front-line communities across the Pacific, who have long borne the brunt of a crisis we did not create, have been heard.\n\nThe ICJ offered clarity on fossil fuels in particular: producing, licensing and subsidizing them could constitute an “internationally wrongful act” for which states can be held liable under international law. Nations have a duty to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions — and the court highlighted the legal liability that could arise from expanding fossil-fuel infrastructure in the face of clear scientific warnings.\n\nIt is especially powerful that this legal breakthrough stems from the efforts of small island nations, launched by courageous Pacific youth in 2019, initially in Vanuatu then through cross-border collaborations. It is a reminder that those most affected by the climate crisis are also among the most determined in addressing it. Through efforts ranging from grassroots movements to international diplomacy, Pacific island nations have charted a path that places justice at the centre of climate governance. This is a powerful example of vulnerable voices driving transformative change at the highest levels of international law.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nThe ICJ also emphasized that cooperation between states is central to meaningful climate action, and identified treaties as a crucial tool for coordinated implementation. This gives wind to the sails of emerging legal instruments. A fossil-fuel non-proliferation treaty has been proposed, for example, that would provide legal grounding for states to pursue coordinated, binding action on a fossil-fuel phase-out and a just transition to renewable energy. It is currently supported by 17 nations, including Tuvalu, that are shaping the treaty proposal and discussing how to involve others and initiate a formal negotiation process. A high-level ministerial meeting in Belém, Brazil, in November, has been planned alongside the COP30 climate talks to move the process forward.",

Just as beers come in different flavours, so do beer enthusiasts. That’s according to researchers who found that beer drinkers tasting a series of lagers fall into two distinct categories: those who prefer strong-flavoured chemicals and those who prefer mellow ones.\n\nThe team reported its findings on 18 August at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington DC.\n\nHow we taste sweetness: long-sought structure of human receptor mapped at last\n\nWhen taste-testing a new beer, researchers tend to rely on trained panelists who can pick out citrus or floral notes in the same way a sommelier can with wine. Devin Peterson, a food scientist at the Ohio State University in Columbus, wanted to go beyond the professionals, to learn what the average beer enthusiast is drawn to, for a better “understanding of what’s driving consumer behaviour”, he told Nature.\n\nSo he and his colleagues tasked about 135 self-proclaimed beer enthusiasts with trying 18 different lagers across 3 tasting sessions and rating them. To level the playing field, the team ensured that the competing beers contained similar percentages of alcohol and had somewhat similar levels of bitterness. Participants evaluated characteristics such as the beers’ sweetness and aroma intensity, and the researchers used mass spectrometry to determine each beer’s predominant flavour chemicals.\n\nThe tasters split into two factions on the basis of their beer rankings, the team found. For the group that preferred stronger flavours, brands such as Samuel Adams and Brooklyn were at the top of the list, and Budweiser was near the bottom. Those who enjoyed a mellower-tasting beer placed the same brands in nearly opposite spots. The two groups are “polar opposites in how they’re responding to the product”, Peterson said during the presentation.",

          "authors": "Elena Hoffer",
          "abstract": "The professional-networking site LinkedIn can be useful for finding like-minded people around the globe.Credit: Yalcin Sonat/Alamy\n\nWhen I started my PhD in 2018, I thought LinkedIn was for only business people — dry, corporate and dominated by people bragging about their latest achievement. I couldn’t imagine spending time on it. But by the end of my PhD in 2023, the networking site had opened doors I didn’t even know existed. So what changed?\n\nDuring my doctorate at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, I helped to organize careers events for PhD students, inviting speakers who had transitioned into jobs outside academia.\n\nI did this because I had seen so many brilliant scientists leave academia not because they weren’t good enough, but because they were exhausted or felt unsupported. But when they tried to leave, there was no guidance or roadmap.\n\nI realized that, if I cared so much about this issue, maybe I should do something about it, so I founded a company to provide a better support system.\n\nBuilding a company means building connections, and I had been told repeatedly: ‘Without a network, you won’t get anywhere.’ So I started looking for one — and that’s how I ended up on LinkedIn.\n\nIt felt a little scary at first — a global platform with one billion users, but with an open structure in which technically anyone can interact with anyone. I started using LinkedIn to find other company founders and like-minded people. One of these was Angela Priest, a hiring manager with two decades of experience building high-performing teams in industry. We met online and both knew right away that we were a great match. We shared professional values, drive and a deep desire to make things better.\n\nWe co-founded Alma.Me in 2024. Our mission is to provide early-career researchers with the tools and knowledge they need to quickly land a job in industry. We do this mainly through suggesting improvements to industry CVs, interview preparation and one-to-one coaching, guiding PhD graduates on how to effectively market themselves to a business audience.\n\nFounding Alma.Me opened the next door. It brought me back to the Karolinska Institute and to its head of doctoral education, Robert (Bob) Harris, who had placed my doctor’s hat on my head during the PhD graduation ceremony six months earlier — a monumental moment for me. I remember thinking: ‘This is the man I need to talk to.’ He’s in charge of doctoral education, so I knew I needed to get him to understand how important career preparation is for new graduates.\n\nBut how do you reach someone like him once you’ve left the university? The answer was through LinkedIn. I started by commenting on a few of his posts, and eventually suggested meeting up for a chat over coffee.\n\nThat conversation changed everything. Bob agreed with Alma.Me’s mission. He truly cares about students. Thanks to him, Alma.Me now offers a career-development course — accredited by the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System —at the Karolinska, something I had never imagined would be possible.\n\nAt that point, I had already achieved some important goals: launching a business with Angela, providing services to help PhD students to transition into careers and getting our course included at a prominent medical university.\n\nBut I didn’t stop there. Bob and I shared a vision for something bigger. Career development was one piece of the puzzle, but we both knew there was more to improve. The question was: how can one or two voices make a difference? We imagined a global collective of people who wanted to rethink the academic ecosystem. So we turned to our networks — especially LinkedIn — and, almost magically, we started finding them.\n\nThat’s how the Academic Think Tank (TATT) was born earlier this year. TATT brings together a select group of researchers, educators and entrepreneurs from all corners of the world with a shared vision of rethinking what academia 2.0 could look like: inclusive, sustainable and human.\n\nWe met five of our ten TATT members through LinkedIn. Our one selection criterion was simple: you have to care. You have to want to improve things and deeply want to make a difference for the people in the system. Our members span the globe — from Texas to Osaka, Japan. I would never have met these people in real life, but LinkedIn made it easy.\n\nElena Hoffer used LinkedIn to help build her business Alma.Me.Credit: Angela Priest",

          "authors": "Esme Hedley",
          "abstract": "Influenced by economic, social and environmental factors, criminal behaviour is a complex phenomenon. Academics across disciplines as varied as sociology, geography, mathematics and psychology work to understand why and how individuals become involved in and experience the criminal justice system. They also seek to develop strategies for crime prevention, intervention and rehabilitation, and to understand the effectiveness of criminal-justice policies.\n\nIt is important work: globally, around 11 million people are held in penal institutions. And in much of the world, numbers are rising. Many of these correctional facilities are severely overcrowded and deny incarcerated individuals access to food and basic medical care. Estimated government spending per person in prison per day is around €13 (US$15) in Bulgaria, compared with €532 in Norway. Such differences can reflect a country’s approach to punishment and rehabilitation.\n\nScience diversified: The roads less travelled to research careers\n\nThe hidden costs of incarceration include financial and economic pressures faced by family members with a loved one in prison, as well as the psychological toll and social stigma that can come from being incarcerated. In the United States alone, mass incarceration costs the federal government and the families of those involved with the justice system at least $182 billion every year, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a public-policy think tank in Easthampton, Massachusetts.\n\nUndertaking research projects with incarcerated individuals can be particularly affecting. “One of the most significant difficulties as a researcher is navigating the tension between academic objectivity and the emotionally charged narratives that you encounter,” says Kanupriya Sharma, a criminologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, who interviewed imprisoned women in India as part of her PhD work at the University of Cambridge, UK.\n\nStrong networks are essential for this work, and are often used to find and build trust with those working in, or interacting with, the justice system.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to three academics who study crime and criminal-justice systems to gain a better understanding of what it is like to work in these complex and often politicized areas of research.\n\nSADÉ LINDSAY: The pendulum of support\n\nSociologist and assistant professor of public policy and sociology at the Brooks School of Public Policy, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.\n\nMy connection to criminal justice and criminology comes from growing up in a highly disadvantaged and racially segregated neighbourhood in Columbus, Ohio. I have family members who have been caught in a cycle that has shifted them in and out of the prison system. My work revolves around that same system, focusing particularly on how policies and practices, mainly in the context of the United States, shape individuals’ opportunities, health and well-being. These strategies dictate, for example, where people can work after they have been incarcerated, and whether they have access to public goods and services. I tend to focus on racial and ethnic inequalities in these policies, and around drugs and substance use, as well as on alternatives to incarceration.\n\nSade Lindsay is studying the impacts of racial and ethnic disparities in drug-diversion programmes in the United States.Credit: Christian Harsa\n\nI’m currently working on a project with Ohio State University in Columbus looking at the causes and consequences of racial and ethnic disparities in drug-diversion programmes. These offer long-term drug treatment and court supervision instead of a jail sentence. They emerged out of the crack-cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and really took off during the current opioid crisis in the United States. But despite this crisis starting to affect Black and Hispanic folks more than white individuals, especially in Ohio, people of colour are very under-represented in these programmes. Instead, they’re often simply sent to prison, where they might receive treatment but only after completing most or all of their sentence. We’re trying to understand why, through qualitative interviews with participants in the drug courts, and by talking to the judges, coordinators, counsellors and probation officers who run them.\n\nPolitical support for prison reform can swing like a pendulum. We’re seeing the pendulum swing now; the will to support people with criminal records is weakening. There was a real risk of our grant being targeted by one of US President Donald Trump’s many executive orders, especially given that the same funding mechanism was discontinued during Trump’s first term, and we’ve had to change some of our reporting to comply with new federal rules.\n\nScience behind bars: How a Turkish physicist wrote research papers in prison\n\nOur role as researchers is to keep doing the work and keep collecting the evidence, even when the political winds aren’t blowing in our favour. Because that’s how real, lasting change happens — not just through policy changes, but through persistent effort that outlasts any single administration that might come and undo things. It might get trickier to find funding for my research, but there are still foundations and private philanthropists who deeply value this work and are committed to supporting it. The real challenge might be whether drug-treatment courts will remain as willing to open their doors and share their expertise. But that’s exactly why this research is so important.\n\nI’m a researcher because I’m a problem solver. The opportunity to use my research to elevate the voices of folks who would otherwise not be in policy conversations is one of my favourite parts of the job.\n\nI run into lots of people at conferences now who have a connection to the justice system, through their own experience or by way of family or friends. It’s a great thing in criminal-justice work that more of the people doing the research are those who have been affected.\n\nKANUPRIYA SHARMA: Listen to your gut\n\nCriminologist and postdoctoral research fellow in the School of Sociology and Social Policy at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\nWhile conducting fieldwork in India for my master’s degree at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, I visited women’s prisons thinking that I would hear stories of pain and trauma. Instead, I found that all the women wanted to talk about was love. Many had regained their sense of agency and a feeling of freedom while in prison by entering into romantic relationships with men — whether ones held in different jails, or male security guards or men outside. How imprisoned women formed these relationships intrigued me and became central to my research, and through my PhD thesis I aimed to understand this phenomenon more deeply. I interviewed 127 women across Punjab and Rajasthan, who were imprisoned in barracks located inside male prison complexes or in open, gender-neutral prisons, to explore their pathways to prison and experiences of incarceration.\n\nKanupriya Sharma, a criminologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, highlighted the tensions that can arise between academic objectivity and ‘emotionally charged narratives’.Credit: Kanupriya Sharma\n\nMy doctorate looked at how these women leveraged their social networks, inside and outside prison, to forge intimate relationships with men. Many of the women I spoke with, regardless of whether they were housed in women’s barracks inside male prison complexes or in all-women facilities, encountered male prisoners during court visits when they were transported in the same prison van or held in the same court lock-up during their hearing. They also communicated with men through letters exchanged across facilities, and were often introduced to men outside during visitation hours by fellow female prisoners. Many of the women I spoke to used these relationships to navigate the constraints of imprisonment, reclaim their identities and be accepted by the community when they are released.\n\nIn India, there is so much taboo around extramarital relationships and a woman’s choice, or lack of choice, of a partner. The women I met are challenging patriarchal institutions, prison and society by forming these relationships in a space that deprives them of both these freedoms.\n\nMoving from prison to a PhD",

GHGSat, an emissions-monitoring company in Montreal, Canada, tracks methane leaks from landfill sites and oil rigs. Earth-imaging firm Planet in San Francisco, California, uses more than 200 satellites to record land and infrastructure for the energy, insurance and maritime sectors. Data-analytics company Spire in San Francisco converts radio signals from navigation satellites into estimates of ocean height and wind speed to support weather forecasts. European aerospace firm Airbus operates radar satellites that can be used to study volcanoes, wetlands and sea ice.\n\nSpace agencies are taking note, and several, including the European Space Agency and NASA, are incorporating commercial data into their portfolios to make them available to researchers. Both agencies have defined processes for evaluating externally produced data, providing science-based assessments of the accuracy, geographical targeting and usability of the observations.\n\nGoogle AI model mines trillions of images to create maps of Earth ‘at any place and time’\n\nAs an academic researcher, I have been excited to participate in efforts to increase the adoption of data from commercial satellites to complement publicly provided information. For example, supported by NASA, I have begun to apply GHGSat data to estimate methane emissions from a landfill site in Brazil. I am also exploring how to use data from companies such as Spire to support hurricane risk-reduction efforts in Puerto Rico and Mexico.\n\nI have found that data gathered by commercial organizations are innovative and useful. But I also know that private companies alone cannot provide all the Earth-observation data that the world needs. Nor should they.\n\nAs governments debate science budgets and consider the role of the public and private sectors in environmental monitoring, it can be tempting to look for ways to increase efficiency and move public-sector operations to the private sector. The progress of commercial satellite operators might seem to provide evidence that NASA will not need to operate as many satellites in the future as it does now. Indeed, US President Donald Trump’s budget request for the 2026 fiscal year proposes to cancel NASA funding for several government-operated Earth-observation missions. But this is the wrong lesson to learn from private-sector progress.\n\nInstead, governments and researchers should continue to pursue a balance between the contributions of the commercial and public sectors to environmental monitoring. Satellite-based Earth-observation missions operated by the public sector remain relevant, because they have several unique features.\n\n‘We dissent’: NASA staff declare opposition to Trump cuts\n\nFirst, such missions are set up to answer scientific questions or to maintain public services, such as weather forecasts or flood-response systems. Although commercial Earth-observation companies can contribute, governmental entities should take the lead to ensure that publicly controlled and validated data, models and forecasts are produced — and trusted.",

The more extreme-heat events that people were exposed to, the more their organs aged. This is the latest study to show that extreme heat can have invisible effects on the human body and accelerate the biological clock.\n\nExposure to extreme heat, especially over long periods of time, strains organs and can be lethal, but “the fact that heatwaves age us is surprising”, says Paul Beggs, an environmental-health scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, who was not involved in the research. “This study is a wake-up call that we are all vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change on our health. It reinforces calls for urgent and deep reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions,” he adds.\n\nAccelerating ageing\n\nAge isn’t just a result of time. Previous studies have linked a number of factors — including environmental and social stress, genetics and medical interventions — to signs of ageing-related physiological changes. This puts people at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and dementia2.\n\nTo study the long-term impacts of heatwaves on ageing, the researchers analysed data from medical examinations between 2008 and 2022. During that time, Taiwan experienced around 30 heatwaves, which the study defined as a period of elevated temperature over several days. The researchers used results from several medical tests, including assessments of liver, lung and kidney function, blood pressure and inflammation, to calculate biological age. They then compared biological age with the total cumulative temperature that participants were probably exposed to on the basis of their address in the two years before their medical visit.\n\nThe study found that the more extreme-heat events that people experienced, the faster they aged — for every extra 1.3 °C a participant was exposed to, around 0.023–0.031 years, on average, was added to their biological clock.\n\n“While the number itself may look small, over time and across populations, this effect can have meaningful public-health implications,” says Cui Guo, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who led the study.\n\nManual workers and people living in rural areas experienced the largest health impacts, probably because these groups are less likely to have access to air conditioning. But there was an unexpected upside: the impact of heatwaves on ageing decreased over the 15-year study period. The reasons behind this heat adaptation are unclear, but improved access to cooling technology could play a part, Guo says.\n\nStill, “the message is that heat makes you age a bit faster than you normally would, and that this is something you would like to avoid”, says Alexandra Schneider, an environmental epidemiologist at Helmholtz Munich in Germany, who was not involved in the study.\n\nScientists estimate that climate change has made heatwaves 30 times more likely to occur.Credit: Perry Svensson/Alamy",

          "abstract": "Revolutionaries in Paris stormed the Bastille as rumours of aristocratic conspiracy swirled in French towns and villages. Credit: Fine Art Images/Heritage Images/Getty\n\nIn 1789, rumours spread like a virus across France: gangs of bandits were attacking villages, destroying crops and terrorizing peasants, mobilized by nobles trying to suppress political unrest. None of it was true. But the resulting panic and upheaval, called the Great Fear, helped to fuel the French Revolution — and provoked a debate that still divides historians.\n\nDid a deliberate effort to advance revolution drive the rumours? Or did they emerge spontaneously, driven by genuine terror? Now, scientists have used the methods of epidemiology to solve the mystery. Drawing on historical records and models developed to trace epidemics, researchers conclude that the fearmongering had rational, not emotional, roots1. “We managed to identify the logic behind the dissemination of the Great Fear,” says Antoine Parent, an economist at University Paris 8 and a co-author of the study, published today in Nature.\n\nUsing data to objectively measure societal events “is the new paradigm for studying human dynamics”, says Walter Quattrociocchi, a computer scientist specializing in complex systems at Sapienza University of Rome, who has studied the spread of misinformation online. The study focuses on “something that we can measure”, he notes. “So, it’s science. It’s not only speculation.”\n\nRevolutionary rumours\n\nThe conspiratorial hearsay that spread across France in July and August of 1789 led peasants to invade castles and destroy land registers, which, in some places, were crucial for the local lord’s claim to authority over estates. The events were among the defining moments of the early days of the French Revolution, a movement that abolished the country’s monarchy, ended feudalism and transformed its political system.\n\nHow conspiracies took root in our culture\n\nParent, whose work involves applying complex system analysis to the study of history, met his co-authors, physicist Stefano Zapperi and pathologist Caterina La Porta at the University of Milan, Italy, at a conference. When he shared his plans to investigate the spread of rumours during the Great Fear, La Porta had an idea. “I said, ‘Why don’t we use the techniques that we use to study epidemics?’”\n\nAs the basis of their analysis, the authors relied on a 1932 book by French historian Georges Lefebvre, who compiled letters and other documents indicating how the rumours travelled from one location to another.\n\nThey also used historical road maps to identify the possible dissemination routes. The information allowed the authors to create a detailed map of the stories’ movement from town to town. “We treated it as a transmission network for an epidemic,” Zapperi says.\n\nThen, the team used a mathematical model developed to study the spread of pathogens to analyse how quickly the alarming stories travelled, the routes they followed and which locations were most susceptible to being ‘infected’ by the tall tales.\n\nGoing viral",

Credit: Matteo Della Torre/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nPosts about research on Bluesky receive substantially more attention than similar posts on X, formerly called Twitter, according to the first large-scale analysis of science content on Bluesky1. The results suggest that Bluesky users engage with posts more than do users of X.\n\nBluesky has more than 38 million users and shares many features with X, which fell out of favour with some scientists when it was bought by entrepreneur Elon Musk in October 2022. A survey of Nature readers earlier this year suggested that many prefer Bluesky over X to discuss and disseminate their work.\n\nA team of researchers from the United Kingdom and China analysed 2.6 million Bluesky posts published from January 2023 to July 2025. Together, these referenced 532,000 academic articles. The results were posted as a preprint on arXiv last month and have not been peer reviewed.\n\n‘A place of joy’: why scientists are joining the rush to Bluesky\n\nThe team found that almost half of the posts about science on Bluesky garnered at least ten likes, and that one-third were reposted ten or more times. Previous research on X has shown that the proportion of science posts receiving at least ten likes varied between 4% and 7.5%, and that the proportion receiving ten or more reposts ranged from 1.4% to 4.4%2. Interactions on Bluesky were an order of magnitude higher than on X, the researchers said. Quotes — whereby users share posts and add their own text — and replies were nearly two orders of magnitude greater on Bluesky than on X, they said.\n\nThe team also reported that nearly half of Bluesky posts summarized academic articles and that only 6.3% simply mentioned the article name and journal. By contrast, 92% of original X posts about life and earth sciences and 17% of those in engineering and physical sciences referred to little more than the study title, according to a 2018 study in the Journal of Infometrics3. This suggests that research content on Bluesky is more original, says Er-Te Zheng, the latest study’s first author and a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, UK. “While X has primarily served as a dissemination tool, Bluesky may support a more interpretive, reflective mode of science communication.”",

          "abstract": "Flashes of Brilliance: The Genius of Early Photography and How It Transformed Art, Science, and History Anika Burgess W. W. Norton (2025)\n\nAs someone who has spent a career visualizing science, Flashes of Brilliance felt like reading a love letter to the power of the photographic image. This beautifully written book, by writer and photo editor Anika Burgess, is a thoughtful, personal and witty meditation on how imagery does much more than just document a scene.\n\nWill AI jeopardize science photography? There’s still time to create an ethical code of conduct\n\nAlong with fascinating examples of early efforts to capture images of society, the book captures well the dual role of the scientific image — as both a tool for discovery and a medium of communication. A reader begins to understand that photography in general, and especially in science, is not just illustrative, it is investigative. And sometimes, as Burgess clearly describes, it is revelatory.\n\nThrough a series of compelling stories and visual examples, the author reminds us that an image can crystallize a complex idea in a way that no string of words ever can. It’s a celebration of ‘aha’ moments made visible. Those photographs wake us up to social issues and phenomena we never even knew existed.\n\nJacob Riis’ images of the squalid conditions of people living in tenements in New York City’s Lower East Side around 1889 say so much more than any text describing the situation. By using flash powder to add light to the exposure, he could reveal details of these ordinarily gloomy spaces and those inhabiting them.\n\nJacob Riis captured the poor conditions of people living in New York City around 1900, such as these children sleeping on a steam grate for warmth.Credit: Granger/Historical Picture Archive/Alamy\nManipulating reality\n\nBurgess doesn’t shy away from the challenges, either — acknowledging how easily images can mislead or manipulate. Even from the beginning, some photographers used a technique to combine negatives in the printing process to create unreal scenarios. In the early 1870s, Édouard Buguet used this method to insert a translucent ‘spirit’ above the people in his portraits to advance the idea that the dead could communicate from beyond the grave. Many viewers thought that the spirit was real; only in 1875 did Buguet admit that the images were fake.\n\nHow AI is expanding art history\n\nThe balance between clarity and accuracy is something I’ve grappled with throughout my career, and it’s refreshing to see this issue addressed so directly. These days, at least in science, any manipulation must be considered carefully and reported.\n\nAnother example came as a surprise. I never tire of studying Eadweard Muybridge’s beautiful sequences of still images showing horses in motion. His photographs from the late 1870s clearly show that at various moments in a trot, all four horse hooves leave the ground at the same time — a fact that wasn’t known until then. What was new for me was to read how “he substituted, or missed out and renumbered, certain sets of images, which naturally calls into question their scientific utility”. As historian Marta Braun argues in her 1992 book Picturing Time: “under the guise of offering us scientific truth”, Muybridge has “like any artist made a selection and arranged his selection into his own personal truth”.\n\nCraig and George Falconer produced several ‘spirit’ photographs in the 1920s.Credit: Dan Moss/Alamy\n\nFor those of us in science communication, this warning is essential. Just because an image is beautiful doesn’t mean it tells the whole story. However, I don’t want to completely discount his contribution to this ‘aha’ moment in science. Informing us of his process (just as NASA scientists do when they colour astronomical images) and why he did what he did would have helped us to consider the study as an authentic scientific investigation.\n\nAlthough Burgess emphasizes the early years of picture making, I was compelled to compare some of her thinking with writer Susan Sontag’s discussion in On Photography (1977). Sontag famously argued that “to photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed” — these images have allowed our minds to consider whatever we are seeing as reality. And this idea resonates with many of the moments in Flashes of Brilliance in which early image makers were not only documenting the world but transforming it into something permanent, collectible and possible.\n\nWhether it is Cecil Shadbolt’s aerial photographs of London from a balloon or Louis Boutan’s captures of life beneath the sea, such images aren’t neutral — they shape what we think is true about the world and what we consider worth looking at.",

          "title": "Autism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "On 16 April, Robert F. Kennedy Jr held a press conference about rising diagnoses of autism. The US Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary pointed to new data showing that autism prevalence in the United States had risen steeply from one in 150 eight-year-olds in 2000 to one in 31 in 2022. He called it an “epidemic” caused by “an environmental toxin” — and said he would soon be announcing a study to find the responsible agent.\n\nThe next month, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the department that Kennedy leads, announced the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI). The initiative offered up to US$50 million to fund studies on the causes of autism. The winning applications are expected to be announced in September.\n\nUsually, big investments in research are welcomed by scientists — but not this time. Many were dismayed that these developments seemed to ignore decades of work on the well-documented rise in autism diagnoses and on causes of the developmental condition. Although Kennedy said that environmental factors are the main cause of autism, research has shown that genetics plays a bigger part. Population studies1 have linked a handful of environmental factors — mostly encountered during pregnancy — to increased chances of autism, but their precise role has been hard to pin down. More than anything, research has shown that the drivers of autism are fiendishly complicated. “There will never be a sound-bite answer to what causes autism,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies neurodevelopmental conditions at Boston University, Massachusetts.\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nThe rise in prevalence, many researchers say, is predominantly caused by an increase in diagnoses rather than a true rise in the underlying symptoms and traits. “We don’t see an epidemic of autism, but we see an ‘epidemic’ of diagnoses,” says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Researchers are concerned that Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate, will use the ADSI to promote the disproven idea that vaccines are linked to autism.\n\nKennedy’s comments prompted equally strong reactions from autistic people and autism groups, says Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, a non-profit research and advocacy group in New York City. Autistic people have a wide range of traits and symptoms — that means that many live and work independently, whereas others need intensive support. Some people want more research into the causes, she says, and others don’t.\n\nBut many people in the autism community found it demeaning and offensive when Kennedy said at the press conference that “these are kids who will never pay taxes, they’ll never hold a job”. These factors do not determine a person’s value, Halladay says — and many autistic people are employed and pay taxes.\n\nScientists and autistic people alike are also concerned that the administration of US President Donald Trump is actually cutting the overall amount of money going towards autism research and support for autistic people, including through cancelled or delayed grants. “Everyone is really, really upset that money is being taken away from these important research projects,” Halladay says.\n\nWhat explains the rise?\n\nMany studies suggest that the prevalence of autism is rising, and not just in the United States. The trend has been observed in other high-income countries, including the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and Japan. “Everywhere people are doing research and are looking at the numbers, [they] are going up,” Bölte says (see ‘Tallying autism diagnoses’). In some less wealthy countries, however, a lack of health services and data mean that prevalence is difficult to assess.\n\nSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring NetworkSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network\n\nThere are several reasons to think that a rise in diagnoses explains a large part of this trend. One is that the diagnostic criteria have changed over time in two periodically updated tools used by health professionals: The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), used mainly in the United States, and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\n\nThese describe autistic people generally as showing differences in social interaction and communication, as well as having ‘restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests’. But until the early 1990s, the manuals had a narrow definition for autism, says Diana Schendel, an epidemiologist who studies autism at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. For instance, the third edition of the DSM recognized autism only in young children and required that they meet a minimum number of criteria.\n\nUpdated versions of both handbooks — ICD-10 in 1990 and DSM-IV in 1994 — broadened the diagnostic criteria so that they could be applied to people with fewer symptoms and of different ages. “That dramatically changed the opportunity for individuals to be classified under the autism umbrella,” says Schendel. In 2013, DSM-V dropped some separate diagnoses, such as Asperger’s syndrome, and subsumed them under the term autism spectrum disorder. Autism is commonly diagnosed with co-occurring conditions, such as intellectual disability or attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nHow to be a brilliant ally to your neurodivergent lab mate\n\nA 2015 study that Schendel co-authored tried to quantify the causes of increased autism prevalence among Danish people born between 1980 and 1991, and diagnosed up to 2011. The authors estimated that 60% of the increase could be explained by changes in the early 1990s to diagnostic criteria and to the way in which diagnoses were reported to national health registries2.\n\nDiagnoses have also risen as health professionals have adjusted how they interpret and apply the criteria, and as they have adopted improved standardized diagnostic tools, such as structured interviews and observations. Eva Loth, a cognitive neuroscientist at King’s College London, says that she now diagnoses people in research projects whom she would have excluded ten years ago. “Our understanding of what autism is has changed,” says Loth.\n\nThe other change that has turbocharged diagnoses, researchers say, is increased awareness of autism and declining stigma among teachers, health professionals and the broader public, alongside increased availability of diagnostic and support services. Parents are more likely to observe signs of autism in children and are often incentivized to seek a diagnosis if it can help their child to access support, such as at school. “Where before a child might be classified as difficult, problematic in a classroom, now they might go seek a diagnosis,” says Nick Puts, who studies neurodevelopment at King’s College London and is autistic.\n\nChildren are also receiving diagnoses at a younger age than in the past. More adults are seeking diagnoses, and they have become more common in girls and women, in whom autism has historically been overlooked.\n\nBölte argues that the high demands of modern schools — such as extensive group work and digital information — could also play a part. “The learning environment is extremely complex today,” he says, “and there’s more and more children with maybe lesser traits or symptoms who are just kind of overwhelmed.” Similarly, more adults — navigating a highly complex world — might be seeking help and advice, leading to more autism diagnoses.\n\nHow much of the rise in autism is accounted for by increased diagnoses and awareness? “It’s certainly the vast majority,” Schendel says, although the exact proportion is difficult to calculate.\n\nHow prevalent is autism now?\n\nThe figure that Kennedy cited — a prevalence of one in 31 among eight-year-olds — stems from an April report by the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network3, a US surveillance programme that tallies autism in children using health and education records (see ‘Autism prevalence across the United States’). These show who has received a diagnosis and who is eligible for autism-related education. The results from this type of study are sometimes called registry or administrative prevalence, because they are based on administrative databases.\n\nSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring NetworkSource: Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network\n\nBut some researchers view such studies with caution, says Damian Santomauro, a mental-health epidemiologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. Identification of autism can come from various sources, including psychiatrists, psychologists and educational settings. Some children who have extra behavioural or educational needs might be included in an administrative database, but would not meet stringent criteria for diagnosis in an independent clinical evaluation, Santomauro says. Conversely, some people with undiagnosed autism might be excluded from registries.\n\nA more accurate way to estimate prevalence is through a population survey, in which researchers screen everyone in a representative group of children or adults for autism. Santomauro led the most recent report on autism by the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest scientific project on impacts of health conditions), which is based only on survey data. This estimated that autism spectrum disorder had a prevalence of one in 127 people globally (less than 1%) in 2021. That’s 62 million people overall4.\n\nHow to speak to a vaccine sceptic: research reveals what works\n\nA long-term study of Swedish children, published this year, compared registry and survey prevalence in children who were born between 1993 and 2001. It found that the prevalence of autism symptoms that parents reported when their children reached 18 had remained stable, even as the prevalence of registered diagnoses had gone up5. And most of the increase in prevalence seen in studies comes from diagnoses of autistic people who do not have language impairment or a co-occurring intellectual disability, Tager-Flusberg says, whereas numbers of diagnosed autistic people with these conditions have changed little, if at all. All of this adds weight to the argument that spiking autism statistics are driven mostly by improved detection and diagnoses.\n\nBut Santomauro says that other high-quality surveys have made him think twice. A study published in 2020 that used rigorous survey methods reported a prevalence of more than 3% in five-year-old children in Japan — higher than previous estimates for autism in some other Asian countries6. So, although Santomauro agrees that most of the rise in autism is explained by increased detection and diagnosis, he says it remains possible that something could be pushing up “true prevalence” as well. But what?\n\nWhat causes autism?\n\nResearchers have been hunting for the causes of autism for decades — and have run up against difficulties at every step. “We just don’t really understand a lot about how any human brain functions,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a UK autism research and campaigning charity in London, who has worked in autism research and is autistic. “So trying to find causal mechanisms for autism is, I think, much harder than people thought it was going to be 20 years ago.”\n\nOne broad conclusion to emerge from the available data is that genetics plays a huge part. “Family-history risk is probably the strongest risk factor there is,” says Schendel.\n\nResearchers capture the genetic contribution using measures of heritability – an estimate of how much of the differences in autism traits between individuals can be explained by inherited genes rather than by environmental factors. A large, five-country study7 published in 2019 estimated the heritability of autism as about 80% — equivalent to the heritability of height. For comparison, the heritability estimates for depression are roughly 30–50%.\n\nIdentifying the individual genes involved, however, has proved tough. “The genetics themselves are wildly complex,” says Craig Newschaffer, an autism researcher at Pennsylvania State University in University Park.\n\nResearchers have sought genes by comparing the genomes of autistic people and people who are not autistic in families and in bigger population studies. These have helped to pinpoint a selection of rare genetic variants — variations in DNA sequence — that cause a relatively large increase in the chances of autism. Many of these are de novo mutations that probably arose in a sperm or egg cell and were passed to a child. These large-impact variants are thought to be a major driver of autism in an estimated 10–20% of autistic people.\n\nBut “the genetic architecture is very different from one individual to another”, says geneticist Thomas Bourgeron, who studies autism at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Researchers have also found that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of common variants have a tiny effect individually — making them hard to pinpoint — but a big effect when combined. If someone has enough variants, they could end up with symptoms and a diagnosis.\n\nAfter genetics, environmental factors are “a smaller slice of the pie” in driving autism, Schendel says, although there is debate about the size of the slice. Some researchers argue that the influence of environmental factors is vanishingly small, and others disagree. Most research suggests that any environmental factors exert their influence before birth, however, and studies have convincingly shown no link to vaccines8,9.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr held an April press conference about the increase in autism prevalence.Credit: Elizabeth Frantz/Reuters\n\nMany studies suggest that older parental age — for mothers or fathers — is linked to an increased likelihood of autism in children10. The average childbearing age has been increasing in many high-income countries, so this could be playing a small part in increasing autism prevalence, researchers say. One possible explanation is that children of older parents are more likely to have de novo mutations than are children of younger parents.\n\nInfections during pregnancy have also been linked in many studies to a greater chance of autism, as has exposure to air pollution before birth. For instance, a US study published in June, involving more than 8,000 children and their mothers, found that exposure to higher levels of ozone was associated with autism11.",

          "title": "Why scientists are flocking to Substack",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "Adapted from Filo/Getty\n\nLike many epidemiologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, Katelyn Jetelina turned to social media to help keep people informed. It was the spring of 2020, and Jetelina, then at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, frequently posted content on viral transmission and vaccines to her Facebook and Instagram pages. That is, until she was hacked.\n\nIn February 2021, a group of anti-vaccine activists found a way into both accounts, using her platform to post and promote a different rhetoric. They even asked her followers to upload their COVID-19 vaccination cards for a chance to win US$1,000, in a bid to gain personal information. It was at this point that Jetelina decided she had to make a change. “It was heartbreaking to me: I had lost all of my content, and all of the blood, sweat and tears I had put into it,” she recalled. “I decided to move on to a platform where I had a whole lot more ownership.”\n\nScientists are falling victim to deepfake AI video scams — here’s how to fight back\n\nThe most obvious choice for her was Substack, an independent writing and e-mailing platform. It’s lauded for its newsletter features — sending posts into the inboxes of subscribers — but content is also available on the site, as with a standard blog. One feature she especially liked, given her past experiences, was that her data was transferable: if you decide to leave, or have to leave, you can take a list of subscriber e-mails with you. On 8 February 2021, Jetelina started putting more energy into her Substack publication, which she calls Your Local Epidemiologist.\n\nAlthough she eventually regained control of her social-media accounts, and her team still posts infographics and videos there, Jetelina says Substack enables her to connect with followers in a different way. As she explains it, the e-mail newsletter platform is more conducive to longer-form and more-nuanced discussions, which aren’t always possible on other forms of social media. Readers subscribe to her specifically, and content goes directly to their inbox, fostering more intimate and close-knit interactions. She says she’s come to know the readers well. “I can now have a two-way relationship with the audience, engaging with them through the comment and chat sections.”\n\nOver the past few years, the newsletter has garnered a strong following and now has more than 400,000 subscribers. What was once a one-woman show is now run by a team of copy editors, social-media creators, administrative assistants and other contributors. It’s also now Jetelina’s main job, she says. And as the pandemic public-health emergency has “faded into the rear-view mirror”, her content has had to change. Jetelina now aims to show the community that public health goes beyond a pandemic and infectious diseases, and writes about topics such as reproductive health, gun violence and mental health. “I’m really trying to focus on how to equip people with the tools to live an evidence-based life,” she says.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina switched to Substack after a group of anti-vaccine activists hacked her Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nFounded in 2017, Substack is meant to give a platform to independent writers, and provides a means for them to monetize their work through paywalls and donations. It’s grown rapidly and now has tens of millions of subscribers, and more than five million paid subscribers. The platform also raised $100 million to expand operations, giving the company a value of $1.1 billion. And it’s not exclusively for scientists: many other academics, as well as journalists and even novelists, have built up a community on the platform.\n\n“Substack is home to a growing number of respected academics and researchers who use the platform to share evidence-based work directly with the public,” a spokesperson told Nature. “For many, it’s a way to reach people more quickly and openly, while still maintaining depth and rigour.”\n\nNot every scientist has a following as large as that of Your Local Epidemiologist, which currently ranks number one on the list of paid science newsletters on Substacks. But other academics and scientists across various disciplines have gravitated towards the platform as a way to promote research and connect with the public.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nNonetheless, the site has its drawbacks. It can take a while to build a following, and making a profit can be hard work. Not only that, but many of the platform’s top science and health-politics newsletters promote anti-vaccine ideology or pseudoscience. “It’s the wild, wild west being on Substack, but right now this is the same on any sort of social-media platform,” says Jetelina. (A Substack spokesperson said that it would be inaccurate to characterize “a majority” of the top science writers as anti-vax.)\n\nStacking up\n\nSubstack and other subscription-based content services — such as Ghost, Mailchimp, Patreon, Beehiiv and Medium — market themselves as being more effective at reaching people than are conventional social media. This is partially backed by marketing data. According to Mailchimp, a US e-mail marketing platform, about 35% of users open e-mails from companies in the education and training sector; for other industries, the proportion is 30–40%. In a recent thread on Substack, writers shared the rates at which their subscribers opened their newsletters, and the proportions ranged from 30% to 70%.\n\nKimberly Nicholas, a sustainability researcher at Lund University, Sweden, whose Substack publication We Can Fix It approaches the climate crisis “with facts, feelings, and action”, says her e-mail newsletters are clicked on and opened more than her social-media posts.\n\nThe site also helps to foster an environment of community engagement. For Jonathan Tonkin, an ecologist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, the social-media platform X “was a really useful tool for scientists to communicate with other scientists, but in terms of reaching the public it wasn’t happening, to be honest”. Tonkin now authors a Substack publication called Predirections. “It’s good, I think, for reaching people who are interested in science and are not scientists,” he says.\n\nJonathan Tonkin found that Substack was much more effective than the social-media platform X as a means of engaging with interested non-scientists.Credit: Prime Minister’s Science Prizes Secretariat\n\nAccording to Similarweb, a traffic-analytics website, Substack’s audience is pretty evenly split between men and women. It skews a bit towards younger readers: the largest group consists of those aged 25–34. Users also tend to be based in the United States, with with about 62% of traffic coming from there in July 2025.\n\n“Scientific subjects are nuanced, and trying to distill that into 140 characters doesn't work very well, or leaves people confused,” adds Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist at the University of Oxford, UK. Ritchie’s Substack publication, Sustainability by Numbers, looks at potential routes to sustainability through an evidence-based lens. Putting together an e-mail, she says, “gives scientists a bit more room to describe the nuances”.\n\nHannah Ritchie points out that Substack frees writers from the constraints associated with more-formal means of publication, such as journals.Credit: Angela Catlin\n\nThen there’s the potential for monetization. Most of the scientists Nature spoke to emphasized that their content is free, but the site gives writers the ability to set up paywalls. According to Jetelina, 7% of her subscribers pay for her content. Although the platform takes a cut, she’s been able to generate enough revenue to quit her full-time job and focus mainly on the newsletter. (Jetelina did not want to share her earnings with Nature, but in 2022, the monthly magazine Vanity Fair reported that she made about $300,000 in the publication’s first nine months).\n\nScientists also highlight that Substack offers more freedom than do other modes of publishing science — in journals, for example, or through guest contributions to online publications such The Conversation. As Ritchie explains, there’s often a lengthy editorial process in these more-formal systems, and writers can be constrained by the requirements of the publication. “The timeline is massively extended compared to what you can do on Substack, where you can have your own audience: you can say what you want, when you want to say it.”",

          "abstract": "President Trump has signed two executive orders that could fundamentally shift oversight of science integrity by federal researchers.Credit: Samuel Corum/Sipa/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nUS science agencies have begun releasing their plans to comply with US President Donald Trump’s call for ‘gold-standard science’. The plans mainly detail efforts towards achieving widely supported science goals, such as data accessibility and reproducibility. But researchers and science-policy specialists tell Nature that elements of the plans leave the door open to political interference in science.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for instance, would put a Trump-appointed official in charge of implementing the new policies, including protocols for reporting research-integrity violations. In the past, responsibility for such tasks at federal agencies was generally held by career civil servants, who were often scientists hired for their expertise.\n\nTrump’s call for ‘gold standard science’ has prompted an outcry: here’s why\n\nThe new policies are the agencies’ first response to two White House executive orders that directed agencies to put political appointees in charge of decisions about science funding and integrity. The policies could shape the work of the nearly 300,000 scientists and engineers who work for federal agencies and the almost US$200 billion of science funded by the US government.\n\nResearchers who spoke to Nature say the overhaul is not in good faith, pointing to the Trump administration’s language around the policy. The most recent executive order, issued 7 August, claimed science grants went to scientists who “promoted Marxism, class warfare propaganda, and other anti-American ideologies”. “The overall strategy is attacking scientific findings in order to diminish the public’s trust,” says David Michaels, an epidemiologist at George Washington University in Washington DC who held public-health positions under previous administrations. A government scientist who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation said that the language around gold-standard science was being used to justify the sweeping cuts to science proposed by the White House this year.\n\nNeither the White House nor its Office of Science and Technology Policy responded to requests for comment from Nature. But Department of Energy spokesperson Ben Dietderich responded to accusations that the Trump administration is using the gold-standard policies to undermine US science. “Unlike previous administrations that abused the scientific process to advance their radical political agenda, the Trump administration is returning the United States to a gold standard of science that fosters more open, fact-based conversations and will allow for the United States to be the global leader in scientific innovation,” Dietderich said in a statement.\n\nWarring policies\n\nDuring Trump’s first term (2017–21), his administration censored government scientists on issues such as COVID-19, altered scientific information in government reports and barred some researchers from science advisory boards. During the subsequent presidency of Joe Biden, federal agencies crafted scientific-integrity policies to protect scientists and prevent political manipulation of science.\n\nAfter Trump, US researchers urge Biden to block political meddling in science\n\nThis May, four months into his second term, Trump issued an executive order that repealed the Biden-era scientific-integrity policies, citing a “loss of trust” in science. The order also called for reforms that would ensure that science is “transparent, rigorous and impactful”. The 7 August executive order focused on the federal grant-making process, which is the primary method of allocating federal fund to US science. Both orders called for presidential appointees to take charge of the reforms, which would shift power away from career civil servants and scientists.\n\nPolicies published by the FDA, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) centre on widely embraced goals and ideas for improving science. Many of their recommendations echo existing efforts meant to ensure reproducibility and transparency.\n\nThe NSF’s plan, for instance, includes a table showing that 14 of 23 activities proposed to implement Trump’s orders are already ongoing. The NIH document describes many initiatives that began prior to the second Trump administration, such as a call for comments from the scientific community on ways to encourage publishing null and negative findings.\n\nPolitical infiltration\n\nBut some staff members at scientific agencies do not trust that the response to the president’s orders will strengthen US science. “I expect it will be used to further politicize science by labeling research the administration doesn’t like as ‘not gold-standard’,” says an NIH staff member, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.\n\nTrump’s chief science adviser faces a storm of criticism: what's next?",

          "title": "Why Texas is the hottest place for space right now",
          "authors": "Jonathan O’Callaghan",
          "abstract": "The mission control room in Houston, Texas, after Apollo 11 touched landed on the Moon in 1969 carrying Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong.Credit: NASA\n\nSome 650 million people around the world watched with bated breath as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin touched down on the Moon in 1969. With just seconds of fuel remaining, the success of the nail-biting Apollo 11 landing was sealed with a single line uttered by Armstrong: “Houston, Tranquility Base here,” he radioed back to mission command’s base in Texas. “The Eagle has landed.”\n\nThat immortal moment highlights the ever-present role that Texas has had in space flight. “Everyone recognizes Texas as a space leader,” says Mitrah Avini, a policy adviser for the Dallas-based non-profit organization Texas 2036.\n\nAnd the state’s space sector is rapidly expanding. The World Economic Forum predicts that the global space economy will grow from US$630 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2035, driven by rising commercial investment and demand for space-based services, and Texas wants a part of that action. Today, the state hosts more than 10% of the US aerospace workforce, around 200,000 workers, behind only California and Washington.\n\n“The Texas legislature has invested a significant amount of money into the space industry,” says Kyle DeMars, an aerospace engineer at Texas A&M University in College Station. “If I were a student looking to break into the space industry, I would follow the innovation, and Texas is where that is.”\n\nStellar prospects\n\nAlready, 18 of the 20 largest aerospace manufacturing companies in the United States operate in Texas, and the state has seen a proliferation of smaller start-up firms. Drawn by the allure of large parcels of land for building facilities, and by proximity to renowned institutions such as NASA’s Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, more than 500 space-sector companies have set up shop in Texas since 2019, taking the state’s total to around 2,000.\n\nNature Career Guide: Texas\n\nIn July 2024, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, said the company would shift its headquarters from Hawthorne, California, to Starbase, a purpose-built facility in Boca Chica, on the Gulf Coast of South Texas. The most valuable space company in the world, SpaceX has been using the facility to develop and launch its Starship rocket, designed to take humans to the Moon and eventually Mars. Musk cited ideological differences with California’s state governor as the reason behind the relocation.\n\nTexas’s tax advantages also make it an attractive destination for high earners and big businesses. Currently, Texas has no state income tax, and it imposes a relatively low corporate levy through its ‘franchise tax’ — which, for most companies, is 0.75% of their revenue. California, by contrast, has a state income-tax rate of 13.3% on its highest earners, and an 8.84% profit-based corporate tax levy.\n\nFurther sweetening the deal, the Texas House of Representatives approved a bill in May that exempts from franchise tax all businesses operating spaceports used by the US Department of Defense. State Representative Stan Gerdes said the measure was expected to attract more business and talent to the state. However, companies will still have to pay Texas property taxes, which are some of the highest in the country.\n\nNASA astronaut Jessica Watkins trains for a spacewalk at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.Credit: Norah Moran/NASA/Johnson Space Center\n\nAttracting companies such as SpaceX creates an incentive for other firms to move there, says Avini. “When you have leaders in a particular industry located in the state, it gives the impression it is a hub of activity,” she says. “It attracts interest from start-ups and others.”\n\nTexan companies also benefit from NASA’s strong presence in the state, which opens opportunities for commercial partnerships and access to federal contracts. In 2023, NASA awarded 10% of its procurement contracts, worth around $2.3 billion, to businesses that operate in Texas: $53million went to Boeing, and $18.9 million to KBR Wyle Services in Houston; the agency also supported 2,997 federal employees and 17,359 Texan-based contractors.\n\nHere’s how to break into the Texas space industry\n\nLike many government agencies, however, NASA faces deep cuts to its funding, especially to its scientific-research arm. In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would have cut NASA’s overall funding by 24%. Two months later, on 10 July, the US Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill to maintain current levels of NASA funding, rejecting the proposed cuts. The bill, which will shape NASA’s 2026 spending allocations, will now move to the full Senate and the House of Representatives for consideration, and is due to be finalized later this year.\n\nYet parts of NASA have found a reprieve with the release of the federal government’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’, a budget reconciliation bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on 4 July. The space agency is set to receive $10 billion in funding over the next six years from the bill, which includes allocations for the Moon-exploration programme Artemis and around $300 million for upgrades to the JSC.\n\nCasey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a space advocacy organization based in Pasadena, California, says that Trump’s NASA budget proposal would have phased out key Artemis components, including the Space Launch System, the Orion crewed spacecraft and the Gateway space station. This would have had “significant impacts” for Texas — as would cutting staff numbers by “upwards of 20%” at the JSC. “However, the recent ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ countermanded that proposal and provided billions of additional dollars to those projects, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars for infrastructure and construction at the JSC.”\n\nSpaceX launches Starship in Texas in 2024.Credit: Joe Marino/UPI/Shutterstock\n\nIn the commercial sector, a shift in funding would probably favour big industry players while disadvantaging others, says Dreier. “Generally, the commercial space industry retains a lot of support in the White House proposal. But it’s important to note that the commercial industry does not provide services for free: NASA is their customer, so any reductions in spending could impact businesses in the private sector as well.”\n\nWhen it comes to the country’s proposed exploration of the Moon and Mars, Dreier says that a few firms — such as SpaceX, or Blue Origin in Kent, Washington — could theoretically deliver cargo and crew to these target destinations. But the capabilities don’t yet exist, he adds, and would be a gamble to develop without long-term government support.\n\nNew offerings\n\nDespite cuts to the public sector, the growth of the overall space sector in Texas is “exponential” at the moment, says Clint Dawson, chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin. This has had a knock-on effect for academia.\n\n“We’ve seen tremendous growth in applications to aerospace programmes,” he says. “Last year we got about 2,000 applicants for roughly 200 freshman slots,” signalling a shift in student priorities from previous years. “This year it’s closer to 3,000 applicants.”\n\nThis increase in demand prompted Texas governor Greg Abbott to call last March for more universities in the state to offer space-engineering programmes. Texas A&M obliged: it now offers “a very specific space-engineering degree programme at both undergraduate and graduate levels”, says former astronaut Nancy Currie-Gregg, an engineer at Texas A&M who is also on the board of directors for the Texas Space Commission. “We expect the first students will start in 2026.” The new programme will focus on the growing space industry in Texas, and will include an Introduction to Space course covering orbital mechanics and environmental control systems.\n\n“There are plenty of degree programmes, including here at Texas A&M, that focus on things like propulsion and hypersonics — the things that get you to and from space — and even on the space environment, but this would be one of the first undergraduate degrees that focuses on the multidisciplinary engineering nature of what happens once you get there,” says Demars.\n\nTexas A&M Space Institute director Nancy Currie-Gregg with deputy director Robert Ambrose.Credit: Yi-Chin Lee/Houston Chronicle via Getty\n\nCurrie-Gregg adds that demand is already high for courses such as this. “Every seat is filled” in her space-engineering courses, she says. “I have 100 students this semester, and not everybody could get into the class that wanted to.”",

          "abstract": "Credit: Xijing Hospital of the Air Force Medical University/Xinhua via Alamy\n\nA lung from a genetically modified pig has been transplanted into a person for the first time1. The recipient, a 39-year-old man in China, was brain dead, but the organ survived for nine days.\n\nAt least half a dozen people in the United States and China have received organs from genome-edited pigs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and a thymus. The latest procedure suggests that almost any pig organ could be transplanted into people, researchers say. They hope that such organs might one day save the thousands of people who die each year while waiting for a donor organ.\n\nLungs are the most difficult organ to transplant, says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a surgeon and researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who in 2022 led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person. Lungs have the most blood vessels of any transplantable organ, so are more prone to attack from the immune system, which can lead to blood clots and tissue damage, says Mohiuddin. “I applaud their effort,” he says: “it’s a first step” towards lung xenotransplantation, the use of organs from other species in humans. US clinical trials for pig livers and pig kidneys were approved this year.\n\nProof of concept\n\nThe transplanted left lung was taken from a pig with six genomic edits that was created by research firm Chengdu Clonorgan Biotechnology in China. This included removing three genes to reduce the risk of the organ triggering an immune response and adding three human genes to protect the organ from rejection. In the proof-of-concept trial, the lung was transplanted on 15 May last year by researchers at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China. Their findings were published this week in Nature Medicine.\n\nThe team reports that there were no signs of rejection, infection or graft failure in the first three days after surgery. However, 24 hours after the transplant, the researchers noticed that the lung was swelling, and that the tissue had been damaged after going without oxygen for a period of time during the transplant procedure. They also observed damage caused by antibodies attacking the organ on days three and six, but noted that the damage to the lung had reduced on day nine, when the study was stopped at the request of the recipient’s family.",

          "abstract": "Research budgets have not kept pace with inflation in the United Kingdom.Credit: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty\n\nThe proportion of research and innovation awards granted by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the United Kingdom’s national funding agency, has nearly halved over the past seven financial years, as application rates surged by more than 80%, new data show.\n\nThe UKRI data, published last month, show that between 2017–18 and 2024–25, the number of applications to the national funding agency increased from 16,355 to 29,927. Meanwhile, the number of awards granted per year increased by only 3% over the same period, to 5,667 in 2024–25 (see ‘Diminishing returns’). A substantial bump in applications was seen in 2020–21, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a similar, but smaller, bump was seen in awards, which levelled out over the following years.\n\nThe increase in applications is mostly due to applications to Innovate UK — which supports industry-driven research and now accounts for more than 56% of the assessed applications. The award rate for these applications was 14% in 2024–25.\n\nFor academic and research-led grants from UKRI, applications and award rates vary between research councils — the subject-specific bodies that allocate funding in areas such as engineering, medical research and social sciences — but many have seen a fall in award rates over the past financial year. Overall, the proportion of awards granted per year — including research and innovation, fellowships and training grants — fell from 36% in 2017–18 to 19% in 2024–25, the lowest in the decade. The total number of active awards has remained fairly stable, and is now around 21,000.\n\nPrice of progress\n\nDespite the stagnation in the number of awards, the value of UKRI grants steadily increased from around £3 billion (US$4 billion) to more than £6 billion between 2015–16 and 2023–24, before falling to £4.5 billion this financial year.\n\nOver the past few years, laboratories and universities have reckoned with the consequences of significant inflation. In October 2022, the UK consumer price index hit 11.1%, a 41-year high. According to the UKRI data, over the past three years, the average amount awarded for a successful application exceeded £800,000. In 2015–16, the average value of a grant was just more than £450,000.\n\nEleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh and a member of the UKRI’s Medical Research Council (who spoke to Nature in a personal capacity), says that research budgets have barely kept pace with inflation. A lack of investment from the country’s government is mostly to blame, she adds. A research and development analysis, published this year by the Campaign for Science and Engineering, an advocacy group in London, showed that government spending in real terms — when adjusted for inflation — plateaued in 2019 owing to high inflation.\n\nThe activities of other funders, including US-based research institutes affected by funding cuts from President Donald Trump’s administration, might have also affected UKRI application volume, with more researchers in the United States looking outside the country to secure funding.\n\nDemand management\n\nIn 2022, the Technopolis Group — an international research and consulting organization — published a review of the UKRI’s response to the substantial bump in applications and the expedited review timelines in the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, UKRI staff and reviewers faced widespread burnout, according to the report, and more than one-third of awardees had experienced delays while waiting for a decision.\n\nA number of UKRI councils have adopted demand-management policies to reduce pressure on their peer-review systems as applications increase. In 2015, the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) implemented a demand-management policy limiting the number of applications from individual institutions on the basis of success rate: those with a low success rate were subjected to a cap on the number of applications they could submit. Although this is not the only way to reduce pressure on peer-review and grant systems, it tends to lead to more-robust applications, says Riley. She says other councils could follow suit.",

          "title": "Do social-media bans benefit young people? These data could offer clues",
          "authors": "Helen Christensen, Andrew Mackinnon",
          "abstract": "In December, the Australian government will bring the Online Safety Amendment Act into force. The law will prevent people under 16 years of age from having accounts for a range of social-media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. The legislation, introduced in response to concerns over children’s online safety and well-being1, provides a golden opportunity for researchers to investigate how social-media use might affect mental health among adolescents — a complex issue that has been the subject of heated debate.\n\nSocial-media bans won’t work — there are better ways to keep kids safe\n\nThere’s little time to plan and set up the ideal experiment. Assessing the mental-health status and Internet usage of tens of thousands of teenagers in Australia and comparator countries over time, before and after the legislation comes into force, is no mean feat. It would require substantial organization in schools, the recruitment of research staff, agreement about the research measures used and fast ethical review and parental consent, all of which takes many months. Nevertheless, there are more-feasible approaches that could provide valuable information if researchers act promptly.\n\nAn as-yet-unnamed advisory committee and research partner have been established by the government to review the effect of the act, but to our knowledge there have been no official announcements about the responsibilities, leadership or research strategies they will adopt. We urge the committee to consider implementing each of the following three approaches.\n\nTrack official records\n\nHospital admissions records and coroners’ reports can track the incidence of serious self-harm and suicides among adolescents before and after the introduction of legislation. The benefits of this approach are that it is possible to gather data for the whole country, rather than studying a subset of teens, and that many years of retrospective data are available. Data from other nations can also be used to help determine whether any changes to mental health in Australia can be ascribed to the bans or whether they simply reflect broader trends.\n\nOn the downside, it takes time for official data to become available. Figures on suicide are linked to time-consuming coroners’ investigations, so data sets are often not finalized for years. Routinely collected data do not reveal anything about individual mental-health trajectories and social-media use, making it hard to determine whether social media contributed to peoples’ actions. These records also do not allow investigation of the many instances of anxiety and depression that do not lead to self-harm or suicide. This is because these conditions often go untreated or are addressed through primary health-care services or private psychologists, from which data are not easily collated.\n\nLaunch national surveys\n\nThe government could commission surveys of the health and well-being of young people aged under 16 before and after the legislation is brought in. Two national surveys have been run in Australia in the past, the latest in 2013–142. Starting one survey in the coming months and another in four years’ time would enable comparisons with previous cohorts.\n\nThese surveys typically involve a representative sample of the population. To study the social-media ban, they might instead oversample at-risk subgroups — teens from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQIA+) or those with pre-existing mental health conditions, for instance. The surveys could be used to probe risk factors for anxiety and depression, including online bullying, and could ask detailed questions about mental ill-health and social-media use on various platforms, going beyond generic measures such as screen time. They could also include measurements of lifestyle and any activities or hobbies taken up to fill the time previously spent on social media. Analyses would help to answer questions about which individuals are protected by social-media bans, and what online activities are associated with improved well-being.\n\nYoung people might adopt different lifestyle interests when Australia’s social-media ban begins — a trend that researchers could study.Credit: Vlad Sokhin/Panos Pictures\n\nThe drawback of these surveys is that the proposed first cohort (to be evaluated in the coming months) would have a different social-media environment and different stressors from the second group, which would be assessed in four years’ time. This would make any comparisons complex and challenging. A gap of four years between surveys would make the data coarse with respect to any trajectories of change — but narrowing that gap to, say, two years is probably both financially and politically unfeasible.\n\nPiggyback existing studies\n\nResearchers could take advantage of ongoing longitudinal studies of young people to recruit new cohorts and follow them up over time. These studies have the advantage of individual retrospective data. Australia has several such studies that include mental-health measures. The Future Proofing Study, for instance, began in 2019 and is examining the onset and trajectory of mental-health conditions in 6,000 adolescents from age 13 onwards3. It is scheduled to finish this year, but could be funded to include a new cohort running from now until 2030.\n\nHow social media affects teen mental health: a missing link\n\nTrials evaluating public-health interventions could also be used, if their timespan encompasses the social-media ban (the control groups in such trials are essentially longitudinal observational studies). One example is the Health4Life trial4, which is investigating the effect of six lifestyle interventions on the mental health of 11- to 13-year-olds in three Australian states. It could continue its follow-up assessments for longer than the current limit of 36 months.\n\nAn audit of existing trials and longitudinal studies, both in Australia and in potential comparator countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the United States, should be high on the priority list for the ban’s advisory committee and researchers. But comparisons are likely to be complex, owing to probable differences in sample demographics, risk assessments, age in the cohorts and outcome measurements. It might also be tough to achieve safe and ethical access to these cohorts — teenagers and their parents might not have consented to have their data used beyond the original investigation.",

          "authors": "Sarah Wells",
          "abstract": "Postdoctoral researcher Srihari Menon says having a diverse skill set is an advantage in the space industry.Credit: Srihari Menon\n\nThey say everything is bigger in Texas — and the aerospace industry is no different. A report1 published this year by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) ranked Texas as the top US state for aerospace manufacturing attractiveness. PwC, a multinational services firm based in London, scores each state on metrics such as industry growth, the local economy and tax policies. The sector itself is expanding; the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projected that countrywide employment for aerospace engineers will grow faster than average between 2023 and 2033, with more than 4,000 job openings expected each year.\n\nNature Career Guide: Texas\n\nAlthough proposed NASA budget cuts from the administration of US President Donald Trump, which are due to be ratified later this year, will probably reverberate across the industry, they are likely to be ameliorated by the country’s status as the global leader in military spending. One-quarter of that spending is devoted to the aerospace and defence sector, according to PwC. Texas’s economy is especially bolstered by the commercial space industry — 18 of the largest aerospace companies call the region home — and by increased investment from the Texas Space Commission, which was launched in March last year.\n\nHere, four space specialists talk about the evolution of the state’s aerospace industry and the advice for those looking to enter the field.\n\nDAVID SILVA: The importance of being a life-long learner\n\nProfessor of physics and astronomy and director of the Center for Space Technology and Operations Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\nFor undergraduate students, I think it’s beneficial to start their careers here in Texas because the cost of a degree is more affordable compared with in other states. The state subsidizes higher education through state support and reinvestment of fossil-fuel and mineral-extraction fees: the annual in-state college tuition in Texas is roughly US$1,500 less than the national average.\n\nUnlike academia, the private industry is not necessarily looking for people with post-doctoral experience. Companies want people as early as they can get them, both because they like the energy of recently trained engineers, but also because there’s a certain amount of retraining or training that an individual will need to complete when a company has a specific mission. In the next few years, Texas will be proving the economic business case of this industry, but I think that there’s going to be enough demand driven by national-security objectives for students to find opportunities irrespective of the NASA funding cuts. It might be that the total federal investment in space technology will increase over time, especially in the military and intelligence fields.\n\nDavid Silva (centre) says that there are plenty of opportunities for recently trained engineers in the Texas space industry.Credit: Ryan Schoensee\n\nIn my experience, space enterprise start-up companies in the state are looking for graduates who can cover a large variety of engineering fields, including electronics, power, structures and artificial intelligence, but they’re also looking for scientists who are willing to work on not only basic research but also on applied science and technical problems. A nice example of this type of problem is building habitats on the Moon. You need to understand the geophysical, chemical and structural properties of the lunar surface and how this evolved from impacts by solids and solar wind to answer questions such as, ‘Can a given material be used to build habitats?’ or ‘How do you form bricks that are stable in an environment without an atmosphere or water?’\n\nA common thread is that these companies are really looking for people who are willing to be life-long learners. This means that graduates with a variety of science and engineering backgrounds can make great candidates for working in the space industry. It also means that students with a more conventional space-industry experience might not want to focus on one field but instead be generalists. Some advice that I would give to students is that during your scientific training, the more you can work on actual projects and get out of the classroom, the more attractive you're going to be in the marketplace. It’s my experience that potential employers care a lot more about actual experience than they do about grades. At the University of Texas at San Antonio, this is something we’ve leaned into by making sure that our engineering students are doing senior projects on challenges set by local companies, so that in the final year of their degrees they’re working on an applied project.\n\nLLOYD WENDT: Landing the first gig\n\nSenior recruiter at Venus Aerospace in Houston, Texas.\n\nWe see new recruits with backgrounds that run the gamut, including expertise in propulsion, aeronautics and astronautics, software engineering and mechanical engineering. At Venus, where we work to develop reusable hypersonic technologies — such as rocket engines — junior-level roles might require a bachelor’s degree but mid- to top-level roles are typically filled by candidates with a master’s or PhD in that niche area.\n\nAs a senior recruiter, Lloyd Wendt suggests that joining clubs and connecting with alumni can help to secure work experience.Credit: Rachael Yates\n\nIn these specialized areas, such as vehicle engineering, it can be beneficial to bring a multifaceted skill set, for example an understanding of not just the analysis and design of a vehicle but also the mechanical engineering knowledge of how to build it. However, focusing your expertise too narrowly on a specific fuel or material might not be useful because these are likely to change over time, especially in the case of fuels — different types of which might be phased out as more are developed.\n\nIrrespective of what role you’re interested in, it’s always beneficial to have real-world experience in that area, this can include internship experience or a thesis project at university. However, we recognize that internship opportunities can receive thousands of applicants for only a handful of roles. Therefore, joining clubs, reaching out to alumni or asking to shadow a professional at a space company can all be good starting places. The toughest gig is your first, but once you get in and start making connections, recruiters will be eating you up.\n\nSRIHARI MENON: Developing diverse skills\n\nPostdoctoral researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute in College Station, Texas.\n\nWhen it comes to space, Texas is unique: we have NASA and private industry in our backyard.\n\nYour job as an early-career researcher is simply to develop your skills across the spectrum. Eventually, if your skill set is sufficiently diverse, you will find utility in any industry. These skills need not be trendy, because aerospace as an industry is much too mature to latch onto trends that don’t last longer than five years.\n\nAfter completing a master’s degree in computational fluid dynamics for propulsion and atmospheric re-entry, I pivoted to the study of computational injury biomechanics, which uses engineering models to evaluate injury risks. Combining these areas, I was qualified to start my doctoral studies in spacecraft occupant safety. In the future, this diverse skill set could help me to market myself in fields outside conventional aerospace, such as at automotive companies, civil-aviation firms and injury-research laboratories.\n\n‘We dissent’: NASA staff declare opposition to Trump cuts\n\nFor industry networking, if you’re early on in your career, you might want to go to conferences such as ASCEND. This is an interesting event for people who are trying to break into the space industry, because it brings policymakers, aerospace companies, scientists and early-career researchers into one place. In addition to ASCEND, I would also recommend networking at NASA conferences, such as the Human Research Program Investigators’ Workshop, and at the Pumps and Pipes annual event that will take place in December in Houston, Texas, for professionals working at the intersection of medicine, space and engineering.",

          "authors": "Chris Simms",
          "abstract": "A huge analysis of DNA methylation in human tissue has revealed new anti-ageing targets.Credit: Lawrence Lawry/SPL\n\nThe visible effects of ageing on our body are in part linked to invisible changes in gene activity. The epigenetic process of DNA methylation — the addition or removal of tags called methyl groups — becomes less precise as we age. The result is changes to gene expression that are linked to reduced organ function and increased susceptibility to disease as people age.\n\nNow, a meta-analysis of epigenetic changes in 17 types of human tissue throughout the entire adult lifespan provides the most comprehensive picture to date of how ageing modifies our genes.\n\nThe study assessed DNA methylation patterns in human tissue samples and revealed that some tissues seem to age faster than others. The retina and stomach, for example, accumulate more ageing-related DNA methylation changes than do the cervix or skin. The analysis also found universal epigenetic markers of ageing across different organs. This ‘epigenetic atlas’ might help researchers to study the link between DNA methylation and ageing and could aid the identification of molecular targets for anti-ageing treatments.\n\n“I think this is a great resource” to understand ageing, says Joao Pedro Magalhaes, a molecular biologist at the University of Birmingham, UK. “This meta-analysis of methylation data across organs is, to my knowledge, the largest such resource assembled to date. I am sure that it will be valuable to researchers.”\n\nThe work is reported on the preprint server Research Square1 and has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nEpigenetic atlas of ageing\n\nResearchers can already analyse DNA methylation patterns in people’s genomes to create ageing clocks — tools that measure biological age. However, there are unresolved fundamental questions about whether these signatures of ageing are shared across tissue types.\n\nTo elucidate how methylation relates to ageing, Nir Eynon at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of more than 15,000 samples from 17 human tissues taken from adults of different ages. They mapped out methylation changes across 900,000 potential sites in the DNA, then created an open-access atlas. “We had examples from people from 18 years old till 100 or so,” says Eynon, so we can look at the epigenetic markers and how they change across the human lifespan.\n\nWhat is ageing? Even the field’s researchers can’t agree\n\nOverall, the researchers found that the mean amount of methylation varies greatly between tissues, ranging from 35% in the cervix, through to 48% in skin, 51% in muscle, 53% in the heart, 57% in the stomach and up to 63% in the retina.\n\nStudy co-author Macsue Jacques, also at Monash University, says almost all tissues have increased DNA methylation as they age. The exceptions are skeletal muscle and lung, “which has more of a loss of methylation with age”. Their analysis also found that different organs have distinct ageing patterns of DNA methylation. “Each tissue has a different shift that happens,” Jacques says.\n\nAgeing methylation targets\n\nAs well as examining differences between tissues, the researchers screened individual gene sites throughout each tissue genome. “We wanted to find a common ageing mechanism that goes across all the tissue types,” says Jacques.\n\nThey found several genes that had methylation changes were strong biological markers of ageing across several tissues. These included the developmental regulators HDAC4 and HOX, which are related to senescence and age-related decline, and MEST, which has been associated with diabetes and obesity, two known accelerators of ageing2.\n\nThe researchers identified high methylation of the protocadherin gamma (PCDHG) gene family as a driver of the ageing process in multiple different organs. Other studies have shown that hypermethylation in the PCDHG gene family is linked to reduced white matter in the brain, a marker of accelerated cognitive decline3.",

          "abstract": "Humans have been walking on two legs for millions of years. Credit: Nick Veasey/SPL via Alamy\n\nAll vertebrate species have a pelvis, but only humans use it for upright, two-legged walking. The evolution of the human pelvis, and our two-legged gait, dates back five million years, but the precise evolutionary process that allowed this to happen has remained a mystery.\n\nNow, researchers have mapped key structural changes in the pelvis that first enabled early humans to walk on two legs, and to give birth to babies with large brains and broad shoulders. The study, published in Nature on 27 August1, compared the embryonic development of the pelvis between humans and other mammals. They found two crucial evolutionary steps — related to the growth of cartilage and bone in the pelvis — that put humans on a separate evolutionary path to that of other apes.\n\n“Everything from the base of our skull to the tips of our toes has been changed in modern humans in order to facilitate bipedalism,” says Tracy Kivell, a palaeoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nKivell says the study offers a new understanding of how some of those changes came about, not just in living humans, but also in ancient hominins such as Denisovans. “I think it’s exciting in terms of moving forward this area of functional genomics,” she says.\n\nTwo small steps for evolution\n\nAs modern humans evolved, our pelvises developed the wide, bowl-like shape needed to allow upright, two-legged walking — but exactly how that happened had been unclear. “The human pelvis is dramatically different [to] what you see in chimpanzees and gorillas, so we wanted to set out to try and understand what’s happening there,” says study co-author Terence Capellini, a developmental geneticist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nTo investigate, the researchers studied anatomical, histological and genomic changes in samples of human pelvis from various stages of development. They then compared pelvic development in humans with the process in mice and in other primate species, including gibbons and chimpanzees.\n\nThe researchers focused their analysis on the formation of the ilium, a pelvic bone that supports internal organs and anchors the gluteal muscles to stabilize walking. The team collected specimens of primate embryos — some hundreds of years old — from museums in the United States and Europe. “These museum collections are exceptionally precious: they were collected in the last 100–200 years,” says Capellini.\n\nComplex genetic and molecular changes to a bone called the ilium have helped to shape the human pelvis in a way that allows us to walk on two legs.Credit: Massimo Brega/Science Photo Library\n\nThe analysis identified two key steps in the development of the human ilium that enabled its characteristic shape and therefore its ability to support bipedalism.\n\nThe first step occurs at around seven gestational weeks, when early bone development begins with the formation of a vertical rod of cartilage. This process is similar in non-human primates. But what happens next sets the human pelvis apart — in humans, the ilium cartilage growth plate rotates by 90 degrees shortly after its formation. This ultimately makes the pelvis short and broad.\n\nThe second step unique to humans takes place later in development, when the ilium cartilage ‘ossifies’ and is replaced by bone cells. In humans, the internal ossification of the ilium does not happen until around 24 gestational weeks — much later than in other primates. This delay allows the cartilage cells to maintain the shape of the pelvis while it grows.\n\nTogether, these developmental quirks help to produce a pelvis with the perfect shape for bipedalism.",

          "abstract": "Global warming has accelerated in the past decade, with the world’s average surface temperature in 2024 surpassing pre-industrial levels by 1.5 °C1. Although, so far, human activities have been largely responsible2, the factors behind recent record-breaking temperatures remain to be understood. Are human activities amplifying warming faster than scientists expected, or might natural changes in the Earth system have a stronger role than presumed? Researchers and policymakers need answers fast.\n\nTo quantify the causes and effects of climate change, the climate-research community relies mainly on three types of information sources. First, model simulations provide insights and predictions on timescales from one year to decades, through initiatives such as the World Climate Research Programme’s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)3 and Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change activities4. Second, snapshots of global climate are tracked through various observed and model-based indicators5. Third, climate reanalyses such as ERA5 (see go.nature.com/3hxepxf) and MERRA-2 (see go.nature.com/41x7k24), which assimilate historical observations into models, are widely used for monitoring and research to understand how the Earth system has evolved.\n\nGoogle AI model mines trillions of images to create maps of Earth ‘at any place and time’\n\nAlthough these and other analyses by climate researchers use the most up-to-date observations, model simulations tend to lag. Models are driven by estimates of natural and human influences on Earth’s climate system — known as forcings data — that are based on analyses of a wide range of observations, covering temperatures, greenhouse gases and more. Almost all Earth system models use the same forcing data sets, which are formally updated every five to seven years to support successive phases of the CMIP6. Thus, the inputs to drive the models are based on older or approximate data that might not reflect conditions today.\n\nAnnual updates to the forcing data sets are urgently needed to enable researchers to understand and explain unfolding changes in the world’s climate in near-real time7. Here, we and our co-signatories (see Supplementary information) set out how that can be done.\n\nRecognize the need for speed\n\nForcing data sets are built using a variety of climate observations and products derived from them (see Supplementary information). The data sets include: emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols; concentrations of greenhouse gases and substances that deplete ozone; aerosols ejected by volcanoes; as well as measures of incoming solar radiation, land-use changes, sea surface temperatures and sea ice. The resulting files must be prepared in standard data formats and disseminated on a stable, accessible and robust platform. All of this takes time.\n\nClimate scientists push for access to world’s biggest supercomputers to build better Earth models\n\nOver the past decade, the production of forcing data sets has become more coordinated. Before the CMIP’s fifth phase (CMIP5; 2008–13), they were developed in an ad hoc way, mostly in-house at modelling centres. CMIP6 (2014–21) spawned a system under which the data sets were developed by specialists based elsewhere8. This work was brought together in 2022 under the CMIP Forcings Task Team (see go.nature.com/3jxaqgf) to support the ongoing CMIP79. Earlier this year, the latest forcings data sets were delivered10, most of which span from 1850 to the early 2020s.\n\nBut climate conditions can vary a lot over five to seven years, influenced by volcanic eruptions, large wildfires, or even pandemics or policy interventions. Annual updates to forcings data sets would better align model simulations and observations. Progress in four areas is needed for this to happen.\n\nSecure, reliable observations\n\nA sustained and robust stream of observations is essential for accurate and timely updates. Three actions are needed. First, researchers and governments must enhance and maintain comprehensive long-term global observational networks to ensure consistent coverage of climate-relevant variables. Second, institutions around the world should align observational efforts, share data, enhance data availability and quality, and coordinate funding. Third, a sustainable source of funding is needed for the long-term production of forcings data sets, including the augmenting of existing work on data-format and quality standards, and documentation that enhances downstream use.\n\nBalance research and applications\n\nThe generation of forcings data sets is a continuous process, involving research and refinement before the final products are compiled and disseminated. The data sets have a range of uses, from real-time applications such as air-quality forecasting and the detection and tracking of emission events, including those from volcanic eruptions and wildfires, to comprehensive historical analyses. Each use has different requirements.\n\nGovernments must stop hoarding climate data",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "Gigantic trenches known as gullies are opening up in cities in Africa, swallowing up homes and businesses, sometimes in an instant, a study has found1.\n\nAbout 118,600 people, on average, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) alone were displaced between 2004 and 2023, according to researchers reporting their findings in Nature.\n\nWithout urgent action, researchers estimate that hundreds of thousands of people across Africa are likely to be displaced within the next 10 years, including more than one-quarter of the 770,000 or so people in the DRC living in the expected expansion zone of these gullies.\n\n“It’s an underestimated and severely under-researched hazard,” says study co-author Matthias Vanmaercke, a geographer at the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. It is caused by “a combination of natural and human factors”, he says, but this is “not at all unavoidable”.\n\nExpanding gullies\n\nGullies are expanding across cities that are built on sandy soils and lack adequate drainage. When there are heavy rains, water accumulates on roads and rooftops. When the drainage systems are inadequate, the water finds its way into unprotected ground, carving deep holes that can stretch for hundreds of metres. Over time, the gullies swallow houses and other infrastructure, and sometimes even result in deaths.\n\nVanmaercke and his colleagues used satellite images taken between 2021 and 2023 to identify 2,922 urban gullies in 26 of 47 cities, covering a cumulative distance of nearly 740 kilometres. The team cross-checked these images with historical aerial photographs stored at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium and found that only 46 of the gullies were present in the 1950s. This “gave the first clear indication that this is indeed attributable to the ongoing urbanization”, Vanmaercke says.\n\nIn 99% of cases, the gullies had expanded by at least 10 square metres between 2004 and 2023. The average gully was 253 metres long and 31 metres across at its widest point, and nearly all of them were linked to the road network. “The water cannot infiltrate, and it concentrates along these roads which basically become big canals that turn into rivers,” says Vanmaercke.\n\nThe researchers then combined data on population density with the gully maps. This enabled them to estimate that an average of 118,600 people were displaced because of gullies over the period — with displacement rates more than doubling after 2020.\n\nHazardous science that helps to save and improve lives needs more support\n\nGuy Ilombe Mawe, a geomorphologist at the Official University of Bukavu in the DRC and a co-author of the paper says that the widening of gullies can be catastrophic and even fatal, and that families living near gullies often have no safe alternatives.\n\nIn November 2019, the researchers visited Kinshasa, the DRC’s capital and one of the most affected cities, with 868 urban gullies stretching over a total of 221 kilometres. There they met a mother whose home stood near a gully edge. Two days later, several of her children were killed while sheltering at a relative’s house, when an expanding gully collapsed overnight. At least 40 people in Kinshasa died that night.",

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "University students might soon have something other than black-light posters to brighten their dorm rooms. Researchers have created glow-in-the-dark plants by injecting succulents with materials similar to those that make the posters light up. The fleshy plants shine as brightly as a night light, and can be made to do so in a wide variety of colours — a first for glowing houseplants, according to the team.\n\nGlow way! Bioluminescent houseplant hits US market for first time\n\nThe researchers, led by Xuejie Zhang, a materials scientist at the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou, describe today how they produced the plants in the journal Matter1. They have applied for a patent on the technology, which they hope will lead to decorative installations and living lighting.\n\nThe idea of making glowing plants has captivated scientists since the late 1980s, when researchers made the first bioluminescent plant2 by inserting a gene from a firefly (Photinus pyralis) into a type of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). This work laid the foundation for the first genetically engineered luminescent houseplant to come on the market in the United States, last year. The biotechnology firm Light Bio in Sun Valley, Idaho, sells the petunia (Petunia hybrida), which glows a very faint green thanks to genes from a light-emitting mushroom.\n\nLeafy greens … and blues and reds\n\nUnlike the petunia, which emits light through chemical reactions in its cells, the succulent glows because of materials injected into its leaves. These materials — phosphor particles made of strontium and aluminium dosed with other metals — absorb energy from light at one wavelength, store some of that energy and then slowly re-emit it at a different wavelength for several hours. For instance, one material the scientists injected into their succulents absorbs ultraviolet and blue light, and re-emits it as green light.\n\nThis type of ‘afterglow’ phosphor is used in glow-in-the-dark toys and paints, and as an imaging tracer for laboratory animals. Whereas genetically engineered bioluminescent plants are, so far, limited in the range of colours they emit, afterglow phosphors span a wide variety of hues, including red and blue, and they can be combined to produce a white glow.\n\nThis video shows how the tiny phosphor particles spread through the succulent leaves after they are injected.Credit: Liu et al./Matter\n\nThe researchers purchased phosphors containing strontium aluminate and ground them down to particles of various sizes before injecting them into an assortment of plants. They found that particles around 7 micrometres in diameter glowed more brightly than did nanoparticles in plants, and were able to fill up the interior tissues of succulent leaves for a stronger, more uniform glow. By contrast, plants with simple leaf structures, such as tobacco plants and pak choi, emitted a more patchy glow.\n\nThe plant favoured by the team is the succulent Echevaria ‘Mebina’, a common houseplant that grows rosettes of dense, fleshy leaves. To make every leaf glow, the researchers had to inject each one with phoshor particles, a process that takes about ten minutes. The luminescence — which the team generated in hues of blue-green, blue-violet, green, red and white — lasted as long as 120 minutes after exposing the plant to tailored wavelengths of light or sunlight, and could be triggered again and again over the 10 days of the study.",

          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "An AI tool can screen thousands of journals, and identify ones that violate quality standards.Credit: PaulPaladin/Alamy\n\nResearchers have identified more than 1,000 potentially problematic open-access journals using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that screened around 15,000 titles for signs of dubious publishing practices.\n\nThe approach, described in Science Advances on 27 August1, could be used to help tackle the rise in what the study authors call “questionable open-access journals” — those that charge fees to publish papers without doing rigorous peer review or quality checks.\n\nPredatory publishers’ latest scam: bootlegged and rebranded papers\n\nNone of the journals flagged by the tool has previously been on any kind of watchlist, and some titles are owned by large, reputable publishers. Together, the journals have published hundreds of thousands of research papers that have received millions of citations.\n\nThe study suggests that “there’s a whole group of problematic journals in plain sight that are functioning as supposedly respected journals that really don’t deserve that qualification”, says Jennifer Byrne, a research-integrity sleuth and cancer researcher at the University of Sydney, Australia.\n\nThe tool is available online in a closed beta version, and organizations that index journals, or publishers, can use it to review their portfolios, says study co-author Daniel Acuña, a computer scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder. But, he adds, the AI sometimes makes mistakes, and is not designed to replace detailed evaluations of journals and individual publications that might result in a title being removed from an index. “A human expert should be part of the vetting process” before any action is taken, he says.\n\nScreening journals\n\nThe AI tool can analyse a vast amount of information from journals’ websites and the papers they publish, and search for red flags — such as short turnaround times for publishing articles and high rates of self-citation. It also assesses whether members of a journal’s editorial board are affiliated with well known, reputable research institutions, and checks how transparent publications are about licensing and fees. Several of the criteria used to train the tool come from best-practice guidance developed by the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), an index of open-access journals run by the non-profit DOAJ Foundation in Roskilde, Denmark.\n\nCenyu Shen, the DOAJ’s deputy head of editorial quality, who is based in Helsinki, says that the number of problematic journals is rising, and that their “tactics are becoming more sophisticated”. “We are observing more instances where questionable publishers acquire legitimate journals, or where paper mills purchase journals to publish low-quality work,” she adds. (Paper mills are businesses that sell fake papers and authorships.)\n\nI’m worried I’ve been contacted by a predatory publisher — how do I find out?\n\nThe DOAJ’s own quality checks on journals are done mostly manually and are initiated only after receiving complaints. In 2024, the directory investigated 473 journals, a rise of 40% compared with 2021. “The time our team spent on these investigations also grew significantly by nearly 30%, to 837 hours,” says Shen.\n\nAI tools could help to speed up some of these assessments, Acuña says. He and his colleagues trained their model on 12,869 journals that are currently indexed in the DOAJ as legitimate, as well as 2,536 that the directory had flagged as violating its quality standards.\n\nWhen the researchers asked the AI to evaluate 15,191 open-access journals listed in the public database Unpaywall, it identified 1,437 journals as questionable. The team estimated that some 345 of these were mistakenly flagged: they included discontinued titles, book series and journals from small, learned-society publishers. The researchers also found that the tool had failed to flag a further 1,782 questionable journals, based on estimates of error rates.",

          "abstract": "The use of complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAIM) is highly prevalent among autistic individuals, with up to 90% reporting having used CAIM at least once in their lifetime. However, the evidence base for the effects of CAIM for autism remains uncertain. Here, to fill this gap, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism across the lifespan and developed a web platform to disseminate the generated results. Five databases were searched (up to 31 December 2023) for systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism. Independent pairs of investigators identified eligible papers and extracted relevant data. Included meta-analyses were reestimated using a consistent statistical approach, and their methodological quality was assessed with AMSTAR-2. The certainty of evidence generated by each meta-analysis was appraised using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework. This process led to the identification of 53 meta-analytic reports, enabling us to conduct 248 meta-analyses exploring the effects of 19 CAIMs in autism. We found no high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of any CAIM for core or associated symptoms of autism. Although several CAIMs showed promising results, they were supported by very low-quality evidence. The safety of CAIMs has rarely been evaluated, making it a crucial area for future research. To support evidence-based consideration of CAIM interventions for autism, we developed an interactive platform that facilitates access to and interpretation of the present results ( https://ebiact-database.com ).",

Most studies focused on reducing the likelihood of committing biases (for example, confirmation bias) using cognitive strategies. Some biases seemed difficult to overcome (for example, representativeness heuristic), and questions remain about the depth and transferability of learning beyond classroom settings. All studies had unclear or high risk of bias and there was some risk of publication bias. While evidence suggests that educational interventions can reduce bias on targeted tasks, more research is needed to determine whether these improvements translate to meaningful changes in real-world decision-making and to identify which paedagogical approaches are most effective for reducing the influence of cognitive biases.",

On the basis of millions of moves, we show how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices reveals a power law spanning five orders of magnitude. To do so, we incorporate geography via the pair distribution function, which encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. By showing how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, our approach bridges the gap between distance- and opportunity-based models of human mobility.",

The rise of modern sanitation and reduction of infectious diseases has been implicated in increasing levels of allergy and immune dysregulation: termed, the “hygiene hypothesis.” This study leverages quasi-experimental variation from combining precampaign hookworm exposure with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission’s deworming campaign in the early 20th century to rigorously examine the impacts of childhood hookworm exposure on adult lifespan and morbidity. Findings show deworming before age five leads to 2.5 additional months of life in a large sample of adult death records. Further, decreasing hookworm exposure is related to improvements in biomarkers for inflammation and skin-tested allergies, in contrast to predictions of the “hygiene hypothesis.” Placebo tests using health outcomes that should not be affected by deworming do not show similar patterns. Overall, childhood deworming leads to improvements in morbidity and lifespan decades later.",

We test how ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility predicted social media users’ engagement with 62,118 posts by 484 US partisan accounts before and after the first Trump assassination attempt (July 13) and Biden’s re-election campaign suspension (July 21). We find that, while outgroup hostility is typically the dominant predictor of engagement, interactions with ingroup solidarity surged among Republicans after the Trump shooting and among Democrats after Biden’s withdrawal.

A total of 127 same-sex dyads ( M age = 22.8 y, 51.2% female) played 40 rounds of an online Stag Hunt game, with dyads randomly assigned to either a no communication or communication condition. Participants were not informed about the game’s payoff structure in advance and had to infer it during play. Results showed that coordination on the payoff-dominant outcome (Stag–Stag) increased across trials, but only when communication was possible. No significant sex differences were observed. These findings highlight the central role of communication in fostering cooperation, particularly in environments in which information must be jointly discovered. This is an important consideration for developing and interpreting future research. Moreover, subsequent research should explore how the content, timing, and relevance of communication shape cooperative outcomes over time.",

          "abstract": "How societies remember the dead can reveal what people value in life. We analyzed 38 million obituaries from the United States to examine how personal values are encoded in individual and collective legacies. Using Schwartz’s theory of basic human values, we found that tradition and benevolence dominated legacy reflections, while values like power and stimulation appeared less frequently. Major cultural events—the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—were systematically linked to changes in legacy reflections about personal values, with security declining after 9/11, achievement declining after the financial crisis, and benevolence declining for years after COVID-19 began and, to date, not yet returning to baseline. Gender and age of the deceased were also linked to differences in legacy: Men were remembered more for achievement , power , and conformity , while women were remembered more for benevolence and hedonism . Older people were remembered more for tradition and conformity than younger people. These patterns shifted dynamically across the lifespan, with obituaries for men showing more age-related variation than legacies for women. Our findings reveal how obituaries serve as psychological and cultural time capsules, preserving not just individual legacies, but also indicating what US society values collectively regarding a life well lived.",

          "abstract": "Rapid global expansion of protected areas is critical for safeguarding biodiversity but depends on political action for successful implementation. Following widespread ratification of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, an unprecedented increase in area-based conservation is required to reach its target of conserving 30% of land, waters, and seas by 2030. These expansions prompt difficult trade-offs between conservation, social, and economic interests. A key factor in securing legitimacy and practical feasibility for expansion regimes is understanding what factors determine public support for them. Using survey and experimental data, we show that in eight countries across five continents, public opinion is 1) strongly in favor of the “30-by-30”-target and 2) highly consistent regarding policy priorities for the design of international- and domestic-level expansion regimes. We find that for international-level policy regimes, support increases with protection responsibilities equally split between countries, rich countries bearing higher costs, more countries actively cooperating, and placement trade not allowed. For domestic-level policy regimes, support generally increases when nature values are prioritized over social or economic values and, in many countries, decreases when costs are borne by a general tax increase, parks are managed by private companies, and when access to parks is restricted. Together, these results demonstrate how protected area expansion policies can be shaped to facilitate reaching 30% protected areas by 2030.",

Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data are available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our minimal hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation–integration transition even with memory-less agents. While residential segregation is a multifactorial phenomenon, this physics analogy suggests a simple mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood’s population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract spaces.",

          "abstract": "Glucose metabolism impacts the innate immune response against viral infection. However, the key enzymes or the natural products and mechanisms involved are not well elucidated. Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection.",

We show how the ϵ = d − 2 expansion and the 1 / d expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent y depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension.

          "abstract": "In mammals, a hierarchically organized circadian timing system orchestrates daily rhythms of nearly all physiology. A master pacemaker in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes subsidiary clocks in most peripheral organs. By driving anabolic and catabolic cycles of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and by detoxifying endo- and xenobiotic components, the liver plays an important role in adapting the metabolic needs to rest-activity rhythms. In keeping with these functions, the liver expresses many clock-controlled genes that are required for these processes. Remarkably, however, this organ also fluctuates in size and morphological parameters. In mice, the mass of the liver increases and decreases by 30 to 40% during the 24-h day. The oscillation in liver mass is accompanied by daily rhythms of similar amplitudes in hepatocyte cell size and global RNA and protein accumulation. The number of ribosomes, which parallels the ups and downs of liver size, appears to be the rate-limiting factor in driving the diurnal rhythms of overall protein synthesis. Obviously, the rapid increase in hepatocyte size within the liver engenders mechanical stress, which must be dealt with by increasing the physical robustness of cells. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton of hepatocytes undergoes dramatic polymerization cycles. Thus, massive intracellular and subcortical F-actin bundles are assembled during the night, at which the liver reaches its maximal size. In turn, the oscillation in actin polymerization elicits rhythms in myocardin-related transcription factors-serum response factor signaling, which participate in the circadian transcription of the core clock gene Per2 and thereby contribute to the synchronization of hepatocyte clocks.",

          "abstract": "Despite sharing fewer than 10 core genes, the hyperdiverse Nucleocytoviricota phylum (ranging from poxviruses to giant viruses) universally assembles viral factories (VFs) resembling biomolecular condensates. Regardless, it is unclear how these viruses achieve such a level of functional conservation without clear conserved genetic information. We demonstrate that the VFs produced by amoeba-infecting viruses have liquid-like properties and identify a conserved molecular grammar governing viral factory scaffold protein: charge-patterned intrinsically disordered regions that drive phase separation independently of sequence homology. This grammar predicts functional scaffold proteins across the 15 viral families, revealing evolutionary constraints invisible to sequence or structural analysis. Strikingly, VFs exhibit subcompartmentalization analogous to nuclei, segregating transcription and mRNA processing (inner condensates) from replication (interphase zones) and translation (host cytoplasm). Our work establishes phase separation as a fundamental organizational principle bridging extreme genomic diversity, explaining how biological complexity emerges without gene conservation. This grammar is likely also conserved in non-amoeba-infecting members of the phylum and thus may represent a primordial solution for organelle-like organization, with broad implications for antiviral targeting.",

The scarcity of verified Denisovan fossils makes it challenging to study their anatomy, and how well they were adapted to their environment. We previously developed a genetic phenotyping approach to gain insight into Denisovan anatomy by detecting gene regulatory changes that likely altered Denisovan skeletal morphology. Here, we scan the Middle Pleistocene fossil record for crania matching the predicted Denisovan morphology and might therefore be related to Denisovans. We developed quantitative measures to assess both the proportion and extent of matches. These analyses revealed that the East Asian specimens of Harbin and Dali show an exceptionally high concordance with the Denisovan profile, surpassing all other examined Middle Pleistocene hominin specimens, including Neanderthals. Specifically, 15 out of 18 of Dali ’s features and 16 out of 18 of Harbin ’s matched Denisovan predictions. These findings are robust to overall skull size and to correlations between phenotypes. We also found that Kabwe 1 shows a strong affinity to the Denisovan–Neanderthal clade and might be placed near its root.

          "abstract": "In vivo genome editing has the potential to address many inherited and environmental disorders. However, a major hurdle for the clinical translation of genome editing is safe, efficient delivery to disease-relevant tissues. A modality-agnostic reporter animal model that facilitates rapid, precise, and quantifiable assessment of functional delivery and editing could greatly enhance the evaluation and translation of delivery technologies. Here, we present the development of the tdTomato in vivo genome-editing reporter (TIGER) mouse, a reporter strain that harbors an integrated and constitutively expressed mutated tdTomato gene in the Polr2a locus. The mutations (Q115X, Q357X) abolish fluorescence, but successful adenine base editing (ABE) or prime editing (PE) restores tdTomato fluorescence. This mouse model facilitates the tissue- and cell type–specific assessment of genome editing agent delivery. We describe several editing strategies validated in vitro and demonstrate efficient ABE and PE in vivo using viral and nonviral delivery vectors targeting four cell types within the mouse eye: the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, Müller glia, and the trabecular meshwork. We show direct editing characterization in the ocular tissues via in vivo and ex vivo two-photon confocal microscopy and verify the spectral and fluorescence lifetime properties of tdTomato reporter in other mouse tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate successful adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PE of extraocular tissues, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and brain neurons by intravenous injection. Thus, the TIGER mouse facilitates the direct development, comparison, and optimization of delivery platforms for efficient and productive ABE or PE broadly applicable in vivo across multiple tissues tested in this study.",

          "abstract": "Global demand for wood products is increasing forest harvest. One understudied consequence of logging is that it accelerates mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to aquatic ecosystems where it is more easily rereleased to the atmosphere. Here, we tested how logging changed DOM in headwaters of hardwood-dominated catchments in northern Ontario, Canada. We applied a before-after-control-impact experiment across four catchments for 3 y and measured DOM monthly during ice-free seasons. DOM concentration in streams from logged catchments quadrupled, on average, only for the first 2 mo postharvest, but resulting changes to the molecular composition of DOM persisted for at least 2 y. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DOM composition within logged streams became more available for microbial use and chemically diverse than in controls, with novel highly unsaturated polyphenols, carboxylic-rich alicyclic, and nitrogen-containing formulae. The molecular composition of stream DOM measured fortnightly postharvest was most similar to the DOM composition of surrounding soils, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity. Alongside carbon being more likely to be released into the atmosphere, we estimate that selective logging increased the total flux of dissolved organic carbon in streams by 6.4% of the carbon extracted as timber. Although these estimates are short-lived, they should affect the millions of hectares that are logged annually. Carbon accounting of forestry, including as a natural climate solution, must now consider the transport and fate of DOM from land into water.",

          "abstract": "Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO 2 -laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a nonlinear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam’s soap films (≠1 for CO 2 /air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.",

Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach.

To address these challenges, we present Streptomyces -compatible TnpB-assisted genome editing (STAGE), a genetic toolkit based on ISDra2 TnpB, which is approximately one-third the size of Cas9 and enables precise, site-specific gene editing. We demonstrated that STAGE introduces genetic mutations with high efficiency and minimal off-target effects in two industrially important Streptomyces strains. Building on this platform, we developed STAGE-cBEST and STAGE-McBEST, enabling single and multiplexed C·G-to-T·A base editing, respectively, with editing efficiencies exceeding 75%. To further enhance performance, we engineered the ISDra2 TnpB system using an AI-assisted protein engineering framework, resulting in two variants that achieve nearly 100% genome editing efficiency. Additionally, through sequence homology analysis, we identified a TnpB ortholog from the same biological origin of ISDra2 TnpB, which also functions effectively as a gene editing tool. Our study establishes STAGE as a highly precise, programmable, and versatile genome editing platform for Streptomyces , paving the way for advanced genetic manipulation and synthetic biology applications in these industrially important bacteria.",

          "abstract": "Precise, noninvasive drug delivery to small but important brain regions is challenging and highly desired given the brain’s inherent complexity and heterogeneous nature. Here, we report an approach utilizing focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with nanobubbles to successfully navigate this challenge. Compared to traditional microbubbles, nanobubbles exhibit superior acoustic properties. The nanobubbles, when exposed to FUS, induce a highly localized and reversible opening of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) with significantly enhanced precision (up to fourfolds compared to microbubbles, as measured by the precision loss metric). Repeated multitarget FUS-NB precisely delivers macromolecular human-derived anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) into the small brain region within a 2-h half-life window per opening. Fluorescence images confirm HuMAb retention in the brain parenchyma for at least 10 d postadministration. With this approach, we targeted the lateral habenula, a small but effective brain target for antidepressant treatments, and significantly alleviated depression-like symptoms at least 2 wk in a mouse model (tail suspension test/forced swim test: P &lt; 0.01/0.05). Moreover, minimal red blood cell extravasation (0.9‱ affected area) was observed in the treated region after multiple FUS treatments, indicating the safety and tolerability of FUS-nanobubble-mediated BBB opening. The enhanced delivery precision, coupled with a favorable safety profile, positions our approach as a promising strategy for antibody therapy with significant clinical translation potential.",

          "abstract": "Arsenite (As III ) is toxic to all organisms due to its ability to tightly bind exposed thiols within cells. An important As III resistance mechanism in prokaryotes involves proteins encoded by the ars operon. A central component of the ars operon in many bacteria is the cytoplasmic ATPase, ArsA, which orchestrates a series of nucleotide-dependent handoffs, starting with the capture of As III by the ArsD metallochaperone and culminating in its removal from the cell by the ArsB efflux pump. Although the mechanism of ArsA has been widely studied, the molecular details of how nucleotide hydrolysis modulates these events remain unclear. ArsA is an archetypal member of the intradimeric Walker A (IWA) family of ATPases, implicated in a diversity of complex biological functions. Conformational changes typical of IWA ATPases have been postulated to drive these molecular events but have not been demonstrated. We report cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ArsA in MgADP-bound and MgATP-bound open states, as well as a distinct closed MgATP-bound state liganded to As III . X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed three-coordinate binding of As III to the conserved cysteines at the metalloid-binding site of the closed state. Coupled with biochemical characterization, our cryo-EM structures reveal key conformational changes in the ArsA catalytic cycle consistent with other IWA ATPases and provide the structural basis for allosteric activation of nucleotide hydrolysis by As III . This work establishes how the nucleotide state of ArsA transiently creates a high-affinity binding site that can sequester metalloid within the cell, followed by a nucleotide-driven handoff to ArsB for efflux.",

Here, we systematically mapped the ligand specificities of selected extracytoplasmic sensory domains from twenty members of the human gut microbiota, with a primary focus on the abundant and physiologically important class of Clostridia. Twenty-five metabolites from different chemical classes—including amino acids, nucleobase derivatives, amines, indole, and carboxylates—were identified as specific ligands for fifteen sensory domains from nine bacterial species, which represent all three major functional classes of transmembrane receptors: chemotaxis receptors, histidine kinases, and enzymatic sensors. We have further characterized the specificity and evolution of ligand binding to Cache superfamily sensors specific for lactate, dicarboxylic acids, and for uracil and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Structural and biochemical analysis of the dCache sensor of uracil and SCFAs revealed that its two different ligand types bind at distinct sensory modules. Overall, combining experimental identification with computational analyses, we were able to assign ligands to approximately half of the Cache-type chemotaxis receptors found in the eleven gut commensal genomes from our set, with carboxylic acids representing the largest ligand class. Among these, the most commonly found ligand specificities were for lactate and formate, indicating a particular importance of these metabolites in the human gut microbiota and consistent with their observed growth-promoting effects on selected bacterial commensals.",

We found that most class 3 mAbs, especially those not blocking receptor-binding domain-ACE2 binding, including VIR-7831, were substantially underestimated in cell-line-based assays. Nasal organoids adequately recapitulated the real-world effectiveness of VIR-7831 because of biologically relevant low ACE2 expression, and exclusively reproduced the in vivo protection of S2 mAbs due to the high TMPRSS2 expression, reminiscent of native human respiratory epithelial cells. Collectively, the robust organoid culture system and biologically relevant expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 make nasal organoids present a correlate of in vivo protection of neutralizing mAbs exclusively.

The cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal silence depend on both Aβ and tau protein pathologies, with an unknown role of Aβ. Here, by using single-cell-initiated rabies virus (RV) tracing in mouse models of β-amyloidosis, we demonstrate that the presynaptic connectivity of silent, but not that of hyperactive, neurons is severely disrupted. Furthermore, silent neurons display a major spine loss and strongly suppressed synaptic activity. Thus, we suggest that synaptic decoupling is an Aβ-dependent cellular mechanism underlying progressive neuronal silencing and a critical factor for the cognitive impairments encountered in AD.",

That perinatally produced Tregs persist for a protracted period in peripheral lymphoid organs has been well documented, as has their superior ability to protect the organism from many autoimmune diseases. However, their contribution to pools of nonlymphoid-tissue Tregs and their homeostatic functions therein have been little studied. We show that perinatal Tregs preferentially derive from a CD25 + Foxp3 − thymocyte progenitor; that they seed and persist to varying degrees in every nonlymphoid tissue examined; and that transient depletion of perinatally generated Tregs in adults, but not in neonates, is followed by poor reconstitution of Treg numbers and phenotypes in epididymal visceral-adipose tissue (eVAT) and the skin but not in several lymphoid and other nonlymphoid tissues. Potential clinical implications of such a deficiency are highlighted by findings on mice subjected to weight cycling: Imposing a low-fat–high-fat–low-fat diet regimen in adult, but not juvenile, mice results in an impoverished eVAT, but not spleen, Treg compartment, accompanied by normal weight gain and glucose tolerance but profound insulin resistance.

          "abstract": "Life thrives due to its remarkable ability to create complex structures through the self-assembly of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. Achieving such complex assemblies with the same level of fidelity, reproducibility, and advanced functionality in synthetic systems, however, has remained a grand challenge. One outstanding problem is the presence of parasitic products and long-lived intermediate states that slow the reaction process and limit the yield of the final product. Biology overcomes this challenge by proofreading to recognize and disassemble parasitic products. Such local checks, however, are currently difficult to implement in available self-assembly platforms. Here, we overcome this challenge by implementing a proofreading mechanism in a self-assembly platform. Specifically, we design intermediate states that strongly couple to an external force but a final product that is decoupled and thus highly stable to external driving, such that application of external forces selectively dissociates parasitic products. To implement this idea, we introduce lithographically patterned magnetic dipoles and an applied magnetic field to drive an assembly process similar to thermal self-assembly, but with additional controls. By applying patterns of magnetic driving that selectively destabilize parasitic states, we effectively implement a proofreading strategy to enable high-yield, time-efficient self-assembly. This realization of a general proofreading mechanism bridges the gap between artificial and biological self-assembly, paving the way for advanced self-assembled materials, with applications in next generation responsive materials, biomimetic devices, and microscale machines.",

          "abstract": "Biological flyers periodically flap their appendages to generate aerodynamic forces. Extensive studies have made significant progress in explaining the physics behind their propulsion in cruising by developing scaling laws of their flight kinematics. Notably Strouhal number ( St ; ratio of flapping frequency times stroke amplitude to cruising speed) has been found to fall in a narrow range for animal cruising flights. However, St exhibits strong correlation to flight conditions; as such, its universality has been confined to preferred flight conditions. Since the leading-edge vortices (LEV) on flapping appendages generate the majority of propulsive forces, here we take the perspective of LEV circulation maximization, which generalizes the dimensionless vortex formation time to flapping flight. The generalized vortex formation time scales the duration of vorticity injection with the rate of total vorticity growth inside the LEV and the maximum vorticity allowed inside it. By comparing the new scaling with St of previously reported animal cruising flights of 28 species, we show that the generalized vortex formation time is consistent across different animals and cruising locomotion, independent of flight conditions. This finding advances the fundamental principles underlying the complex wing kinematics of biological flyers and highlights a unifying framework for understanding biolocomotion.",

          "abstract": "Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a Ca 2+ -sensing protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The depletion of ER Ca 2+ stores induces a large conformational transition of the cytosolic STIM1 C-terminus, initiated by the dimerization of the transmembrane (TM) domain. We use the AI-guided transition path sampling algorithm aimmd to extensively sample the dimerization of STIM1-TM helices in an ER-mimicking lipid bilayer. In nearly 0.5 ms of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without bias potentials, we harvest over 170 transition paths, each about 1.2 μs long on average. We find that STIM1 dimerizes into three distinct and coexisting configurations, which reconciles conflicting results from earlier crosslinking studies. The dominant X-shaped bound state centers around contacts supported by the SxxxG TM interfacial motif. Mutating residues in this contact interface allows us to tune the STIM1-dimerization propensity in fluorescence experiments. From the trained model of the committor probability of dimerization, we identify the transition state ensemble for TM-helix dimerization. At the transition state, interhelical contacts in the luminal halves of the two monomers dominate, which likely enables the luminal Ca 2+ -sensing domain in STIM1 to condition the dimerization of the TM helices. Our work demonstrates the unique power of AI-guided simulations to sample rare and slow molecular transitions and to produce detailed atomistic insight into the mechanism of STIM1 TM-helix dimerization as a key step in ER Ca 2+ -sensing.",

Here, we use the Drosophila ovary as a model to study the role of cytonemes in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling–directed germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and dedifferentiation of germ cells to GSCs. We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend longer cytonemes that are more polarized toward the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signaling. The presence of additional somatic cells in the niche is associated with a failure of germ cell dedifferentiation, consistent with the formation of a physical barrier to cytoneme–niche contact and outcompetition of germ cells for BMP. Using BMP beads in vitro, we show that these are sufficient to induce cytoneme-dependent contacts in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We demonstrate that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localized to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalization reduces the frequency, length, and directionality of cytonemes. During homeostasis, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalization impairs GSC fitness by reducing GSC BMP signaling and niche occupancy. Disrupting cytonemes by targeting Ena during dedifferentiation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate. Overall, our results provide evidence that cytonemes play a fundamental role in establishing polarized signaling and niche occupancy during stem cell maintenance and dedifferentiation.",

          "abstract": "The glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) pathway is central to the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and glycerophospholipids, essential for membrane biogenesis and lipid storage. The first and rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs), with microsomal GPAT3 and GPAT4 being evolutionarily conserved and predominant in most tissues. While previous studies have implicated Calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a cofactor for GPAT4, the broader role of CHP1 in regulating microsomal GPATs and TAG biosynthesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CHP1 is a critical regulator of both GPAT3 and GPAT4, essential for their stability, enzymatic activity, and lipid droplet (LD) localization. Structural modeling and mutational analyses identified key hydrophobic interfaces mediating the CHP1–GPAT interaction, which are required for optimal GPAT activity and LD growth. Loss of CHP1 impairs LD expansion and disrupts the localization of GPAT3/4 and downstream enzymes in the TAG synthesis pathway, including 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). Mechanistically, CHP1 helps circumvent seipin-mediated restriction of late LD-targeting enzymes, facilitating their access to mature LDs. Together, our findings reveal CHP1 as a dual-function regulator that stabilizes and activates microsomal GPATs while enabling the coordinated recruitment of TAG biosynthetic enzymes to LDs. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating LD growth and glycerolipid metabolism, with broad implications for lipid homeostasis and metabolic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Membrane active peptides (MAPs) represent a diverse group of agents that disrupt the integrity of lipid membranes. One class of MAPs, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), destroy bacteria by transiently porating the bacterial membrane causing leakage of cellular contents. Transient leakage is classified as “graded,” where all vesicles in a population leak partially, or “all-or-none,” where some vesicles leak completely. However, the molecular interactions underlying transient leakage have eluded experimental determination. Here, dye leakage experiments with the AMP piscidin 1 (P1) show that graded leakage can be converted to all-or-none by simply adding a defect-promoting lysophospholipid. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that area stress arising from membrane asymmetry decreases the energy of pore formation and is highly lipid dependent. Furthermore, lipids and peptides translocate the bilayer through these pores, leading to area-relaxed states where poration is highly unfavorable. Even pores too small to leak dye relieve area stress; they are the “none” component of all-or-none release. These observations lead to development of a quantitative model where graded and all-or-none leakage are treated as a continuum explained by a single mechanism that accounts for the local peptide concentration and probabilities of different pore sizes. This unified model accurately reproduces the P1 dye leakage data and provides an explanation for varying pore energy, size, and probability within the framework of asymmetry-driven poration. This model is expected to be applicable to other MAPs, including cell-penetrating peptides, and could provide a framework for designing peptides with greater cellular specificity, a long-sought outcome.",

Mineral–organic interactions in frozen environments, such as soils and permafrost, are crucial for explaining the flux of soluble iron during melting events, yet the mechanisms remain misunderstood. This study elucidates the unique roles of freezing in the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles (α–FeOOH) by oxalate, a low molecular weight dicarboxylate, under acidic conditions. From time-resolved experiments conducted over 4 d, we demonstrate that soluble iron was released through reactions in minute volumes of liquid water trapped between ice micrograins. Freeze concentration of nanoparticles, oxalate, and protons into this liquid water drove oxalate- and proton-promoted dissolution reactions at temperatures as low as −30 °C. Remarkably, ice at −10 °C dissolved more iron than liquid water at 4 °C under high oxalate loadings, and even more than at 25 °C under low oxalate loadings. In contrast, high salinity subdued dissolution. Also, sequential freeze-thaw cycles enhanced dissolution by releasing unreacted oxalate that was previously locked in ice. By resolving the chemical controls on mineral dissolution in ice, this work can help explain how freeze-thaw events are supplying new fluxes of soluble iron to nature.",

          "abstract": "With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse enough to truly bolster collective creativity? We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.",

          "authors": "Ji-Ung Jung, Steve Stippec, Melanie H. Cobb",
          "abstract": "With No lysine (K) 1 (WNK1) is essential for ion and volume homeostasis, sensing osmotic stress and activating pathways that regulate ion transport. Its response to osmotic stress shares similarities with the function of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In this study, we show that Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, activates WNK1 downstream kinase targets oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related serine, proline-, and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in endothelial cells within minutes. Ionophore-induced Ca 2+ influx similarly triggers their activation. Comparable responses were observed in HDMEC, HUVEC, A549, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells. Hypotonic stress also enhances SPAK and OSR1 phosphorylation, which is attenuated by WNK1 inhibition or Piezo1 knockdown, whereas hypertonic stress-induced phosphorylation is not affected by Piezo1 knockdown. Chelating Ca 2+ or depleting intracellular stores prevents their activation, while increasing intracellular Ca 2+ via the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger or thapsigargin enhances it. ER-released Ca 2+ is sufficient to activate SPAK and OSR1 even in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ , and this effect is diminished by Piezo1 knockdown. Both Yoda1 and ionomycin promote phosphorylation of WNK1 at serine 382, a modification that increases its catalytic activity. These findings identify Piezo1 as an activator of WNK1, linking Ca 2+ dynamics to WNK1-OSR1/SPAK signaling.",

          "authors": "Jacob Russin, Ellie Pavlick, Michael J. Frank",
          "abstract": "Human learning embodies a striking duality: Sometimes, we can rapidly infer and compose logical rules, benefiting from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly conflicting behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems—one for rapid, rule-based inferences (e.g., in working memory) and another for slow, incremental adaptation (e.g., in long-term and procedural memory). It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of in-context learning (ICL)—the ability to flexibly infer the structure of a new task from a few examples. In contrast to standard in-weight learning (IWL), which is analogous to synaptic change, ICL is more naturally linked to activation-based dynamics thought to underlie working memory in humans. Here, we show that the interplay between ICL and IWL naturally ties together a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, including curriculum effects on category-learning tasks, compositionality, and a trade-off between flexibility and retention in brain and behavior. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering an integrative perspective on dual-process theories of human cognition.",

Local electromagnetic fields, that usually produced by current in micro/nanoscale metal wires, have been employed for the coherent driving and addressing of spin qubit. However, the fixed distribution limits the spatial selectivity and efficiency of qubit manipulation, which is of central importance in a scaled-up quantum system. Here, we report a solution by demonstrating a reconfigurable current with arbitrary shape to engineer microwave and DC magnetic field at microscale. A “photothermal doping” method was proposed to optically control local insulator-to-metal transition in vanadium dioxide. It generates a conducting filament with adjustable position, direction, and width. Universal manipulation and selective addressing of spins at arbitrary sites are realized, by freely changing the filament and electromagnetic field on demand.

          "abstract": "Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that infect more than 200 million people globally. However, there is a shortage of molecular tools that enable the discovery of potential drug targets within schistosomes. Thus, praziquantel has remained the frontline treatment for schistosomiasis despite known liabilities. Here, we have conducted a genome-wide study in Schistosoma mansoni using the human druggable genome as a bioinformatic template to identify essential genes within schistosomes bearing similarity to catalogued drug targets. Then, we assessed these candidate targets in silico using a set of unbiased criteria to determine which possess ideal characteristics for a ready-made drug discovery campaign. Following this prioritization, we pursued a parasite p97 ortholog as a bona-fide drug target for the development of therapeutics to treat schistosomiasis. From this effort, we identified a covalent inhibitor series that kills schistosomes through an on-target killing mechanism by disrupting the ubiquitin proteasome system. Fascinatingly, these inhibitors induce a conformational change in the conserved D2 domain P-loop of schistosome p97 upon modification of Cys519. This conformational change reveals an allosteric binding site adjacent to the D2 domain active site reminiscent of the “DFG” flip in protein kinases. This allosteric binding site can potentially be utilized to generate new classes of species-selective p97 inhibitors. Furthermore, these studies provide a resource for the development of alternative therapeutics for schistosomiasis and a workflow to identify potential drug targets in similar systems with few available molecular tools.",

However, empirical and theoretical treatments of the niche are mostly performed at the species level, neglecting individuals as important units of ecological and evolutionary processes. So far, a formal mathematical link between individual-level niches and higher organismal-level niches has been lacking, hampering the unification of ecological theories and more accurate forecasts of biodiversity change. To fill in this gap, we propose a bottom–up approach to derive population and higher organismal-level niches from individual niches. We demonstrate the power of our framework by showing that 1) the statistical properties of higher organismal-level niches (e.g., niche breadth, skewness, etc.) can be partitioned into individual contributions and 2) the species-level niche shifts can be estimated by tracing the responses of individuals. By using individual-level GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking data from three different species, we show that climate change could have contrasting consequences on population-level niche shift depending on individual niche compositions. Our method paves the way for a unifying niche theory and enables mechanistic assessments of organism–environment relationships across organismal scales.",

          "abstract": "Heparan sulfates are found in all animal tissues and have essential roles in living systems. This family of biomacromolecules modulates binding to calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) in low free energy reactions that influence biochemical processes from cell signaling and anticoagulant efficacy to biomineralization. Despite their ubiquity, the thermodynamic basis for how heparans and similarly functionalized biomolecules regulate Ca 2+ interactions is not yet established. Using heparosan (Control) and heparins with different positions of sulfate groups, we quantify how SO 3 − and COO − content and SO 3 − position modulate Ca 2+ binding by isothermal titration calorimetry. The free energy of all heparin-Ca 2+ interactions (Δ G rxn ) is dominated by entropic contributions due to favorable water release from polar, hydrophilic groups. Heparin with both sulfate esters ( O -SO 3 − ) and sulfamides ( N -SO 3 − ) has the strongest binding to Ca 2+ compared to heparosan and to heparin with only O -SO 3 − groups (~3X). By linking Ca 2+ binding thermodynamics to measurements of the interfacial energy for calcite (CaCO 3 ) crystallization onto polysaccharides, we show molecule-specific differences in nucleation rate can be explained by differences in water structuring during Ca 2+ interactions. A large entropic term (- T Δ S rxn ) upon Ca 2+ –polysaccharide binding correlates with high interfacial energy to CaCO 3 nucleation. Combining our measurements with literature values indicates many Ca 2+ –polysaccharide interactions have a shared thermodynamic signature. The resulting enthalpy–entropy compensation relationship suggests these interactions are generally dominated by water restructuring involving few conformational changes, distinct from Ca 2+ –protein binding. Our findings quantify the thermodynamic origins of heparin-specific interactions with Ca 2+ and demonstrate the contributions of solvation and functional group position during biomacromolecule-mediated ion regulation.",

          "abstract": "Paleogenomic studies suggest that Mammuthus columbi derives from an ancient hybridization between Mammuthus primigenius and Mammuthus trogontherii . While its habitat spanned from North to Central America, available genetic data are limited to temperate regions, leaving gaps in knowledge of the species’ demographic history on the continent. In this study, we generated 61 capture-enriched M. columbi mitogenomes from the Basin of Mexico, in Central Mexico. Our analysis reveals that these mitogenomes belong to a mitochondrial lineage distinct from other North American mammoths. These divergent mitogenomes suggest a deep population structure in their ancestors, and challenge prior assumptions based on geographically restricted samples. Our findings underscore the importance of wider spatial sampling to reconstruct mammoths’ evolutionary history and demonstrate the feasibility of studying megafauna from tropical latitudes.",

          "abstract": "Tissue macrophages reside in anatomically distinct subtissular niches that shape their identity and function. In white adipose tissue (WAT), we identified three macrophage populations with distinct localization, turnover, and phenotypes. Septal adipose tissue macrophages (sATMs), marked by CD209b and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, were long-lived and positioned in close proximity to adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) within the WAT septum. Within this shared niche, sATMs instructed the differentiation of ASCs into white adipocytes through transforming growth factor–β1 (TGFβ1). Depletion of sATMs, or the selective loss of TGFβ1 within tissue-resident macrophages, redirected ASC fate toward thermogenic adipocytes, enhancing WAT beiging and protecting against diet-induced obesity. These findings highlight the role of a discrete, anatomically defined macrophage population that governs ASC fate and orchestrates adipose tissue expansion.",

We constructed machine learning (ML) models for 10 diseases using 1,347,298 participants with electronic health records, then applied them to an independent cohort with linked exome data. Resulting probabilities were used to evaluate ML penetrance of 1648 rare variants in 31 autosomal dominant disease-predisposition genes. ML penetrance was variable across variant classes, but highest for pathogenic and loss-of-function variants, and was associated with clinical outcomes and functional data. Compared with conventional case-versus-control approaches, ML penetrance provided refined quantitative estimates and aided the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and loss-of-function variants by delineating clinical trajectories over time. By leveraging ML and deep phenotyping, we present a scalable approach to accurately quantify disease risk of variants.",

Central to this defense is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where UBR4 acts as an essential E4 ubiquitin ligase, amplifying degradation marks on defective proteins. Cryo–electron microscopy analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3-megadalton ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Our structure shows how UBR4 binds substrate and extends lysine-48–specific ubiquitin chains. Efficient substrate targeting depends on both preubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as a key substrate filter. The architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes, but species-specific adaptations allow UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality control function in diverse cellular environments.",

We assessed carbon and nitrogen dynamics across the northern Yellowstone ecosystem, where one of the last remaining large migratory populations resides. Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality. Effects were strongest in wet, nutrient-rich habitats that received higher bison densities and grazing than is recommended in rangeland management, while soil and plant conditions suggested landscape resilience. Restoration should embrace heterogeneity in densities and effects across habitats and spatial scales beyond those guiding most current recovery efforts.",

In summer 2024, wastewater flows surged to millions of gallons per day despite no rain, enhancing water-to-air transfer of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) and other toxic gases at a turbulent hotspot. High wastewater flows and low winds led to nighttime H 2 S peaks, reaching 4500 parts per billion (ppb)—exceeding typical urban levels of &lt;1 ppb. H 2 S levels and community malodor reports were strongly correlated (correlation coefficient r = 0.92), validating long-dismissed community voices and highlighting an environmental injustice. This study demonstrates that poor water quality can substantially affect air quality—although rarely included in air quality models and health assessments—with far-reaching implications as polluted waterways increase globally.",

However, the suite of biological traits that reshaped horses during domestication remains unclear. We scanned an extensive horse genome time series for selection signatures at 266 markers associated with key traits. We detected a signature of positive selection at ZFPM1 —known to be a modulator of behavior in mice—occurring ~5000 years ago (ya), suggesting that taming was one of the earliest steps toward domestication of horses. Intensive selection at GSDMC began ~4750 ya with the domestication bottleneck, leading regulatory variants to high frequency by ~4150 ya. GSDMC genotypes are linked to body conformation in horses and to spinal anatomy, motor coordination, and muscular strength in mice. Our results suggest that selection on standing variation at GSDMC was crucial for the emergence of horses that could facilitate fast mobility in human societies ~4200 ya.",

We also used conditional genetics in mouse embryos and stem cells and found that the TFs SP5 and SP8 regulate cilia formation and gene expression. In embryos lacking Sp5 and Sp8 , primary and motile cilia were shorter than normal and reduced in number across cell types, contributing to situs inversus and hydrocephalus. Moreover, expression of SP8 was sufficient to induce primary cilia in unciliated cells. This work will facilitate the study of cilia assembly using stem cell models and promote further understanding of human ciliopathies.",

However, global mitigation from forestation remains uncertain owing to varying estimates of carbon sequestration rates (notably in soil) and land availability. In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares). Achieving greater mitigation requires expanding dedicated forestation areas and strengthening commitments from nations with considerable but untapped potential.",

Here, we showed that tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR, a hypoxia-induced tDR derived from the 3′ end of tRNA-Asp-GTC, activated autophagic flux in kidney cells and its silencing blocked autophagic flux. Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy. This tDR-induced RNA autophagy pathway was activated during murine and human kidney diseases, suggesting clinical relevance. Thus, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR plays a role in regulating RNA autophagy, which helps to maintain homeostasis in kidney cells and protects against kidney injury.",

          "abstract": "A primary axiom in geoscience is that the evolution of plants drove global changes in river dynamics. Notably, the apparent sinuosity of rivers, derived from the variance of sediment accretion direction measured in rocks, substantially increased when land plants evolved, around 425 million years ago. This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we found that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction. These results explain why meandering rivers have been underrecognized in prevegetation stratigraphy.",

          "abstract": "We investigate how to counter misinformation about voter and election fraud using data from the US and Brazil. Our study first compares two types of messages countering claims of widespread fraud: (i) retrospective corrections from credible sources speaking against interest and (ii) prebunking messages that prospectively warn of false claims about future elections and provide information about election security practices. In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects. In Brazil, prebunking had positive immediate effects across measured outcomes, whereas those of the credible source corrections were less consistent. We then conducted an experiment in the US randomizing exposure to a persuasion forewarning before election security information is provided. Prebunking again increased confidence and decreased fraud beliefs but only when the forewarning was omitted, suggesting that novel factual information is responsible for the observed effects of the prebunking treatment.",

          "abstract": "When speakers of different languages are in contact, they often borrow features like sounds, words, or syntactic patterns from one language to the other. However, the lack of historical data has hampered estimation of this effect at a global scale. We overcome this hurdle by using genetic admixture and shared geohistorical location as a proxy for population contact. We find that language pairs whose speaker populations underwent genetic admixture or that are located in the same geohistorical area exhibit notable similar increases in shared linguistic patterns across world regions and different demographic relationships, suggesting a consistent trend in borrowing rates. At the same time, the effect varies strongly across specific linguistic features. This variation is only partly explained by cognitive differences in lifelong learnability and by social functions of signaling assimilation through borrowing, leaving much randomness in which specific features are borrowed. Additionally, we find that, for some features, admixture decreases sharing, likely reflecting signals of divergence (schismogenesis) under contact.",

          "abstract": "In the vertebrate brain, neural stem cell (NSC) quiescence is necessary for stemness maintenance. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in the zebrafish adult telencephalon, we identified different molecular clusters of quiescent NSCs, interpreted to sign different quiescence depths. Here, we show that these clusters, when challenged in vivo with an inhibitor of Notch signaling, a major quiescence promoting pathway, unfold different behaviors. Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid up-regulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion. In contrast, an NSC cluster predicted to be in the deepest quiescence state resists Notch blockade, and we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nr2f1b mediates this resistance to activation in vivo. These results together link the molecular heterogeneity of quiescent NSCs with bona fide biological properties and their molecular regulators.",

While quantum interferometry can surpass the Heisenberg limit, it has been confined to the optical domain. Extending it to x-rays enables sub-angstrom spatial and zeptosecond temporal resolution, unlocking atomic-scale processes inaccessible to existing methods. Here, we demonstrate x-ray quantum interferometry using 17.5–kilo–electron volt ( λ = 70 picometers) photon pairs. Our approach introduces a phase measurement technique with exceptional noise resilience, mitigating the impact of mechanical instabilities, vibrations, and photonic noise—key challenges in x-ray interferometry. By generating and using entangled x-ray photons, we lay the foundation for next-generation techniques with unprecedented phase precision. This breakthrough carries far-reaching consequences for fundamental physics, high-resolution imaging, and spectroscopy, bringing to light quantum optical effects never before accessed in the x-ray regime.",

It is accepted that most STAT3 variants causing AD-HIES are dominant negative. Whether haploinsufficient mutations cause a phenotype in humans is still debated. We report on a family with a heterozygous STAT3 nonsense mutation that led to rapid decay of the mutant mRNA and protein, leading to haploinsufficiency. To explore STAT3 heterozygosity, we created a Stat3 haploinsufficient ( Stat3 +/− ) mouse model in which we found that Stat3 +/− mice had increased IgE serum levels, reduced T H 17 cell differentiation, and were susceptible to a cutaneous Staphylococcus aureus infection. Together, our findings provide mechanistic evidence for the impact of haploinsufficiency in STAT3 with residual protein expression as an important cause for immune deficiency. The implications extend to the diagnosis of immunodeficiency disorders and to the design of gene therapy in situations where gene dosage matters.",

Here, we mapped the chromatin contacts along nuclear radial axis and built radial score by factoring in contact frequencies. The chromatin high-order structures exhibit rich diversity along radial axis. Furthermore, the proximal trans contacts retrieved by radial score reveal conserved active/inactive chromatin segregation across intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Ablation of CTCF proteins disrupts chromatin loops with mild changes to chromatin radial positioning. By acutely perturbing multiple transcription factor (TF) occupancy, chromatin loop dissolutions are often accompanied by radial dissociations between two anchors. Our work provides a genome architecture reference map adhering to nuclear physical axis and suggests that multiple architectural TFs collectively shape nuclear positioning of chromatin and their contacts, with contacts serving as forces on chromatin positioning as well.",

          "abstract": "Neuronal death in stroke and other conditions stems in part from stimulation of N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA)–type glutamate receptors. This induces neuronal production of both nitric oxide and superoxide, which together induce oxidative cell injury. Nitric oxide can readily cross lipid membranes, but superoxide, being an anion, cannot. Using primary neuronal cultures, we show that superoxide enters neurons through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Oxidative injury produced by either exogenous superoxide or NMDA receptor stimulation is prevented by the VRAC inhibitor [4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichlor-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid] (DCPIB) and by disruption of the essential VRAC subunit, leucine-rich repeat–containing 8A (LRRC8A). In mouse cortex, neuronal oxidative injury induced by either NMDA or transient ischemia is likewise blocked by both DCPIB and LRRC8A disruption. Selective expression of LRRC8A/C and LRRC8A/D but not LRRC8A/D subunits conferred superoxide conductance in HeLa cells. Superoxide entry through VRACs is thus a requisite step in excitotoxic neuronal injury, and interventions affecting VRAC subunit composition, localization, or opening could influence neuronal survival.",

Our findings show that several disorders were associated with increased AD/PD risk before diagnosis, with variation in the strength and timing of associations across conditions.

Here, spatial programming of stiffness variation in the azobenzene-functionalized liquid-crystalline polymer (Azo-LCP) addresses this limitation and achieves efficient photomechanical jumping. Introduction of stiffness mismatch induced localized curvature, which preserved the initial curvature and simultaneously enhanced photomechanical strain responsivity. By programming for symmetry of stiffness variation, we achieved directional or vertical jumping via strategic placement of the rigid region, with corresponding stress accumulation behaviors corroborated by finite element simulations. Integration of patterned stiffness variation with geometric asymmetry enabled both vertical and horizontal jumping within a single structure, without compromising performance. This dual-mode jumper also demonstrated sequential and consecutive jumps under continuous light exposure.",

In addition, all four essential variants of bilinear π rotations—BIRD d , BIRD r , BIRD d , X , and BIRD r , X filters—were given for all cases studied. In the first step, adiabatic CHIRP-type and BUBI/BUBU pulses lead to improved robustness with respect to offset/detuning effects and variations in B 1 -field strengths.

Shortly after internalization, Francisella associates with DC mitochondria, which leads to the rapid repurposing of their oxidative metabolism for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mitochondrial metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the intramitochondrial signaling mediated by protein acetylation and involves switching to glutamate as the primary substrate for DC tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rather than killing the bacterium, glutamate-fueled mtROS production activates p38-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Blocking of glutamate utilization prevents DC activation and bacterial dissemination and alleviates inflammation in vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of metabolic plasticity in antibacterial DC response and open up potential avenues for therapies targeting host metabolism.",

In this study, we evaluated 57 synthetic carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) for antiviral activity in cellulo using pseudotyped virus particles (PVPs) from six high-risk viruses across three families: Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, and Coronaviridae. Four SCRs inhibited all tested PVPs, and their efficacy was confirmed against live viruses including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, EBOV, MARV, NiV, and HeV. Notably, SCR005 and SCR007 , which exhibited minimal toxicity, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in a severe animal model with a single dose.

          "abstract": "The dynamics of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations during and following the last deglaciation have mainly been ascribed to carbon release from and uptake in oceans, primarily in the Southern Ocean. But recent studies also point toward a terrestrial influence. We quantify dynamic changes to northern terrestrial carbon stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years) until present at millennial time steps using a combination of paleo-data and climate-biome modeling. During the deglaciation, northern land carbon storage declined by &gt;300 petagrams of carbon with a minimum around 11,000 years, followed by progressively higher land carbon stocks during the Holocene. We find evidence that dynamic changes in terrestrial land carbon stocks were of a scale to exert large influence on atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and that postglacial terrestrial carbon stock dynamics were dominated by losses from permafrost-affected loess and gains into peatlands.",

These intriguing molecules are rare instances of stable CO diborylation products that were made accessible by direct CO capture. While the monocarbonyl product shows remarkable thermal stability, the dicarbonyl product rearranges into a bicyclic tetraborylethylene structure under thermal stress. Combined analytical and theoretical efforts clearly highlight the unique electronic, spectroscopic, and structural characteristics of these carbonyl compounds. The cyclopentanone analog engages in stepwise one- and two-electron reduction processes to yield radical monoanion and dianion species while preserving the five-membered ring structure and the boron-boron bonds. Together, these boron heterocycles expand the limited class of stable boryl ketones containing direct boron-carbonyl carbon bonds, thus offering valuable opportunities for exploring the fundamental chemistry and synthetic applications of this functionality.",

Combining the structural advantage of polyethyleneimine and piperazine monomers, the separation layer had a large free volume, high-density homogeneity, well-tuned nanopores, and tailored charge distribution. The staged-regulated membrane exhibited high water permeance and could even adapt to ion separation in ultrahigh-salt solutions (Mg/Li = 50, 20,000 parts per million), with a notable Mg 2+ /Li + selectivity improvement of more than 1600% over that of the control, directly mixed dual aqueous monomer-prepared membrane.

The BoNT/A–NTNH complex protects the toxin from adverse environment, while the complex consisting of HA proteins facilitates toxin absorption during oral intoxication. How these two independent modules assemble into the L-PTC remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the BoNT/A–NTNH–HA70 complex at ~2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals that the BoNT/A–NTNH complex is anchored into a concentric double β-barrel channel of trimeric HA70 through a short β-hairpin of NTNH (termed nLoop), resembling a nut-and-bolt attachment. We find that the nLoop of NTNH is strictly conserved across HA-containing BoNT complexes and that NTNH–HA70 binding is interchangeable among them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nLoop functions as a minimal motif enabling attachment of a protein-of-interest to the HA complex, with potential applications in oral biologics delivery.",

However, excitonic absorption may dampen SHG. Here, we demonstrate tunable SHG enhancement using virtual coupling effects between quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) optical resonances and tunable excitons in high-index WS 2 metasurfaces with crescent meta-atoms. These metasurfaces promote a magnetic-type qBIC resonance, enabling control over nonlinear optical processes in the visible spectrum. The used qBIC resonance at half the exciton energy increases SHG efficiency by 98-fold compared to monolayer WS 2 and by four orders of magnitude relative to an unpatterned WS 2 film. The enhancement is tunable with temperature and incident light polarization, allowing the dynamic control of virtual coupling and SHG efficiency, thereby paving the way for next-generation reconfigurable metaoptics devices.",

While the role of these genes has been extensively studied in neurons, microglial functions such as phagocytosis are also dependent on cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that disturbance of actin cytoskeletal regulation in microglia, modeled by genetically impairing the scaffold protein Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which integrates actin-binding proteins, causes a shift in actin regulatory balance favoring filopodial versus lamellipodial actin organization. The resulting microglia-specific dysregulation of actin dynamics leads to excessive uptake of synaptic proteins. Genetically engineered DISC1-deficient mice show diminished hippocampal excitatory transmission and associated spatial memory deficits. Reintroducing wild-type microglia-like cells via bone marrow transplantation in adult DISC1-deficient mice restores the synaptic function of neurons and rescues cognitive performance. These findings reveal a pivotal role for microglial actin cytoskeletal remodeling in preserving synaptic integrity and cognitive health.

Genetic evidence implicates impaired mitophagy in Parkinson’s disease, making its pharmacological enhancement a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we characterize two mitophagy activators: a novel Parkin activator, FB231, and the reported PINK1 activator MTK458. Both compounds lower the threshold for mitochondrial toxins to induce PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. However, global proteomics revealed that FB231 and MTK458 independently induce mild mitochondrial stress, resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and activation of the integrated stress response, effects that result from PINK1/Parkin-independent off-target activities. We find that these compounds impair mitochondria by distinct mechanisms and synergistically decrease mitochondrial function and cell viability in combination with classical mitochondrial toxins. Our findings support a model whereby weak or “silent” mitochondrial toxins potentiate other mitochondrial stressors, enhancing PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy.

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway repairs stalled replication forks (RFs) and prevents such instability. Through an E3 ubiquitin ligase screen aimed at identifying regulators of RAD51, we identified macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA), a core component of C-terminal to Lish (CTLH) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as a regulator of the HR pathway. Loss of MAEA impairs RAD51 recruitment at stalled RFs, leading to increased sensitivity to RS-inducing agents and excessive degradation of nascent DNA strands. Mechanistically, MAEA associates with and mediates the ubiquitylation of Ku80, enabling its removal from RF ends and facilitating the loading of RAD51. Notably, MAEA deficiency is associated with a developmental disorder involving microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, ocular defects, and heart malformations. Functional assays show that disease-linked MAEA variants (R34C, E349G, Y394D, and M396R) are defective in RS response.

          "abstract": "The Drosophila brain contains distinct circadian oscillators responsible for generating the morning and evening bouts of locomotor activity in light-dark cycles. We lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes reshape the resulting bimodal rest-activity pattern. Here, we uncover a seasonal switch mechanism that remodels the evening bout of activity. Under temperate summer-like conditions, levels of the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDF receptor (PDFR) signaling disinhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY to advance the evening output, and in parallel, weakens the siesta-promoting vc DN1p-SIF amide axis to expand the evening peak. Under these conditions, vc DN1p takes over the evening pacemaker role by exerting control over the dorsal lateral oscillator neurons. Our findings elucidate how environment-induced changes in PDFR signaling tip the balanced output of the clock network, aligning daily rhythms with seasonal time. Neuropeptide-driven parallel adjustment of clock circuitry and clock protein functioning likely represents a conserved strategy, enabling animals to adapt their daily behavior to seasonal changes.",

Here, we introduce PhoCoil, a dynamically tunable recombinant hydrogel formed from a single protein component with unique multistimuli responsiveness. Physical cross-linking through coiled-coil interactions promotes rapid shear-thinning and self-healing behavior, rendering the gel injectable, whereas an included photodegradable motif affords on-demand network dissolution via visible light.

When total caloric, lipid, and carbohydrate intake declined during episodes of fruit scarcity, orangutans drew on fat and endogenous amino acids for energy. This strategy is beneficial only in the context of alternating periods of fruit scarcity and abundance.

In 106 patients with 29 benign nodules, 45 papillary thyroid carcinomas, and 32 follicular neoplasms, three PAI-derived parameters—the photoacoustic spectral gradient, oxygen saturation, and skewness of the oxygen saturation distribution—were combined using a support vector machine. Following USI-based American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, they were used to develop the ATA-Photoacoustic (ATAP) scoring system. The ATAP score achieved 97% sensitivity and 38% specificity in distinguishing nodules requiring FNAB. Our approach enabled better identification of benign nodules, reducing unnecessary FNAB in 11 of the 29 benign cases.

These representations minimize neural distances across different vocalizations from the same individual while preserving distinct trajectories for different callers. This structure emerged from the coordinated activity of the broader neuronal ensemble, although a small subset of highly identity-selective neurons carried high identity information.

The lower phase is enriched in free fatty acids and lead carboxylates, especially saturated species—both as free acids and metal soaps—prone to self-organization. As a result, the lower phase displays a pronounced lamellar organization with partial crystallization and exhibits viscoelastic and shear-thinning properties.

          "abstract": "Laplace-related techniques in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), including both standalone Laplace NMR and combined Laplace-Fourier NMR, provide detailed insights into molecular dynamics and spin interactions through the measurement of relaxation and diffusion parameters, offering complementary chemical resolution to Fourier NMR. Spectrum reconstruction with accurate diffusion coefficients or relaxation time is essential for the Laplace-related NMR experiments, but existing processing methods generally yield varying results because of the ill-posed nature of inverse Laplace transform, making it challenging to assess the accuracy and reliability of estimations without ideal references. To address this, we developed a deep learning–based method that not only recovers parameter distributions from exponential signals with improved accuracy but also provides an uncertainty estimation for each reconstruction result. This additional insight allows the user to assess the confidence across spectral regions, providing a clearer and more reliable framework for Laplace-related data interpretation, thus facilitating broader applications in fields such as chemistry and materials science.",

          "abstract": "Sea spray aerosol (SSA) emission is a major source of atmospheric aerosols, influencing global climate and coastal air quality. Much of our knowledge about SSA derives from coastal observations near shorelines, but whether and when these observations accurately represent open oceans remain unclear. Here, we show that strong nearshore SSA production during high-wave periods greatly enhances downwind cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and aerosol mass concentrations. Strong shoreline wave breaking is widespread globally, and swell waves, which are decoupled from local winds, play a dominant role in many coastal regions. Therefore, extrapolating results based on coastal measurements to open oceans may significantly overestimate SSA concentration and its contribution to CCN and, by extension, the impact of SSA on clouds and climate. Additionally, the strong enhancement of coastal aerosol population by shoreline wave breaking and its environmental impact on coastal communities cannot be captured by current regional models, which do not parameterize nearshore SSA generation using wave energy or completely neglect it.",

Here, we report poorer disease outcomes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) expressing high IgM versus those expressing IgG1. Using isogenic lymphoma cells expressing distinct BCRs, we found that IgM expressing cells strongly outcompete their IgG1 counterparts. Mechanistically, IgG1 BCR is associated with a dysfunctional mitochondrial state and reduced cell survival. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered by accentuated calcium responses downstream of IgG1 BCR. Genetic reversal of IgG1 to IgM, pharmacological dampening of calcium signaling, or treatment with interleukin-21 can correct mitochondrial defects and rescue IgG1 survival.

Given that one in five people lack α-actinin-3, it is possible that they may respond to androgens differently. Here, we show that α-actinin-3 deficiency decreases AR in muscles of mice and humans (in males and females) and that AR positively correlates with α-actinin-3 expression in a dosage-dependent manner. α-Actinin-3 deficiency exacerbates gastrocnemius mass loss with androgen deprivation in male mice and stunts the muscle growth response to dihydrotestosterone in female mice at the onset of puberty. This is mediated by differential activation of pathways regulating amino acid metabolism, intracellular transport, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, MAPK, and calcineurin signaling, likely driven by seven key genes that are both androgen sensitive and α-actinin-3–dependent in expression. Our results highlight a role for ACTN3 as a regulator of muscle mass and a genetic modifier of androgen action in skeletal muscle.",

Specifically, Mn 2+ @Man-phage anchored on bacterial surfaces and provided artificial recognition sites that enabled macrophages to phagocytize via mannose receptors, accompanied by enhanced bactericidal activity triggered by manganese ions in response to an infectious microenvironment. Moreover, immune labeling–activated macrophages enhanced antigen presentation at infection sites, further boosting specific T cell–mediated adaptive immune responses and infection eradication effects.

Some mutations impart a selective growth advantage to HSPCs, which expand and contribute to mature blood cells. This expansion is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) protein is a transcriptional regulator of proliferation/differentiation of hematopoietic cells. HSPCs express low levels of Id1 that is induced by growth factors and other mediators of inflammatory during stress to promote HSPC expansion. Since chronic inflammation is associated with the progression of hematopoietic malignancies, reducing Id1 expression may reduce CH. Genetic ablation of Id1 in Tet2 −/− HSPCs reduces HSPC expansion/CH, extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloid skewing, and genetic instability and delays the onset of disease. Mechanistically, p16 expression, senescence, and apoptosis were increased, and proliferation decreased in Tet2 −/− ;Id1 −/− HSPCs.

Prevailing motor control models emphasize Bayesian inference, where prior information is integrated to optimally estimate the current state. An alternative framework, efficient coding, proposes that the system dynamically reallocates encoding resources on the basis of environmental statistics—a mechanism highlighted in perception while underappreciated in motor control. We compared these frameworks in reaching movements, focusing on how the system leverages short-term priors in unpredictable environments. Unexpectedly, sequential effects aligned with the efficient coding model and contradicted Bayesian models. Specifically, current movements were biased in the opposite direction of previous movements, and movement variability decreased when successive reaches were similar. We further explored the temporal dynamics of these effects and showed that sequential bias is enhanced by intrinsic motor variability.

We find rapid replacement of dominant species, with local species richness inversely related to dominance. Marked turnover in fish community structure and composition is also present, with different functional groups favored under changing environmental conditions.

Phytoplankton frequently experience a limiting supply of multiple nutrients simultaneously (colimitation). Ocean warming is predicted to exacerbate marine nutrient limitation. Yet, how phytoplankton adapt their physiology and regulate responses to colimitation is poorly understood. Here, we show that when the crucial macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) colimit growth of globally abundant phytoplankton, the diatoms, cellular resources are diverted to prioritize N uptake over P sensing and acquisition. Regulatory mechanisms for responding to fluctuating P supply, including Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PSR1) and P-resupply sensing via Ca 2+ signaling, are strictly nitrate dependent. Further, P-Ca 2+ signaling is impaired in psr1 mutants, suggesting that PSR1 is necessary for this response and coordinates adaptations to colimitation. Our study demonstrates a hierarchy of resource allocation during colimitation that points to N starvation mechanisms overriding those of P and could lead to N-P colimitation being masked in many marine ecosystems.",

In this study, we characterize every SUMO component in the Arabidopsis root to create a complete SUMO Cell Atlas in eukaryotes. This unique resource reveals wide spatial variation, where SUMO proteins and proteases have subfunctionalized in both their expression and subcellular localization. During stress, SUMO conjugation is mainly driven by tissue-specific regulation of the SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme. Stress-specific modulation of the SUMO pathway reveals unique combinations of proteases being targeted for regulation in distinct root tissues by salt, osmotic, and biotic signals. Our SUMO Cell Atlas resources reveal how this posttranslational modification (PTM) influences cellular- and tissue-scale adaptations during root development and stress responses. To our knowledge, we provide the first comprehensive study elucidating how multiple stress inputs can regulate an entire PTM system.",

Their monitoring is challenging and often confined to the radar networks of single countries. By exploiting kilometer-scale climate simulations, we have derived a previously unknown characterization of supercell occurrence in Europe for the current and a warmer climate. The current climate shows several hundred supercells per convective season. Occurrence peaks are colocated with complex topography, e.g., the Alps. The absolute frequency maximum lies along the southern Alps and minima over the oceans and flat areas. Comparing a current-climate simulation with a pseudo–global warming +3°C global warming scenario, the future climate simulation shows an average increase of supercell occurrence by 11%. However, there is a spatial dipole of change with strong increases in supercell frequencies in central and eastern Europe and a decrease in frequency over the Iberian Peninsula and southwestern France.",

However, reducing the thickness of the structure is almost the only strategy to enhance the elastic bendability of inorganic flexible electronics. This study proposes an overbend strategy, whose operation is beyond the designed elasticity of the fabricated structure. Mechanical theories, finite element analysis, and experiments verified that, with multilayer stacks and interconnects with various geometric designs as examples, the overbend strategy can enhance the designed elastic bendability to twice for the material of the ideal elastoplastic/kinematic hardening constitutive relationship and to more than twice for the mixed hardening/isotropic hardening constitutive relationship. The mechanism is extending the elastic strain range at the critical section to twice or more times the original value by the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relationship. Notably, the overbend strategy is virtually costless, combinative with other strategies and widely applicable for inorganic flexible electronics.",

The Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI), present from tabletop to astronomical scales, is an iconic example characterized by mushroom-shaped incursions appearing when immiscible fluids are forced together. Despite its ubiquity, RTI experiments are challenging; here, we report the observation of the RTI in an immiscible binary superfluid consisting of a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate. We force these components together to initiate the instability, and observe the growth of mushroom-like structures. The interface can also be stabilized, allowing us to spectroscopically measure the “ripplon” interface modes. Last, we use matter-wave interferometry to transform the superfluid velocity field at the interface into a vortex chain. These results—in agreement with our theory—demonstrate the close connection between the RTI in classical and quantum fluids.",

The ratio of cell mass to volume defines the cell mass density (CMD), which is also a measure of macromolecular crowding and concentrations of all proteins. Using the fluorescence eXclusion method (FXm) and quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), we investigate CMD dynamics following sudden changes in media osmolarity. We find that while cell volume and mass exhibit complex behavior after osmotic shock, CMD follows a straightforward monotonic recovery over 48 hours. This recovery is cell cycle independent and depends on coordinated adjustment of protein synthesis and volume growth rates. Unexpectedly, the protein synthesis rate decreases when CMD increases. We observe that nucleoplasm-cytoplasm transport is CMD dependent, which contributes to negative regulatory feedback on CMD. The Na + /H + exchanger helps regulate CMD by affecting both protein synthesis and volume change. Together, we reveal that cells have a robust control system that actively regulates CMD during environmental change.",

Our findings reveal dynamic regulation of SLC35A4-MP expression during primary brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro and during cold exposure or high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obesity in mice. Using a knockout mouse model, we show that loss of SLC35A4-MP disrupts mitochondrial lipid composition, decreasing cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamine in brown adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice. SLC35A4-MP deficiency also impairs mitochondrial activity, alters mitochondrial number and morphology, and promotes inflammation. Knockout mice accumulate acylcarnitines during cold exposure, indicating defective fatty acid oxidation. These findings reveal SLC35A4-MP as a previously unrecognized microprotein in regulating mitochondrial function and tissue lipid metabolism, adding to the growing list of functional endogenous microproteins.",

Herein, we investigate the permeation of alkali chlorides (LiCl, KCl, and CsCl) through steric hindrance–free nanoporous membranes with tunable surface charge densities. Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm that electrostatic effects promote the dehydration of Cl − , the counterions to the membrane charge, at the positively charged membrane surface. This dehydration leads to a great tendency of Cl − to absorb to the membrane surface and be retained, compromises Cl − partitioning, and impedes salt cotransport. For negatively charged membranes, Cs + with its lower hydration energy undergoes greater electrostatic-driven dehydration and partition hindrance than K + , resulting in selective KCl transport. Our findings provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of ionic dehydration and transport impediments driven by electrostatic interactions at charged membrane surfaces, presenting an in-depth perspective for designing ion-selective membranes to separate similar ions based on charge effects.",

Particularly, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a driving factor in foam cell formation, altering macrophage function and metabolism. The aim of our research was to understand the impact of oxLDL-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species on macrophage-to-foam cell differentiation. We demonstrate that macrophage oxLDL-derived superoxide modulates mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming, facilitating foam cell formation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial superoxide drives signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation, leading to reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle activity. In parallel, mitochondrial superoxide enhances chromatin accessibility at STAT5 target genes, establishing a distinct STAT5 signaling signature in foam cells ex vivo and in human and mouse plaques in vivo. Inhibition of STAT5 during atherosclerosis progression prevents the differentiation of macrophages to mature Trem2 hi Gpnmb hi foam cells. Collectively, our data describe an oxLDL-induced, mitochondrial superoxide–dependent STAT5 activation that leads to a self-amplifying feedback loop of reciprocal mitochondrial superoxide production and STAT5 activation, ultimately driving macrophage-to-foam cell transition.",

The functional significance of DKC1 up-regulation and the mechanistic connection between pseudouridylation and IRES-mediated translation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that DKC1 drives an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program that supports amino acid metabolism and stress adaptation. We identify hnRNP A1, an IRES trans-acting factor, as a critical downstream mediator of DKC1 in sustaining ATF4 expression and IRES-dependent translation. Mechanistically, DKC1-mediated pseudouridylation at two specific 28 S ribosomal RNA sites is crucial for maintaining hnRNP A1 protein expression. In turn, hnRNP A1 binds and stabilizes ATF4 messenger RNA, preferentially promoting IRES-dependent translation of ATF4 variant 1. Furthermore, cellular stress induces hnRNP A1, which is necessary for stress-induced ATF4 protein expression. Collectively, our findings uncover an MYC-driven DKC1-hnRNP A1 axis that links IRES-dependent translation and ATF4-mediated metabolic adaptation, thereby supporting cancer cell survival under metabolic stress during tumor progression.",

A snapshot of these prefibrillar assemblies has been characterized using a combination of cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET), cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM) single-particle analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A highly consistent diameter for all curvilinear protofibrils and oligomers of 2.8 nanometers suggests that these assemblies are structural extensions from the smaller oligomers. In situ AFM confirms that spherical oligomers template and extend over time into curvilinear protofibrils. Furthermore, their basic cross section suggests that amyloid fibrils might be initiated by the lateral binding of two curvilinear protofibrils. Cryo-ET/EM single particles also reveal ring-shaped annular assemblies. These have a central internal channel, ~1.4 nanometers in diameter, which is capable of traversing lipid membranes. Large conductance recorded using patch-clamp electrophysiology matches the internal diameter of the Aβ annular architecture.",

Compensated ferrimagnet spintronic devices with both a large anomalous Hall effect and a high coercivity would be simultaneously easy to read and difficult to erase. The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn 6 Sn 6 has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system toward magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed. Additionally, Cr doping markedly enhances the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, which can be attributed to a shift in the Fermi level. Our results extend the range of unique magnetic states observed in kagome materials, demonstrating that chemical doping is an effective strategy to tune and realize these states.",

The resulting cold-welded LMP micropatterns exhibit exceptional electromechanical properties, high conductivity (2.4 × 10 6 siemens per meter), stretchability (more than 1200%), and strain- and pressure-insensitive resistance, owing to their multiscale and dynamic morphologies. Demonstrations in highly stretchable strain sensors and cardiac mapping devices highlight the capabilities of this method for creating high-performance, highly stretchable electronic systems. Notably, balloon catheter–integrated LMP microelectrode arrays show low impedance under extreme deformations and enable high-resolution endocardial electrogram mapping inside the human heart.
