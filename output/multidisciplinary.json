          "abstract": "Distinct ligands for the same G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activate intracellular signaling partners to varying extents, but the molecular mechanisms driving these differences remain elusive. Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gαiβγ heterotrimer by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor1. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptor’s transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule fluorescence assays, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a ‘kinetic trap’ during G-protein activation.",

          "abstract": "The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-bound factor with essential yet incompletely understood roles in protein biogenesis1. Here, we show that NAC is a multifaceted regulator that coordinates translation elongation, cotranslational folding, and organelle targeting through distinct interactions with nascent polypeptides both inside and outside the ribosome exit tunnel. Using NAC-selective ribosome profiling in C. elegans, we identify thousands of sequence-specific NAC binding events across the nascent proteome, revealing broad cotranslational engagement with hydrophobic and helical motifs in cytosolic, nuclear, ER, and mitochondrial proteins. Unexpectedly, we discover an intra-tunnel sensing mode, where NAC engages ribosomes with extremely short nascent polypeptides inside the exit tunnel in a sequence-specific manner. Moreover, initial NAC interactions induce an early elongation slowdown that tunes ribosome flux and prevent ribosome collisions, linking NAC’s chaperone activity to kinetic control of translation. We propose NAC action protects aggregation-prone intermediates by shielding amphipathic helices, thus promoting cytonuclear folding. NAC also supports mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis and ER targeting by early recognition of signal sequences and transmembrane domain. Our findings establish NAC as an early-acting, multifaceted orchestrator of cotranslational proteostasis, with distinct mechanisms of action on nascent chains depending on their sequence features and subcellular destinations.",

Here we compare the ability of humans (N = 9,198) and large language models (LLMs, N = 215,542 observations) to generate novel ideas in an established creativity task. We present three key results. First, human creativity on average is slightly higher than that of LLMs. Second, creativity differences are pronounced at the extremes of the distribution, with humans exhibiting greater variability and higher levels of creativity in the right-hand tail of the distribution. Third, attempts to increase the creativity of LLMs through instructing LLMs to take on genius personas or different demographic roles lifted performance up to a threshold beyond which the output became opposite real-life patterns, whereas strategic prompt-engineering efforts yielded mixed to negative results. We discuss the implications of our findings for human–machine collaboration and problem solving.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in applying cognitive load theory to instructional design, its principles have not yet been fully integrated into the design of physical learning environments. Recent work has synthesized embodied cognition with cognitive load theory, and suggests that learning emerges as a sum of mental operations and the physical context in which they occur1. However, the way in which classrooms are designed around the world — including in Brazil, where I work — remains largely disconnected from these cognitive principles. In many of the classrooms I visit, walls are often overloaded with colourful posters, unrelated visual materials and competing information, a practice that is culturally perceived as enriching but is potentially counterproductive from a cognitive perspective.\n\nIn schools, the persistent use of classrooms with colourful decorations and walls filled with posters, charts and unrelated visual material may inadvertently impair children’s cognitive performance. Research has shown that excessive visual stimulation increases extraneous cognitive load, and consumes working memory resources that should be allocated to learning tasks2,3.",

          "abstract": "For over a century, research has shown that human perceptual decisions are systematically influenced by prior perceptual experiences, a phenomenon known as serial dependence. It has recently been suggested that serial dependence can improve perceptual decision-making by mitigating uncertainty and reducing variability in perceptual estimates—leading to a superiority effect. However, this claim remains largely untested. Here we present a large-scale analysis, compiling the most extensive dataset of serial dependence studies from the past decade. Contrary to the proposed superiority effect, our findings indicate that serial dependence deteriorates rather than improves perceptual decision-making. These results challenge prevailing models and emphasize the need to rethink serial dependence and its role in human perception, cognition and behaviour.",

We use publicly available information to develop a dataset comprising 3,534 academy member profiles spanning 1905 to 2023. Using this dataset, we examine the evolving composition of China’s academic elite. Here we show that despite increasing globalization, the proportion of foreign-educated academy members has declined, while scholars from underrepresented regions—Western China and developing countries (or the Global South)—have benefited from preferential inclusive policies. Some elite-level returnee academics experience research underperformance upon returning. These trends reflect a broader shift towards academic indigenization and have wider implications for meritocracy, mobility and the sustainability of China’s talent strategies. This study examines complex reasons behind the above developments.",

Participants from the Middle East and North Africa reported the lowest subjective well-being (mean 4.78, s.d. of 2.70), followed by Eastern Europe and Central Asia (mean 5.22, s.d. of 2.13). The Structural Homophobic Climate Index (β = −1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) −2.38 to −0.99) and family-level homophobia (β = −0.84, 95% CI −0.87 to −0.81) were negatively related to LGBTQ+ well-being. Economic precarity significantly interacted with the negative association between homophobia and participants’ well-being. The weight of a country’s homophobic climate on well-being was nearly halved for economically secure participants compared with those economically deprived. Participants unaware of their human immunodeficiency virus status reported the lowest well-being (β = −0.20, 95% CI −0.23 to −0.16) controlling for homophobia. Public health measures should address homophobic stigma and discrimination, focusing on the lowest socioeconomic strata.",

          "abstract": "Do humans learn like transformers? We trained both humans ( n = 530) and transformer networks on a rule learning task where they had to respond to a query in a sequence. At test, we measured ‘in-context’ learning (generalize the rule to novel queries) and ‘in-weights’ learning (recall past experiences from memory). Manipulating the diversity and redundancy of examples in the training distribution, we found that humans and transformer networks respond in very similar ways. In both types of learner, redundancy and diversity trade off in driving in-weights and in-context learning, respectively, whereas a composite distribution with a balanced mix of redundancy and diversity allows the two strategies to be used in tandem. However, we also found that while humans benefit from dynamic training schedules that emphasize diverse examples early, transformers do not. So, while the same data-distributional properties promote learning in humans and transformer networks, only people benefit from curricula.",

          "abstract": "Organisms in nature and humans in socioeconomic systems alike face tradeoffs between selfish consumption of resources and investment in the welfare of their offspring. Previous work across the disciplines of biology and economics has sought to elucidate this process, develop a theoretical framework to solve for the optimal life history strategy, and deduce implications of these microscopic interactions for the distribution of resources at the macroscopic level. Such theory, however, has failed to account for heterogeneous conditions that various individuals and groupings of kin enjoy, like growth rate advantages for those with greater resource abundance. Furthermore, such emergent trends at the macroeconomic scale lack reconciliation with observations of power law distributions of wealth and income in vivo. We modify and extend an analytical framework here to allow for heterogeneity, and consider the long-term consequences for resource distributions with Pareto initial values. We find that power law phenomena are robust to such processes and, due to sensitivity to the form of the utility curve, higher-order uncertainty may not affect the optimal tradeoff. This stresses the impact of mechanistic choices when translating sociological findings to ecological and economic theory, and suggests future work must consider how social norms and other microscopic complexity can explain emergent patterns or disrupt trends of inequality at the macrolevel.",

Here, we compare the progress of 117 SDG indicators for 167 countries and project the achievements by 2030. Our results reveal the progress of the SDGs across the world varies depending on the initial SDG scores of the indicators in 2015. For indicators with low scores (0 to 50%), the proportion of countries showing advancement is greater than that demonstrating regression (25 vs. 16%). Countries that foster scientific research and promote manufacturing industry (SDG9) have the best performances. For indicators with high scores (70 to 90%), the proportion showing regression is greater than that with advancement (16 vs.10%). The increased coverage of immunization vaccines and prevention of infectious diseases (SDG3) have the worst performances. For indicators with moderate scores (50 to 70%), the proportion showing regression is slightly greater than that showing advancement (11 vs. 9%). When the score was low and high, the impact of the pandemic was significantly greater than that for moderate scores. By 2030, the global SDG score will reach approximately 63%, with a SD of 8%. Overall, 78 countries will reach the moderate score (60 to 70%), and 12 countries will remain with a low score (40 to 50%). Countries need to achieve an annual growth rate of 4% to meet the overall SDGs by 2030.

While reversible phosphorylation of the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) is critical for BR signaling, much remains to be learned about the dephosphorylation mechanisms of BRI1. Here, we demonstrate that the D-clade type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2C-Ds) negatively regulate BR signaling by dephosphorylating key residues in the kinase activation loop of BRI1. The phosphatase activity of PP2C-D2 and D5 is activated through homo- or heterodimerization, a process antagonized by BR-induced BRI1 phosphorylation or SMALL AUXIN UP RNA15 (SAUR15) binding. BL treatment, BRI1-mediated phosphorylation, or SAUR15 binding disrupts dimerization, returning PPC2C-Ds to a monomeric, inactive state. These data not only reveal another phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade regulating BR signaling but also decode unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of PP2C-Ds in plants.",

Mitigating productivity loss from interactions between these global change drivers requires a mechanistic understanding of the forces generating productivity benefits from species richness (i.e., overyielding). Progress has been limited by two challenges: i) individual mechanisms can be highly context-dependent, yet multiple mechanisms can produce similar responses to functional diversity loss or altered climate, and ii) most experiments test short-term weather events rather than sustained changes in precipitation. We address these limitations using direct tests of multiple mechanisms within a sustained, full factorial manipulation of plant richness, composition, and precipitation within experimental grasslands. Precipitation consistently increased overyielding, as yield declined in monocultures and increased in polycultures, consistent with greater specialist pathogen accumulation in mesic conditions. Resource partitioning and specialist pathogen dilution—estimated from physiochemical trait dissimilarity and soil pathogen dissimilarity—were positive predictors of overyielding, relationships that strengthened over time. Moreover, overyielding was best explained by the joint influence of resource acquisition traits and pathogen dissimilarities, indicating that multiple mechanisms generated productivity responses to richness. These two mechanisms can explain the robust findings across systems that productivity increases with plant biodiversity. Our findings predict that biodiversity loss will be most damaging in wetter climates, where pathogen dilution amplifies the benefits of diversity.",

          "abstract": "Wild foods are critical to the food security of billions of people worldwide, yet the ecological mechanisms that promote wild food system stability remain poorly understood. Within complex food webs, ecological theory predicts that nonhuman consumers can maintain more stable consumption rates by foraging on multiple resources that vary asynchronously in their availability across space and time. These so-called portfolio effects may also sustain more stable harvest rates by humans in wild food systems. We analyzed wild food harvest patterns for 46 isolated rural communities in southern coastal Alaska that harvest a diversity of wild foods (96 taxa) across terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal, and marine habitats. We show that access to diverse wild foods across this heterogeneous landscape dampened variability in harvest through time and increased robustness to species declines by allowing communities to harness seasonal and interannual asynchronies in wild food availability. These results demonstrate how ecological mechanisms that stabilize ecosystems may also underpin the stability of human wild food systems. Managing landscapes to maintain access to diverse wild foods and adopting flexible governance that allows communities to adjust harvest as patterns of wild food availability shift through time are crucial to sustaining resilient wild food systems in a changing world.",

          "abstract": "Despite great success in certain cancers, immunotherapy made little progress in treating immune cold tumors, largely attributed to an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment with elusive mechanisms. Here, we report in prostate cancer cells a positive feedback loop driven by phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) that could be targeted to render effective cytotherapy by natural killer (NK) cells. In the loop, PSAT1 increases Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) phosphorylation by microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate PSAT1 transcription. Meanwhile, YBX1 also promotes human leukocyte antigens E (HLA-E) transcription to inactivate NK cells. Consequently, the PSAT1 loop serves as a buff sustaining YBX1/HLA-E expression, suppressing NK killing of prostate cancer cells. Targeting loop molecules, such as PAST1, effectively potentiates tumor suppression by NK cells both in-vitro and in-vivo. Thus, our study uncovered a heretofore unrecognized nonautonomous mechanism for PSAT1, as well as a molecular buff for YBX1, to drive tumor growth by evading NK immunity, providing a promising target for NK cytotherapy of immune cold tumors.",

In canola ( Brassica napus ), a major global oil seed crop, spontaneous or harsh weather-induced fruit shattering at maturity could lead to yield losses from 3 to 50%. Here, we show an extraembryonic role for the ABA-responsive transcription factor, ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE-3 (ABI3) in controlling seed dispersal through mediating lignification of the endocarp b (en b ) layer and the lignified layer (LL) of the valves. The resistance created by these lignified layers is critical for valve opening at maturity as the tensile forces generated during silique drying converge on these fortified cell layers to trigger shatter. We further show that ABI3 functions independent of the patterning genes and functions through transcriptional regulation of NAC-domain transcription factors, NST1 and NST3 , to mediate lignin biosynthesis. Our results show that both excessive and complete absence of lignification could prevent the tensile drying forces from breaking open the pod, leading to fruit indehiscence. As a proof-of-concept, we show that BnABI3 overexpression in canola results in highly lignified, robust siliques that are shatter tolerant. Besides uncovering an extraembryonic role for ABI3, this study has identified spatial distribution and abundance of lignin in the silique valve tissue as the key determinants for silique dehiscence.",

Despite their ubiquitous presence in human populations, little is known about the anellovirus mechanism of replication in host cells. We identified the protein coded by ORF2/3 as necessary and sufficient to initiate replication from the minimal origin of replication for viruses of both the Beta- and Alphatorquevirus genera. Supporting this observation, we identified components of the polymerase alpha and BTR (Bloom’s syndrome helicase (BLM), topoisomerase IIIα, RMI1, and RMI2) complexes as interacting with the viral replication initiation protein (Rip) during DNA replication, suggesting a recombination-dependent mechanism of replication that uses host cell machinery to mediate dissolution of replication intermediates. Furthermore, we mapped a 92-bp minimal origin of replication sequence for the Betatorquevirus genus composed of an adenine and thymine (AT)-rich stretch and a portion of the guanine and cytosine (GC)-rich region. Altogether, this study provides insight into the mechanism by which anelloviruses manipulate host cell machinery to facilitate viral genome replication and represents a significant step forward in understanding the complex processes underlying anellovirus replication and persistent infection of these important commensal viruses.",

          "abstract": "Multidrug efflux pumps are dynamic molecular machines that drive antibiotic resistance by harnessing ion gradients to export chemically diverse substrates. Despite their clinical importance, the molecular principles underlying multidrug promiscuity and energy efficiency remain poorly understood. Using multiparametric deep mutational scanning across eight substrates and two energy conditions, we deconvolute the contributions of substrate recognition, energetic coupling, and protein stability, providing an integrated, high-resolution view of multidrug transport. We find that substrate specificity arises from a distributed network of residues extending beyond the binding site, with mutations that reshape binding, coupling, conformational flexibility, and membrane interactions. Further, we apply a pH-based selection scheme to measure the effect of mutation on pH-dependent transport efficiency. By integrating these data, we reveal a fundamental relationship between efficiency and promiscuity: Highly efficient variants exhibit broad substrate profiles, while inefficient variants are narrower. These findings establish a direct link between energy coupling and polyspecificity, uncovering the biochemical logic underlying multidrug transport.",

With a peak absorption at 585 nm, Chrimson is the most red-shifted cation-conducting ChR. It is frequently employed in multicolor experiments alongside blue light–sensitive optogenetic tools and is so far the only light-gated ion channel successfully applied in human vision restoration. However, its photoresponses to different wavelengths have not been thoroughly characterized. In this study, we identify multiple interconvertible dark states of Chrimson with distinct absorption and photokinetic properties. Combining electrophysiology and spectroscopy with optogenetic experiments in neurons, we unveil that this dark state heterogeneity is based on distinct protonation dynamics of the counterion complex and alternative retinal isomerization. In neurons, prolonged red illumination reduces Chrimson’s red light sensitivity, which is reflected by a blue shift of the action spectrum. Blue light pulses reverse this shift and increase the excitability in subsequent red-light flashes. This understanding of wavelength-dependent photoreactions in Chrimson will improve the design of multicolor optogenetic experiments and inform strategies for optimizing Chrimson for therapeutic applications.",

Here, we establish a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiota and biological scaffold-mediated tissue repair. Utilizing a conventionalized germ-free mouse, we demonstrate that scaffold implantation induces compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiome, particularly affecting amino acid biosynthesis. Additionally, in a model of antibiotic-induced microbiota depletion, we show that dysbiosis disrupts key immune regulators of type 2 immunity, including reductions in eosinophils, proregenerative macrophages, and interleukin-4 (IL-4)-producing CD4 + T cells. At 6 wk post–scaffold implantation, we observed a significant decrease in myocytes with centrally located nuclei alongside an upregulation in profibrotic gene expression with antibiotic treatment.

Fishermen are increasingly recognized as marine apex predators, and there are extensive satellite-based geolocation data on fishing vessel activities. Despite this potential, the utility of fishermen as ecosystem sentinels remains unexamined. Using one million vessel positions from 600 U.S. vessels, we assess the effectiveness of fishermen as sentinels for the ecological impacts of Northeast Pacific marine heatwaves on tuna distribution and availability. Fishermen were skillful predictors of extreme northward shifts for albacore and bluefin tunas, and extreme inshore shifts for albacore. Fishermen signaled low albacore availability over a year in advance of a formal fisheries disaster declaration request. Notably, fishermen also indicated true negatives during marine heatwaves: periods of anomalous warming but stable tuna distribution and availability. This information could aid management of transboundary shifts during marine heatwaves of albacore from U.S. to Canadian waters and bluefin from Mexican to U.S. waters. Advanced warning of fisheries disasters could expedite the delivery of relief funds for struggling communities. The number of Earth-orbiting satellites is exponentially rising, generating a wealth of geospatial information on fishing vessels. This rich and growing resource can signal otherwise unobserved ecological impacts, aiding rapid management responses to climate extremes.",

          "abstract": "The ability to synthesize essential molecules is sometimes lost in evolution. A classic example is ascorbate (vitamin C), which is synthesized in most animals by L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO), an enzyme lost multiple independent times in animal evolution. This event is thought to be evolutionarily neutral; however, GULO- deficient animals including humans need to obtain ascorbate from their diet and are prone to ascorbate deficiency and scurvy. We therefore hypothesized that this disadvantage of GULO loss is offset by physiological benefits. Here, we show that ascorbate deficiency benefits mice infected with schistosome parasites, which cause schistosomiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease that afflicts 250 million people. Schistosoma mansoni worms required host ascorbate to produce eggs in vivo. Consequently, ascorbate-deficient mice were protected from schistosomiasis pathologies and transmission. Intermittent ascorbate deficiency protected Gulo -deficient mice from both scurvy and schistosomiasis mortality. The effects of ascorbate on schistosome reproduction were mediated by ascorbate-dependent histone demethylation which promoted vitellocyte development in female schistosomes. We propose that vitamin deficiencies are not always detrimental but can protect animals from pathogens which need to obtain vitamins from their host.",

          "abstract": "The β-barrel assembly machine (BAM) is an essential protein complex that folds and inserts outer membrane β-barrel proteins (OMPs) into the bacterial outer membrane. The BAM complex contains the essential BamA OMP with five soluble polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains, which scaffold the essential BamD lipoprotein and the nonessential lipoproteins BamB/C/E. The importance of each BAM component has been investigated primarily using cell-based phenotypic assays, and structural data have revealed insights into the role of the BamA β-barrel in OMP folding. However, in vitro quantitative analysis for the function of each BAM component has been challenging. We describe the development of a fluorescent reporter of OMP folding, bOmpA-A488, which we use to obtain single-turnover kinetic parameters for wild-type BAM complex in vitro. We observe a k fold of 0.78 ± 0.15 min −1 and approximate substrate affinity of 3.1 ± 1.1 µM consistent with estimates of in vivo requirements. Furthermore, we find that while BamA alone is inactive in Escherichia coli lipid liposomes, BamAB and BamAD subcomplexes have activities similar to that of the holoBAM complex. This suggests that OMP folding and insertion is catalyzed by BamA while the accessory lipoproteins maintain BamA in a catalytically competent conformation. We also find that, contrary to prevailing models, POTRA domain deletions that include POTRA3, which is essential in cells, do not drastically impact activity. This indicates that the first three POTRA domains do not play a major role in binding or folding OMPs under single-turnover conditions, suggesting a different role in cells.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) is distributed across multiple cortical areas, suggesting that behaviors relying on WM arise from interactions between these regions. In a recent study, we found that during delayed comparison tasks, the first stimulus is not represented veridically in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but instead is encoded in a systematically warped manner–biased toward the mean of the stimulus distribution. This neural distortion, which emerges already during the stimulus presentation and persists throughout the delay period, closely mirrors a contraction bias observed in behavior. Furthermore, the behavioral responses could be explained by a Bayesian observer model, in which the observer integrates prior expectations with noisy sensory inputs. These results suggest that the geometry of PFC neural trajectories embodies Bayesian estimates that underlie biased decisions. Here, we investigate whether the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)–a lower-level sensory area also implicated in tactile WM–exhibits a similar encoding structure. Our analyses reveal that although WM-related signals in S2 are less robust than in PFC, the neural state space in S2 shares key geometric features with that of PFC, including a similarly warped representation of stimulus values. These findings suggest that perceptual biases may originate early in the cortical processing stream and are not exclusively shaped by higher-order associative areas. More broadly, our results support a distributed organization of representational warping, in which even sensory areas contribute to the formation of bias-prone representations that guide behavior.",

Past research has emphasized particle entrainment by raindrop splash at impact. Here, we report lab and field observations, that uncover a surprisingly rich and efficient postimpact phase. Raindrops impacting a dry, sloping, granular bed spontaneously form “sandballs;” drops of dense suspensions that can grow in mass to a jammed state by sediment entrainment, as they roll downhill like snowballs and magnify soil erosion. Careful control of drop conditions reveals two stable sandball morphologies: peanut-like shapes linked to hydrodynamic instabilities and toroidal forms that undergo mechanical locking from extreme sediment loading, which have potential implications for related problems in bioengineering, pharmaceuticals, and snow physics.",

Although continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps are moving toward a closed-loop system, it remains difficult to predict how device design influences system performance. Traditional optimization methods are inefficient and empirical: Data-driven algorithms lack interpretability, trial-and-error design is time-consuming, and first-principle models are difficult to integrate at the system level. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-based framework which integrates microneedle (MN) designs for sensing and therapy with a physiological model of glycemic control. The framework builds compact relationships showing how material, chemical, and geometrical features affect key metrics such as response time, extraction flux, and insulin delivery rate. Specifically, we develop a theory for three sensing MN types (hollow, porous/swellable, and nanostructured MNs) and one therapeutic patch (electro-termo-mechanical device) to create a predictive model for glycemic regulation. By linking device design to system behavior across time and spatial scales, we examine the framework in three cases: How disease progression, MN design, and MN sensitivity affect plasma glucose levels and time-in-range metrics. This work establishes the foundation for a physics-based digital twin for diabetes management, complementing ML, experiments, and numerical models. More broadly, it streamlines patch design, minimizing glycemic events and trial-and-error in next-generation CGM technology.",

Despite their biological and chemical significance, the bacterial enzymes responsible for urolithin production remain largely unidentified. Here, we use differential gene expression analysis, anaerobic protein production, and enzyme assays to identify members of two distinct molybdenum enzyme families (the DMSO reductase family and the xanthine oxidase family) capable of regioselective dehydroxylation and urolithin generation. These two enzyme families have distinct substrate requirements, suggesting they employ different catalytic mechanisms for phenol dehydroxylation. Multiomics analysis of a human cohort uncovers decreased levels of urolithin A and genes encoding urolithin A-producing enzymes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), implying reduced health effects of EA consumption in this setting. Together, this study elucidates the molecular basis of urolithin production, expands the known enzymatic repertoire of the human gut microbiome, and suggests a potential link between gut bacterial urolithin production and reduced host inflammation.",

          "abstract": "The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is characterized by poorly understood complex multiannual cycles. The origins of these cycles have long been debated, and multiple explanations of varying complexity have been suggested. Using Bayesian methods, we fit a dynamical model to half a century of M. pneumoniae surveillance data from Denmark (1958 to 1995, 2010 to 2025) and uncover a parsimonious explanation for the persistent cycles, based on the theory of quasicycles. The period of the multiannual cycle (approx. 5 y in Denmark) is explained by susceptible replenishment due, primarily, to loss of immunity. While an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, unable to reproduce the persistent cycles. We find that environmental stochasticity (e.g., varying contact rates) stabilizes the multiannual cycles and so does demographic noise, at least in smaller or incompletely mixing populations. The temporary disappearance of cycles during 1979 to 1985 is explained as a consequence of stochastic mode-hopping. The circulation of M. pneumoniae was recently disrupted by COVID-19 nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), providing a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations for long-term prediction. More generally, our findings provide further evidence for the role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.",

In Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis , energization of cytoplasmic metabolism and the ETC occurs early in germination, before or alongside water ingress and bulk CaDPA efflux. The aa 3 -type oxidases (Qox, Cta) accumulate nonradical ferryl intermediates of their catalytic cycle, slowed by a high membrane potential. The Yth isoform of the bd oxidase, present in spores, allows rapid electron transfer to O 2 when the aa 3 -type oxidases are hindered, establishing a role for this enzyme. Deletion of Yth slows the initiation of “absorbance”/attenuance loss, directly linking bioenergetic processes to germination. We propose a powered germination model, where the Ger-mediated signaling cascade and bioenergetic processes occur in parallel and are mutually influenced by each other. This model explains why germination on energy-rich molecules (e.g., glucose) is often much faster than on energy-poor ones (e.g., KBr).",

          "abstract": "Aducanumab, a human IgG1 antibody with plaque-clearing effects and modest clinical benefit, binds selectively to aggregated Aβ via the N-terminal region. Yet, the molecular details of how the antibody engages Aβ 1-42 fibrils remain unresolved. Using magic-angle spinning NMR, we show that binding of aducanumab preserves the overall architecture of the Aβ 1-42 fibril core while inducing significant structural and dynamic perturbations in the N-terminal region. Antibody binding markedly reduces flexibility in this domain, with the appearance of side-chain resonances from residues D1, E3, and histidine (likely H6) in dipolar-based experiments. These side chains—previously observed in scalar-coupling spectra of the unbound state—indicate rigidification of residues that were dynamic. The interaction extends to S8 and Y10, indicating broader fibril engagement than the minimal epitope (residues 3 to 7) defined in fragment-based studies. Perturbations in the C-terminal segment (G37–A42) are consistent with its spatial proximity to the antibody-bound N termini of neighboring monomers. Cryo-TEM images reveal fibrils bundling in the presence of aducanumab, consistent with lateral association via antibody cross-linking, supporting a model where surface coating and steric hindrance suppress secondary nucleation. This mode of action restricts monomer access to catalytic sites on the fibril surface, resulting in partial inhibition (~threefold reduction) of secondary nucleation. The effect depends on high avidity and relatively high stoichiometry but is ultimately limited by antibody size relative to N-terminal spacing along the fibril. These findings provide atomic-level insights into aducanumab’s binding mode and supply a structural framework for understanding antibody-mediated fibril recognition and for guiding next-generation therapies targeting Aβ aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Rabies, caused by the neurotropic lyssavirus rabies virus (RABV), is nearly 100% fatal after symptom onset. A fundamental challenge for rabies therapy is that the blood–brain barrier (BBB) prevents peripherally administered neutralizing antibodies from entering the central nervous system (CNS) to clear the infection. In this study, we initially generated four human–mouse chimeric antibodies with preserved neutralizing potency against RABV to increase its translational potential. To achieve brain antibody delivery, we conjugated a lead chimeric antibody (7A3-H) to different cell-penetrating peptides with potential BBB-penetrating capacity (RVG, TGN, THR, and SynB1). In vivo fluorescence imaging revealed that SynB1 conjugation significantly outperformed conjugation with the other peptides in terms of BBB penetration for brain antibody delivery. Furthermore, a triple-antibody cocktail (targeting epitopes II/III/IV of RABV-G) conjugated to SynB1 resulted in 80% survival in mice infected with lethal challenge virus standard (CVS) or dog-originated rabies virus (DRV) strains when it was administered at 5 dpi (when CNS invasion and symptoms were evident). In contrast, the unconjugated cocktail provided only 20% (CVS) or 0% (DRV) survival. Together, these data demonstrated that SynB1-mediated BBB penetration dramatically improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti-RABV antibodies, enabling post-symptom rescue of rabies. This antibody–peptide conjugation strategy provides a proof of concept for advancing rabies therapy, specifically by leveraging peptide-mediated enhancement of BBB penetration.",

          "abstract": "Primate societies rely on the production and interpretation of social signals, in particular those displayed by the face. Facial movements are controlled, according to the dominant neuropsychological schema, by two separate circuits, one originating in medial frontal cortex controlling emotional expressions, and a second one originating in lateral motor and premotor areas controlling voluntary facial movements. Despite this functional dichotomy, cortical anatomy suggests that medial and lateral areas are directly connected and may thus operate as a single network. Here, we test these contrasting hypotheses through structural and functional MRI (fMRI) guided electrical stimulation and simultaneous multichannel recordings from key facial motor areas in the macaque monkey brain. These areas include medial facial motor area M3 (located in the anterior cingulate cortex); two lateral face-related motor areas: M1 (primary motor) and PMv (ventrolateral premotor); and S1 (primary somatosensory cortex). Cortical responses evoked by intracortical stimulation revealed that medial and lateral areas can exert significant functional impact on each other. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials in all facial motor areas further confirm that during facial expressions, medial and lateral facial motor areas significantly interact, primarily in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, whereas during voluntary chewing, coupling occurs at lower frequencies. These functional interactions varied across facial movement types. Thus, at the cortical level, the control of facial movements is not mediated through independent (medial/lateral) functional streams, but results from an interacting sensorimotor network.",

Additionally, we observed unexpected spatial variation in gene expression within several types along the dorso–ventral axis or within vs. outside the ART, independent of RGC density profiles.

The receptors colocalize widely at inhibitory synapses in the spinal cord and in the brainstem due to their interaction with an overlapping binding site of the synaptic scaffold protein gephyrin, pointing to a direct competition between the different receptor types. We have put this hypothesis to the test using single-molecule approaches to measure receptor–gephyrin interactions in cells and in vitro. We explored the effects of receptor competition at inhibitory synapses in living neurons by measuring the change in the accumulation and effective stabilization energy of glycine receptors in the presence of interfering GABA receptor complexes through single-molecule tracking and diffusion analysis. Second, using molecular tweezers, we quantified the thermodynamic properties of receptor–gephyrin binding, demonstrating direct and reversible competition through the addition of interacting peptides in solution. The relatively low affinity of GABA receptor subunits for gephyrin compared to the glycine receptor raises interesting questions about the role of this competition in synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that GABA and glycine receptor competition constitutes a molecular system designed to reconcile synapse stability and plasticity at mixed inhibitory synapses.",

          "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) has regained research prominence as deep learning advancements accelerate the search for analytical models from observational data. However, the vast search space often hinders existing algorithms to yield complex analytical expressions. We present SR-LLM, an SR framework integrating retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms based on large language models (LLM) to achieve incremental learning. Specifically, our framework is capable of leveraging accumulated prior knowledge and past exploration results from external knowledge bases to retrieve the most relevant information for current regression tasks. It first composes prior information into small symbolic groups with the assistance of the LLMs and then utilizes deep reinforcement learning to combine these groups to formulate complex yet explainable analytic expressions that are more easily understood by humans. The capability for efficient knowledge utilization enables our framework to integrate all previous human experiences and exploration results, effectively learning by standing on the shoulders of giants. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we not only test the framework on popular symbolic regression benchmarks but also extend its application to a domain where the explicit optimal model remains controversial: how to analytically describe human car-following behavior based on observed vehicle trajectories? Experiments confirm that our method outperforms on standard benchmarks, successfully rediscovers famous traditional car-following models and discovers new models from empirical trajectory data, achieving both fitting effectiveness and interpretability.",

          "abstract": "Cereal crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, and barley) constituted the major component of global human diet and fundamentally changed human society since the dawn of agriculture around 12,000 y ago. Originated and domesticated in different continents and environments, cereal crops vary significantly in their salt tolerance. The High-Affinity K + Transporter1;5s (HKT1;5s) predominately regulate Na + accumulation and salt tolerance in salt-sensitive cereal crops by mediating shoot-to-root Na + exclusion. However, HvHKT1;5 paradoxically promotes root-to-shoot Na + translocation in salt-tolerant barley. Therefore, unravelling the regulatory mechanisms of HvHKT1;5 is critical to understanding the molecular basis of salt tolerance in barley. Here, we demonstrated that a microRNA164d-HvNAC92-HvHKT1;5 module improves salt tolerance via reduced shoot Na + accumulation and increased K + retention in barley, whereas miR164d suppresses HvNAC92 transcription factor to directly downregulate HvHKT1;5 expression. Under salinity condition, the MIR164d -OE, Hvnac92 , and Hvhkt1;5 lines showed significantly reduced root-to-shoot Na + translocation and shoot Na + content compared with the wild-type. In conclusion, we resolve the species-specific function of HKT1;5s in cereal crops by establishing miRNA-guided Na + and K + transport regulation as a regulatory framework for engineering salt-tolerant crops.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulatory systems play an essential role in regulating brain states and functions. The canonical view is that the release of monoamines including norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) is high during wakefulness and attenuated during sleep, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, whereas the cholinergic system is active during both wakefulness and REM sleep and quiescent during non–REM (NREM) sleep. Recent studies have revealed a slow and rhythmic release pattern of neuromodulators during NREM sleep that drives infraslow oscillation (ISO) (0.02 to 0.03 Hz) in the brain. A key question is whether/how the release of different neuromodulators during sleep is coordinated. In this study, we combined 2-site fiber photometry with electroencephalogram/electromyography recording to monitor the release of NE, 5-HT, and acetylcholine in the cortex and hippocampus during sleep and wake cycles. We found that the ISO of these neuromodulators is synchronized during NREM sleep. The synchrony between neuromodulatory systems increases in the oscillatory cycles leading to arousal. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of either the 5-HT or NE system eliminates the oscillation of other neuromodulators during NREM sleep. Optogenetic activation of 5-HT or NE neurons during NREM sleep induces the release of other neuromodulators in the absence of sleep-to-wake transitions. These results suggest that the rhythmic neuromodulator releases are highly coordinated in the brain. The synchrony among multiple neuromodulatory systems across brain regions provides a powerful neural mechanism to orchestrate sleep architecture and sleep-related neural processes.",

          "abstract": "α-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered neuronal protein that forms an amphipathic helix when it peripherally binds to lipid membranes. This membrane interaction is integral to the protein’s function but is also associated with its dysfunction. Numerous membrane parameters have been identified to promote α-synuclein binding such as high negative charge and low lipid-packing density, which corresponds to greater lipid-packing defects—increased spacing between lipids conferred through curvature, unsaturation, or small headgroups. Despite α-synuclein’s established preference for negatively charged membranes with packing defects, the specific effects that each parameter has on this interaction remains underexplored. With increasing links between α-synuclein-associated diseases and changes in lipid composition, it has become more important to delineate how changes in membrane parameters affect α-synuclein membrane-interactions. Here, we demonstrate using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy that while net negative charge does increase the density of α-synuclein bound to a membrane, lipid-packing defects alone are sufficient for α-synuclein to insert. Not only do our results establish a lipid-packing defect requirement for α-synuclein, but they also reveal a packing defect-dependent shift in the ensemble of binding modes of the protein favoring the insertion of the end of its binding domain—a binding mode which has previously been linked to disease mutants of the protein. Overall, this work establishes the significance of lipid-packing defects in contrast to net negative charge for α-synuclein–membrane binding and proposes a lipid-compositionally dependent shift in α-synuclein’s ensemble of bound conformations, which may be relevant for the protein’s function and dysfunction.",

While some geological records and ice-sheet models suggest WAIS retreat during past warm periods, reliable data constraining the extent of retreat are lacking. Detrital Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope data of sediments recently drilled at International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1532 on the Amundsen Sea continental rise manifest repeated alternations in sediment provenance during glacial–interglacial cycles of the Pliocene (5.33 to 2.58 Mya), a time warmer than present. The variations reflect large fluctuations in WAIS extent on the Antarctic continent. A unique high Pb/low ε Nd signature of sediments found at the onset of glacial intervals (3.88, 3.6, and 3.33 Ma) is attributed to the supply of detritus sourced from plutonic rocks located in the West Antarctic interior. Its isotopic signature at Site U1532 indicates major inland retreat of the WAIS during the preceding interglacials. During peak interglacials, the ice margin had retreated inland, and icebergs rafted and deposited inland-sourced detritus over 500 km across the Amundsen Sea shelf. Subsequent readvance of grounded ice then “bulldozed” these inland-derived fine-grained sediments from the shelf down to the continental slope and rise, resulting in a high Pb/low ε Nd peak in the rise sediments. Our continuous Pliocene records provide conclusive evidence for at least five major inland retreat events of the WAIS, highlighting the significant vulnerability of the WAIS to ongoing warming.",

Inhibition of CBP/p300 with two distinct small-molecule inhibitors suppresses T antigen expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1 . This shift promotes neuronal differentiation, associated with neurite outgrowth in MCC cells. RNA sequencing revealed downregulation of genes involved in E2F, Myc, mTORC1 oncogenic signaling, as well as markers of the Merkel cell lineage including Sox2 and Atoh1. Notably, a rare MCC case exhibiting a mixed cellular composition, with loss of T antigen expression and neuroblastic phenotype, showed a transcriptomic profile resembling that of MCC cells treated with CBP/p300 inhibitors.

It plays an important role in the control of movement, integrating inputs from upstream structures in the basal ganglia, before sending organized projections to a range of targets in the midbrain, brainstem, and thalamus. Here, we present a detailed in silico model of the mouse SNr, including its major afferent inputs. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of SNr neurons are characterized in acute brain slices via whole cell patch-clamp recordings and morphological reconstruction. Using reconstructed morphologies, multicompartmental models of single neurons are instantiated within the NEURON simulation environment and populated with relevant modeled ion channels. Model parameters are optimized via an evolutionary algorithm, such that simulated neurons faithfully reproduce recorded electrophysiological behavior. Using the simulation infrastructure software Snudda , single neuron models are incorporated into a circuit-level model, where the sparse connectivity within the SNr is recreated. We simulate the mouse SNr at scale, featuring realistic volumes and neuronal density. The unique synaptic properties and activity patterns of different afferent sources are captured in silico. Born out of ex vivo data, our model reproduces in vivo firing patterns. Our simulations suggest that paradoxical activity increases in response to experimental inhibition can be explained by lateral connectivity. In addition, our model predicts the functional implications of characteristic short-term synaptic plasticity in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia. The model can be extended to include additional inputs and be connected with existing models of upstream basal ganglia nuclei to further explore circuit dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of cardiac failure among individuals under 35. Many genetic mutations that cause HCM seem to enhance ventricular systolic function, suggesting that these HCM mutations are hypercontractile. Among the most common causes of HCM are mutations in the gene MYH7, which encodes for β-cardiac myosin, the principal human ventricular myosin. Previous work has demonstrated that, for purified myosins, some MYH7 mutations are gain-of-function while others cause reduced function, so how they lead to enhanced contractility is not clear. Here, we have characterized the mechanics and kinetics of the severe HCM-causing mutation M493I. Motility assays demonstrate a 70% reduction of actin filament gliding velocities on M493I-coated surfaces relative to wild type (WT). This mutation slows ADP release from actomyosin•ADP fivefold without affecting phosphate release or ATP binding. Yet it enhances steady-state ATPase V max twofold. Through single-molecule mechanical studies, we find that M493I myosin has a normal working stroke of 5 nm but a significantly prolonged actin attachment duration. Under isometric feedback, M493I myosins produce high, sustained force, with an actin detachment rate that is less sensitive to force than that of WT myosin. We also report direct measurement of the equilibrium state of the super-relaxed to disordered relaxed regulatory transition and show its disruption in M493I, with a concomitant enhancement to actin attachment kinetics. Together, these data demonstrate that enhanced myosin binding from inhibition of myosin’s off state, combined with slow ADP release and enhanced force production, underlie the enhanced function and etiology of this HCM mutation.",

          "abstract": "Herbivory is destructive for crop production in many regions worldwide. The induced plant response to herbivores promotes resistance; therefore, characterizing the mechanisms underlying natural host resistance is highly important. However, the genetic components of resistance to herbivores in the staple food crop soybean remain elusive. Here, a key defense gene, GmMYC3 , was identified via joint linkage and association mapping in soybean. GmMYC3 encodes an MYC2 transcription factor that is rapidly activated after jasmonic acid treatment or herbivore attack and confers resistance to a major pest, the common cutworm (CCW), in soybean. GmMYC3 positively regulates multiple biotic stress-related genes, among which GmMYC3 triggers high expression of Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors alongside its homolog GmMYC1 and downstream GmWRKY56 . GmMYC3 overexpression results in massive accumulation of trypsin inhibitors in soybean leaves, interferes with the protein digestion and absorption function in larvae that are fed these leaves, and retards larval and pupal development of the CCW. The results of the field tests of the transgenic plants corroborate the defense role of GmMYC3 . Evolutionary and population genetic analyses suggest that the elite haplotype of GmMYC3 contributes to resistance against the CCW without significant reduction in seed yield and quality. Notably, this haplotype appears at a low frequency in domesticated germplasms. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying plant resistance to the CCW and provides potentially valuable resources for breeding soybean plants with elevated resistance against this pest.",

          "abstract": "Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) is a method whereby randomly oriented chiral molecules are irradiated by circularly polarized light (CPL), photoionizing electrons, which are measured in a momentum-resolved manner. This scheme permits chiral light–matter interactions within the electric-dipole approximation (avoiding weak magnetic-dipole interactions), yielding huge chiral signals in the form of a forward–backward asymmetry in photoemission. Recently, more intricate realizations of PECD have been explored where the CPL is replaced with elaborate polarization-tailored light (e.g., bichromatic, noncollinear, etc.), some of which do not even require circularly polarized components, but still lead to massive chiral signals. However, the connection between generalized symmetries and asymmetries of the laser drive and selection rules in PECD have not yet been derived. Here, we formulate this connection analytically from group theory, also predicting two previously unknown selection rules for PECD from fields with dynamical inversion and improper-rotational symmetries. We further propose bichromatic bielliptical fields for breaking symmetries in typical spectra, yielding potentially more information for ultrafast-resolved measurements. We numerically demonstrate all of our results with state-of-the-art ab-initio simulations in the archetypal chiral molecule, Bromochlorofluoromethane, providing predictions for experiments. Our work presents a roadmap for analyzing PECD from tailored light and resolves a long-standing issue in the field. It should motivate theoretical and experimental investigations in novel PECD set-ups.",

          "abstract": "Some patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) make a full recovery, while others remain severely disabled. Accurate prognostication is important, because withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy based on perceived poor prognosis is the leading cause of death after TBI. Synchronized activity between brain regions, measurable with resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), may underlie neurological recovery. However, which functional connections are critical for recovery, and whether functional connectivity measured shortly after brain injury predicts long-term recovery, is unknown. Here, we analyzed data from three prospective cohorts of patients with moderate or severe TBI (N = 116 patients; 134 controls) who underwent rs-fMRI shortly after injury. The strongest predictor of 6-mo functional outcomes in the Training Cohort (mean cross validation AUC 0.94) and independent Testing Cohort (AUC 0.78; P = 0.001) was functional connectivity between three pairs of brain regions from functionally distinct networks, two of which were anticorrelated. Results were robust to controlling for sedation ( P = 0.02) and level of consciousness at time of MRI ( P = 0.02). Finally, preserved anticorrelations improved the leave-one-out outcome prediction accuracy of an established prognostic score (AUC 0.90 vs. 0.80; P = 0.02). Preserved functional anticorrelations in acutely traumatized brains identify patients with the neurological substrate required for recovery. This biomarker can inform prognostic decisions in patients at high risk for death from withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy.",

Our method is based on in vivo affinity selection inside a bacterial host and uses high-throughput DNA sequencing to infer probable protein–protein interaction (PPI) interfaces. SpARC-map uses only routine microbiology techniques, with no reliance on specialized instrumentation, dedicated reagents, or reconstituting protein complexes in vitro. SpARC-map can be tuned to detect PPIs over a broad range of affinities, multiplexed to probe multiple PPIs in parallel, and its nonspecific background can be precisely measured, enabling the sensitive detection of weak PPIs. Using SpARC-map, we recover known PPI interfaces in the p21–PCNA, p53–MDM2, and MYC–MAX complexes. We also use SpARC-map to probe the purinosome, the weakly bound complex of six purine biosynthetic enzymes, where no PPI interfaces are known. There, we identify interfaces that satisfy structural requirements for substrate channeling, as well as protein surfaces that participate in multiple distinct interactions, which we validate using site-specific photocrosslinking in live human cells.

We provide 686,559 data points and further evaluate 11 diseases most widely targeted by vaccination programs in 2025. The vaccination coverage for global populations at risk of these diseases in 2025 is as follows: for cattle, 16.64% (95% CI: 16.63 to 16.66) against foot and mouth disease, 33.80% (33.43 to 34.38) against lumpy skin disease, 7.46% (6.71 to 8.81) against Brucella abortus , 11.57% (10.29 to 13.36) against anthrax, and 7.93% (6.27 to 14.09) against rabies.

          "abstract": "Many animals have multiple organs or tissues that are colonized by diverse microbiota. The female Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes , has two organs with distinct symbiotic communities: the accessory nidamental gland (ANG) and the light organ (LO). The ANG hosts a bacterial consortium, whereas the LO has a binary relationship with Vibrio fischeri , housed in extracellular crypt spaces as part of the central core (CC). To understand how the host maintains distinct symbiotic communities, we used transcriptomics to identify immune-related genes that are uniquely and similarly expressed in the ANG and LO-CC compared to organs without a known microbiota. Genes such as peptidoglycan recognition proteins EsPGRP2 and EsPGRP3, cathepsin-Z, alkaline phosphatase, and acidic phospholipase exhibited significant upregulation in the symbiotic organs compared to other tissues like gills, skin, mantle, optic lobe, ovaries, and brain. Moreover, EsPGRP2 displayed distinct localization patterns within the ANG, inversely correlating with bacterial presence, whereas the protein was colocalized with V. fischeri in the LO-CC. Notably, 10 different galaxins (EsGal) were uniquely highly expressed in both the ANG and LO-CC, with EsGal1 messenger RNA predominantly localized to the LO-CC epithelium, while EsGal2 and EsGal3 were primarily found in the epithelia of ANG tubules. Furthermore, antimicrobial assays using partial peptides derived from EsGal1 and EsGal2 showed varying and distinct patterns of inhibitory activity for these peptides. In summary, our findings identify similar immune gene families expressed across functionally distinct symbiotic organs in E. scolopes , suggesting that common immunomodulatory factors may maintain distinct symbiotic niches in the host.",

TCs in the post-1911 period were also examined and a 653-y long (1368–2020) North Western Pacific TC chronology was studied. The peak TC frequency occurred in the 1650–1680 with a greater amplitude of variabilities in the south and east coasts of China and TC behaviors changed seasonally. The peak TC period corresponded to the Maunder Minimum which was characterized by lower land surface temperature, whereas the temperature reconstructed from marine proxies showed an anomalously warmer sea surface temperature over the western Pacific. Changing thermal contrast between land and sea likely created a more dynamic summer monsoon circulation resulting in active TC activity.

          "abstract": "Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a fundamental principle of protein organization in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and biomaterials, yet the residue-level interactions that link condensation to structural ordering remain poorly defined. In spider dragline silk, LLPS is believed to initiate the transition from soluble spidroin dope into β-sheet–rich fibers that provide exceptional toughness, yet how sequence-specific motifs govern this process has been unclear. Here, we combine isotope-edited solution NMR, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)–enhanced solid-state NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and AlphaFold3 modeling to define the molecular role of arginine and tyrosine in Latrodectus hesperus dragline silk. Phosphate triggers LLPS while preserving intrinsic disorder, with arginine exhibiting the largest chemical shift perturbations. Simulations reveal that phosphate displaces hydration water to promote Arg–Tyr cation–π interactions and weaken Arg–poly(Ala) contacts. Solid-state NMR directly detects Arg–Tyr contacts in spun fibers, demonstrating that arginine is partially incorporated into β-sheet interfaces while tyrosine frequently adopts β-turn conformations. AlphaFold3 models corroborate these interfacial geometries and reproduce experimental chemical shifts, supporting persistent Arg–Tyr interactions at structured–unstructured boundaries. Together, these results identify Arg–Tyr contacts as critical “sticker” interactions that mediate condensation, nucleate local order, and stabilize fiber architecture. More broadly, this work establishes a mechanistic link between residue-specific chemistry, LLPS, and hierarchical assembly in a structural protein. These insights highlight how weak multivalent interactions bridge disordered and ordered states, providing a general framework for condensate-driven assembly in biology and guiding biomimetic material design.",

The cytoskeleton is known to play a critical role in gravitropism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis kinesins KCH3 and KCH7 (KCH3/7) are expressed and functionally active in the root stele. The kch3 kch7 ( kch37 ) double mutant exhibits delayed gravitropic responses, while stele-specific expression of either KCH3 or KCH7 rescues this defect. Both the calponin homology (CH) and motor domains of KCH3/7 are essential for mediating gravitropism. In vitro and in vivo assays reveal that KCH3/7 promotes actin filament (F-actin) bundling and its turnover in the root stele. Mutation of KCH3/7 results in altered PIN protein abundance and polarity in the root stele, leading to impaired acropetal auxin transport within the stele and reduced auxin accumulation in the root tip’s columella cells. This ultimately causes defective auxin redistribution during gravistimulation. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics in the root stele for maintaining the auxin gradient in the root tip and for gravistimulation-induced auxin asymmetry.",

Specifically, stromal cells exhibited attenuated inflammatory responses coupled with enhanced fibrotic activity. Keratinocytes and endothelial cells demonstrated increased proliferative and angiogenic activity, respectively, yet both cell types showed markedly reduced antigen-presenting capacity. Immune cell compartments displayed profound dysfunction characterized by marked reductions and impaired functionality of dendritic cells, polarization of macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, and enrichment of T cell exhaustion signatures. Notably, cell–cell communication analysis revealed diminished crosstalk between immune and structural cell populations. Mechanistically, we identified NAMPT-mediated signaling as a critical regulator of myeloid-stromal crosstalk. Targeted depletion of NAMPT in macrophages disrupted fibroblast-mediated inflammatory responses and impaired wound healing, whereas exogenous NAMPT administration reactivated immune responses and promoted tissue repair in chronic wounds.

Unfortunately, existing roadmaps often drastically underestimate the true extent of road networks and future predictions of road-related impacts rely on incomplete and outdated data, undermining development planning and conservation decision-making. Here, we develop a multivariate “road expansion risk” index to identify areas prone to road building and therefore vulnerable to road-related environmental impacts. Using a massive road dataset—137 million 1-ha raster cells drawn from three different sources arrayed across the Amazon and Congo basins and insular Asia-Pacific region—we predict road-prone locations via a statistical model that integrates a range of biophysical, socioeconomic, and administrative data. This highly integrative, large-scale approach allowed us to identify areas likely to experience future road building and regions that may contain unmapped roads. Importantly, our road expansion risk index is a strong predictor of forest loss and degradation and can hence identify future road building and deforestation hotspots, even for the many tropical forest locales with grossly deficient road data.",

          "abstract": "The interaction between the immune system and the somatosensory system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of diverse biological processes. Chronic itch is a common yet hard-to-treat symptom of many inflammatory skin conditions. One hallmark of chronic itch is the hyperinnervation of the skin by sensory fibers, yet what drives this aberrant nerve growth or how it contributes to disease progression remains unclear. Here, we identify IL-17A and immunity to skin microbiota as key triggers of sensory neuron plasticity and pruritus. In a murine model of psoriatic itch, we show that exposure to Staphylococcus aureus prior to experimental psoriasis results in heightened skin inflammation, increased itch, and marked hyperinnervation of CGRPα + sensory neurons. Accordingly, single-nuclei RNA sequencing of dorsal root ganglia reveals that microbiota-driven inflammation induces a regenerative transcriptional program in sensory neurons, including upregulation of axonal growth, injury response, and IL-17RA signaling pathways. Mechanistically, we show that IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling within TRPV1 + sensory neurons drives hyperinnervation and pruritus, establishing a causal link between IL-17A and microbiota-driven immune responses in sensory circuit remodeling. Further, we identify sensory hyperinnervation as a key driver of chronic itch and inflammation. Collectively, we reveal that aberrant IL-17A signaling in sensory neurons, triggered by dysregulated microbiota immunity, promotes neuronal remodeling that amplifies itch and inflammation. These findings provide a framework for targeting microbiota–neuroimmune interactions as a therapeutic strategy for pruritus.",

          "abstract": "Gap junctions mediate rapid signal transduction between contiguous cells, which are indispensable for multicellular organisms to coordinate cellular activities across numerous physiological processes. However, precise control of gap junctions remains elusive. Herein, we present CarGAP, a single-component chemo-optogenetic tool that utilizes the C-terminal adenosylcobalamin (AdoB 12 ) binding domain of a photoreceptor protein (i.e., CarH C ) to achieve reversible control over both vertebrate and invertebrate gap junctions with spatiotemporal precision. The vertebrate CarGAP (i.e., Cx-CarGAP), created by genetically fusing connexins with CarH C in mammalian cells, can efficiently block the gap junction channels through AdoB 12 -induced protein oligomerization and subsequently reinstate them via green light–induced protein disassembly. We further introduced the CarGAP system (i.e., Inx-CarGAP) to the Drosophila ovary, enabling reversible control over the heterotypic gap junctions formed by innexin2 (Inx2) and innexin4 (Inx4, also known as zero population growth, Zpg), thereby uncovering the roles of gap junctions in stem cell–niche interactions. This study illustrates CarGAP as a generalizable chemo-optogenetic tool for interrogating the functions of gap junctions in various biological contexts.",

          "authors": "Brent W. Simpson, Amanda B. McLean, M. Stephen Trent",
          "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria build a multilayered cell envelope in which the peptidoglycan layer is sandwiched between an inner membrane of glycerophospholipids and an asymmetric outer membrane composed of glycerophospholipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Acinetobacter baumannii , however, synthesize lipooligosaccharide (LOS), an LPS variant lacking O-antigen. Although LPS/LOS is typically essential, A. baumannii can survive without LOS, offering the opportunity to examine how the Gram-negative envelope remains stable in the absence of this major glycolipid. We previously found that the peptidoglycan biogenesis protein NlpD, an activator of peptidoglycan degradation by cell division amidases, is critical for fitness during LOS deficiency. Here, we show that NlpD is required under these conditions because a second putative amidase activator, WthA (cell wall turnover hub protein A), no longer functions in LOS-deficient cells. Mutants lacking WthA exhibited severe cell-division defects and were synthetically sick with loss of NlpD. Acinetobacter lack canonical periplasmic amidases, raising the question of which enzymes partner with NlpD and WthA. Previous work showed that overexpression of an Acinetobacter β-lactamase increased denuded peptidoglycan, a product of amidase activity. Guided by this finding, we examined the chromosomally encoded β-lactamase Oxa51 and found that its coexpression with WthA or NlpD enhanced release of amidase products, suggesting that Oxa51 participates in peptidoglycan degradation and that WthA is an amidase activator. Further, WthA influenced peptidoglycan endopeptidases and lytic transglycosylases through a network of protein interactions. Altogether, these findings identify WthA as a missing regulator in Acinetobacter peptidoglycan biogenesis and a hub that coordinates peptidoglycan turnover and cell division.",

          "abstract": "The Niemann-Pick type 1 and 2 proteins (NPC1 and NPC2) coordinate cholesterol egress from late endosomes-lysosomes (LE/LY). Proper folding, trafficking, and localization of both NPC proteins are essential for normal LE/LY cholesterol handling. Accordingly, mutations in NPC genes cause Niemann–Pick type C (NPC) disease, a progressive neurodegenerative lysosomal cholesterol storage disorder. The routes by which NPC1 reaches the LE/LY compartment in mammalian cells are not fully elucidated. Therefore, to interrogate NPC1 trafficking, we developed genome-engineered HeLa cells expressing endogenous NPC1 mNeon . We demonstrate that endogenous NPC1 localizes to the LE/LY compartment and by using protein proximity-based approaches that NPC1 resides in the same membranes as Vacuolar Protein Sorting-associated protein 41 (VPS41), one of the two unique subunits of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting complex. Loss of VPS41 increases NPC1 and Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) abundance. Paradoxically, this results in marked accumulation of lysosomal cholesterol and induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein signaling. Mechanistically, using immuno-fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging in combination with a VPS41-dependent ectopic recruitment assay, we demonstrate that this is due to a shift in the localization of NPC1 and LAMP1 from LE/LY to biosynthetic vesicles called LAMP carriers. These vesicles have been recently described to transport lysosomal-destined cargo directly from the trans- Golgi (TGN) network to LE/LY. In conclusion, we identify NPC1 as a cargo for VPS41-dependent LAMP carriers that are instrumental for the delivery of NPC1 to LE/LY and maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies have identified diverse hollow biomolecular condensates, characterized by biomolecule-depleted interiors surrounded by biomolecule-rich shells. Although several formation mechanisms have been proposed, a general thermodynamic driving force remains elusive. Here, we investigate a well-defined system in which the human transcription factor p53 and nonspecific double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) form biomolecule-rich condensates. Introduction of dsDNA containing p53-binding motifs induces a morphological transition to hollow structures, accompanied by a material state transition from liquid-like to gel-like. In vitro assays indicate that the formation of hollow condensates is driven by p21 DNA–induced localized gelation at the condensate periphery. Guided by these findings, we developed a three-component phase-field model that quantitatively recapitulates the formation of hollow condensates. Simulations show that peripheral gelation leads to gradual depletion of protein and Random DNA from the condensate core, triggering spinodal decomposition and lumen formation inside condensates. Together, these results offer mechanistic insights into multicomponent hollow condensates.",

          "abstract": "With approximately 4% of the world’s population using cannabis, there is a need to better understand its physiological effects. Cannabis consumption acutely promotes food intake (“the munchies”) via delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-mediated activation of cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1R); however, these appetitive effects have not been well characterized. We examined effects of cannabis vapor inhalation on energy and macronutrient intake patterns in human participants and then validated these findings in a translational rat model through which we explored behavioral and physiological mechanisms subserving this response. Vaporized cannabis acutely and robustly increased energy intake. In humans, this occurred in the first 30 min of snack and beverage access, irrespective of dose or gender. In rats, these effects were observed in the first 60 min of food access, irrespective of macronutrient content, satiation, or sex, and were a result of cannabis vapor reducing latency to eat and increasing feeding bout number. Also, cannabis vapor did not change the proportion of macronutrients consumed by human participants and abolished preexisting macronutrient-specific food preferences in rats. Our rat data indicate that cannabis vapor may override homeostatic appetite regulation by increasing motivation to eat and reducing food reward devaluation to promote energy intake. Finally, cannabis vapor did not alter circulating appetite-associated hormones, and these feeding effects were mediated by central, but not peripheral, CB1Rs. This study complements and builds upon previous literature to characterize the appetitive effects of vaporized cannabis and uses a translational approach to examine cannabis-driven energy and macronutrient intake patterns in humans and rodents.",

In the case of PdCrO 2 , this arises in a triangular-lattice antiferromagnet, creating a unique opportunity to study frustrated magnetism in a very clean metal. Here, we combine a chemical vapor transport crystal growth approach with magnetic, thermodynamic, magnetotransport, and neutron scattering measurements to elucidate the striking anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic PdCrO 2 . The unconventional AHE (with anomalous Hall conductivity ~10 5 Ω −1 cm −1 ) and a large positive magnetoresistance effect (&gt;1,000%) are shown to exhibit complex temperature dependencies, persisting to almost seven times the Néel temperature (~250 K). These effects are directly compared to elastic neutron scattering, inelastic neutron scattering, and neutron magnetic pair distribution function data, establishing unambiguous links between anomalous magnetotransport properties and directly probed short-range spin fluctuations. The latter occur over a notably broad temperature range due to geometrical magnetic frustration. Connecting to recent experimental and theoretical developments, these findings are discussed in terms of a temperature-dependent interplay between chiral spin order and chiral spin fluctuations, significantly elucidating the high-temperature anomalous magnetotransport in such compounds.",

          "abstract": "The Mesoproterozoic eon [1.8 to 0.8 billion years ago (Ga)] is a crucial but enigmatic period in Earth’s history. Many facets of this interval remain unresolved, especially how atmospheric evolution influenced and responded to changes in climate and biology. For example, low atmospheric O 2 concentrations are thought to have inhibited the emergence of animals until the Neoproterozoic. Yet, some p O 2 estimates indicate that the critical threshold for animal respiration was exceeded several hundred million years prior. Likewise, low p CO 2 estimates imply glacial climates should prevail. However, this prediction is inconsistent with an apparent billion-year hiatus in glaciation. We test these hypotheses with direct constraints on the Mesoproterozoic atmosphere from analyses of primary fluid inclusions in 1.4 Ga surficial halite, which reveal an atmospheric p O 2 of 7.84 ± 3.05 mbar and a p CO 2 of 2.76 ± 1.66 mbar. We couple these measurements with average inclusion homogenization temperatures of 31.2 ± 7.8 °C. Our results point to an Earth system state characterized by a moderate climate with sufficient O 2 for early animal respiration. These observations reflect a coevolution of life, climate, and the atmosphere, where a largely unrecognized episode of oxygenation and CO 2 drawdown was driven by the breakup of the supercontinent Nuna and the complexification of algal eukaryotes.",

          "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV), a flavivirus, causes a range of clinical complications including microcephaly in human fetuses. Currently, there is no treatment or vaccine. Different maturation states (mature and immature forms) of flavivirus particles have been observed to be released from infected cells and are infectious. To understand how an ultrapotent human antibody (HMAb) A9E can neutralize these Zika particles, we determined the cryoEM structures of the A9E Fab fragment complexed with mature (mZIKV) and immature (immZIKV) ZIKV to 2.8Å and 7.5Å, respectively. A9E binds to an epitope spanning Domain I (EDI), EDIII, and their linker in an E protein protomer in both immZIKV and mZIKV particles. A9E generally inhibited prior to or during virus attachment to cells, via virus aggregation, distortion of virus particles and inhibition of receptor binding. ImmZIKV is particularly sensitive to structural distortion by Fab A9E. The primary mode of infection used by ImmZIKV is via antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADE)—the formation of virus complex with nonneutralizing or subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies, that leads to enhanced infection of Fcγ positive myeloid cells. IgG A9E, by itself displays poor ADE activity. When IgG LALA mutant or Fab A9E is added to other enhancing antibody (DV62.5):virus complexes, they can strongly reduce the overall ADE activity. This is likely due to their ability to distort virus particle structure, suggesting that HMAb A9E could be a potential prophylactic and therapeutic candidate against all maturation states of ZIKV.",

MB exhibited a specific pattern of behavioral lapses, as well as decreased fast oscillatory activity and complexity over posterior electrodes compared to MW. Functional connectivity analyses revealed decreased long-range interareal connectivity during MB, compared to both ON and MW states. Event-related potentials with source reconstruction and temporal decoding techniques indicated a significant disruption in visual processing during MB, starting from 200 ms post stimulus and echoing into the late-stage of visual processing, suggesting a disruption of conscious access to sensory information during MB. Electroencephalogram-derived markers allowed the prediction of mental states at the trial level, offering a finer view of conscious dynamics than subjective reports alone. Overall, these findings challenge the notion of the wakeful conscious mind as inherently content-oriented, suggesting that MB reflects genuine gaps in the stream of conscious thoughts, arising from disruptions in the generation or accessibility of thought content.",

Our biochemical assays reveal that substrate binding induces ATPase activity in ABCD3, suggesting a substrate-dependent conformational change. Structural comparison of the apo and substrate-bound states demonstrates that the substrate interaction brings nucleotide-binding domains closer together, providing a mechanistic basis of substrate-induced ATPase activity.

          "abstract": "Cognitive flexibility relies on the continuous accumulation and integration of sensory evidence to guide adaptive behavior. In natural environments, behaviorally relevant information unfolds sequentially over time and is constantly evaluated against prior knowledge, task rules, and current demands. Integration of these inputs poses a computational challenge: How is temporally unfolding, predictive information integrated into a stable representation, while preserving the discriminability and flexibility to map individual stimuli to competing context-specific actions? Using large-scale human intracranial electroencephalography, we assessed how neural population activity integrates behaviorally relevant information across multiple sensory events that sequentially unfold over time and jointly determine the current context. The results uncover that the population geometry supports the emergence of conjunctive coding subspaces that integrate prior information with current sensory evidence and jointly define the temporal context that mediates behavioral benefits. Evidence accumulation diversifies the population responses distributed across the cortex, increasing the representational space that embeds context-dependent stimulus-action mappings. Hence, context-dependent sensory coding might constitute the neural basis underlying adaptive human behavior. In sum, these results demonstrate how neural population activity balances integrating predictive information with preserving stimulus discriminability to enable flexibility, while minimizing interference.",

          "abstract": "Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations is critical for advancing our understanding of gene regulation. While single-cell CRISPR perturbation assays such as Perturb-seq provide direct measurements of gene function, the scale of these experiments is limited by cost and feasibility. This motivates the development of computational approaches that can accurately infer responses to unmeasured perturbations from related experimental data. We introduce dbDiffusion, a generative framework that integrates diffusion models with classifier-free guidance derived from perturbation information, operating in latent space through a variational autoencoder. Diffusion models are probabilistic generative models that approximate data distributions by reversing a Markovian diffusion process, progressively denoising Gaussian noise into structured outputs. By exploiting biological similarities in gene expression profiles and relationships among perturbations, dbDiffusion enables the conditional generation of gene expressions for previously unobserved perturbations. In contrast to competing approaches, dbDiffusion does not rely on Large Language Model or foundation models, which have been found to yield unsatisfactory results. Rather, it leverages embeddings derived from measured perturbations to generalize to unseen perturbations, effectively transferring information across related experimental conditions. In benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods on Perturb-seq datasets, dbDiffusion demonstrates superior accuracy in predicting perturbation responses. A methodological innovation of dbDiffusion is the integration of prediction-powered inference, which corrects for biases inherent in generative models and enables statistically rigorous downstream tasks, including the identification of differentially expressed genes. By combining deep generative modeling with principled inference, dbDiffusion establishes a scalable computational framework for predicting and analyzing transcriptomic perturbation responses, significantly extending the utility of Perturb-seq experiments.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms that dictate the localization of cytoskeletal filaments is crucial for elucidating cell shape regulation in prokaryotes. The actin homolog MreB plays a pivotal role in maintaining the shape of many rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli by directing cell-wall synthesis according to local curvature cues. However, the basis of MreB’s curvature-dependent localization has remained elusive. Here, we develop a biophysical model for the energetics of a filament binding to a surface that integrates the complex interplay between filament twist and bending and the two-dimensional surface geometry. Our model predicts that the spatial localization of a filament like MreB with substantial intrinsic twist is governed by both the mean and Gaussian curvatures of the cell envelope, which strongly covary in rod-shaped cells. Using molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the mechanical properties of MreB filaments, we show that their thermodynamic preference for regions with lower mean and Gaussian curvatures matches experimental observations for physiologically relevant filament lengths of ~50 nm. We find that the experimentally measured statistical curvature preference is maintained in the absence of filament motion and after a cycle of depolymerization, repolymerization, and membrane rebinding, indicating that equilibrium energetics can explain MreB localization. These findings provide critical insights into the physical principles underlying cytoskeletal filament localization and suggest design principles for synthetic shape-sensing nanomaterials.",

          "abstract": "Understanding protein structure and dynamics is crucial for basic biology and drug design. Conventional methods often provide static conformations that inadequately capture protein flexibility. We present PackDock, a framework that integrates deep learning and physics-based modeling to represent protein–ligand interactions. PackDock’s core, PackPocket, uses diffusion models to sample diverse binding pocket conformations and predict ligand-induced changes. We validate PackDock through side-chain packing, redocking, and cross-docking experiments, demonstrating its ability to address protein flexibility challenges. In a real-world application, PackDock identified nanomolar affinity compounds with unreported scaffolds for the protein of interest. Additionally, it revealed key amino acid conformational changes, offering insights into protein–ligand interactions. By accurately predicting complex conformations in various scenarios, PackDock enhances our understanding of protein dynamics and provides perspectives for both basic biological research and drug discovery efforts.",

          "abstract": "Brain capillaries are sensors of neural activity. When a brain region is active, capillary endothelial cells (ECs) sense neuron-derived mediators and elicit a local increase in blood flow (functional hyperemia) to support the rise in metabolic needs. This hyperemic response involves a rapid electrical component and a slower chemical component that involves Gαq PCR (G q PCR) activation by agonists released from neurons. The intravascular forces associated with hyperemia engage mechanosensitive Piezo1-mediated signaling that serves a mechano-feedback control function to facilitate the return of elevated blood flow to basal levels. Whether G q PCR activity influences Piezo1 mechanosensitive signaling has not been explored, despite the potential significant implications of such crosstalk. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology and freshly isolated brain capillary ECs, we demonstrate that prostanoid or muscarinic G q PCR activation facilitates Piezo1 activity. Pharmacological studies revealed the involvement of Gαq and phospholipase C stimulation, as well as downstream phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) hydrolysis in Piezo1 activation, but not signaling triggered by metabolites of PIP 2 hydrolysis. Exogenous application of nanomolar-to-micromolar PIP 2 suppressed Piezo1 open probability. Brain capillary ECs from mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral small vessel disease, or Piezo1 gain-of-function mutation exhibited higher Piezo1 activity, that was corrected by exogenous ex vivo PIP 2 application. We finally tested in vivo the hypothesis that systemic PIP 2 administration restores functional hyperemia in EC-specific Piezo1 gain-of-function mutant mice suffering impaired blood flow. Our findings provide insights into Piezo1 channel regulation and how it affects neurovascular coupling and cerebral blood flow.",
