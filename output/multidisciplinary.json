          "abstract": "Achieving highly ordered and uniformly covered self-assembly monolayers (SAMs) with optimal packing configuration on textured silicon substrates remains a critical challenge for further improving the efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs)1-3. Here we design an asymmetric SAM (named as HTL201) featuring anchoring group and spacer flanking a carbazole core, serving as hole selective layer (HSL) for perovskite/silicon TSCs. When compared to symmetric SAMs with nitrogen-bonded phosphonic acid group, the HTL201 molecule exhibits minimized steric hindrance and improved coverage on the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) recombination layer. The strong coordination interaction between HTL201 and perovskite film effectively reduces non-radiative recombination at buried interface. Notably, the optimized energy level alignment between perovskite and HTL201, accompanied by an increase in quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) value of the perovskite layer, enables an impressive voltage of nearly 2 V for perovskite/silicon TSCs, resulting in a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 34.58% based on a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell.",

          "title": "Deaf scientists hit by drastic NIH cuts — the research community must support them",
          "authors": "Wyatte C. Hall",
          "abstract": "I knew funding cuts would come to the ‘deaf-scientist pipeline’ — a constellation of five programmes that support deaf students from secondary school to postdoctoral research, all based in Rochester, New York. In April, however, I was still devastated by the flurry of formal terminations of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants that support four of the programmes, amounting to 80% of the system’s collective funding.\n\nAs a Deaf scientist and the first postdoctoral product of the pipeline, these funding cuts cannot help but feel personal.\n\n‘Deaf people cannot read or graduate from secondary school’, ‘deaf people are not prepared to function in a hearing world’ and ‘deaf people cannot lead research about deaf people’ are just a few of the negative messages we are often told by society. The deaf-scientist pipeline was different in its positive uplifting of deaf people to become researchers. These huge reductions, by contrast, are yet again a clear societal message of a belief that deaf people are not welcome, in science or anywhere.\n\nThe pipeline has grown for more than a decade and consists of partnerships between the University of Rochester Medical Center, the National Technical Institute for the Deaf and the Rochester School for the Deaf. Deaf students rarely get to easily access, much less thrive in, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education environments. The pipeline’s programmes provide them with mentorship, specialized training and support for navigating and overcoming systemic barriers.\n\nJudge rules against NIH grant cuts — and calls them discriminatory\n\nPipeline graduates have become teachers and researchers. They make meaningful innovations in their fields. They also give back to the pipeline: a postdoctoral fellow giving STEM lectures to deaf secondary-school students; a faculty member mentoring deaf graduate students; and principal investigators leading programmes in the pipeline. Some of these examples are me. And my own research grant focusing on language tracking and outcomes for deaf children has now been terminated.\n\nUnfortunately, funding for these training programmes is unlikely to be restored soon. This is a generational setback for the deaf academic community, not just here in the United States, but globally. Deaf people, however, will not disappear from STEM environments, and the lessons learnt from these programmes needn’t be lost. There are several steps that academic institutions can take to support deaf students, who will persevere even without the pipeline.\n\nThe first one is to recognize and help to manage the ‘deaf tax’. Many education and science institutions are not designed with deaf people in mind. Navigating administrative systems requires a lot of extra time, energy and labour for deaf people. On top of learning how to be a scientist, they might need to educate others about their access needs or train an interpreter in their science content. People who work with deaf students can help by educating themselves, creating more-accessible systems and proactively taking on some of these tasks themselves.\n\nIt’s also important to foster connections for deaf students — without waiting for them to ask. Provide networking opportunities with peers and mentors and for career development. Do not assume that deaf trainees have easy access to the same chances that other students might. Networking is already intimidating; adding language and communication barriers and interpreters can make it downright scary.",

          "title": "Stress is wrecking your health: how can science help?",
          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "George Slavich recalls the final hours he spent with his father. It was a laughter-packed day. His father even broke into the song ‘You Are My Sunshine’ over dinner. “His deep, booming, joyful voice filled the entire restaurant,” says Slavich. “I was semi-mortified, as always, while my daughter relished the serenade.”\n\nThen, about 45 minutes after saying goodbye outside the restaurant, Slavich got a call: his father had died. “I fell to the ground in a puddle of shock and disbelief,” he says.\n\nSlavich recognized the mental and emotional trauma he was feeling — and could imagine how it would affect his health. He studies stress for a living, after all. Yet even after he brought up his concerns, his health-care provider didn’t evaluate his stress.\n\n“If stress isn’t assessed, then it isn’t addressed,” says Slavich, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The experience highlighted a paradox between what I know stress is doing to the brain and body, and how little attention it gets in clinical care.”\n\nDecades of research have shown that, although short bursts of stress can be healthy, unrelenting stress contributes to heart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory disorders, suicide1 and other leading causes of death. In some cases, prolonged stress drives the onset of a health problem. In others, it accelerates a disease — or induces unhealthy coping behaviours that contribute to chronic conditions2.\n\nStress also seems to be on the rise. It increased globally during the recession of 2007 to 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic, says David Almeida, a developmental psychologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, who studies historical shifts in stress as well as everyday stressors. Polls show that globally, including in the United States, stress hasn’t gone back down to previous levels.\n\nHow gut microbes could drive brain disorders\n\n“Any time there is uncertainty in society, we see increases in reports of stress,” says Almeida. Uncertainty can ramp up our responses to stressors that are usually minor, he says: “Being stuck in traffic might make you more upset than it did before.”\n\nAlthough people tend to be aware of their stress, they often don’t know what to do about it. A physician might recommend leaving a stressful job, engaging in talk therapy or eating and sleeping better — but those options are not always possible. In fact, many of the individuals who face the greatest stressors also face the greatest barriers to treatment. What’s more, some people take pride in how many demands they can juggle, wearing stress like a badge of honour, says Slavich.\n\nHe, Almeida and other researchers are trying to change the current thinking. Emerging assessment tools, along with basic advances in stress science, now make it possible to answer questions such as ‘When does good stress turn bad?’ and ‘How can we intervene effectively?’ An improved understanding of stress, says Slavich, could “fundamentally transform health care”.\n\nGood versus bad stress\n\nSources of stress run the gamut: a high-stakes presentation at work, a disagreement among friends, trauma from military conflict, living in poverty, structural racism, divorce, a lost job — or a lost loved one.\n\nWhen the body perceives a threat, stress hormones, including cortisol, flood the bloodstream. Muscles tense and blood sugar levels rise. The heart beats faster and stronger, and blood vessels dilate, shuttling extra oxygen through the body to help you think and move quicker. The immune system is put on call for rapid healing and recovery.\n\nThis fight-or-flight response has, over millennia, helped humans to survive. But it didn’t evolve to cope with traffic, cyberbullying, credit-card debt and the countless other stressors of modern life.\n\n“There is an evolutionary mismatch happening right now,” says Almeida.\n\nIssues arise when the body fails to control the on–off switch, says Wendy Berry Mendes, a psychologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Stress becomes problematic if the body overreacts to situations that are not life-threatening, anticipates a stressor too soon or dwells on negative feelings after the stressor has passed — or if a source of stress sticks around for too long. When cortisol and the sympathetic nervous system are dialled up for extended periods, good stress can turn bad. But how would someone know when the line is crossed?\n\nStress assessments tend to rely on self-reported symptoms, such as anxiety or trouble sleeping, plus, in some cases, on measurements of blood pressure, cortisol levels or heart rate. These tools aren’t always sufficient. An elevated cortisol level or heart rate, for example, could be explained by exercise or “that cup of coffee you just had”, says Almeida.\n\nBlood pressure, cortisol and heart rate also rise and fall naturally throughout the day. The timing of the measurement matters, as do patterns over time. Mendes says she is most confident in cortisol measurements that are taken approximately 30 minutes after waking, when a healthy person should experience a strong spike. Heart-rate variability, a measure of the natural fluctuation in the time between beats, is also much more informative as to how the body regulates stress than is the heart rate itself, she says.\n\nAccess to many more types of measurement might offer a fuller picture, say researchers. Nearly the entire body reacts to stress, including the nervous, respiratory, digestive, cardiovascular, immune, circadian and endocrine systems. In a study that has not yet been peer reviewed, Slavich and his colleagues found that the expression of more than 1,500 genes, especially those involved in inflammation and antiviral responses, can change after a person is socially stressed for as little as 10 minutes3.\n\nWith this complex cascade in mind, Slavich and his colleagues are investigating a broad array of self-reported measures, including past stress and trauma exposure, as well as data on neurotransmitters, hormones, genetics, gene expression, gut bacteria, inflammatory markers, glucose levels, lipid function and metabolites. These data are now easier to obtain, often with affordable at-home tests.\n\nHow chronic stress warps decision-making\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic spurred the creation of simple-to-use devices to collect blood, saliva and stool samples. In parallel, there are increasingly small and powerful wearables that can continuously assess physical activity, sleep, heart rate, heart rate variability, vestibular balance and galvanic skin response. Sensors under development aim to detect real-time levels of cortisol and other stress hormones through sweat4. Meanwhile, researchers are designing ways to gauge blood pressure when people are on the go.\n\nThere are limitations to the wearables currently on the market, says Mendes: “Many physiological measures that wearables can detect are simply easy to obtain rather than being the most informative about stress or health.” Still, optimism is high that measures that can be taken quickly and with little or no effort will help people to become more aware of their stress level and will advance stress science.\n\nThe influx of data could help researchers to understand how stress contributes to long-term health problems, as well as offering guidance in the clinic. Currently, there are no clinical cut-offs that indicate harmful stress, says Slavich. By contrast, a health-care provider concerned about cardiovascular disease, for example, can measure levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, to determine whether a person is at an elevated risk and whether they’d benefit from further testing and treatment. “If you are going to transform clinical care and give health-care providers and patients a target to move towards, that’s a first step,” he says.\n\nFor harmful stress, Slavich anticipates that a more robust and continuous stress score, derived from a combination of signals, might be needed.\n\nStress gets personal\n\nThe good news is that a variety of interventions are already available, and more options are on the horizon.\n\nRobust clinical trials show that cognitive behavioural therapy, breathing exercises, social support, exercise and time spent in nature can fight bad stress by altering how a person thinks, how they act and how their body responds to stress. Cognitive behavioural therapy has been shown to reduce how much people dwell on negative feelings after a stressor, for example, as well as helping a person to reframe their perception of an upcoming stressful event. Last year, a meta-analysis of techniques for reframing stress concluded that they can provide a small boost in performance on a range of tasks, notably those that involve social evaluation, such as giving a business pitch5.\n\nThere are other tools that can help a body overwhelmed by stress. Beta blockers, for example, can be prescribed to tamp down the sympathetic nervous system as needed. Anti-inflammatory drugs can calm an immune system that remains activated after a bout of stress. Even omega-3 fatty acids can buffer the stress response and reduce inflammation.\n\nAn adhesive sensor can give quantitative readouts of several biological markers of stress.Credit: Wei Gao\n\nPart of the challenge going forward will be to match the treatment to the individual. In the past several years, researchers have realized just how much the impacts of stress vary depending on someone’s biology, past exposures and present circumstances.\n\nFor one thing, men and women tend to differ in their responses6. Men show greater cortisol responses to stressors related to performance, for example, such as public speaking, whereas women might react more strongly to inter-personal stressors7. Some studies find that people whose microbiome is out of balance, because of antibiotics or previous stressors, can experience an exaggerated stress response.\n\nThere’s also a body of research on how children who experience abuse or chronic neglect can be predisposed to a maladaptive stress response later in life. “An early-life traumatic experience can lead you to believe the world is unpredictable and unsafe place,” says Slavich.",

          "abstract": "Archaeological evidence suggests that Neanderthals (artist’s impression) were capable of processing animal bones to extract fat.Credit: S. Plailly/E. Daynes/Science Photo Library\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered evidence that Neanderthals rendered fat from bones 125,000 years ago. Modern humans have been using the process for at least 28,000 years, but the latest finding of “fat factories” reveals that Neanderthals were doing it much earlier. The study appeared on 2 July in Science Advances1.\n\nFat is a vital component of the hunter-gatherer diet, especially during the winter months, when animals are lean and hunted meat alone is not sufficient for sustenance. Eating lean protein without other nutrients can lead to protein poisoning, also known as ‘rabbit starvation’. Fat from bone marrow is a high-calorie source of nutrition, and is an important addition to a protein-heavy diet.\n\nDuring the process of rendering fat, bones were broken down into small segments using stone hammers and were boiled to draw out the fat, which rose to the top and could be extracted after cooling. Containers made from bark and animal tissue have been suggested for this process, although such artefacts would be unlikely to be found in the archaeological record owing to the perishable nature of these materials.\n\nThe team analysed material from Neumark-Nord near Leipzig, Germany: a former lake landscape that has yielded artefacts left by humans and their ancient relatives dating back 400,000 years. The researchers excavated thousands of bone fragments and other remains and artefacts from a layer of the site that has been dated to about 125,000 years ago — long before modern humans arrived in Europe.\n\nButchered and broken\n\nThe bones were heavily fragmented and marked with cuts, and had been harvested from at least 172 large animals, suggesting a large-scale operation in which animals were purposely transported to the area. Many of the bones were scattered around the site, but the researchers found a dense cluster of marrow-rich bones that they describe as a “fat factory”.\n\nNo direct evidence of boiling was found, but there were signs of the use of fire near the bone cluster, including charcoal and bones, flint and other rocks that had been exposed to heat.\n\nStep by step\n\nResearchers had previously suggested that Neanderthals could have rendered fat, “but the proof was lacking”, says study co-author Lutz Kindler, a zooarchaeologist at MONREPOS Archaeological Research Centre and Museum for Human Behavioural Evolution in Neuwied, Germany.",

          "title": "Will AI speed up literature reviews or derail them entirely?",
          "authors": "Sam A. Reynolds, Alec P. Christie, Lynn V. Dicks, Sadiq Jaffer, Anil Madhavapeddy, Rebecca K. Smith, William J. Sutherland",
          "abstract": "Over the past few decades, evidence synthesis has greatly increased the effectiveness of medicine and other fields. The process of systematically combining findings from multiple studies into comprehensive reviews helps researchers and policymakers to draw insights from the global literature1. AI promises to speed up parts of the process, including searching and filtering. It could also help researchers to detect problematic papers2. But in our view, other potential uses of AI mean that many of the approaches being developed won’t be sufficient to ensure that evidence syntheses remain reliable and responsive. In fact, we are concerned that the deployment of AI to generate fake papers presents an existential crisis for the field.\n\nWhat’s needed is a radically different approach — one that can respond to the updating and retracting of papers over time.\n\nWe propose a network of continually updated evidence databases, hosted by diverse institutions as ‘living’ collections. AI could be used to help build the databases. And each database would hold findings relevant to a broad theme or subject, providing a resource for an unlimited number of ultra-rapid and robust individual reviews.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire\n\nCurrently, the gold standard for evidence synthesis is the systematic review. These are comprehensive, rigorous, transparent and objective, and aim to include as much relevant high-quality evidence as possible. They also use the best methods available for reducing bias. In part, this is achieved by getting multiple reviewers to screen the studies; declaring whatever criteria, databases, search terms and so on are used; and detailing any conflicts of interest or potential cognitive biases.\n\nScientists are building giant ‘evidence banks’ to create policies that actually work\n\nYet these reviews require considerable resources. Some studies suggest that Cochrane reviews — systematic reviews of specific topics in health care and health policy that meet internationally recognized criteria for the highest standards in evidence-based health care — generally cost more than US$140,000 and take more than two years to complete3,4.\n\nIt is becoming ever harder for review authors to keep up with the rapidly expanding number of papers. The scientific literature is estimated5 to have doubled every 14 years since 1952.\n\nBecause each reviewer tends to have access to different publications, and because databases are continually updated, systematic reviews are plagued by reproducibility issues. A study published last year concludes that only 1% of reviews report a search strategy that is fully reproducible6. Furthermore, many systematic reviews unwittingly cite publications that have been retracted, including those removed from the literature because of methodological or ethical issues and fraud7.\n\nWe agree that AI could be part of the solution to these problems. It could help investigators to conduct reviews more comprehensively and more efficiently — by filtering many more papers, say, or by assessing the entire content of papers instead of just the title and abstract, as human reviewers tend to do as a first step. But one aspect seems to be underappreciated: the degree to which AI — particularly large language models (LLMs) — could exacerbate some of the problems.\n\nAt this point, little is known about how many scientific papers generated entirely by AI are being published. As announced in March, a scientific paper8 generated by AI Scientist (an AI tool developed by the company Sakana AI in Tokyo and its collaborators) passed peer review for inclusion in a workshop at a key AI meeting. The reviewers did not detect that an AI model had formulated the hypotheses, designed and run experiments, analysed the results, generated the figures and produced the manuscript.\n\nPolicymakers in China are using evidence synthesis to guide management of the invasive grass Spartina alterniflora.Credit: SIPA Asia/ZUMA Press/Alamy\n\nAnd a preprint posted on arXiv estimates that at least 10% of all PubMed abstracts published in 2024 were written with the help of LLMs, on the basis that an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain words coincided with widespread access to LLMs9. That proportion has almost certainly gone up since.\n\nDecision makers need constantly updated evidence synthesis\n\nEven if LLMs are used widely, it is difficult to separate cases in which they have been deployed to fabricate papers from those in which authors are simply using them to improve their writing10. Yet generative AI is likely to make the production of fake manuscripts easier, irrespective of whether those who use LLMs maliciously do so to further their careers, to manipulate the conclusions of evidence syntheses because of a specific commercial or policy objective or simply to be disruptive. The use of multiple LLMs will also make it more difficult for humans to detect textual fingerprints associated with one particular model.\n\nIn other words, the use of generative AI is likely to supercharge the already growing problem of paper mills — businesses that sell fake work and authorships to researchers seeking journal publications to boost their careers. It could even replace the paper-mill market, given that fake papers can now be generated in minutes for free.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThe Campbell Collaboration (a group of researchers and policymakers dedicated to generating evidence syntheses for economic and social policy decisions) and Cochrane already provide guidance on how to identify studies that have raised concerns or that have been retracted11. This includes checking studies against the Retraction Watch database, which lists retractions gathered from publisher websites, and using the CENTRAL database, a repository for clinical-trial reports that flags retracted studies11. Cochrane guidance also states that the authors of published reviews containing retracted studies should recalculate all results and, while doing so, flag the review with an editorial note or withdraw it and then publish the updated version11.\n\nEven now, this kind of reanalysis often fails to happen, presumably because the original review authors have limited resources and little incentive. In one assessment of systematic reviews of pharmaceutical compounds tested in clinical trials, retracted papers continued to be cited in 89% of the reviews one year after the review authors had been notified of the retraction7. With the ever-increasing production of both legitimate and spurious scientific literature, researchers’ ability to maintain an accurate picture of what the data show is likely to be outstripped (see ‘More papers, more retractions’).\n\nSource: Data from Open Alex (https://openalex.org/).\n\nSo, what system might enable the continual and rapid removal — at scale — of fraudulent or otherwise problematic papers from databases?\n\nAlthough not developed with this goal in mind, our work on the Conservation Evidence project — an information resource hosted by the University of Cambridge, UK, to support decisions about how to maintain and restore global biodiversity — has convinced us that a network of AI-enabled, continually updated evidence databases is one possible solution.\n\nAs part of this project, all of the authors of this article have been involved in developing subject-wide evidence synthesis. The aim here is to identify literature containing information that is relevant to a broad theme. For the Conservation Evidence project, this is the effectiveness of management actions for biodiversity conservation.\n\nEvidence synthesis needs greater incentives",

Credit: Stan Olszewski/IBM Research/Science Photo Library\n\nQuantum tunnelling — when a particle skips through a barrier that classical physics would forbid — happens faster when objects have less energy, find physicists who worked out a way to probe photons during the process.\n\nThe counter-intuitive result contributes to a long-standing debate about how to define tunnelling time, for which there is no single description, and how fast the process occurs.\n\nThe results also challenge an interpretation of quantum physics known as Bohmian mechanics, which proposes that particles are guided by waves, say the authors, who published their findings in Nature on 2 July1.\n\n“It strikes me as a real experimental tour de force,” says Aephraim Steinberg, a quantum physicist at the University of Toronto in Canada.\n\nTunnelling test\n\nIn classical physics, if a particle reaches a barrier that it doesn’t have the energy to surmount, it bounces back. But in quantum physics, there is a small but non-zero chance that the particle will bulldoze right through. This phenomenon, called quantum tunnelling, has a key role in processes from photosynthesis to radioactive decay, but its precise nature is not well understood.\n\nThe researchers set up an experiment to probe the speed of particles as they tunnel through an energy barrier. They made a waveguide — a mirrored structure that restricts photons’ movement to one direction. By shining a laser at one end of the waveguide, they generated photons that travelled until they met a barrier (a step in the mirrored surface) that their energy should not let them pass.\n\nAt this point, photons tunnelled into the ‘forbidden’ region inside the barrier, while also tunnelling sideways into a second waveguide running inside the barrier parallel to the first. A camera captured a snapshot of particle positions over time. Because the researchers knew how readily photons tunnel between the waveguides, they were able to use the build-up of photons in the second waveguide as a clock against which to judge how fast photons were penetrating the barrier. The experiment seems to be the first of its kind, says Steinberg. “These researchers are able to take a ‘photograph’ and observe the clock readings at all positions within the barrier.”\n\nThe researchers found that the photons with the most negative kinetic energy (values that don’t translate to the classical world but are allowed inside an energy barrier) tunnelled the fastest, says study co-author Jan Klaers, a physicist at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. This is something that is predicted by quantum mechanics, but has been hard to prove experimentally.\n\nThe definition of speed\n\nPhysicists have used a range of techniques and definitions to try to measure tunnelling time and speed2. Steinberg is not ready to fully endorse the Twente team’s definition of tunnelling speed, but says “it’s certainly the most natural and classical-like interpretation”.",

          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates individuals who have fought racism in science and who champion inclusion. The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nIn late 2023, Daisy Rosas Vargas made the gut-wrenching decision to leave what had initially seemed to be a dream job, after years of feeling unsupported as a Latina professor at a small undergraduate university. Rosas Vargas, an organometallic chemist, had always loved teaching, but she felt as if she was withering away, not reaching her full potential.\n\nAs a first-generation university student, she was always taught by her family to keep going, to be grateful to have a steady job and to push things such as mental health to one side. She broke that mould when she put her own health first and left academia.\n\nReflecting on what to do next, she thought about the things she truly enjoyed: teaching, outreach volunteering at a science museum and communication about science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). So when a job opened up at Latinas in STEM, she took a chance. The non-profit organization, founded by Latina alumnae of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, supports the development of Latina schoolchildren and undergraduate students in under-served communities. Now, she leads fundraising for the organization, writes profiles of early-career Latina scientists and coordinates the organization’s efforts to support children affected by the January wildfires in Los Angeles, California.\n\nHow to address gender equity in science in Africa\n\nBased in Pasadena, California, she also serves up dishes with a dose of chemistry on the side, in a YouTube public-engagement series called Chemists in the Kitchen, from the US National Academy of Sciences. Most recently, she helped to develop an accessible course, Real Chem, that connects community college and university students to examples of chemistry in their own lives.\n\n“Even though I’m not in academia any more, that doesn’t mean that the things I’ve learnt can’t be passed on,” she says. Rosas Vargas explains to Nature’s Careers team why she’s now helping to build the support structures for Latina girls and women in STEM that were so badly missing from her academic career.\n\nWhy is diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work important to you?\n\nI grew up in the 1990s with the US educational television programme Bill Nye the Science Guy and cartoons that featured male scientists. I never really saw someone who looked like me. I didn’t meet my first Latina chemist until I was 27, which seems pretty late in life. I think that’s the reason I really care about public outreach, because a child shouldn’t wait that long to meet a role model who is from a similar background.\n\nWhat single thing would you change about how science is done?\n\nI wish there was absolutely mandatory, extensive DEI training for department chairs, provosts and anyone who is an early-career or senior researcher, because many people are not aware of their microaggressions. I’ve heard so many stories from other Latinas in STEM about comments made by professors or someone in authority, such as “you’re not good enough to be in this course” or “you’re not doing well, so just stop asking questions.” That’s just unacceptable.\n\nI want people to be more pro-active and to put action behind their words. It’s not enough to do one online training session and then say you’re anti-racist.\n\nWhat is the biggest misconception or stereotype about Latina people that you’d like to dispel?\n\nPeople think Latinx people, or people with a Latin American background or heritage, aren’t good enough to be in STEM, especially if they went to a publicly funded school or university. If you went to public school, people might assume that your educational experience isn’t on par with private schools or well-funded public-school systems. When I was a professor, I received a negative comment that my teaching style was different and sub-par because I went to a public university for my undergraduate studies. That really stuck with me because it shouldn’t matter where I was taught chemistry, I made it here all the same. Luckily, I didn’t experience those kinds of comments during my undergraduate or graduate studies, like many other Latina people, because that would’ve changed my perspective on things.\n\n‘I saw that discrimination wasn’t hearsay or rumours — it really did exist’\n\nAnother common stereotype is that Latinas talk too loud and we like to cause trouble. I’ve heard stories of this from other Latinas and even saw it in student evaluations of my teaching. But in reality, I’m shy and very quiet. Sometimes I think maybe I shouldn’t speak out about the discrimination I see or experience. I was raised to always listen to authority and respect my elders, so I used to remain quiet when things felt off.\n\nBut now, I’m not afraid to speak out about injustices or discrimination. That’s not ‘making trouble’ because I’m speaking out not only for myself, but also for the people coming after me. Now, in the United States, a lot of places are getting rid of DEI programmes and I think it’s time for us to actually be even louder. There’s a lot of work for us to do.\n\nWhat is your best piece of advice to a 20-something researcher in your field?\n\nI would tell younger chemists and people who aspire to be professors to look out for red flags. If something feels off at a workplace, don’t dismiss that. Ask for better and put yourself first if you’re not receiving what you deserve. People might say they want diversity, but are they willing to do the work to retain people from diverse backgrounds?",

          "authors": "Chelsea Haramia, Émilie A. Laflèche, Julia De Marines, Michael L. Wong",
          "abstract": "“Mars is a failed Earth.” It is common enough to hear such perspectives expressed in reference to our planetary neighbour’s lack of Earth-like qualities, including a thick atmosphere, plate tectonics, oceans and a biosphere. As far as we know, the surface of Mars is hostile to and devoid of life — and so is most of outer space.\n\nNow would be a good time to reconsider this attitude. We are at a pivotal moment in the history of space exploration. Over the past several decades, the search for extraterrestrial life has shifted from the idle anticipation of technologically advanced aliens contacting or visiting Earth to the active development of scientific missions that seek signs of such life, in the Solar System and beyond. Numerous ongoing and upcoming missions have been tasked with searching for signs of habitability and life in the cosmos1,2, presaging what could be a golden age of astrobiology — the study of alien life. Meanwhile, the rising influence of private space corporations is bringing human space flight into a new, commercially driven age. Using technologies developed by companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, US astronauts aim to head once more to the Moon as part of NASA’s Artemis programme, which could act as a stepping stone for missions to Mars and beyond. Other countries, including China, have similar ambitions, or might develop their own programmes.\n\nEthics in outer space: can we make interplanetary exploration just?\n\nAs human influence extends farther, broader ethical guidelines are needed for the exploration and treatment of extraterrestrial environments and phenomena. Rarely is any value ascribed to what space contains beyond the purely instrumental — how it furthers our knowledge of the cosmos or boosts human ambitions. Here, we argue that assessing what deserves our moral consideration in outer space requires a more expansive set of factors that can contribute to moral value than those that have generally been applied through our current, terrestrially based thinking. That, in turn, must inform how we set about exploring space — and preserving what we find there.\n\nWhat is moral value?\n\nAs moral agents, humans have a general obligation to respect what is morally valuable. When considering questions about moral value, a distinction has conventionally been made between an object’s instrumental value (its worth as a means to an end for something else) and its intrinsic value (its value for its own sake). Most ethicists would say that objects that have only instrumental value do not have moral value. In this way of thinking, humans are generally considered hugely intrinsically valuable; our mere existence should be enough for us to feel obliged to treat each other well. By contrast, money is only instrumentally valuable, because its worth is derived solely from its use in human–human exchanges; it does not deserve moral consideration for its own sake. Objects can have multiple forms of value at once: a tree, for instance, might be considered intrinsically valuable as a living thing, but also instrumentally valuable as a source of food, oxygen, lumber and shade.\n\nHow to distinguish intrinsic value from instrumental value has been debated for millennia. In Western analytical philosophy (in contrast, it must be said, to many other conventions), an uncompromising ‘biocentric’ cut-off is sometimes imposed3: being alive is almost always a prerequisite for moral consideration. Within that boundary, many ethicists following the Western convention have taken a stratified approach, basing conditions for a moral consideration on mental attributes such as rationality, autonomy and sentience. Sentientism focuses on a being’s ability to experience certain types of welfare change that other entities can’t. For example, it is now widely acknowledged that lobsters can feel pain, spurring some countries to ban boiling them alive. By contrast, ratiocentrism proposes that only rational creatures — those with the capacity to act through reasoning rather than only on instinct — should be given moral consideration.\n\nEven though it seems to be devoid of life, the rocky terrain of Mars contains much that might be worth preserving.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Del-4Ri\n\nSuch accounts can reinforce a hierarchical view of intrinsic value, with humans either placed at the pinnacle or given preference. Some philosophers, for example, have argued4 that animals other than humans that are ‘sophisticated’ enough to participate in human society (such as dogs and horses) or to be social themselves (chimpanzees and bonobos, for instance) sit just below humans in this hierarchy. Beings that do not display signs of neurological sentience, such as plants and microorganisms, occupy the bottom rung.\n\nThis ‘life bias’5 in approaches to moral value has limitations when looking further afield. Our planet, with its abundance and diversity of life, is special in some ways, as far as we know. Outer space, by contrast, is devoid of life and of sentient, rational beings — or at least those parts of outer space that we are likely to explore on any reasonable timescale seem to be. But it is a leap in reasoning from seeing that Earth is special to concluding that only Earth is special, and that there is little, if anything, of moral value in outer space.\n\nWhy space exploration must not be left to a few powerful nations\n\nWe argue that a one-dimensional hierarchy of moral value misses the interconnected webs of nature’s generative forces. More-over, it fails to acknowledge that many entities — living and inanimate, sentient and non-sentient, rational and irrational — can express several forms of value at once. In the case of space exploration, it misses the important possibility that inanimate entities and extraterrestrial systems can have tremendous moral value; certainly, we have yet to see proof that they don’t.\n\nSimilarly, although the instrumental value of outer-space environments to future human activities is widely acknowledged, focusing only on the distinction between intrinsic and instrumental value means we might miss or ignore other aspects that might contribute to moral value. For example, hydrothermal activity interacting with a hypothetical alien ecosystem on an ice-covered ocean world — say on Jupiter’s moon Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus — could generate a new kind of systemic value that ought to factor into ethical decisions regarding the exploration of such environments.\n\nA new taxonomy of moral value\n\nOur expanded taxonomy of moral value encompasses six overlapping and nested categories that can all contribute to an object’s overall moral value, in distinct ways and to various degrees. Intrinsic and instrumental values remain, but we augment them with the following categories: relational value, innate value, systemic value and rarity value (see ‘Overlapping sources of moral value’).\n\nSource: C. Haramia et al.\n\nIntrinsic value. This category remains defined essentially as the worth that objects have by dint of their own attributes. It has been noted6 that this can lead to varying delineations of the term’s precise meaning: as non-instrumental value; as value solely on the basis of an entity’s intrinsic properties, ignoring its relationships to anything else; or as an objective value possessed independently of any assessor. In this analysis, we take intrinsic value to encompass the first and third of these qualities: it is an objective property, independent of instrumental value.\n\nInnate value. We define this type of value as a subset of intrinsic value. It is possessed by ostensibly discrete entities independently of any relationships to anything else, and so ticks all three boxes of the above-mentioned definitions of intrinsic value. Recognizing innate value begins with acknowledging the projective nature of the cosmos — how nature produces its own ‘projects’ through its incessant inventiveness and constructiveness7. Life, as a product of evolution, is an obvious example of this kind of value, but this projective integrity extends to inanimate entities, too. Take space environments such as Valles Marineris, Mars’s canyon system, which is the largest known in the Solar System; or the huge icy basin of Sputnik Planitia on Pluto and the cryovolcanic ‘tiger stripes’ on Enceladus. These phenomena can be regarded as innately valuable because of their aesthetic properties, their structural complexity or other factors. Everything we encounter in space is a product of cosmic evolution and therefore might, to some degree, have innate value. Our ethical considerations must acknowledge this.\n\nTrump wants to put humans on Mars — here’s what scientists think\n\nRelational value. This value is distinct from the intrinsic and innate ones. It encapsulates the value that can be produced by distinct entities through their interactions, such as those between an author and a reader, a child and a parent, a forest and its resident animals or a star and an orbiting planet. We contend that such relations can be morally valuable independently of the value status of the relation’s members. Most people would readily acknowledge that a relationship between two humans can produce value distinct from and not reducible to the value of the two individuals, who also exist in and of themselves. But the same is less obviously true for a whole host of other relations: the relationships between predator and prey that result in ecosystem stability; symbiotic ones, such as those between algae and fungi that create lichen; or the one between silicate weathering and the removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide on a terrestrial planet8. On Earth, such relations can also have instrumental value to humans, by creating the conditions that allow us to thrive.\n\nInstrumental value. In our scheme, this is a subset of relational value: instrumentally valuable phenomena produce positive effects for the things or people they affect. We contend that instrumental value can be indirectly connected to moral value through its relations to things of intrinsic value. Lunar ice deposits possess instrumental value as a source of water (and, after hydrolysis, oxygen and rocket fuel) for crewed missions to the Moon and beyond; these resources could factor into moral considerations because they might contribute to the welfare of intrinsically valuable human explorers. Instrumental value is therefore relevant to questions about moral value when considering the real-world activity of astro-biological exploration and the interconnected possibilities of scientific searches.\n\nThe rings of Saturn and its moon Enceladus have great intrinsic aesthetic value — and perhaps other sources of moral value, too .Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SSI/CICLOPS/Kevin M. Gill\n\nSystemic value. This is generated when relational aspects factor into intrinsic value. It manifests in the systemic processes of entities interacting with each other and their environments. These are complex processes, not mere two-part relations. They have a kind of intrinsic value that cannot simply be reduced to a sum of the innate values of the system’s members, or even to what emerges from their distinct relations. Systemic value emerges when relationships have systemic integrity, generative or regenerative abilities, or an evolutionary potential. Ecosystems have systemic value, but so, too, can tightly interwoven inanimate processes8. Systemic value lies at the intersection of intrinsic and relational values, because it describes how dynamic systems comprising many interacting components can be valuable as a single entity and as a total that is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nRarity value. This value, rating the uniqueness of an entity, is another way in which relational value can measured. For instance, a storm on Jupiter, a mountain on Mars or a human life are all rare, given the low occurrence of similar phenomena in the known Universe. The moral value this produces cannot be reduced to the entity’s innate nature, because innate value is considered independently of the value of other objects.",

The results of the survey were presented at a press conference on 16 June.\n\n“The data clearly show that changing one’s surname can cause significant disadvantages,” says Misa Shimuta, a neuroscience researcher at the Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, who was involved in the survey.\n\nEarlier this year, Japan’s main opposition party put forward a bill proposing that married couples be allowed to retain their own family names after marriage. A proposal to change the rule, which has been in place for more than a century, was debated in the National Diet — Japan’s legislative body — last month, but a decision has been pushed to later in the year. In practice, the current rule mainly affects women — 95% of married women in Japan legally change their name to their husband’s.\n\nResearcher survey\n\nIn response to the proposal to change the rule and other lobbying efforts, the Japan Inter-Society Liaison Association Committee for Promoting Equal Participation of Men and Women in Science and Engineering (an association representing about 100 academic societies working on gender equality) surveyed academics to try to understand how the current law affects them, says Noriko Sato, a forest-policy researcher at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, who led the survey.\n\nThe team collected responses from 7,582 academics, of whom roughly one-third were women, between April and May. Just over 5% of the 3,810 married men who responded had changed their name after marriage, but more than 90% of the 1,506 married women had changed their name. Of those who had changed their name, more than 70% continued to use their original name at work, a practice that has become increasingly popular.\n\nOf those who used their original family name at work, 78% said that even doing that caused issues.\n\nPersonal experience\n\nKyoko Ohno-Matsui, an ophthalmologist at the Institute of Science Tokyo, was born Matsui and married an Ohno, and uses the double-barrelled name in her professional life. “I didn’t want to change my surname,” she says.

When she attends conferences abroad, where she is known as Ohno-Matsui, she often has trouble checking into hotels because her passport details don’t match those provided by the conference organizers.",

In Norway, fears that English was pushing out Norwegian in some academic departments led to stricter language requirements for research staff last year. And in the Netherlands, courses taught in English are being restricted and regulated.\n\nThis shift reflects deeper changes in European politics, with nationalist far-right parties gaining ground and entering parliaments in nearly every European Union country over the past decade. Not all those who oppose internationalization in higher education are motivated by nationalist ideology, but the practice is increasingly colliding with immigration policies, says Vassiliki Papatsiba, a higher-education policy specialist at Cardiff University, UK. “Universities find themselves caught between these pressures, trying to maintain international openness and competitiveness while responding to domestic political concerns.”\n\nDutch reforms spark academic pushback\n\nConsider the Netherlands. In 2024, the Dutch government proposed the Internationalisation in Balance bill, requiring that Dutch be the default language for teaching in bachelor’s programmes. The policy emerged from a coalition government led by the right-wing populist Party for Freedom (PVV), and drew strong criticism from the academic sector, which was already reeling from large budget cuts the year before.\n\nThe government’s stated reasons for cutting back on programmes taught in English were to address housing shortages in university cities by reducing international-student numbers; to ensure accessibility for Dutch students; and to safeguard public investment in higher education by focusing on domestic students, who were viewed as more likely to stay and work in the country.\n\nBut Eddie Brummelman, chair of the Young Academy, part of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, says that whatever the validity of those concerns, “the extent to which internationalization causes or contributes to these problems is often exaggerated, conflated with other issues or unsupported by facts”. The bill has caused international staff and students to feel “ostracized, ridiculed and scapegoated”, he says, and is causing both Dutch and international staff to consider leaving the country. “They don’t want to work in an environment that goes against internationalization, which is so vital for well-functioning academia.”\n\nBrummelman’s organization also slammed a proposal to end English-taught bachelor’s degrees in psychology at five universities. This had been made in April by Universities Netherlands, the umbrella body for the country’s 14 research universities. In a 27 May statement, Brummelman’s Young Academy called the package “a harmful act of anticipatory obedience”, saying it would legitimize the negative narrative around English-language programmes.\n\nOn the same day, partial relief came when the Dutch House of Representatives passed a motion that removes one of the most damaging elements of the Internationalisation in Balance bill: a mandatory assessment of all English-taught bachelor’s courses that would have forced them to be taught in Dutch unless a strong justification for another language could be made. The collapse of the Dutch government on 3 June, prompted by the withdrawal of the PVV from the interim government, further adds to the uncertainty.\n\n“There’s a genuine case to be made for preserving or promoting Dutch as an academic language,” Brummelman says, “but that should never come at the cost of internationalization.”\n\nNorway reverses course after outcry\n\nNorway has faced a similar reckoning. In August 2024, the country implemented a law requiring all international PhD students and postdocs to complete a Norwegian language course equivalent to three months of part-time study, and tightening language requirements for permanent staff. The measure was introduced in 2023 by a coalition government that also brought in tuition fees for non-European students. Supporters of the policy said it would protect Norwegian as a language of scholarship.\n\nBut the backlash was immediate. Prominent scientists, including Nobel-prizewinning neuroscientist Edvard Moser, warned that the requirement would deter international researchers. The PhD and postdoc proposal was especially unpopular, given the numbers involved: in 2022, for example, 44% of PhD candidates and 74% of postdoctoral fellows at Norwegian institutions came from abroad. A legal challenge, filed in December 2024, argued that the policy violated European Economic Area labour laws.\n\nThe political winds shifted again in early 2025, when Norway’s EU-sceptic Centre Party, which was behind the language drive, left the government over disagreements with its coalition partners about energy policy. As part of that shift, the minister of research from the Centre Party quit. His successor, the Labour Party’s Sigrun Aasland, announced plans to reverse the language requirement for PhDs and postdocs, a move researchers hailed as a victory for international science. It remains unclear whether related rules for permanent academic staff — such as the requirement to reach a high level of Norwegian proficiency in three years — will also be revoked.\n\nNorwegian university leaders have since been advocating a “new deal” on internationalization to rebuild the country’s global competitiveness. Norway’s experience “demonstrates how language requirements and other things like fees can become powerful instruments in broader debates about national identity and international engagement in higher education”, Papatsiba says.\n\nExternal pressures breed resistance\n\nEstonia offers a contrasting example of how European universities can navigate internationalization pressures without major political controversy.\n\nThe Baltic state’s push for higher-education internationalization took root under a liberal government in the early 2010s, spurred by reforms around 2013 that introduced free Estonian-language tuition but encouraged expansion of English-taught programmes to diversify funding. This led to a nearly fivefold increase in international enrolment, from 2.3% in 2011 to approximately 12.2% in 2019.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has depressed those numbers slightly, as has the war in Ukraine: since the start of the hostilities, Russian students have no longer been accepted for bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Estonian universities, contributing to a 17% drop in foreign students from 2022 to 2024. Nevertheless, English-language teaching remains popular. In a few departments at the University of Tartu, the country’s oldest and largest, almost half the staff members are English-speaking.\n\nEstonia’s internationalization journey could have created conflicts similar to those in the Netherlands and Norway, says Aune Valk, vice-rector of the University of Tartu. Before COVID-19, she says, two-thirds of students did not pay tuition fees, and politicians questioned whether the money spent on subsidizing international students should be redirected to other things, especially given that universities were asking for more money .\n\nThe large numbers of international academic staff have also caused some internal debate in Estonian universities, Valk says. Having lots of foreign staff increases the teaching burden on Estonian-speakers, because any course offered in English must also be offered in Estonian. Although this means that English speakers might have more time for research, Valk says that “quite a big part of your staff is not heard”, because administration and outreach happen mostly in Estonian.",

We consider this a direct targeting of Israeli science and the global enterprise of science that benefits humanity.\n\nAlthough, thankfully, there were no human casualties on campus, more than 50 Weizmann research laboratories, led by world-class scientists doing cutting-edge science, were destroyed either by direct hits or shock waves. The strikes came close to the homes of many scientists and students who live on campus.\n\nNews changes quickly in this part of the world, but as I write these words, I can express gratitude for the ceasefire and hope that it is adhered to.\n\nEscalating Israel–Iran conflict damages science labs\n\nLet me be clear: our institute shares values with many Iranians, including those Iranian scientists living outside Iran with whom we collaborate on live-saving and life-sustaining research. I look forward to the day when Israeli scientists can freely collaborate with scientists in Iran and do good for the region and for humanity. I wish the same for scientists in Gaza and throughout the Middle East.\n\nThis blow comes after 20 months of war in Gaza and southern Lebanon, following the attacks of 7 October 2023 on Israel by Hamas. We continue to grieve the loss of life on both sides. We remain deeply distressed by the ongoing war in Gaza, the hostage crisis and the Palestinian humanitarian crisis.\n\nOver the course of history and the many wars in our region, science has endured. We at Weizmann are facing challenges head-on and continuing in our mission as we always have: by advancing science that protects and sustains life, and doing so through international collaboration with colleagues regardless of their identity or nationality.\n\nThe value of science\n\nScience can take on issues that know no geographical borders. At Weizmann alone, life scientists’ discoveries have led to medications for cancer, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases, as well as diagnostic methods such as amniocentesis: a prenatal test to check for genetic or chromosomal conditions in a fetus. Our microbiologists are engaged in solving the urgent problem of antibiotic resistance. And our plant scientists have found ways to engineer crops for improved nutrition and resilience to pests. Other breakthroughs are happening at other Israeli institutions every day, with positive effects worldwide.\n\nDid the US wipe out Iran’s nuclear programme? What researchers know\n\nDespite Israel’s small geographical size and population, the nation has achieved great success in science and technology as a result of its winning combination of academic freedom, curiosity and scientific literacy.\n\nEven as Weizmann recovers from the most difficult moment in its history, I feel strongly that we can be on the starting line of a new era for the region — one in which borders open up and Weizmann and other Israeli institutions can engage with colleagues throughout the Middle East. Our desire is to establish more partnerships with more countries in Middle East and Gulf states, as we did in 2020, when we established a formal collaboration with Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.",

          "abstract": "The immune-system agents called natural killer cells (artificially coloured) can be bioengineered to attack cells that produce dangerous antibodies.Credit: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/National Institutes of Health/Science Photo Library\n\nSupercharged ‘natural killer’ cells could become a potent way to reset a disordered immune system — and thus quench some autoimmune disorders.\n\nResults from two small clinical trials suggest that researchers can engineer natural killer cells — immune cells that destroy infected or diseased cells — to assassinate the renegade cells that produce antibodies against the body’s own tissues. These ‘autoantibodies’ can damage tissues, fuelling autoimmune diseases such as lupus and systemic sclerosis.\n\n“Natural killer cells have evolved to seek and destroy abnormal cells,” says Nadir Mahmood, president of Nkarta, a biotechnology company in South San Francisco, California. “And if that’s deep enough to drive an immune-system reset, then you can have the reconstitution of a healthy and naive immune system.”\n\nFindings from one trial were announced in June at the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Results from the other trial were published in the journal Cell1.\n\nBefore the killers\n\nThis approach has its roots in cancer therapies that rely on another kind of immune cell, called T cells, that can be genetically engineered to recognize and kill tumours. The engineered cells use a protein called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to identify their targets, and are therefore called CAR T cells.\n\nCAR T cells can send some forms of blood cancer into remissions lasting more than a decade, and they have shown early promise against certain autoimmune disorders. But CAR-T-cell therapies on the market now are expensive and complicated to make: each treatment must be manufactured from the recipient’s own T cells.\n\n‘It’s all gone’: CAR-T therapy forces autoimmune diseases into remission\n\nThese factors mean that, at present, only about one-quarter of people in the United States who might benefit from CAR-T-cell cancer therapies can access them, says Katy Rezvani, who studies cell therapy at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “There are five times as many patients with autoimmunity as there are with cancer,” she says. “So how are we ever going to be able to afford these expensive therapies for autoimmune disorders?”\n\nNatural killer cells, however, can be taken from a blood donor and genetically modified to produce ‘CAR NK’ cells, which can be frozen and used to treat multiple people. Rezvani says that her colleagues at MD Anderson can make hundreds of doses of CAR NK cells from a single donation of umbilical-cord blood.\n\nPerfect fit?\n\nThe first trials of CAR NK cells have been in cancer and have had mixed early results, says Mahmood. One possible limitation is that these cells are shorter-lived than are CAR T cells, says Max Qian, chief executive of Rui Therapeutics, a company in Nanjing, China, that is developing CAR-NK-cell therapies. “If the tumour comes back, you need the drug to still be in the body,” he says.\n\nBut the cells’ fleeting presence might not be a problem for treating autoimmune diseases. A brief treatment with CAR NK cells could be enough to wipe out autoantibody production, Qian adds, or a person could receive several doses of the treatment if needed. After that, the immune system could rebuild itself with a fresh population of antibody-producing cells that have not been triggered to make autoantibodies.\n\nCan autoimmune diseases be cured? Scientists see hope at last\n\nLate last year, Nkarta announced that it would end its efforts to make CAR-NK-cell cancer therapies and would instead focus on autoimmune disorders. “It seemed like CAR-NK-cell therapy was tailor-made for autoimmune disease,” says Mahmood.",

          "authors": "N. G. Boeck",
          "abstract": "Catherina Becker (centre) says it’s key for leaders to give their teams breathing space when ‘something momentous’ happens in the world.Credit: Anja Bretschneider\n\nIn June 2016, neurobiologist Catherina Becker witnessed at first hand how a contentious national issue could affect the members of her laboratory group. The United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, triggering the process known as Brexit, was divisive. Becker, then director of the Centre for Neuroregeneration at the University of Edinburgh, UK, found herself navigating the fine line between acknowledging her group’s distress at the vote’s possible implications for their careers and families, and keeping the lab’s day-to-day research on track.\n\nBecker, who was very active in the anti-Brexit movement before the vote, admits to strong feelings when she learnt of the result. “I was a bit non-directorial,” Becker admits. “I may have cussed a bit.”\n\nBut she also had to acknowledge the issue in her group. “It did come up,” she says. “It is difficult to navigate, because you have to respect people’s views. There were probably a couple of people who were pro-Brexit for various reasons. And you can’t roll over them,” she says. “So, while I expressed my opinion, I offered solidarity with everyone, hopefully.”\n\nStill, it was a struggle. “It was a rubbish year,” Becker says.\n\n#OpenToWork: how laid-off US scientists are coping with shattered careers\n\nIdeally, research labs should be devoid of pressures from national politics or international conflict: places where students, researchers and technicians keep experiments running and discoveries flowing. Distressing events, however, can affect lab members more than a principal investigator (PI) might realize. In the past few years alone, the global community has had to contend with the fall of US protections for abortion, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the Trump administration’s cuts to research funding — tied to climate, diversity, certain universities and the health of people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+) — to name just a few. Acknowledging the fears of students and staff member and communicating support are powerful leadership and management skills. By knowing how to navigate difficult conversations, PIs can help to ensure their groups feel safe, protected and supported during uncertain times.\n\nBecker, who is now at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, says it’s important to allow lab members to express their feelings. “Acknowledge that something momentous has happened,” she says. “And just leave some breathing space and don’t tell people what to feel.” That kind of empathy requires trust, Becker says. In Edinburgh, she established that culture through a Friday lab lunch. It included rollicking 45-minute discussions on topics such as ‘Who’s eaten the most experimental animals?’ — anything except the group’s work.\n\nBecker is one of several PIs around the world who spoke to Nature’s Careers team about strategies for creating safe spaces to discuss world events. Some of these PIs have been recognized by Nature for outstanding mentorship through its annual award for mentoring in science (see go.nature.com/4zrmakc), now in its 20th year. They describe their best strategies for helping lab members to navigate contentious outside events (see ‘Five top tips for difficult group discussions’). Although their experiences might be specific to their location, a common theme emerged: that early-career researchers might feel concern and stress, and might need space and time to express their concerns safely in research environments that, historically, have not always prized personal openness or asking for help.\n\nThese PIs stress that maintaining trust is crucial so that, instead of ignoring the outside world, lab members feel they can speak up when struggling with troubling events.\n\nFive top tips for difficult group discussions\n\n1. Avoid the urge to ignore an unsettling incident in the news, says Peter Scontrino, an organizational psychologist in Seattle, Washington. Remember that the words a group leader says — or doesn’t say — will affect lab members. Even if a contentious issue does not affect you personally, it could land very differently with lab members who have less power or experience.\n\n2. Consider starting a group meeting with supportive words. Scontrino suggests something along the following lines: “I know everyone is probably feeling concerned by what’s happening in the world. I’m feeling frustrated myself. I just want everyone to know that my door is open if you want to talk.”\n\n3. Catherina Becker, a neurobiologist at the Technical University of Dresden in Germany, suggests taking a lab member whom you suspect might be struggling out for an off-campus coffee or tea. Let them know that you care, and that you’re available if needed.\n\n4. Offer continuous support during tumultuous times. Adesola Ogunniyi, a neurologist at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, reassures his lab members that their research will not be hindered by outside events. “I tell them to come and see me so we can discuss it,” Ogunniyi says.\n\n5. Exemplify resilience by investing in your own mental health and speaking openly about it to colleagues. This helps to build an atmosphere of trust and respect so that everyone, from undergraduates to staff scientists, knows that they are valued.\n\nNavigating civil unrest\n\nAdesola Ogunniyi, a neurologist at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, recalls the Occupy Nigeria movement of January 2012. Sparked by government action that more than doubled the price of fuel, Occupy Nigeria led to nationwide protests including sit-down strikes, demonstrations and even attempts to disrupt the electricity grid. These actions presented a huge risk for biomedical labs that need a reliable power supply for freezers and equipment.\n\nNow an emeritus professor, Ogunniyi, a winner of Nature’s 2024 Mentoring in Science award, remembers how he guided his trainees when Occupy Nigeria, and similar protests and labour strikes since then, led to great uncertainty in the academic community.\n\n“We had a lot of these incidents in which education was disrupted,” Ogunniyi says. “Sometimes, you didn’t know when [the] academic year would end, and whether, especially if you had a grant, you would be able to carry out the research.”\n\n“Such challenges can disturb people, both psychologically and in terms of productivity,” he observes. “Sometimes protesters could be quite militant, going from lab to lab, directing people to leave their offices,”\n\nThe Israel–Hamas conflict one year on: researcher resilience in the face of war\n\nOgunniyi’s strategy during difficult times was twofold: to reassure lab members that “nothing lasts forever” and things would return to normal at some point, and to stress that they should continue their research, even if they had to work around the challenges presented by protesters’ actions.\n\nOgunniyi told his group members to keep focused on their work, whether by planning its next phase or by looking at past results to identify aspects that needed improvement or required more experiments. That way, he says, “by the time things return back to normal, they are able to come back, make up for these deficits, and continue”.\n\nOgunniyi says that PIs must nurture the dialogue between mentor and trainees, allowing the trainee to formulate contingency plans during disruptive periods. By giving group members ownership of decision-making, he helps them to develop the leadership skills they will need to flourish in their scientific careers.\n\n“It has to be a two-way affair,” Ogunniyi says of the partnership. It’s not always the lab member asking what to do and the mentor giving them instructions, he notes. “It’s a dialogue. It has to be a feedback process.”\n\n“We must always look for opportunities for growth, so that if one door closes, another one will open” if we are paying attention, he says. “Political situations and socio-economic problems should not stop science.”\n\nBalancing dwindling resources\n\nAndrew Prentice, a maternal and child nutrition researcher and another 2024 award winner, is mentoring his way through a more current international challenge. Prentice directs a group at the Keneba field station, a research and health-care clinic of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Medical Research Council Unit in Gambia. His team depends on research funding from various sources, including the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research.\n\nPrentice’s team is currently absorbing the impact of sudden cuts to science funding by the administration of US President Donald Trump. Perhaps surprisingly, these affect his funding for research in Gambia because the UK government is reallocating resources to places where US funding has been curtailed.\n\nWhile keeping a positive outlook, Prentice is being pragmatic and is encouraging the members of his group to make contingency plans for their careers. It is a delicate balance.\n\nMentoring in science award winner Andrew Prentice.Credit: MRC Unit The Gambia\n\n“We can’t just say to our group members, ‘Oh, don’t worry, we’ll be fine,’” Prentice says. “Our moral responsibility is to say, yes, I think you do need to look for other options” in case funding does not come through.\n\nPrentice says his leadership approach was influenced by the relationship he had with his own mentor in Gambia, Roger Whitehead, a nutritionist who was based there between 1973 and 1998. Prentice recalls long walks on the salt flats near Keneba, on which he and Whitehead talked about their scientific endeavours.\n\nFive years on: how Brexit changed three scientists’ careers\n\nEarlier this year, a PhD student in Prentice’s group was unable to travel to Europe for his thesis defence when his family members’ visa applications were refused — an unusual occurrence, which Prentice says was probably the result of new political pressures on immigration to European countries. In response, Prentice organized a virtual celebration for the student and his family: a show of solidarity in the face of outside events, as well as a gesture of empathy.\n\nPrentice’s advice to PI colleagues is to manage expectations with group members while encouraging them to look for potential solutions, but also to maintain a positive attitude, especially when talking to early-career researchers. “I think we must keep the faith,” Prentice says. “You’ve got to believe that things are going to get better. And we can find interim survival mechanisms to get us through to a better future.”\n\nLeading by example",

It is only the third interstellar object ever spotted in our Solar System, although many others have probably passed unnoticed.\n\nThe object gained an official name, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1, on Wednesday. Moving at a record-setting speed for an interstellar visitor, it is travelling along a curve but not in a closed loop, which offers confirmation that its origin lies outside the Solar System. It will zoom past the Sun without being captured by its gravity.\n\nMost comets and asteroids detected in the Solar System also originated there. Besides the latest visitor, only two other objects — ‘Oumuamua (1I), spotted in 2017, and the comet 2I/Borisov, seen in 2019 — have been acknowledged as being interstellar in origin. The new object, 3I/ATLAS, might be much older than the previous two.\n\n“This is fabulous,” says astronomer Michele Bannister at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. “Working on 1I and 2I were transformational opportunities,” she says, and she expects 3I to be the same.\n\nAt present, 3I/ATLAS is just inside Jupiter’s orbit and is heading towards the Sun. It is expected to zoom closest to Earth’s orbit in October, at a speed of about 68 kilometres per second. A few researchers have seen a tail, hinting that it is venting gas and dust like a comet, rather than behaving like a rocky asteroid, according to the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center.\n\nCaught on camera\n\nThe object was first spotted on 1 July by a telescope in Chile that is part of the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS), a NASA-funded project based at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This system automatically flags potentially interesting objects in the sky for researchers to review. On average, the team reports about one object a day to the Minor Planet Center for follow-up by other astronomers. When ATLAS co-manager Larry Denneau, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii, clicked the button to submit this particular result, he says, “it looked completely garden variety”.\n\nHow two intruders from interstellar space are upending astronomy\n\nBut other astronomers quickly discovered it was anything but. They combed through new and archived data from a range of instruments to find more images of the same object, including some from days or weeks beforehand. These were used to calculate 3I/ATLAS’s trajectory, which revealed that it is on a very wide, open hyperbolic path, rather than orbiting our Sun in an ellipse, confirming that it is an interstellar object not tied by gravity to any star.\n\n“At that point it really hits you, that this little button push you did the night before has created this frenzy, and you have hundreds of astronomers and millions of interested people paying attention to it,” says Denneau.\n\nCloser look\n\nResearchers worldwide will now be turning their telescopes on 3I/ATLAS. It will be visible to observatories on Earth and in space long enough for information to be gathered on its composition, size and shape, as well as how it changes as it is heated by the Sun, all of which “will tell us about what conditions were like in the protoplanetary disk where it formed”, says Bannister.",

          "abstract": "Generative artificial-intelligence tools are increasingly widely available.Credit: Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nAround one in seven biomedical-research abstracts published last year was probably written with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), according to a massive analysis1 of the scholarly literature. More than 200,000 abstracts out of 1.5 million indexed in PubMed in 2024 contained words commonly suggested by large language models (LLMs).\n\nThe study was posted online as a preprint2 in June 2024, when it estimated that one in nine abstracts were written with AI assistance in the first half of last year. The updated analysis is published in Science Advances today1.\n\n“The total number of LLM-edited papers has continued to rise inexorably,” says Andrew Gray, a bibliometrics support officer at University College London. He thinks researchers haven’t fully grasped the scale on which these tools are being used to produce scholarly work. “Hopefully, this paper will help drive some attention to the problem,” he adds.\n\nExcess words\n\nMany groups are trying to assess the impact of LLMs on scholarly output, but it is tricky because most users don’t disclose these practices. Efforts typically train models to identify differences between human-generated and LLM-generated text, and then apply those insights to assess the literature. But it is not clear how such models distinguish between the two types of text, and training data sets don’t always represent up-to-date trends in LLM-generated writing.\n\nDmitry Kobak, a data scientist at the University of Tübingen in Germany, and his colleagues took a more open-ended approach. They searched abstracts for ‘excess words’ that started to appear more often than expected after November 2022, when ChatGPT became widely available. The team was inspired by work estimating ‘excess deaths’ during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe researchers found that 454 words appeared much more often in 2024 than in any other year since 2010. They were mostly ‘style’ words unrelated to the content of the research, and tended to be verbs and adjectives. Some were common — such as ‘findings’, ‘crucial’ and ‘potential’ — whereas others were more unusual, including ‘delves’ and ‘showcasing’. Excess words that emerged in the second half of 2024 include ‘heighten’ and ‘hinder’, as well as superlatives such as ‘unparalleled’ and ‘invaluable’, says Kobak.\n\nShifts in the scientific lexicon happen over time — including drastic changes that accompany major events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020. There were 190 excess words in 2021, and they tended to be nouns related to the content of the research, such as ‘mask’. But the lexical shift that has occurred since LLMs became popular has been even more pronounced, and mainly stylistic.\n\nGeographic differences",

          "abstract": "Rise of the Zombie Bugs\n\nMindy Weisberger Johns Hopkins Univ. Press (2025)\n\nIn horror fiction — which fascinates science writer Mindy Weisberger — a zombie is a human ghost or spirit “somewhere between living and dead, puppeted by external forces”. Her intriguing book, by contrast, explores real zombies in the natural world: organisms that lose control to exploitative parasites. For example, a tropical wasp can stab a cockroach in its brain with chemicals, paralysing it. It is then pulled placidly to a place of burial, where it is eaten alive by the wasp’s young. Humans might also be susceptible to ‘zombie bugs’.\n\nTarget Earth\n\nGovert Schilling MIT Press (2025)\n\nIf Earth had not been the “target of cosmic rubble”, life “would probably never have begun”, says this small, scintillating book on meteorites, asteroids and comets by amateur astronomer Govert Schilling — who has a meteorite named after him. The extinction of the dinosaurs and many other life forms 66 million years ago, he says, cleared the ground for primate evolution. Asteroids probably provided Earth with water and organic molecules, and a giant cosmic collision created the Moon, which stabilized Earth’s axis.\n\nMaya Wisdom and the Survival of Our Planet\n\nLisa J. Lucero Oxford Univ. Press (2025)\n\nThe persistence of Maya culture in Central America, despite centuries of settler colonialism, fascinates archaeologists and anthropologists. “Maya knowledge passed down through the millennia has allowed them to survive, but not at the expense of the environment and its non-human inhabitants,” writes anthropologist Lisa Lucero in her thoughtful book on planetary survival. Maya foreman can locate ancient houses hidden by jungle growth from their vegetation. The Maya had no nature–culture divide.\n\nThe Measure of Progress\n\nDiane Coyle Princeton Univ. Press (2025)",

          "abstract": "China has medical infrastructure and large population to test the efficacy of brain implants.Credit: Chen Zhonghao/Xinhua/Alamy\n\nA deep-brain device that allowed a man with no limbs to play computer games is one of an increasing number of brain–computer interfaces (BCI) being trialled in people in China.\n\nThe BCI system, developed by medical-technology company StairMed in Shanghai, China, is similar to the implants being trialled in people by Neuralink, owned by Elon Musk, based in Fremont, California. StairMed’s device has fewer probes than Neuralink’s device has, but it is smaller and less invasive.\n\nCompared with the United States, China doesn’t have the long history in the field, and many of the devices being trialled there are simplified versions of those developed by US companies, say researchers. But “BCI research in China is developing very fast,” says Zhengwu Liu, an electrical engineer at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nResearchers in China are advancing the field on several fronts, such as by improving algorithms used to decode neural data and the implantation devices, says Christian Herff, a neural engineer at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, who co-organized a meeting on BCI in Shanghai last year.\n\nThe Chinese government has identified brain–computer systems as a priority area of innovation, and funding agencies are pouring money into the field. “A lot of young scientists are involved in this new wave of BCI” in China and have industry ties, says Yuanning Li, a computational neuroscientist at ShanghaiTech University.\n\nThe country also has the medical infrastructure and population to test and validate technologies, says Li. “Progress made here can benefit patients and researchers worldwide,” he says.\n\nSeveral teams have announced initial results for early-stage trials, but none of these has been peer reviewed.\n\nOn the surface\n\nOne brain–computer device being trialled in people is a minimally invasive, wireless device called NEO, which can restore hand movement in a person with paralysis using a pneumatic glove. Eight probes are placed on the dura matter, the outer membrane surrounding the brain2.\n\nThe first person to receive the device, in October 2023, was able to strengthen and speed up their grip, and now, after living with the device for 20 months, can use it to eat and drink, says Hong Bo, a biomedical engineer at Tsinghua University in Beijing, who is co-leading the trial. Hong says that, so far, 20 individuals have received the NEO implant.\n\nBecause the technology collects information about a large population of cells, its signal resolution is not as strong as deeper probes that record the activity of individual neurons, says Zhengtuo Zhao, a neuroengineer at the Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. This makes the approach more appropriate for controlling simple movements, he says. But Hong says the trade-off in performance is that the device is minimally invasiveness and can run for a long time.\n\nThe NEO team has collaborated with Liu and his colleague Jianshi Tang, an electrical engineer at Tsinghua University. In a Nature Electronics paper in February1, they described the use of efficient neuromorphic chips, instead of conventional silicon chips, to mimic how the brain decodes brain signals. This would allow them to integrate the chip in the probe itself and make the device smaller, less power-hungry and quicker to process information.\n\nSpeaking Mandarin\n\nAnother team has dug slightly deeper into the brain. In July 2024, neurosurgeons in Shanghai implanted a device with 256 probes on top of the neural cortex of a woman with epilepsy. After two weeks of practice, she could use the device, designed by Shanghai-based BCI company NeuroXess, to use social-media applications and control a wheelchair.\n\nLast December, the team surgically implanted probes into a woman with epilepsy who had a tumour in a part of her brain that processes language. The recipient used the device to communicate in Mandarin at a rate of 50 words per minute with a 100-millisecond delay — the first time that a BCI technology has been used to decode Mandarin in real time, says Tiger Tao, co-founder and chief scientist of NeuroXess. An average person can speak at a rate of 150 words a minute, so “there’s still a lot of room to improve”, he says.",

Although it is thus conceptually obvious that psychology and geography need one another to fulfil their mandates, integrating them has been empirically challenging. To remedy this, we propose the unifying Geographical–Psychological Interactionist Framework. This framework features three axes (that is, geography, psychology, and geography–psychology interactions). Each axis hosts overarching classes (for example, human, physical and spatial geographical variables) and specific instances thereof (for example, climate and distance). As such, our framework provides: (1) a systematic taxonomy of the general interplay between geography and psychology; (2) a precise vocabulary with which to categorize specific interactions; and (3) a straightforward tool to inspire concrete and testable hypotheses. We conclude by positioning our conceptual framework in relation to existing theories and discuss next steps towards an interdisciplinary future at the nexus of psychology and geography.",

          "abstract": "When scientists search for articles using platforms such as Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science, the results that they see are determined by search algorithms. These algorithms prioritize highly cited papers. On the one hand, this strengthens the association of these papers with corresponding keywords, which helps to surface dominant publications from prevailing disciplines. However, it also narrows exposure to alternative methods, theories or research programmes. Consequently, researchers who explore emerging topics or interdisciplinary problems face diminished chances of discovering relevant but less-cited perspectives.\n\nThese scientific ‘recommender systems’ shape our information environments, and amplify popular items through self-reinforcing feedback loops1. Items that initially gain prominence receive disproportionately greater visibility, and gain popularity simply because they are already popular — regardless of their quality or utility2.

In an iterated learning experiment, we demonstrate that cultural learning adapts in precisely this way: Microcultures more often instruct future generations to follow procedures when the world is stable, but they tend to share information about valuable outcomes and causal relations when the world is variable.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the theoretical and methodological limitations of migration research in understanding gender-specific trends of migration. In particular, theory-driven methods suffer from the gender blindness of migration theories, while data-driven methods suffer from the scarcity of gender disaggregated migration data. This research aims to evaluate how these dual limitations affect the accuracy of commonly used migration prediction models. By analyzing migration flows disaggregated by gender, the study compares the performance of deterministic methods and probabilistic gravity-type models in predicting migrant flows with varying gender compositions. The findings reveal significant differences in the predictive performance of gravity-type models based on the gender composition of migration flows. Drawing on migration theories and case studies, the study contextualizes these findings, concluding that the lack of robust theoretical frameworks and the limited availability of gender-specific migration data have critically undermined the accuracy of current prediction and forecasting methods. The implications of this research highlight the urgent need for a critical reassessment of migration theories and methodologies through the lens of gender biases, paving the way for more inclusive and accurate migration predictions.",

          "abstract": "The study of DNA tumor viruses has revolutionized cancer biology, partly by virtue of the unique capabilities of viral oncoproteins to manipulate key proteins and pathways involved in tumorigenesis. We find a high affinity and selective binding of the polyoma small T antigen (PyST) with the transcription cofactor TAZ. By engineering a degradable version of PyST, we demonstrate that, when TAZ activity is modulated by PyST, a surprisingly small number of genes have altered expression and thus are candidate transcription targets of TAZ. Notably, knocking out TAZ, or its target genes CTGF or CYR61, abolishes the growth-promoting properties of PyST that are evident upon growth factor withdrawal. Therefore, by controlling the protein abundance of PyST and consequently TAZ activity, we find that TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator that can achieve important biological effects by acting on a limited number of gene targets.",

          "abstract": "The cardiac sodium–calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a critical regulator of intracellular calcium (Ca) in cardiomyocytes. Although strongly regulated by pH, the role of NCX1 pH sensitivity in cardiac function and intracellular Ca regulation is not understood. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to produce a pH-resistant NCX1 mouse by replacing histidine 165 with alanine (H165A). H165A mice live into adulthood and are fertile. Comparative studies in isolated ventricular myocytes demonstrated that NCX1 current (I NCX ) was significantly inhibited by lowering pH i to ~6.5 in the wild type (WT) but was unaffected in myocytes from pH-resistant H165A mice. Similarly, in WT cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca indicator fura-2 AM, Ca transient amplitude increased dramatically during field stimulation when pH i was lowered to 6.5, consistent with impaired Ca efflux caused by proton-mediated NCX1 inhibition. In contrast, Ca transients were unchanged by low pH i in H165A myocytes, indicating effective Ca efflux by the mutant exchanger despite acidosis. When we subjected H165A mouse hearts to ischemia/reperfusion, where cellular injury is thought to result in part from Ca accumulation and inhibition of NCX1 by ischemic acidosis, there was reduced injury and improved recovery of function compared to WT. These results reveal that maintaining NCX1 activity during ischemia, and presumably maintaining Ca extrusion, is a powerful approach to protect or precondition the heart against injury that would otherwise occur subsequently during reperfusion. We conclude that allosteric regulation of NCX1 by protons is a highly relevant physiological process that takes place in clinical settings associated with abnormally low pH, such as cardiac ischemia.",

To address this issue, we report herein the direct interaction between thrombin and DNA scaffolds and further, the identification of short tandem repeats of single-stranded (ATTCC) n in NETs that selectively bind thrombin, a crucial enzyme involved in both blood clot formation and immune response. We have also developed a strategy of selective targeting ss(ATTCC) n using antisense locked nucleic acids (LNAs), effectively disrupting NET–thrombin interactions. This finding reveals an unexplored role of single strand DNA (ssDNA) within NETs and provides a broad avenue for developing targeted therapeutic interventions for immunothrombosis-related disorders.",

Using a cohort of ex vivo cultured circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with heavily pretreated breast cancer (n=18), we find distinct patterns of response to DTX, which are intrinsic and independent of past clinical treatment with taxanes. In some CTC cultures, treatment with a single dose of DTX results in complete cell killing, associated with accumulation of nonviable polyploid (≥8 N) cells arising from endomitosis. In other CTC cultures, a transient viable drug-tolerant persister (DTP) population emerges, ultimately enabling renewed proliferation of CTCs with preserved parental cell ploidy and restored DTX sensitivity identical to that of the pretreated culture. In these CTCs, efficient cell cycle exit generates a ≤4 N drug-tolerant state dependent on CDKN1B (p27/kip1). Exposure to DTX triggers stabilization of CDKN1B through AKT-mediated phosphorylation at serine 10. Suppression of CDKN1B reduces the number of persister CTCs, increases ≥8 N mitotic cells and abrogates regrowth after DTX exposure. Thus, CDKN1B-mediated suppression of endomitosis contributes to the initiation of a reversible drug-tolerant persister state following mitotic inhibitors in advanced patient-derived breast cancer cells.",

          "abstract": "Sliding friction between two dry surfaces is commonly described by the speed-independent Amonton–Coulomb friction force law. However, there are many situations where multiple frictional contact points between two surfaces are “active” and each can move at a different relative speed. Here, we study the sliding friction properties of a system with multiple active contacts each with independent and controllable speed. We demonstrate that multiple active contacts can produce controllable speed-dependent sliding friction forces, despite each individual contact exhibiting a speed-independent friction. We study in experiment a rotating carousel with ten speed-controlled wheels in frictional contact with the ground. We first vary the contact speeds and demonstrate that the equilibrium system speed is the median of the active contact speeds. Next we directly measure the sliding friction forces and observe how the contact speeds can control the force–speed curve of the system. In the final experiments, we demonstrate how control of the force–speed curve can create sliding friction with a controllable effective viscosity and controllable sliding friction coefficient. Surprisingly, we are able to demonstrate that frictional contacts can create near frictionless sliding with appropriate force–speed control. By revealing how active contacts can shape the force–speed behavior of dry sliding friction systems, we can better understand animal and robot locomotion and furthermore open up opportunities for new engineered surfaces to control sliding friction.",

          "abstract": "CDK12 primarily functions as a transcription regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) that controls mRNA elongation, splicing, and polyadenylation. The CDK12 gene is implicated in human cancers since it is frequently mutated and/or deleted in prostate and ovarian cancer but paradoxically amplified in breast cancer. Here, we demonstrate that CDK12 promotes serine-933 phosphorylation of DNA2, a nuclease/helicase critical for replication fork stress regulation, and the phosphorylation subsequently facilitates DNA2 polyubiquitination and degradation mediated by the APC/C CDC20 E3 ubiquitin ligase. CDK12 inactivation induces but amplification suppresses genome-wide expression of interferon response and antigen processing and presentation machinery genes in ovarian and breast cancer cells, respectively. Besides causing aberrant DNA2 stabilization, replication stress, genomic instability, and cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) accumulation, CDK12 loss also triggers cGAS–STING activation and innate immune response, which can be reversed by forced expression of replication protein A (RPA) subunits or DNA2 depletion. Our findings identify DNA2 as a phosphorylation substrate of CDK12, connecting CDK12 to cell cycle regulation. These data also reveal DNA2 protein destruction as a critical mechanism that dictates genomic instability, cGAS–STING signaling activation, and innate immune response in CDK12-deregulated cancers.",

Multiprincipal element alloys offer promising opportunities for optimizing this process, yet their vast compositional space and the presence of local minima pose significant challenges for experimental and AI-driven exploration. To overcome these challenges, an AI framework is developed by integrating Gaussian Process Regression with a configuration entropy–based acquisition function for screening and a design of experiments (DoE) for data-efficient overpotential mapping. Through Bayesian optimization across 16.2 million chemical compositions, this entropy-screened and DoE dataset–trained AI identifies Fe 12 Co 28 Ni 33 Mo 17 Pd 5 Pt 5 as the best composition for water splitting within its search space. The alloy exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 24 mV for hydrogen evolution and 204 mV for oxygen evolution at 10 mA·cm −2 with robust stability, surpassing state-of-the-art non-noble and noble metal electrocatalysts including Pt/C+IrO 2 , Pt 35 Ru 65 , and Ru–VO 2 —demonstrating remarkable performance beyond reach by contemporary experimental and AI frameworks.",

          "abstract": "In chemotaxis, motile bacteria recognize external molecules and move toward favorable concentrations. Chemoreceptors form complexes that perform transmembrane signaling, control a histidine kinase, and undergo posttranslational adaptational modifications. Chemoreceptors are thought to function by switching between two signaling states: kinase-off, favored by ligand occupancy, and kinase-on, favored by adaptational modification. Many structural and biochemical features of the two states have been identified, but little is known about the equilibrium between them and the response of that equilibrium to signaling inputs. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer, we monitored helical separations in the Escherichia coli aspartate chemoreceptor Tar for the two pairs of helices that form the cytoplasmic four-helix coiled coil bundle. Rather than the commonly assumed switch between two conformations in response to signaling inputs, we identified two separations in each helical pair that were present under all conditions but with variation in relative occupancy. Ligand occupancy and adaptational modification were found to differentially impact the conformational equilibria, rather than reversing the same conformational response, as previously thought. Ligand occupancy changed symmetrical packing in the four-helix bundle into rhomboid packing, whereas adaptational modification determined which helical pair was central in the rhombus. Thus, the structural consequence of ligand binding was not stabilization of a specific helical conformation but instead the collective geometry of all helices in the bundle. Such changes in helical geometry may play a role in conformational signaling by other transmembrane receptors.",

We demonstrate that MPA treatment reproducibly inhibits the replication of a range of viruses, including severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistically, we identified cellular guanosine triphosphate pool depletion as a key mediator of this antiviral effect. Strikingly, this inhibition can be overcome which was correlated with the emergence of three breakthrough mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (S P812R, ORF3 Q185H, and E S6L). Subsequent analyses confirmed that the combination of these mutations conferred accelerated replication kinetics, higher viral titers, and more rapid onset of cytopathic effects, but not MPA resistance. Comparison of global transcriptional responses to infection highlighted dysregulation of specific cellular gene programs under MPA treatment prior to breakthrough mutation emergence. Together, these findings identify viral and host drivers of variant emergence under immunosuppression. They also advocate for close monitoring of immunosuppressed patients, where emergence of novel viral variants with a fitness advantage may arise.",

While significant advances have been made in the management of low-grade cancer, treatment of advanced HNSCC remains challenging. Here, we used a proteomic approach to find binding partners of the oncogene p63, the most frequently amplified transcription factor in HNSCC. We identified a zinc finger protein, ZNF148, which is coexpressed and physically binds p63 in carcinoma cells. Genome occupancy analyses identified a functional transcribed enhancer-derived RNA (eRNA) upstream of the CCND1 gene occupied by both factors. Mechanistically, p63 and ZNF148 control transcription of this eRNA, leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 to reinforce tumor cell proliferation. Importantly, this axis is specific for cancer cells and remains inactive in normal epithelial cells. The expression levels of these factors and the eRNA are positively correlated in cancer and associated with advanced stage and metastasis. Collectively, our data reveal a molecular pathway controlling HNSCC progression and identify potential selective targets for cancer treatment.",

          "abstract": "Single-domain antibodies, such as variable heavy domain of heavy chain (VHH) domains from camelids, are an attractive platform for therapeutic purposes. VHHs have a smaller size than traditional antibodies, which harbors certain advantages such as tissue penetration or accessing epitopes that may be shielded by protein domains. However, the smaller size of VHHs typically involves a smaller binding site, which can limit the scope of related antigens they are able to bind and, in the specific case of antiviral VHHs, render them susceptible to escape by a single point mutation. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental protein engineering approach to broaden the reactivity of SARS-CoV-1 receptorbinding domain (RBD)-specific VHH-72 for SARS-CoV-2 and Delta. Our strategy focuses on increasing the size of the binding site by imparting “second site” interactions toward heterologous antigens. We utilized the residue-based pharmacophore modeling approach, Protein-ligandinterface design (ProtLID), to identify potential productive side chain interactions in this second site and then encoded the ProtLID-predicted restricted diversity into a VHH-72-based phage library, which we then screened for cross-reactive SARS-CoV-1/2 RBD clones. Based on sequence analysis from the resulting population of functional VHH clones, we identified a VHH-72 triple mutant (T60P.D61P.D100eY), which maintained high affinity for SARS-CoV-1 RBD but was enhanced by 18- and 20-fold for RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and Delta relative to WT VHH-72. These results highlight the potential of computationally customizing phage display diversity for single-domain binding proteins and provide a strategy for designing extension of protein binding interfaces.",

          "abstract": "Mechanical forces are ubiquitous and essential during vertebrate development, yet how these forces are translated into biochemical signals and regulate development during postnatal organogenesis remains poorly understood. While early embryogenesis relies on cell-autonomous mechanotransduction, the role of sensory innervation—abundant in postnatal stages—has been overlooked. Here, using the postnatal mouse molar development model, a system experiencing sustained mechanical forces and extensive innervation during tooth root formation, we first identify a subpopulation of Piezo2 + mechanosensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglia and reveal these neurons specifically detect tooth root-associated mechanical forces and orchestrate tooth root development via paracrine signaling. Critically, we show that Piezo2 in neurons—not in dental cells—is essential for tooth root morphogenesis, revealing sensory neurons as unexpected master regulators of mesenchymal cell fate. Mechanistically, Piezo2 activation triggers the calcium-dependent secretion of platelet-derived growth factor A, defining the neuronal mechanotransduction pathway that directly converts force into biochemical signals to drive organogenesis. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that Piezo2 + mechanosensory neurons primarily orchestrate mechanical-force-regulated processes during postnatal development. The identification of the PIEZO2–calcium–PDGF axis provides important insight into mechanotransduction by introducing sensory neurons as active architects of tissue development. This work establishes a paradigm in developmental biology, revealing how mechanosensation bridges biomechanics and neurobiology to regulate postnatal organogenesis, with implications for tissue regeneration strategies.",

Cost-effective and chronically safe disease-modifying therapeutics are needed to address the AD medical emergency worldwide. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms of Aβ 42 -induced cytotoxicity and to investigate clinically relevant aminosterols, we study the impact of claramine on the aggregation kinetics and properties of Aβ 42 aggregates, as well as the ability of these proteotoxic species to bind and disrupt cell membranes. Whereas previously studied aminosterols accelerated Aβ 42 aggregation, we show that claramine potently inhibits Aβ 42 amyloid fibril formation. We find that claramine stabilizes soluble Aβ 42 , speeding up primary and secondary nucleation into species with antiparallel β-sheet structure that are elongation incompetent, thereby depleting Aβ 42 monomers from the aggregation reaction. This steroid–polyamine also dissociates Aβ 42 fibrillar aggregates, resulting in the abrogation of the autocatalytic capacity of Aβ 42 fibrils, and it also inhibits the aggregation of a tau fragment relevant to AD. Upon exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to stabilized Aβ 42 oligomers, claramine effectively neutralized Aβ 42 oligomer-induced cytotoxicity by preventing their binding to cell membranes. Owing to the unique mechanism of action of aminosterols to reduce the toxicity of soluble Aβ 42 aggregates by protecting cell membranes, and the newly characterized ability of claramine to inhibit Aβ 42 fibril formation and dissociate fibrillar Aβ 42 resulting in the interruption of the positive feedback loop in Aβ 42 aggregation, our findings further emphasize the relevance of this family of natural products as potential treatments for AD and other protein misfolding diseases.",

Tracing revealed that CGRP neurons in the SPFp (CGRP SPFp ) receive projections from the dorsal horn. Increased calcium activity was observed in CGRP SPFp neurons during mechanical, thermal, and inflammatory stimuli. Genetic silencing of these neurons resulted in reduced pain responses in animals. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of CGRP SPFp neurons induced aversive memory but did not alter mechanical or thermal pain thresholds.

By treating spectral measurements as sequences rather than image channels, SpecTf learns fundamental physical relationships without relying on spatial context. Our experiments demonstrate that SpecTf significantly outperforms the current baseline approach implemented for the Earth surface Mineral dust source InvesTigation (EMIT) instrument, and performs comparably with other machine learning methods with orders of magnitude fewer learned parameters. Critically, we demonstrate SpecTf’s inherent interpretability through its attention mechanism, revealing physically meaningful spectral features the model has learned.

          "abstract": "Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) pollution is an environmental problem of global concern because overenrichment of water bodies increases phytoplankton biomass and ecosystem metabolism, depletes oxygen in bottom waters, and increases the frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms. These responses to nutrient pollution have motivated policies to reduce anthropogenic nutrient inputs. However, these policies have not been universally implemented and their success at reducing phytoplankton biomass is confounded by other components of global change that regulate the conversion of nutrients into biomass. These regulating processes themselves are changing in the Anthropocene. Our study is an assessment of changing phytoplankton biomass over the period 2000–2019, using chlorophyll a trends measured in 191 lakes and 159 estuarine-coastal sites. Our results show that phytoplankton biomass has decreased in most lakes, increased in most coastal sites, and the largest trends have been predominantly negative for lakes and positive for coastal sites. These results provide evidence of opposing directions of phytoplankton biomass change between lakes and coastal sites in this recent period of unprecedented global change. Nutrient pollution is a knotty environmental problem, and our study indicates that it might be a particularly challenging problem for ecosystems situated in densely populated landscapes where freshwater and sea water meet. Success at overcoming this challenge will require deeper scientific understanding of changes in processes that regulate the conversion of nutrients into phytoplankton biomass, substantial investments of time and resources to reduce nutrient inputs, and a flexible strategy designed to anticipate and adapt to a changing world.",

While traditionally assumed to be energetically inexpensive for fishes with a swim bladder, the metabolic costs and morphological factors influencing postural stability during hovering remain poorly understood. Hovering requires fishes to counteract small instabilities in position and orientation, often through continuous adjustments using their fins and body. To examine the energetic consequences of this active stabilization, we measured body posture, fin kinematics, and metabolic rates in 13 near-neutrally buoyant fish species during both hovering and resting. Our results show that hovering nearly doubles metabolic rates compared to resting, and species with greater separation between the center of mass and center of buoyancy and increased caudal fin activity exhibit higher energetic costs. In contrast, species with more posteriorly positioned pectoral fins and lower length-to-depth ratios show reduced hovering costs. Our findings demonstrate that, despite morphological traits that promote instability, fishes maintain posture and position through fine-scale fin control—at a significant energetic expense. This study suggests that hovering is a costly behavior that likely plays a key role in shaping the evolution of fish morphology and locomotor strategies.",

          "abstract": "The fossil record provides the most powerful evidence of large-scale biodiversity change on Earth, but it does so at coarse and often idiosyncratic temporal scales. One critical problem that arises concerns the evolutionary consequences of individual environmental experience. Individuals respond to their environment instantaneously, whereas the resolution of most fossil records aggregates multiple paleoenvironments over time scales beyond individual lifespans. Therefore, the presence of phenotypic plasticity in deep time and the extent of its influence on macroevolution remain poorly understood. Using coupled computed tomography and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry protocols, we studied the environmental dependence of developmental trajectories across three sister species of macroperforate planktonic foraminifera. A foraminiferal shell preserves all stages of the individual’s ontogeny, as well as the environmental state experienced throughout its lifetime. Generalized additive mixed effect (GAMM) models show that somatic growth rates differ among the three Menardella species and that these are inversely correlated with calcification temperature, as reconstructed from Mg/Ca measurements through ontogeny. This environmental dependence varies among species: The thermal sensitivity of individual chamber-to-chamber growth rates of Menardella limbata and Menardella pertenuis is double that seen in Menardella exilis . In contrast, no such environmental signal was recovered for architectural shape traits. Our integrated approach is widely applicable and demonstrates that detecting developmental plasticity in the fossil record is feasible. Extrapolating these techniques in deep time promises to revolutionize our understanding of the ways in which environmentally associated trait variation drove the diversification of life on Earth.",

Here, we identified an 18.6 kDa heat shock protein gene ( TaHSP18.6 ) through combining a transcriptome analysis and a genome-wide association study. We verified the positive role of TaHSP18.6 in regulating wheat FCR resistance using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutants and genetic transformation. Next, we screened a lysine deacetylase sirtuin-like (TaSRT1) to determine its potential interaction with TaHSP18.6. We demonstrated that TaSRT1 deacetylated TaHSP18.6 and thereby inhibited TaHSP18.6 protein accumulation. Haplotype analysis revealed that the K171M substitution of TaHSP18.6 generated a susceptible haplotype TaHSP18.6 M171 in wheat, and mass spectrometry results implied that K171 is a key lysine acetylation site. We confirmed the differential acetylation level between TaHSP18.6 K171 and TaHSP18.6 M171 by TaSRT1. Analysis of overexpression lines and EMS mutants showed that TaSRT1 negatively regulated wheat FCR resistance. Meanwhile, we identified that TaHSP18.6 interacted with an auxin-responsive protein IAA1 (TaIAA1) that negatively regulated FCR resistance. TaHSP18.6 overexpression and TaSRT1 mutation significantly increased the auxin content. Exogenous application of auxin substantially enhanced wheat FCR resistance. Taken together, we proposed a TaSRT1–TaHSP18.6 model regulating FCR resistance possibly through mediating TaIAA1 to change the endogenous auxin content in wheat plants.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of macromolecules adsorbed from extracellular fluids onto cell membranes is crucial for elucidating basic cellular processes and advancing applications in biotechnology, such as biosensing, therapeutics, and synthetic biology. However, this is complicated by the interplay between membrane heterogeneity, macromolecule conformation, and fluid hydrodynamics. We investigate the dynamics of linear polymers on binary lipid membranes using hydrodynamics simulations and single-molecule tracking experiments. We find that the preferential adsorption of nanosized polymer onto the raft-forming component of the membrane induces and stabilizes a single lipid raft that colocalizes with the polymer. This lipid raft, in turn, imposes dynamic confinement on the polymer, resulting in swollen yet restricted 2D conformations and Saffman–Delbrück-type diffusivity. These effects lead to an unusual scaling for polymer interfacial diffusion, D ∼ N − ν D with ν D ≈ 0.5 . Normal mode analysis further reveals that the relaxation time of the polymer’s slowest mode surprisingly follows the prediction of Zimm model for a 3D chain in a good solvent, irrespective of whether the polymer’s hydrodynamics are dominated by the 3D solvent or 2D fluid membrane. We also identify two diffusive modes: Saffman–Delbrück-type for polymer on heterogeneous membranes and Stokes–Einstein-like for polymer on homogeneous membranes, demonstrating the potential of polymer adsorbates as biosensors for membrane heterogeneity. Our study provides insights into polymer dynamics on biological membranes and suggests that polymer adsorbates can modulate lipid rafts, influencing raft-related cellular processes.",

          "abstract": "B-1a cells, a self-renewing B cell subset essential for innate immunity, produce natural IgM antibodies that defend against pathogens, yet mechanisms sustaining their maintenance during aging remain unclear. We report that aging B-1a cells exhibit hallmarks of decline, including DNA damage, apoptosis, and reduced proliferation, with striking sex-specific disparities: aged females retain higher B-1a cell numbers than males, correlating with enhanced glycolysis and chromatin accessibility. Motif analysis of accessible regions identified the transcription factor Bcl11a, which shows elevated chromatin accessibility and expression in aged female B-1a cells but declines in males. Bcl11a deletion reduced B-1a cell numbers, impaired viability, and increased apoptosis across sexes and ages. Mechanistically, Bcl11a sustains survival by upregulating antiapoptotic genes ( Mcl1 , Mdm2 , and Mdm4 ) to suppress p53-mediated apoptosis, as evidenced by partial rescue of viability defects in Bcl11a-deficient B-1a cells upon p53 deletion. Conversely, Bcl11a overexpression or Bcl11a-high B-1a cells from aged Bcl11a -eGFP reporter mice enhanced stress resistance. These findings establish Bcl11a as a key regulator of B-1a cell maintenance during aging and reveal its role in mitigating sex-dimorphic immune decline through transcriptional control of survival pathways.",

          "abstract": "Bone regeneration continues to be a challenge due to the complex nature of the tissue. Identifying new materials that stimulate regeneration while providing mechanical properties is an active area of research. One class of promising material in bone regeneration is graphene and its derivatives including graphene oxide (GO), the oxidized form of graphene. Recently, calcium phosphate graphene (CaPG), synthesized from GO, has been proven to have osteoinductive properties in vivo. However, CaPG is a powder, and therefore, processing is difficult. Here, we present a method for creating porous CaPG matrices by incorporating it in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). This research has comprehensively evaluated CaPG-encapsulated PLGA-based microspheres for localized delivery of osteoinductive inducerons, calcium, and phosphate ions for bone regenerative engineering. CaPG distribution improved mechanical properties and matrix hydrophilicity. CaPG-integrated matrices successfully supported cell viability, proliferation, and enhanced osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. Major osteogenic gene expression significantly increased, including Sp7, bone gamma-carboxyglutamate protein, COL1A1, bone sialoprotein, and dentin matrix protein1. The CaPG-containing matrices induced the endogenous canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, with no significant difference when treated with DKK1 inhibition, demonstrating its possible selective activation mechanism. The increased protein expression of pathway-specific target genes, Bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) and WNT-1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP-1), further confirmed endogenous activation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. These results suggest that CaPG-modified matrices improve the cellular osteogenic differentiation via the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This study provides further mechanistic insights into the nature of crosstalk between cells and inducerons-rich functionalized matrices for osteoblastic differentiation and improved bone regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Historically, it was widely assumed that males dominate females socially in most mammals. However, recent studies revealed significant variation within and among species, opening new possibilities to explore the extent and drivers of sex biases in dominance relations. This study uses quantitative data from 253 populations across 121 primate species to investigate the distribution of, and factors associated with, sex biases in the outcome of male–female contests. We first showed that male–female contests are common (around half of all contests) and that males win &gt;90% of these contests in less than 20% of populations. We next tested five hypotheses to explain sex biases in dominance relations. We found that female-biased dominance primarily occurs in primate societies where females have substantial reproductive control, as in monogamous, sexually monomorphic, and arboreal species. Female-biased dominance is also frequent in societies where female–female competition is intense, as in solitary or pair-living species where females are intolerant of each other, as well as in species where females face lower reproductive costs and are philopatric. Conversely, male-biased dominance is common in polygynous, dimorphic, terrestrial, and group-living species and often relies on physical superiority. In contrast, female empowerment hinges on alternative strategies, such as leveraging reproductive control. Our study highlights that male–female dominance relationships are highly variable and identifies the traits associated with the emergence of female- versus male-biased dominance in primate evolutionary history, which may also deepen our understanding of the origins of gender roles in early human societies.",

          "abstract": "In Arabidopsis thaliana , the FLOWERING LOCUS T ( FT ) gene encodes florigen, a floral stimulus that integrates multiple environmental cues to optimize the timing of flowering, which is crucial for reproductive success. The FT protein is synthesized in the phloem companion cells of leaves but exerts its function in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to initiate floral morphogenesis. While the environment-dependent regulation of FT transcription in leaves is well studied, the mechanisms underlying FT transport, particularly its cell-to-cell translocation within the SAM, remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed an in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating FT intercellular translocation in the SAM. We demonstrate that low ambient temperature inhibits the cell-to-cell movement of FT in the SAM through abscisic acid signaling pathways, resulting in flowering delay. We further show that the permeability of plasmodesmata (PD) is involved in FT transport; in particular, CALLOSE SYNTHASE ( CalS ) 1 and CalS7 are induced at low temperature, leading to reduced permeability of PD and inhibition of symplastic FT translocation in the SAM. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the intercellular translocation of FT in the SAM in response to environmental conditions and lead to a framework for the understanding of flowering.",

Most TEAD-targeting small molecules are designed to disrupt interaction between TEAD and the oncogenic transcriptional activators YAP and TAZ. Here, we uncover an alternative mechanism for a subset of TEAD lipid pocket-binding molecules. We report that select sulfonamide-containing TEAD-targeting compounds enhance the interaction between TEAD and the transcriptional repressor VGLL4. Chemically induced VGLL4–TEAD complexes confer an antiproliferative effect by outcompeting YAP–TEAD complexes at chromatin. This cofactor switch from YAP to VGLL4 impacts transcriptional networks, including influencing the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and mechanosignaling. We demonstrate that VGLL4 is required for an antiproliferative response to these sulfonamide-containing compounds by counteracting YAP. We show that VGLL4 overexpression can confer sensitivity to these compounds in Hippo-driven cell lines, and we further show that genetic deletion of VGLL4 oblates cellular responsiveness to these molecules in cells and in vivo. Our data reveal a category of TEAD inhibitors that act as “molecular glues” toward the repressive VGLL4–TEAD interaction. These findings open up understandings for curbing the oncogenic activity of Hippo pathway deregulation in cancer, and identify glue-like molecules that promote transcriptional repression.",

          "abstract": "The fidelity of template-dependent mRNA synthesis during transcription elongation is the primary determinant of accurate gene expression and the maintenance of functional RNA transcripts. However, the mechanisms governing transcription fidelity remain incompletely understood. While previous studies have characterized how error rates vary with nucleotide identity at upstream and downstream positions from the incorporation site, the comprehensive microscopic explanation of this sequence dependence has not been elucidated. In this study, we develop a theoretical approach that integrates transcription proofreading mechanisms and inhomogeneous DNA sequence effects. Using first-passage analysis validated by Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively characterize nucleotide-specific error rates during RNA polymerase II transcription. The model accurately reproduces experimental error rates and predicts kinetic parameters influencing transcriptional fidelity. Analysis reveals nucleotide incorporation rates follow the hierarchy U&lt;C&lt;G&lt;A, consistent with independent experimental observations. Notably, our model not only explains how the error rates depend on the nature of the base immediately downstream (+1) but also predicts that the identity of the nucleotide at the second downstream position (+2) also plays an important role. Pyrimidines at position +2 contribute to lower error rates than purines, whereas the third downstream base (+3) has no effect. These previously unreported correlations are corroborated by bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets. In addition, using the BRCA1 gene as an example, we explore the physiological implications of sequence-dependent error rates, identifying an increased likelihood of premature stop codon errors. These findings clarify how DNA sequence context modulates nucleotide incorporation kinetics, advancing our understanding of transcriptional fidelity and its functional consequences.",

Arousal states are influenced by neuromodulators like catecholamines (noradrenaline and dopamine) and acetylcholine. To investigate their contributions to this law, we pharmacologically enhanced arousal while measuring human decision-making and spontaneous arousal fluctuations via pupil size. The catecholaminergic agent atomoxetine increased overall arousal and shifted the entire arousal–performance curve, suggesting a relative arousal mechanism where performance adapts to arousal fluctuations within arousal states. In contrast, the cholinergic agent donepezil did not measurably affect arousal or the curve. We modeled these findings in a neurobiologically plausible computational framework, showing how catecholaminergic modulation alters a disinhibitory neural circuit that encodes sensory evidence for decision-making. This work suggests that performance adapts flexibly to arousal fluctuations, ensuring optimal performance in each and every global arousal state.",

          "abstract": "Despite extensive efforts to develop strategies to inhibit cancer metastasis—the leading cause of cancer-related deaths—progress has been limited in recent decades. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) initiates metastasis by enhancing the migratory capacity and plasticity of cancer cells, enabling them to escape the primary tumor site. Identifying vulnerabilities unique to mesenchymal cancer cells is, therefore, critical for developing effective antimetastatic therapies. Our prior research has highlighted the crucial role of the Golgi apparatus in EMT-driven cancer cell motility and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the antimigratory effects of various Golgi-disrupting compounds and identified Monensin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic, as a potent migration suppressor in mesenchymal non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Monensin treatment increases the pH within the Golgi lumen, inducing rapid exocytosis of the promigratory Golgi scaffold protein Golgi Integral Membrane Protein 4 (GOLIM4). GOLIM4 plays a key role in regulating cell motility and adhesion by modulating the post-Golgi trafficking of Talin 1 (TLN1), an essential focal adhesion component. Furthermore, we found that both GOLIM4 and TLN1 are highly expressed in mesenchymal cancer cells and are direct targets of microRNA-200b, a microRNA that is suppressed during EMT. Treatment with Monensin or depletion of GOLIM4 or TLN1 significantly impaired the migratory activity of mesenchymal NSCLC cells. In summary, this study demonstrates that Monensin exhibits potential antimetastatic activity by disrupting the promigratory GOLIM4–TLN1 axis in mesenchymal NSCLC cells.",

Such sites are rare globally in nonmarine settings during the 12 million years (Ma) preceding the end-Triassic extinction (ETE; ~201.5 Ma), obscuring patterns of faunal change across this interval. A vertebrate assemblage from Arizona, USA, provides unique insights into community composition and ecology prior to the ETE. PFV 393 is a macro- and microvertebrate bone bed preserved in a volcaniclastic fluvial channel-fill with a high-precision U-Pb zircon age of 209.187 ± 0.083 Ma. The fossil assemblage consists of three-dimensionally preserved, delicate, and small skeletal elements of known and new taxa that document a local paleocommunity including hybodontiformes, actinopterygians, actinistians, metoposaurids, salientians, synapsids, lepidosaurs, testudinatans, trilophosaurids, Vancleavea , doswelliids, Revueltosaurus , loricatans, phytosaurs, and pterosaurs. The new early-diverging pterosaur is one of the few Triassic pterosaurs found outside of Europe and the only one with a documented precise radioisotopic age. The testudinatan material shows the rapid dispersal of terrestrial stem-turtles across the Pangaean supercontinent in the Norian and refines temporal constraints on the origin of the turtle shell. The presence of vertebrate lineages endemic to the Triassic highlights their persistence in a mesic, fluvial paleocommunity through a prolonged phase of environmental change preceding the ETE. These lineages coexisted with frogs, lepidosaurs, turtles, and pterosaurs- all key elements of post–Triassic Mesozoic communities. The arrival of turtles and pterosaurs in west-central Pangaea therefore may have been driven by the northward drift of Laurentia from humid equatorial conditions into more arid subtropical latitudes.",

          "abstract": "Autophagic dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disease, leaving neurons vulnerable to the accumulation of damaged organelles and aggregated proteins. However, the late onset of diseases suggests that compensatory quality control mechanisms may be engaged to delay these deleterious effects. Neurons expressing common familial Parkinson’s disease-associated mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) exhibit defective autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that both primary murine neurons and human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC)-derived neurons harboring pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles. We used unbiased proteomics to characterize the secretome of LRRK2 G2019S neurons and found that autophagic cargos including mitochondrial proteins were enriched. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that autophagosomes are rerouted toward secretion when cell-autonomous degradation is compromised to mediate clearance of undegraded cellular waste. Immunoblotting confirmed the release of autophagic cargos and live-cell imaging demonstrated that secretory autophagy is upregulated in LRRK2 G2019S neurons. We also found that LRRK2 G2019S neurons upregulate the release of exosomes containing microRNAs. Live-cell imaging confirmed that this upregulation of exosomal release is dependent on hyperactive LRRK2 activity, while pharmacological experiments indicate that this release staves off apoptosis. Finally, we show that markers of both vesicle populations are upregulated in plasma from mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2. In sum, we find that neurons expressing pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate secretory autophagy and the compensatory release of exosomes to mediate waste disposal and transcellular communication, respectively. We propose that this increased secretion contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, delaying neurodegenerative disease progression over the short term while potentially contributing to neuroinflammation over the longer term.",

          "abstract": "Northeastern US temperate forests are currently net carbon (C) sinks and play an important role offsetting anthropogenic C emissions, but projected climatic changes, including increased temperatures and decreased winter snowpack, may influence this C sink over the next century. Past studies show that growing season warming increases forest C storage through greater soil nutrient availability that contributes to greater rates of net photosynthesis, while reduced winter snowpack induces soil freeze/thaw cycles that reduce tree root vitality, nutrient uptake, and forest C storage. The year-round effects of climate change on this C sink are not well understood. We report here decade-long results from the Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment (CCASE) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which determines the combined effects of growing season warming and a smaller winter snowpack on C storage in northern temperate forests. We found after a decade of treatments that growing season warming increases cumulative tree stem biomass C by 63%. However, winter soil freeze/thaw cycles offset half of this growing season warming effect. The amount of C stored in stem biomass of trees experiencing both growing season warming plus smaller winter snowpack is only 31% higher than the reference plots, but this difference is not significant. Our results suggest that current Earth system models are likely to overestimate the C sink capacity of northern temperate forests because they do not incorporate the negative impacts of a shrinking snowpack and increased frequency of soil freeze/thaw cycles on C uptake and storage by trees.",

Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model’s behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: in the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine ICL and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.",

          "abstract": "Certain viruses such as tailed bacteriophages and herpes simplex virus package double-stranded DNA into empty procapsids via powerful, ring-shaped molecular motors. High-resolution structures and force measurements on the DNA packaging motor of bacteriophage Φ29 revealed that its five ATPase subunits coordinate ATP hydrolysis with each other to maintain the proper cyclic sequence of DNA translocation steps about the ring. Here, we explore how the Φ29 motor regulates translocation by timing key events, namely ATP binding/hydrolysis and DNA gripping, through trans-subunit interactions. We used subunit dimers bound to DNA as our model system, a minimal system that still captures the conformation and trans-subunit interactions of the full pentameric motor complex. Molecular dynamics simulations of all-ATP and mixed ATP–ADP dimers revealed that the nucleotide occupancy of one subunit strongly affects the ability to hydrolyze ATP in the adjacent subunit by altering the free energy landscape of its catalytic glutamate approaching the gamma phosphate of ATP. Specifically, one ATP-bound subunit donates residues in trans that sterically block the neighboring subunit’s catalytic glutamate. This steric hindrance is resolved when the first subunit hydrolyzes ATP and is ADP bound. This obstructive mechanism is supported by functional mutagenesis and appears to be conserved across several Φ29 relatives. Mutual information analysis of our simulations revealed intersubunit signaling pathways, via the trans-acting obstructive residues, that allow for sensing and communication between the binding pockets of adjacent subunits. This work reveals how the sequential order of DNA translocation events among subunits is preserved through trans-subunit interactions and pathways.",

Here, we investigated the possibility that inherited differences in immune tolerance checkpoints contribute to variability in outcomes. Whole genome sequencing revealed biallelic germline loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the immune tolerance checkpoint gene, NOD2 , in an exceptional immune responder to targeted radiotherapy for metastatic melanoma. In 40 exceptional immune responders to anti-PD1 monotherapy for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), genome sequencing showed 30% had inherited a NOD2 LOF variant, more than twice the population frequency ( P = 0.0021). Conversely, a gain-of-function RIPK2 allele known to increase NOD2 signaling was inherited by 61% of nonresponders from the same cohort, compared to 10% of exceptional responders and much higher than the population frequency ( P &lt; 0.0001). Within the overall recruited cohort of 144 NSCLC anti-PD1 patients, individuals with immune-related adverse events (irAE) had better overall survival, further improved in those with NOD2 LOF. In independent anti-PD1 monotherapy cohorts with a range of cancers, inherited NOD2 LOF was associated with complete or partial response ( P = 0.0107). Experimental validation in mice showed germline Nod2 LOF enhanced therapeutic immune responses elicited by anti-PD1 monotherapy against a high mutation burden colorectal cancer, increasing tumor infiltration by effector memory CD8 T cells. Collectively these results reveal common inherited human variation in an immune tolerance checkpoint is a determinant of cancer immune responses elicited by pharmacological inhibition of another checkpoint.",

          "abstract": "The electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ), powered by renewable electricity, provides an energy- and cost-efficient alternative to conventional thermocatalytic methods for purifying crude ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) streams. This approach provides a more sustainable route to polymer-grade C 2 H 4 by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, yet its commercial potential remains limited by the scarcity of high-performance catalysts and the absence of comprehensive techno-economic analyses for large-scale implementation. In this study, we conduct an extensive screening and evaluation of monodisperse metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Bi) with tunable particle sizes and morphologies for the electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of C 2 H 2 in flow reactors. Among these candidates, 45 nm Cu nanocubes and 8 nm Ag NPs exhibited the highest performance. In a simulated crude ethylene stream (C 2 H 2 : C 2 H 4 = 1:80), Cu nanocubes achieved 99.7% C 2 H 2 removal at room temperature with a specific selectivity of 86.7% for C 2 H 4 and maintained stability for 120 h. Meanwhile, 8 nm Ag NPs exhibited a high specific selectivity of 98.9%, with 96.7% conversion and 24-h stability under the same conditions. A detailed techno-economic analysis confirms the feasibility of electrocatalytic systems for industrial-scale crude ethylene treatment, with an optimal conversion cost of $0.74 per kg of C 2 H 2 , compared to $1.34 per kg for the optimized thermocatalytic system. Furthermore, our life cycle assessment highlights the environmental benefits of the electrocatalytic pathway with a carbon emission reduction of over 50%. Our electrified, efficient C 2 H 2 semihydrogenation in C 2 H 4 crude streams minimizes environmental impact and optimizes resource use, contributing to a more sustainable future.",

          "abstract": "The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid 4 He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale’s contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures 1.44 K ≲ T ≲ 2.16 K indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance ℓ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale L 0 ) should behave as ℓ / L 0 ≈ 0.5 Re κ − 3 / 4 with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation κ . This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.",

Each LD is enclosed by a monolayer of phospholipids, distinct from bilayer membranes. The composition of LD surface phospholipids and their impact on LD growth and function remain to be defined. Phosphoinositides mark cellular organelles and regulate organellar function. Here, we demonstrate that PI(4)P decorates a subset of LDs to recruit and activate CIDE proteins. Enhanced expression of ORP2 and ORP5, LD-associated lipid transfer proteins that remove PI(4)P from LDs, abolished the localization and function of CIDE proteins. Blocking the synthesis of PI(4)P on the LD surface via knocking down PI4K2A also impaired the localization and function of CIDE proteins. In adipocytes, depleting PI(4)P dramatically reduced the size of LDs, as well as adipose tissue mass. In severe steatotic liver, depleting PI(4)P impeded LD enlargement. Our results thus identify a key function of LD surface PI(4)P under physiological conditions and unveil how CIDE proteins are recruited to LDs.",

          "abstract": "Natural language unfolds over multiple nested timescales: Words form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, and paragraphs build into full narratives. Correspondingly, the brain exhibits a hierarchy of processing timescales, spanning from lower- to higher-order regions. During narrative comprehension, neural activation patterns have been shown to propagate along this cortical hierarchy with increasing temporal delays (lags). To investigate the mechanisms underlying this lag gradient, we systematically manipulate the structure of a recurrent reservoir network. In the biologically inspired “Limited-Canal” configuration, word embeddings are received by a limited set of sensory neurons and transmitted through a series of local connections to the distal end of the network. This configuration endows the network with an intrinsic lag gradient, inducing a cascade of activity as information propagates along the network. We found that, similar to the human brain, this intrinsic lag gradient is enhanced by naturalistic narratives. The interaction between naturalistic input and network structure becomes evident when manipulating local connectivity through the “canal width” parameter, which determines how closely the Limited-Canal model mirrors the human brain’s sensitivity to narrative structure. In addition, we found that processing cost, as a computational proxy for the BOLD signal, increases more slowly in later neurons, which can account for the emergence of the lag gradient. Our results demonstrate that narrative-driven neural dynamics can emerge from macroscale anatomical topology alone without task-specific training. These fundamental topological properties of the human cortex may have evolved to effectively process the hierarchical structures ubiquitous in the natural environment.",

          "abstract": "Peptidoglycan (PG), a defining feature of the bacterial cell envelope, is crucial for cell integrity and morphology. PG is a macromolecular mesh consisting of glycan polymers crosslinked by short peptides encasing the cytoplasmic membrane. PG peptides contain two to five amino acids of both L- and D-configuration, with a conserved L-alanine residue at the first position in most bacteria. We previously identified a β-lactam hypersensitive mutant of Escherichia coli lacking yfiH (renamed pgeF ) that shows incorporation of L-serine or glycine instead of L-alanine. Here, we demonstrate that PgeF is an editing enzyme that imparts fidelity to the biosynthesis of PG peptides across bacterial genera. Using extensive mass spectrometry, we find accumulation of misincorporated cytoplasmic PG precursors in the absence of pgeF . Detailed biochemical analysis of several bacterial PgeF homologs reveals that PgeF specifically cleaves serine or glycine but not alanine from the PG precursors. Additionally, expression of heterologous ligases that incorporate L-serine or glycine is lethal in the absence of pgeF , indicating that L-alanine at the first position is crucial for wall integrity. Interestingly, PgeF is selectively conserved in bacteria and vertebrates; however, we find that the PG editing activity is exclusive to bacterial homologs. Furthermore, homologs from both taxa were previously characterized as purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNP). Here, we find that they indeed have a weak PNP activity, but with no physiological relevance in bacterial systems. Overall, our study demonstrates the existence of a conserved proofreading pathway that is fundamental to the integrity of the bacterial cell wall.",

Breastfeeding is known to support infant health, but the contributions of the numerous breastmilk components to gut microbiota and immune maturation remain unclear. Secretory IgA (SIgA), the most abundant antibody in human milk, is a key modulator of gut microbiota composition. We have shown previously that mouse milk SIgA protects against asthma by limiting segmented filamentous bacteria in mice. The present study uncovers a similar mechanism in humans. Using human milk from the CHILD Cohort Study, we define a relationship between human milk SIgA and infant gut microbiota composition. This leads to the identification of Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum as a key player in immune development, which is controlled by milk SIgA. Cell culture modeling demonstrates that SIgA restricts the capacity of E. ramosum to adhere to the intestinal epithelium and to induce Th17 responses, which are implicated in allergic and other chronic diseases.",

Key features observed in soft–hard composites, including mechanical hysteresis, sacrificial bond-driven toughening, and brittle-to-ductile (BTD) transitions, are successfully reproduced, suggesting that the simplest model captures the essence of toughening in soft–hard composites. Visualization of internal fracture reveals distinct fracture patterns associated with the BTD transition, while numerical and theoretical analyses elucidate its mechanical origins. Furthermore, we identify an optimal toughening composition governed by a unified scaling relation linked to the fracture toughness ratio between soft and hard components. A fundamental toughening phase diagram is also established in terms of strength and toughness. This work sheds light on the underlying toughening landscape of soft–hard composite systems.",

Recently determined GPCR structures have revealed allosteric pockets facing the lipid bilayer, enabling rational drug design. Here, we develop a virtual screening strategy to discover ligands of extrahelical binding pockets and apply this approach to the adenosine A 1 receptor (A 1 R). The A 1 R is a high-value therapeutic target for ischemia–reperfusion injury and chronic neuropathic pain. Developing effective A 1 R therapeutics remains challenging due to high structural conservation across orthosteric binding sites and on-target unwanted effects stimulated by prototypical A 1 R agonists, such as bradycardia and atrioventricular block. However, A 1 R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) acting through spatially distinct allosteric sites can fine-tune A 1 R activity with high subtype selectivity and spatiotemporal specificity, thereby overcoming current limitations. A chemical library of 160 million compounds was computationally docked to the allosteric pocket identified in a cryo-EM structure of the A 1 R, and a set of 26 top-ranked compounds were selected for experimental evaluation. Pharmacological evaluation of these, and structure-guided hit optimization, led to the discovery of subtype-selective A 1 R PAMs. These compounds demonstrated minimal allosteric agonism and negligible impact on A 1 R-mediated beat rate of an orthosteric agonist. The discovered PAMs pave the way for potential treatments for neuropathic pain and ischemia–reperfusion injury without accompanying side effects.

Herein, we identify a peculiar electroinduced thiol to thione tautomerization of 4-mercaptopyridine (4MPy) molecule on Cu catalyst surfaces at this triple-phase interface driven by cathodic polarization. This leads to a significant performance improvement of CO 2 RR on Cu with a C 2+ Faradaic efficiency of over 80% with more than 60% C 2 H 4 , as well as a 300 mV reduction of cell voltage compared to bare Cu. A home-designed MEA-type operando Raman cell enables mechanistic studies directly under a current density of over 100 mA cm −2 , elucidating the intricate impacts of the 4MPy tautomerization on the local catalytic environments under real reaction conditions. Surprisingly, this tautomerization does not occur in other commonly utilized electrolyzers, e.g., flow cell and H-cell, even with the same catalyst and electrolyte conditions. The direct contact with the electrolyte in the latter cells was found to cause rapid desorption of 4MPy from the catalyst surface before its possible chemical transformation. These results highlight the opportunities of utilizing surface molecular tautomerization to promote CO 2 RR performance and using the triple phase of MEA to drive reactions that would otherwise be hard to happen in classical electrochemical devices of similar conditions.",

ACBP neutralization by means of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) improved health span in a strain of progeroid mice. In a mouse model of chronic kidney injury induced by cisplatin, anti-ACBP mAb administration counteracted both histopathological and functional signs of organ failure. ACBP inhibition also prevented the senescence of tubular epithelial cells and glomerular podocytes induced by cisplatin or doxorubicin, respectively, as measurable by the immunohistochemical detection of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, best known as p21). Senescence was also prevented by anti-ACBP mAb treatment in additional mouse models of accelerated aging. This applied to liver damage induced by a combination of high-fat diet and carbon tetrachloride, where hepatic cells become senescent. Moreover, administration of anti-ACBP mAb prevented natural and doxorubicin-accelerated cardiomyocyte senescence. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to study the transcriptome of hearts that had been exposed to doxorubicin and/or anti-ACBP in vivo. In cardiomyocytes, doxorubicin caused an anti-ACBP-reversible dysregulation of mRNAs coding for cardioprotective proteins involved in autophagy, fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial homeostasis, and oxidative phosphorylation. Altogether, these findings plead in favor of a broad age-promoting effect of ACBP across different organ systems.",

The construction of a temperature-sensitive lethal ( tsl )-based GSS in the Mediterranean fruit fly ( Ceratitis capitata ) over three decades ago was considered a major breakthrough for SIT programs but was never successfully replicated in other pests. After over 30 y of research, we have pinpointed a specific mutation in the C. capitata lysine--tRNA ligase ( Lysyl-tRNA synthetase , LysRS ) gene responsible for the tsl phenotype. Introducing this specific mutation into a wild-type strain produced full embryonic lethality under heat stress, replicating the original mutant phenotype. The random integration of a LysRS minigene reversed this effect. The high conservation of LysRS among insects suggests that tsl-based GSS could be expanded to multiple pest species and extend applications of SIT programs for disease prevention and the protection of agriculture.",

          "abstract": "To uncover substrates mediating the oncogenic activity of WWP1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we performed a proteomic analysis that identified the histone demethylase KDM5B /JARID1B as a candidate target. Of note, JARID1B is indispensable for efficient recruitment of several DNA damage repair factors and for damage resolution, thus negatively influencing the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemo- and radiation therapies. Validation of JARID1B as a substrate of WWP1 revealed a positive regulation of JARID1B half-life by WWP1 through the establishment of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. As a result, downregulation of JARID1B rising from WWP1 inactivation was associated with higher H3K4me3 enrichment at JARID1B target genes in WWP1-depleted relatively to control AML cells. Integration of RNA-seq and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data uncovered a highly significant overlap between upregulated gene expression and enriched H3K4me3 peaks after shWWP1 inactivation. We confirmed transcriptional activation of JARID1B targets in WWP1-depleted cells, supporting a role for WWP1 in regulating JARID1B activity. Coherently, upon WWP1 inactivation, we observed a defective recruitment of repair proteins after DNA damage, with subsequent reduced DNA damage repair efficiency and enhanced sensitization of AML cells to the cytotoxic activity of chemotherapeutic drugs. All together, these data identify JARID1B as a bona fide target of WWP1 and imply that WWP1-mediated regulation of JARID1B impacts its ability to modify chromatin and to recruit DNA damage repair factors, thus ultimately affecting chemosensitivity of AML cells.",

However, the roles of these pathogenic factors in synaptic dysregulation and cognitive malfunction are still poorly understood. In this study, a conditional knockout mouse model lacking ZC4H2 —an X-linked gene implicated in ZC4H2-associated rare disorder (ZARD) —in forebrain excitatory neurons is generated and these mice exhibit cognitive malfunction, recapitulating the intellectual disability manifestation of ZARD. Mechanistically, ZC4H2 harbors a protein interaction network with key excitatory synaptic regulators and ZC4H2 interacts directly with AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and regulates their ubiquitination at the postsynaptic sites, thereby maintaining AMPARs protein stability and synaptic expression. ZC4H2 deficiency specifically and aberrantly increases AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission and impairs synaptic plasticity of long-term potentiation. More importantly, pharmacological treatment with perampanel, an AMPAR-specific antagonist, successfully restores the excitatory synaptic activity and cognitive function of ZC4H2-deficient mice. Together, we establish that ZC4H2 is a postsynaptic regulator for AMPARs and excitatory synaptic activity and highlight that the dysregulation of these biological processes is a crucial etiology underlying ZARD-associated intellectual disability.",

          "abstract": "In the last few weeks, Science has published commentary condemning and supporting the Restoring Gold Standard Science executive order from the Trump administration that purports to strengthen research integrity in the United States through greater government oversight. The scientific community has largely reacted negatively to the directive, fearing that the way oversight by political appointees is specified in the order will lead to interference in the curiosity-driven process of science. This distress is understandable given the administration’s abrupt and arbitrary actions to cut research funding and curtail or even stop the participation of foreign students in research. The United States has been a global leader in science because of high levels of funding, less government interference, and participation of the best talent from around the world. These aspects appear to be in danger, and it is logical to suspect that the executive order is another mechanism for weakening the scientific enterprise.",

However, their impact on the system’s many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoiré-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoiré lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near ν = − 2 , possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoiré lattices as a tunable parameter for designing quantum phases and an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moiré materials.",

The space industry has been pushed by the extreme technological demands of curiosity-driven research, and benefited from the flow of public money to industrial contracts to build astronomical missions. Both science and industry have been driven by a shared romantic vision of exploring the Universe, whether by studying distant galaxies or by humanity stepping out into space. All of this was suddenly disrupted in 2019 by a rude awakening. Starlink communication satellites began to photo-bomb astronomers’ images as they streaked across the sky. Suddenly, it seemed, astronomy and commercial space activity were in conflict. This friction may be coming to a crunch as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begins a 10-year survey of the cosmos.",

In this work, we used triggered anyon pulses incident on a QPC in a filling factor ν = 1/3 FQH fluid to investigate anyon tunneling in the time domain. We observed that braiding increases the tunneling timescale, which is set by the temperature and the anyon scaling dimension that characterizes the edge-state dynamics.

We report dynamic similarity of vegetation and climate even at centennial frequencies (149 −1 to 18,012 −1 year −1 , that is, one cycle per 149 to 18,012 years). A breakpoint in vegetation turnover (797 −1 year −1 ) matches a breakpoint between stochastic and autocorrelated climate processes, suggesting that ecological dynamics are governed by climate across these frequencies. Heightened vegetation turnover at millennial frequencies (4650 −1 year −1 ) highlights the risk of abrupt responses to climate change, whereas vegetation-climate decoupling at frequencies &gt;149 −1 year −1 may indicate long-lasting consequences of anthropogenic climate change for ecosystem function and biodiversity.",

We identified carboxylation of MAVS by vitamin K (VK)–dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX), which was unexpected owing to the reported membrane topology of GGCX. We found that GGCX could undergo topology inversion to carboxylate MAVS within the cytoplasm. This carboxylation enhanced the ability of MAVS to induce type I interferons while suppressing the induction of apoptosis. Genetic knockout of GGCX, a VK-free diet, or depletion of VK by inhibiting VK epoxide reductase 1 with warfarin increased viral susceptibility in mice. Thus, we identified a MAVS regulatory mechanism—the existence of cytoplasmic protein carboxylation and topological inversion of GGCX—and demonstrated how modulating VK levels may influence antiviral defense.",

Optogenetic reactivation of social memories of females, but not males, induced place preference. Ablation of the upstream hippocampal dorsal CA2 region or the medial amygdala disrupted the representation of sex and the sexual dichotomy of social memory valence. Thus, vCA1 neurons use dual coding schemes to represent the identities and social properties of familiar conspecifics as a cohesive memory.",

We hypothesized that BCL-XL and BCL-2 may substitute MCL-1’s anti-apoptotic but not its apoptosis-unrelated functions. Replacing MCL-1 with BCL-XL or BCL-2 supported embryo development by rescuing the Mcl-1 −/− preimplantation lethality.

          "abstract": "Zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) are the largest family of transcription factors, yet how they activate gene expression remains unclear. In this study, we identified Zincore, a protein complex consisting of QRICH1 and SEPHS1, as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for embryonic development in mice and associated with developmental syndromes in humans. We also identified ZFP91 as a representative Zincore client, binding the conserved promoter motif CTTTAAR. Cryo–electron microscopy of a Zincore-ZFP91-DNA complex revealed a SEPHS1 arginine clamp to recognize the DNA-bound zinc finger domains. This mode of binding explains recognition of different ZNFs and stabilizes ZFP91 onto its cognate DNA motif. Thus, our study identified Zincore as a ZNF-specific coregulator essential for development, involving a distinctive mechanism that locks ZNFs onto DNA and regulates transcription.",

          "abstract": "Ecologists have long proposed that environments providing more energy can support more species, yet empirical evidence frequently contradicts this expectation. We argue that such inconsistencies result from confounding geographical influences that mask the true relationship between species richness and energy-related factors. Here, by comparing species richness across different climate conditions, we disentangle the direct effects of temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity from the confounding impacts of the area and isolation of various climates. Using a global analysis of terrestrial vertebrates, we reveal clear and consistent relationships between energy-related factors and species richness. Our findings clarify existing ecological theory and illustrate how adopting a climate space perspective advances biodiversity research, providing critical insights into biodiversity patterns and their responses to environmental change.",

          "abstract": "Random unitaries are central to quantum technologies and the study of complex quantum many-body physics. However, existing protocols for generating random unitaries require long evolution times and deep circuits. In this work, we prove that local quantum circuits can form random unitaries in extremely low depth on any geometry. These shallow circuits have low complexity and create only short-range correlations, yet are indistinguishable from random unitaries with exponential complexity. This finding contrasts sharply with classical systems, in which a long evolution time is required to appear random. Our results have widespread applications across quantum science, from device benchmarking to quantum advantages. Moreover, they reveal that fundamental physical properties—including evolution time, causal structure, and phases of matter—are provably hard to learn.",

We report an assemblage of 35 wooden implements from the site of Gantangqing in southwestern China, which was found associated with stone tools, antler billets (soft hammers), and cut-marked bones and is dated from ~361,000 to ~250,000 years at a 95% confidence interval. The wooden implements include digging sticks and small, complete, hand-held pointed tools. The sophistication of many of these tools offsets the seemingly “primitive” aspects of stone tool assemblages in the East Asian Early Paleolithic. This discovery suggests that wooden implements might have played an important role in hominin survival and adaptation in Middle Pleistocene East Asia.",

Here, we analyze more than 320 million daily observations of milk production across 12 years, paired with survey data, to provide estimates of the effect of humid heat and the scope for adaptation. Results indicate that extreme heat reduces milk yield by up to 10%, with effects that persist for more than 10 days. Effects are stronger when cows are at more productive stages, suggesting a productivity-resilience trade-off. Cooling infrastructure and management adjustments were widely adopted over the preceding two decades, but only partially mitigate these losses, reducing them by less than half. Given the technological advancement and the representation of the climate of key producing countries in our sample, these results suggest that adaptation strategies, even those at the technological frontier, may be insufficient to address climate change damages.",

Numerous gatekeepers determine which research manuscripts complete this dissemination pathway, and the resulting media landscape influences public understandings of scientific fields. Here, we compare scientific and popular publishing of archaeology about different geographic regions. Of 1155 archaeology papers in one specialist and six general science journals across 6 years, 32% were reported by at least one of 15 US news sources. Mixed-effects logistic regression models revealed variation across news sources, but overall papers about archaeology in United Kingdom, Israel/Palestine, and Australia were significantly more likely to receive coverage, compared to China/Taiwan. This disparity raises concerns as archaeology influences notions of identity and cultural achievement, and has been misappropriated by racist, nationalist ideologies. We recommend ways for actors in research dissemination to diversify archaeology coverage.",

          "abstract": "Selective inhibition of the more than 100 S1 family serine proteases is a long-standing challenge due to their active site similarity. Mesotrypsin, implicated in cancer progression, exemplifies these difficulties; no current inhibitors achieve selectivity over other human trypsins. We found an unexpected autoinhibited conformation of mesotrypsin via x-ray crystallography, revealing a cryptic pocket adjacent to the active site. Using high-throughput virtual screening targeting this cryptic pocket, we identified a conformationally selective small-molecule inhibitor that stabilizes the inactive state of mesotrypsin. This inhibitor demonstrates selectivity for mesotrypsin over other trypsins. Our findings challenge the accepted view of digestive trypsins as constitutively active enzymes lacking potential for allosteric regulation. Furthermore, analyses of other structures suggest that dynamic sampling of closed states with analogous allosteric cryptic pockets appears widespread among S1 serine proteases. These observations point to a potentially generalizable strategy to achieve selective inhibition, offering broad implications for drug development targeting serine proteases in cancer and other diseases.",

          "abstract": "Because of the inferior thermoelectric performance of metals, the semiconductor-to-metal transition in thermoelectric materials is always avoided. Here, we demonstrate that α-to-β semiconductor-metal transition in MgAgSb is actually not detrimental but can be strategically exploited to create α/β-MgAgSb junction, enabling 150% enhancement in output power while maintaining high conversion efficiency. This power enhancement lies in the notably reduced internal resistance induced by semiconductor-to-metal transition, which is independent of dimensional changes. Consequently, α/β-MgAgSb can simultaneously achieve high maximum conversion efficiency exceeding 10% (9%) and maximum power density above 1 (0.9) W cm −2 by simulation (experiment), outperforming most p-type materials under identical conditions. In addition, a two-pair thermoelectric module combining α/β-MgAgSb with n-type Mg 3 Sb 0.6 Bi 1.4 achieves an unprecedented power density, representing notable advancements over existing Mg 3 (Sb,Bi) 2 /MgAgSb two-pair system. These findings highlight the immense potential of α/β-MgAgSb for thermoelectric applications and provide insights into the design of high-power thermoelectrics.",

Specifically, we design a three-dimensional Hadamard gate by training a diffractive neural network to generate the required phase distribution. The device is evaluated through quantum process tomography at the single-photon level within spatial modes, achieving a fidelity of 90%. Compared to traditional spatial light modulator–based implementations, our approach integrates spatial mode manipulation into a miniaturized photonic platform.

Here, we report a high-throughput multiplexed gene and cell doping analysis (HiMDA) using CRISPR-Cas12a system integrated with blood direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Blood direct PCR enables simultaneous amplification of multiple exogenous genes directly from whole-blood samples. Coupled with sequence-specific DNA recognition and fluorescence reporter system, HiMDA achieves multiplexed, on-target detection of doping genes and cells. Our results demonstrate HiMDA’s feasibility with only 5 microliters of blood required for the entire 90-minute process. HiMDA exhibits exceptional sensitivity, detecting as few as 2.5 copies of doping target genes from blood—four times more sensitive than current anti-doping standards—and identifying in vivo doping up to 10 days. These findings highlight HiMDA’s robust high-throughput, multiplexed capabilities, satisfying the sensitivity and selectivity demands of anti-doping research. HiMDA offers a flexible solution to meet future doping detection challenges.",

While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high throughputs. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-DOF robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs of more than 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing defects. With this self-supervised neural network–driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.",

We identified Foxc1 and Arid5A genes as prospective transactivation targets by the mutant GR in skeletal muscle. In the muscle, we further characterize Foxc1 as transcriptional activator of Insr and Irs1 in the canonical insulin signaling and Arid5a as transcriptional repressor of Cd36 and Fabp4 in the lipid uptake pathway. Moreover, Foxc1 and Arid5a programs in muscle were divergently changed by glucocorticoid regimens with opposite metabolic outcomes.

MERS E conducts K + ions with a unitary conductance of 113 picosiemens, fivefold larger than the conductance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 E. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance data indicate that the MERS E transmembrane domain forms a five-helix bundle that spans the lipid bilayer. The amino-terminal helical interface features multiple interacting phenylalanine (Phe) residues and an asparagine (Asn), whereas the carboxyl-terminal channel pore contains Phe 33 . Mutation of Phe 17 abolished K + conductance, whereas mutations of Phe 33 and Asn 15 suppressed most channel activity.

By leveraging a rodent-adapted strain of S. aureus , we developed a natural model of SSTIs. We found that LukMF′, a pore-forming leukocidin homolog to the human-specific LukSF-PV toxin, drives skin pathology in mice. LukMF′ lyses neutrophils via the chemokine receptor CCR1, which in turn fuels inflammatory pathology and microbial survival within the infectious nidus. Ablation of CCR1, depletion of neutrophils, or vaccination with LukMF′ all protected mice from skin pathology.

To identify glycosyltransferases, glycans, and glycoproteins essential for melanoma maintenance, we conducted an in vivo growth screen with a pooled short hairpin RNA library of glycosyltransferases, lectin microarray profiling of benign nevus and melanoma samples, and mass spectrometry–based glycoproteomics. We found that α-2,3-sialyltransferases ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 and corresponding α-2,3–linked sialosides are up-regulated in melanoma compared to nevi and are essential for melanoma growth. Glycoproteomics revealed that glycoprotein targets of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 are enriched in transmembrane proteins involved in growth signaling, including the amino acid transporter SLC3A2/CD98hc. CD98hc suppression mimicked the effect of ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2 silencing, inhibiting melanoma cell proliferation. We found that both CD98hc protein stability and its prosurvival effect on melanoma are dependent upon α-2,3-sialylation mediated by ST3GAL1 and ST3GAL2.

Here, we report the emergence of chirality in spatially confined solutions of achiral rigid-rod polymers. We show that kinetically arrested phase separation of polymer solutions confined to narrow capillaries resulted in alternating segments of isotropic and chiral nematic phases. The chiral structure of the nematic segments originated from the interplay between the constrained geometry, surface anchoring, orientational wetting, and elastic anisotropy of rigid-rod polymers. The catenoidal shape of the chiral structure recapitulated the morphology of biological chiral structures. These findings provide insight into the organization of soft matter under spatial confinement and offer a straightforward way to form chiral structures from achiral synthetic polymers.",

The penetration capacity is demonstrated by an unprecedented depth (~150 micrometers) of bovine serum albumin (66.4 kilodaltons) across aortic vessels under pressing for only 60 seconds. This spongy coating-based PMI technique can be integrated with medical balloon devices, offering endoluminal treatment within blood vessels, tracheas, and intestines.

This Ev-hitchhiking strategy, in combination with the loaded drugs ATRA and lenvatinib, efficiently regulated the myogenic and inflammatory characteristics of CAFs, remodeled the metastatic microenvironment, and suppressed tumor growth and metastasis.

Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods often fail to reliably detect these subpopulations due to their low frequency, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic approaches. Here, we present a droplet microfluidics method where bacteria are encapsulated in droplets containing growth medium and antibiotics. The growth of rare resistant cells is detected by observing droplet shrinkage under microscopy. We validated this method for three clinically important antibiotics in Escherichia coli isolates obtained from bloodstream infections and showed that it can detect resistant subpopulations as infrequent as 10 −6 using only 200 to 300 droplets.

Furthermore, YAP-TEAD inhibition restores the expression levels of genes hyperactivated by H3K79me/H3K36me3 loss.

Compared with single cells, CTC clusters present enhanced metastatic potential, greater survival in the bloodstream and increased resistance to microenvironment. Mechanistically, the Src/FN1 pathway is centrally activated in clusters, promoting intercellular cohesion and protecting against immune clearance and stress in circulation. Pharmacological inhibition of Src with the clinical inhibitor KX2-391 disrupted clustering, impaired CTC survival, and reduced metastasis in preclinical models.

          "abstract": "Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal cytokine storm syndrome. Its high mortality rate reflects limited therapeutic options and a poor understanding of disease-causing signaling. We show that the NLRP3 inflammasome is responsible for increased mortality in a model of secondary HLH (sHLH). Unexpectedly, neither deletion of the NLRP3-activated pyroptotic effector GSDMD nor combined deletion of the inflammasome-activated cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 conferred strong protection from sHLH. Instead, co-deletion of GSDMD and caspase-8–activated GSDME limited sHLH-driven lethality, demonstrating redundancy in the pyroptotic machinery required to induce sHLH. We also found that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitors prevent NLRP3-driven pyroptosis, which acted by blocking inflammasome priming. BET inhibitors prevented increased NLRP3 levels in diseased tissue, limited the production of sHLH-associated IL-1β, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor, and protected from sHLH pathogenesis. These findings suggest that targeting NLRP3 could limit sHLH and identify clinically relevant bromodomain-selective BET inhibitors capable of eliminating NLRP3-driven pyroptosis and the sHLH cytokine storm.",

The Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) controls the return of internalized cargos to the plasma membrane, and Rab25 has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancer by promoting invasive migration. However, while Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here, we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localization to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargos, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin β1, with the activation of Rho guanosine triphosphatases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin–rich filopodium-like protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in the three-dimensional matrix.",

Amyloid-β, the main component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease, has been shown to be generated in the presence of microbes. Entrapment of microbes by aggregated amyloid-β may serve as an innate immune response to pathogenic infections. To understand the association of amyloid-β plaques and pathogenic infections in the central nervous system, we obtained viable short-interval postmortem human retinal tissue and generated human retinal organoids that contain electrophysiologically active neurons. Here, we demonstrate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces amyloid-β extracellular protein aggregates in human retinal explants and retinal organoids. Last, pharmacological inhibition of neuropilin-1 resulted in reduced amyloid-β deposition in human retinal explants treated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 protein. These results suggest that Spike 1 protein, during infection with SARS-CoV-2, can induce amyloid-β aggregation, which may be associated with the neurological symptoms experienced in COVID-19.",

Suborbital to millennial-scale surface water bioproductivity changes provide no evidence for a continuous ice shelf in the AAG and the Nordic Seas over the past ~750,000 years. Instead, proxy data and model simulations reveal the persistent presence of seasonal sea ice cover and open water phytoplankton blooms during both glacial and interglacial times.

Inspired by the unique properties of cell membrane–derived nanodiscs, particularly their ultrasmall size and intrinsic membrane functions, we develop macrophage membrane–derived nanodiscs (denoted “MФ-NDs”) as a nanomedicine for the treatment of systemic bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Our findings demonstrate that MФ-NDs interact directly with bacteria, disrupting their membranes, inducing leakage of intracellular contents, and ultimately causing bacterial death. Meanwhile, MФ-NDs reduce intracellular bacterial count. In a mouse model of systemic MRSA infection, treatment with MФ-NDs significantly improves survival rates in both therapeutic and preventative contexts. Moreover, MФ-NDs show a lower propensity to induce bacterial resistance compared to conventional small-molecule antibiotics. No acute toxicity is observed in mice treated with MФ-NDs. Overall, this study underscores the straightforward fabrication and promising potential of MФ-NDs for addressing antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.",

Specifically, missense p53 (misp53) GOF mutations associate with therapy resistance and worse clinical outcomes. However, the molecular functions of distinct misp53 mutants in plasticity and therapy response remain unclear. Integrating multicenter patient data and multi-omics, we report that the misp53 R273H/C mutant is associated with cell cycle progression and a basal-like state compared to the misp53 R248W/Q mutant. Loss of misp53 R273H/C decreased tumor growth and liver metastasis while prolonging survival in preclinical models. We found that misp53 R273H/C specifically regulated the Rb/DREAM axis involved in cell cycle regulation. Notably, a clinical CDK4/6 inhibitor reduced misp53 R273H/C mutant expression. However, it triggered MAPK/ERK-mediated resistance mechanisms, enhancing cell survival and resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Combining MAPK/ERK and CDK4/6 inhibitors reduced misp53 R273H/C -associated oncogenic functions. Thus, distinct misp53 mutants show unique cell-intrinsic plasticity, therapeutic vulnerabilities, and resistance mechanisms.",

Traditional studies that rely solely on fiber orientation to explain scleral mechanics may overlook the tissue’s complex biomechanical behavior. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive investigation using ultrasonic elastography, optical coherence elastography, and polarizing light microscopy to analyze the equatorial sclera’s anisotropic properties.

In this work, we demonstrate an all-optical storage and retrieval of the spin-forbidden dark exciton in a quantum dot from the ground state using chirped pulses and an in-plane magnetic field. Our experimental findings are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions of the dynamics calculated using state-of-the-art product tensor methods.

Here, we investigate their effects following transport into the accretionary wedge by integrating discrete-element modeling with three-dimensional seismic interpretation. We find that the typical dips of the incoming PFSs overlap with modeled dips prone to reactivation and confirm that subducting PFSs can be reactivated and gradually evolve into major thrust faults. Comparisons with electromagnetic data indicate that PFSs may provide conduits for fluid leakage along the plate interface, coincide with disrupted strata and decreased shear stress, and enhance geometric and stress heterogeneity along the megathrust. These suggest that PFSs may play a previously unrecognized role in contributing to shallow slow earthquake phenomena in subduction zones.",

The MD-FET enables a perfect off state, as the elastic tunneling is forbidden by the momentum mismatch between the cross 1D contacts. It can also access a substantial on state, because the momentum mismatch can be compensated by the electron-phonon scattering in a 2D channel. The MD-FET with sub–1-nm channel thus exhibits high on/off ratios of ~10 7 , which breaks through the theoretical limit on the short-channel effect.

          "abstract": "Lead (Pb) is a potent neurotoxicant, but few studies have evaluated its effect on neurobehavioral measures that can be used in multiple species including humans. We investigated the effect of prenatal and childhood Pb exposure on children’s rate of forgetting using a delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) task among children 6 to 8 years of age. Blood Pb was measured during pregnancy (second and third trimesters) and at 4 to 6 years of age. A nonlinear modified power function was used to predict the forgetting rates on the DMTS task, using separate models for prenatal and childhood Pb. Higher childhood Pb [median (interquartile range), 1.7 (1.3) (μg/dl)] was associated with a faster rate of forgetting (β = −0.05; 95% confidence interval: −0.09, −0.01). Higher maternal intelligence quotient and child’s age were significantly associated with a slower rate of forgetting. We validated a unique power function statistical approach for rates of forgetting using Pb exposure.",

However, challenges remain in balancing multifunctional cargo loading with efficient locomotion and in predicting behavior in complex biological environments. Here, we present permanent magnetic droplet–derived microrobots (PMDMs) with superior cargo loading capacity and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Produced rapidly via cascade tubing microfluidics, PMDMs can self-assemble, disassemble, and reassemble into chains that autonomously switch among four locomotion modes—walking, crawling, swinging, and lateral movement. Their reconfigurable design allows navigation through complex and constrained biomimetic environments, including obstacle negotiation and stair climbing with record speed at the submillimeter scale. We also developed a molecular dynamics–based computational platform that predicts PMDM assembly and motion. PMDMs demonstrated precise, programmable cargo delivery (e.g., drugs and cells) with postdelivery retrieval. These results establish a physical and in silico foundation for future microrobot design and represent a key step toward clinical translation.",

These artificial cells feature nano-organelles that segregate incompatible modules: one for photocatalytic cofactor regeneration and another for biocatalytic alcohol metabolism. This spatial separation ensures sustainable cofactor provision and protects enzymes from oxidative damage. Co-compartmentalization of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase within a single nano-organelle enhances cascade reaction efficiency while inhibiting intermediate leakage. When cocultured with hepatocytes, these artificial cells demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and efficiently mitigate oxidative stress from alcohol metabolism.

We enhance the exposure of single atoms in nanopores by coating the catalysts on a carbon nanotube–interwoven membrane framework. Electrofiltration intensifies the transport and adsorption of nitrate in confined nanopores with highly exposed single-atom active sites to enhance reduction. The membrane enables a superior ammonia turnover frequency of 15.1 grams of nitrogen per gram of metal per hour, up to four orders of magnitude higher than that reported in the literature, under both high removal efficiency and Faradaic efficiency of over 86% when treating influents with a low nitrate concentration of 100 milligrams of nitrogen per liter in a residence time on the order of seconds.",

Adult muscle cells are large and chain thousands of sarcomeres into long periodic myofibrils that attach to the skeleton. During development, muscle cells must increase in length to maintain the mechanical connection to the growing skeleton. How muscles add new sarcomeres to facilitate muscle growth is unknown. Using live imaging and high-throughput image analysis, we have now tracked the sarcomere components during the developmental growth of Drosophila muscle and found that individual sarcomeres divide along the myofibril tension axis into daughter sarcomeres. This way, new sarcomeres can be inserted into contractile and mechanically intact myofibrils. We propose that sarcomere division is triggered by tension and local sarcomere damage originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions. Sarcomere divisions repair damaged sarcomeres, ensure their mechanical integrity, and synchronize sarcomere addition with skeletal growth during animal development.",

Silencing of TMEM9B-AS1 in primary human myotubes attenuated protein synthesis, concomitant with reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. Moreover, we show that TMEM9B-AS1 plays a pivotal role in regulation of ribosomal biogenesis by facilitating messenger RNA stabilization of the transcription factor MYC through direct physical interaction with the RNA binding protein, insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1). Disrupted ribosomal biogenesis resulting from TMEM9B-AS1 silencing leads to decreased expression of muscle contractile and structural proteins important for maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function.

We found that dopamine release in both regions correlated with errors in predicting value-neutral cues during latent learning and with errors in predicting reward during reward-based conditioning. Moreover, dopamine in the nucleus accumbens reflected inferred value in the probe test, supported by orbitofrontal cortex activity. Our findings show that dopamine signals prediction errors about both valued and neutral stimuli, consistent with its operation as a general teaching signal that supports learning across different informational domains.",

These loser cells have mitochondrial dysfunction, which we show causes amino acid deprivation and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), a pathway essential for their survival. We demonstrate that l -proline is a key amino acid sensed by the ISR and that proline represses the ISR and drives their elimination. These results indicate that cell competition acts as a previously unidentified tissue-sparing mechanism, regulated by the availability of extracellular amino acids, that allows for the elimination of dysfunctional cells when amino acids are plentiful but ensures their survival in nutrient-poor environments.",

Results suggest that climatic fluctuations played an important role in shaping its demographic trajectory and genetic structure. In addition, Tibetan macaques have experienced a severe bottleneck in the recent past, with highly deleterious mutations partially removed, but moderately deleterious mutations accumulating. The severe bottleneck and lower genetic diversity may have reduced their potential to adapt to environmental change, which will compromise long-term viability.

Here, we explored the integrity and functional role of Dicer during FMDV infection. These studies showed that the FMDV-encoded Leader protease (Lpro) specifically cleaves Dicer at a conserved DExD/H helicase motif releasing the complete N-terminal helicase domain. Dicer cleavage by Lpro suppressed small hairpin RNA (shRNA)–induced RNAi in swine cells. Silencing of Dicer conferred increased susceptibility to an Lpro-deficient FMDV, revealing a Dicer-dependent antiviral effect which can be effectively counteracted by Lpro. This mutant generated a remarkably different profile of viral small RNAs (vsRNAs) in infected cells compared with the wild-type virus.

Elevated OPA1 levels in multiple cancers correlate with reduced therapy sensitivity and poor survival, calling for specific OPA1 GTPase inhibitors. A high-throughput screening of ~10,000 compounds identified MYLS22, a heterocyclic N -pyrazole derivative as a reversible, noncompetitive OPA1 GTPase inhibitor. MYLS22 engaged with OPA1 in vitro and in cells where it induced cristae remodeling and mitochondrial fragmentation contingent on intactness of its predicted OPA1 binding site. MYLS22 enhanced proapoptotic cytochrome c release and sensitized breast adenocarcinoma cells to anti–Bcl-2 therapy, without toxicity on noncancer cells. By MYLS22 structure-activity relationship studies, we obtained Opa1 inhibitor 0 (Opitor-0) that inhibited OPA1, promoted cytochrome c release, and restored anti–Bcl-2 therapy sensitivity more efficiently than MYLS22. These chemical probes validate OPA1 as a therapeutic target to increase cancer cell apoptosis at the mitochondrial level.",

The incidence of human infections of POWV in North America has been increasing because of the expanding distribution of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis that transmits POWV to humans. To mitigate the dangers of handling a risk group 3 human pathogen, a chimeric virus was constructed from the genetic backbone of a yellow fever virus vaccine strain 17D (YFV-17D) and the external structural proteins of POWV lineage II. The chimera had a comparable phenotype as POWV. The atomic resolution of yellow fever virus-Powassan virus chimera (yPOWV) structure was built without ambiguity, revealing surface glycans and lipid pocket factors. The similarity to other flavivirus structures and the phenotype similar to YFV-17D suggest that there could be future potential as a vaccine candidate.",

However, the current approaches to structured sound often have restrictions on the multiplexing capacity of generating sound vortices and lack of dynamic manipulation over them. Here, we unveil an approach to generating structured acoustic waves and achieving remote dynamic control based on the proposed concept of topological-charge (TC) multiplexed metasurface (TCMM). We demonstrate that the TCMM can serve as an efficient device to yield structured sound field with multiple spatial vortex singularities, whose features and physics are entirely determined by the TCs encoded in it. These degrees of freedom can be tuned independently, enabling the dynamic remote control of multiple acoustic vortices and leading to the precise control over their motion. Our findings provide different insights into the generation and control over sound vortices and establish a powerful platform for engineering structured acoustic waves.",

Specifically, our in-house–customized MG-editing mRNA lipid nanoparticles (MERLINs) efficiently introduced SER mRNA into MG to generate Aβ-specific SER-MG in situ. SER-MG exhibited robust Aβ-specific phagocytosis and stimulated anti-inflammatory efferocytosis typical signaling in vitro. In a mouse model of AD, SER expression in the MG markedly increased the clearance of Aβ and dampened inflammation, resulting in improved behavioral outcomes along with substantially reduced synapse elimination. Our findings establish that AD-associated aberrant MG can be in situ reprogrammed with SER for Aβ clearance in an anti-inflammatory manner, with broad application in other inflammation-related diseases.",

Previous development of perovskite lasing has been largely limited to proof-of-concept devices with short operation time. Here, we report remarkably stable green lasing from colloidal CsPbBr 3 perovskite nanocrystals dispersed in liquids placed in a Fabry-Pérot cavity under excitation by nanosecond pulses. The output intensity of this laser is stable for more than 10 days of continuous operation. Transient absorption measurements reveal that the optical power efficiency of the laser is limited by the relatively short gain lifetime of NCs (160 ps), which nevertheless can be enhanced to 4.2% by implementing a double-pulse excitation scheme. Deep-red liquid lasing from CsPbI 3 nanocrystals has also been achieved, suggesting the feasibility to develop perovskite liquid lasers that are seamlessly tunable across the whole visible spectrum.",

Here, inspired by nonliving dehydrated leaves, we propose an on-demand customizable, material invariant, parametric surface anti-wrinkling strategy using leaf vein–imitated boundary curvature–coupled constraints. This strategy allows for an exact surface customization with enhanced anti-wrinkling capability, tailored to specific anti-wrinkling demands while maintaining the original cross-section materials. The defined parameters, anti-wrinkling width and concave radius, are customized by the anti-wrinkling design criteria via the dimensionless dual-correction stiffness model, which are simple linear or quadratic functions of anti-wrinkling demands and cross-section properties. Experiments at different scales and materials validate the correctness of the design criteria. The strategy in this study is effective on diverse wrinkle-prone surfaces at multiple scales and can inform real engineering design of the nonliving artificial surfaces.",

In both Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mice and lung epithelial cells, OXPHOS deficiency increased glycolytic flux, diverting carbons into hexosamine and de novo sialic acid (SIA) biosynthesis pathways. This led to elevated sialylation and enhanced viral attachment. In Ndufs4 KO models, adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase signaling was insufficient to blunt this increased metabolic flux. IAV infection further exacerbated this metabolic vulnerability, amplifying SIA and viral burden. Pharmacologic rerouting of glucose carbons with dichloroacetate reduced sialylation, viral replication, and inflammatory responses in Ndufs4 KO models. These findings reveal that mitochondrial dysfunction enhances IAV susceptibility by disrupting energy sensing and fueling viral receptor biosynthesis, highlighting the importance of epithelial metabolism in viral pathogenesis and suggesting metabolic modulation as a potential therapeutic.",

While asymmetric optical responses have enabled breakthroughs in classical applications like nonreciprocal light transmission, we report the experimental demonstration of asymmetric nonlinear responses for biphoton entanglement. Using a structural-asymmetric semiconductor metasurface incorporating [110] InGaP nanoresonators, we realize continuous tuning of polarization entanglement from partially entangled states to a Bell state by adjusting the pump wavelength. We also observe pronounced spatial anti-correlations and theoretically confirm that this approach can extend to tailor hyperentanglement. Furthermore, our nanoscale entanglement source features an ultrahigh coincidence-to-accidental ratio of ≈7 × 10 4 , outperforming existing semiconductor flat optics by two orders of magnitude.

In addition, we demonstrate that reintroduction of PPE71 into the L2 strain HN878 suppresses the baseline elevation of these transcripts, while overexpression of PPE71 increases the localization of PE_PGRS proteins and lipoproteins to the M.tb outer mycomembrane. Mouse infection confirmed the hypervirulence of the PPE71 – 38 deletion strain and conversely showed that PPE71 overexpression attenuates M.tb .

It remains unclear how various hydrophobic environments stabilize membrane proteins and whether lipids play any unique role in protein stability compared to other types of amphiphiles. Here, using the evolutionarily unrelated α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins from Escherichia coli , we find that the hydrophobic thickness and the strength of amphiphile-amphiphile packing in amphiphilic assemblies are critical determinants of protein stability. Lipid solvation enhances protein stability by facilitating residue burial in the protein interior, reminiscent of the lipophobic effect. This lipid-mediated mechanism also strengthens the cooperative residue-interaction network, promoting the propagation of local structural perturbations throughout the protein. This study demonstrates the pivotal role of lipid solvation in modulating the stability of membrane proteins and their responses to external stimuli.",

Here, we show how simultaneous upscale and downscale energy transfers occur in solar wind, leading statistically to equipartition of the turbulent energy flux. Our study sheds light on the paradigm of the existence of dual energy cascades in astrophysical plasmas, identifying the scales at which energy sources act in the magnetohydrodynamic regime driving turbulent dynamics in solar wind.

We found that diverse networks learn to represent natural images using a shared set of latent dimensions, despite having highly distinct designs. Next, by comparing these networks with human brain representations measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the most brain-aligned representations in neural networks are those that are universal and independent of a network’s specific characteristics. Each network can be reduced to fewer than 10 of its most universal dimensions with little impact on its representational similarity to the brain.

          "abstract": "Exposure to saturated fatty acids (SFAs), such as palmitic acid, can lead to cellular metabolic dysfunction known as lipotoxicity. Although canonical adaptive metabolic processes like lipid storage or desaturation are known cellular responses to saturated fat exposure, the link between SFA metabolism and organellar biology remains an area of active inquiry. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in human epithelial cells to identify modulators of SFA toxicity. The screen revealed peroxisomal proteins, especially those that affect ether lipid synthesis, as important regulators of lipotoxicity. We identified Fas-associated factor family member 2 (FAF2) as a critical bifunctional coregulator of peroxisomal and fatty acid biology. We further demonstrated the requirement of the ubiquitin-regulatory X (UBX) and UAS thioredoxin-like domains of FAF2 for peroxisomal protein abundance and SFA-induced cellular stress. Our work highlights the role of FAF2 in regulating peroxisomal abundance and function and the peroxisome as a key organelle in the cellular response to SFAs.",

We present an integrated study of trace elemental and Mg-Hg isotopic compositions of pre-, syn-, and postcollisional magmatic rocks from the eastern Gangdese belt in southern Tibet. Our findings show increased magmatic oxidation states linked to the enrichment of terrigenous sediments from Neo-Tethys subduction to postcollision, as evidenced by distinctive mass-independent Hg isotope fractionation in postcollisional porphyries (Δ 199 Hg = −0.25 to 0.22‰) and mantle-derived ultrapotassic rocks (Δ 199 Hg = −0.54 to 0.25‰) and negative δ 26 Mg values in ultrapotassic rocks (δ 26 Mg = −0.51 to −0.04‰). These results suggest that oxidation of postcollisional magmas was driven by the subduction of carbonates and/or sulfates from the Indian plate, enhancing metal enrichment.

To enable simultaneous acquisition of two fluorescent wavelengths, we incorporated two CMOS sensors into a single miniscope.

To address this, we introduce the LIMO heart, a compact TAH concept based on an efficient soft fluidic transmission system. By reducing actuator volume and enhancing energy transfer, LIMO enables a more compact and efficient design. We developed a soft ventricle prototype using thin-walled pouch actuators that achieve transmission ratios above one via circumferential shrinkage. A fast, cost-effective prototyping method accelerated testing. Experimental results showed high energy transfer efficiency (82 to 91%), and in vitro tests demonstrated promising cardiac outputs of 5.9 liters per minute against aortic pressure and 7.6 liters per minute against pulmonary pressure.

However, simply building protective layers cannot address essential issues; a thorough transformation of the metal electrode bulk is critical. We propose a reconstructed sodium metal anode (RSMA) by implanting an activatable ion-conductive network to the bulk. NaPF 6 will be activated with an electrolyte to conduct ions and form an anion-derived SEI. Conductive polymers become the supporting skeleton; thus, the RSMA has a metal-bulk storage matrix and an expanded three-dimensional plating/stripping mechanism and permits the homogeneous deposition/dissolution of Na + in high dimensions. Last, RSMA symmetric cells were stably cycled for 2700 hours and achieved a 100% depth of discharge.

After being dispersed in lipiodol and injected into tumors, Mg MSs would continuously generate hydrogen and magnesium hydroxide, which could neutralize the acidic tumor microenvironment, restore exhausted CD8 + T cells, reverse immunosuppression, and trigger specific T cell–mediated antitumor responses, synergistically resulting in inhibited tumor growth. As demonstrated in a rabbit orthotopic liver cancer model, artery infusion of Mg MS–dispersed lipiodol offered greatly enhanced therapeutic outcome compared to lipiodol-based or polymeric-bead–based TACE. In a pilot clinical study, among 15 eligible patients with HCC, 11 patients achieved complete response and 3 patients achieved partial responses without unexpected treatment-related adverse events during the 1 to 3 months’ follow-up.

We prepare pure states in qubit and qutrit systems and apply unitary evolution to investigate this relationship. Our results confirm the factorization law, offering strong evidence for this relationship.

          "abstract": "In the mammalian neocortex, the two hemispheres communicate via the corpus callosum. We investigated mechanisms regulating dendritic arbors and spines of callosal neurons. The transcription factor LIM Homeodomain 2 ( Lhx2 ), a key regulator of cortical development, is expressed in postmitotic layer II/III neurons and their progenitors. Loss of Lhx2 in either population caused similar but distinct phenotypes: reduced dendritic arbors, altered spine morphology, and changed electrophysiological properties. Morphometric defects were more severe when Lhx2 was disrupted in progenitors and were recapitulated by its specific loss in basal progenitors. Lhx2 loss in progenitors aberrantly up-regulated Neurog2 in postmitotic neurons, and Neurog2 knockdown partially rescued the phenotype. Loss of Lhx2 at either stage also up-regulated Wnt signaling pathway genes. The mutant phenotype was mimicked by constitutive activation of β-CATENIN in postmitotic neurons. Our findings reveal previously unidentified LHX2-dependent mechanisms of dendritic morphogenesis, highlighting its temporally dynamic and diverse roles in neocortical development.",

          "abstract": "The effectiveness of exosomes engineered to carry a dominantly active variant of inhibitor α of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (IκBα), super-repressor IκB (srIκB), that inhibits the expression of NF-κB in various animal models of inflammatory diseases has been demonstrated. In this study, we used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)–induced chorioamnionitis model in pregnant nonhuman primates to explore the therapeutic potential and mode of action of srIκB-loaded exosomes (Exo-srIκBs). Intraamniotic injection of LPS induced infiltration of BCL2A1-positive neutrophils and CD68-positive macrophages in the extraplacental membranes, causing fetal lung injury. Conversely, administration of Exo-srIκB via intraamniotic and intravenous routes (6.9 × 10 10 and 4 × 10 11 particle numbers, respectively) ameliorated these effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the decidua and bulk RNA sequencing of the choriodecidua highlighted that Exo-srIκB treatment mitigated LPS-induced inflammatory pathways, particularly in macrophages, leading to a cascade effect on neutrophils through NF-κB signaling inhibition. These findings underscore the potential of Exo-srIκB as a therapeutic strategy for chorioamnionitis.",

          "abstract": "Maternal behaviors, which are crucial for the survival of mammalian infants, require the coordinated operation of multiple brain regions to process infant cues, make decisions, and execute motor plans. Although these processes likely demand higher cognitive functions, the prefrontal areas that regulate limbic parental programs remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) excitatory projection neurons promote alloparental caregiving behaviors in female mice. By chronic microendoscopy, we observed robust yet adaptable representations of pup-directed anticipatory and motor-related activities within the OFC. Some of these plastic responses were significantly overlapped with those related to nonsocial reward signals. The inactivation of OFC output reduced the phasic activities of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons specifically tied to pup retrieval and impaired the modulation of DA release to the ventral striatum during the acquisition of alloparental behaviors. These findings suggest that the OFC transiently boosts DA activity during the acquisition phase, thereby facilitating the manifestation of alloparental behaviors.",

          "abstract": "The mid-Tournaisian carbon isotope excursion (TICE) represents the largest positive carbon isotope excursion in the late Paleozoic, coinciding with the onset of the late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA). Here, to investigate changes in the marine biological pump during the TICE, we measured barium isotopes (δ 138 Ba) in two marine limestone sections in the Antler foreland basin (USA). We found the largest positive δ 138 Ba shifts recorded in geological history, indicating increased marine export productivity in the Antler foreland basin, followed by the productivity-driven expansion of anoxia. The nearly identical stratigraphic trends, along with different absolute values in δ 138 Ba between the two sites, suggest spatial differences in marine biological pump intensity during the Early Mississippian. Earth system model simulations indicate that a global increase of 30% in marine export productivity is needed to explain observed changes. Our findings support the idea that an enhanced marine biological pump contributed to elevated organic carbon burial and the transition from a greenhouse climate to the LPIA.",

          "abstract": "Iterative cycles of theoretical prediction and experimental validation are the cornerstone of the modern scientific method. However, the proverbial “closing of the loop” in experiment-theory cycles in practice is usually ad hoc and often inherently difficult, beset by the scale or time constraint of computation or phenomena. Here, we demonstrate autonomous materials search engine (AMASE), where self-driving continuous cyclical interaction of experiments and computational predictions is performed for materials exploration. We have applied this formalism to rapid mapping of a temperature-composition phase diagram. Experimental determination of phase boundaries in thin films is autonomously interspersed with real-time updating of phase diagram prediction using CALPHAD. AMASE was able to accurately determine the eutectic phase diagram of the Sn-Bi thin-film system from a self-guided campaign covering just a small fraction of the phase space, translating to a sixfold reduction in the number of experiments. This study demonstrates real-time, autonomous, and iterative interactions of experiments and theory carried out without any human intervention.",
