          "authors": "Germain Gauthier, Roland Hodler, Philine Widmer, Ekaterina Zhuravskaya",
          "abstract": "Feed algorithms are widely suspected to influence political attitudes. However, previous evidence from switching off the algorithm on Meta platforms found no political effects1. Here we present results from a 2023 field experiment on Elon Musk’s platform X shedding light on this puzzle. We assigned active US-based users randomly to either an algorithmic or a chronological feed for 7 weeks, measuring political attitudes and online behaviour. Switching from a chronological to an algorithmic feed increased engagement and shifted political opinion towards more conservative positions, particularly regarding policy priorities, perceptions of criminal investigations into Donald Trump and views on the war in Ukraine. In contrast, switching from the algorithmic to the chronological feed had no comparable effects. Neither switching the algorithm on nor switching it off significantly affected affective polarization or self-reported partisanship. To investigate the mechanism, we analysed users’ feed content and behaviour. We found that the algorithm promotes conservative content and demotes posts by traditional media. Exposure to algorithmic content leads users to follow conservative political activist accounts, which they continue to follow even after switching off the algorithm, helping explain the asymmetry in effects. These results suggest that initial exposure to X’s algorithm has persistent effects on users’ current political attitudes and account-following behaviour, even in the absence of a detectable effect on partisanship.",

          "authors": "Qinhui Rao, Jun Yang, Pengxin Chai, Steven Markus, Kai Zhang",
          "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein-1, a microtubule (MT)-based motor protein, requires dynactin and a coiled-coil adaptor to form the processive dynein–dynactin–adaptor (DDA) complex1,2. The roles of MTs and dynein regulator lissencephaly-1 (LIS1) in DDA assembly have remained elusive. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structural basis of MT- and LIS1-mediated DDA assembly. We show that an adaptor-independent dynein–dynactin complex spontaneously forms on MTs with an intrinsic 2:1 stoichiometry in a highly efficient manner, driven by parallel alignment of dynein tails upon MT binding. Adaptors can wedge into and exchange within the assembled MT-bound dynein–dynactin complex; these processes are enabled by relative rotations between dynein and dynactin and facilitated by the dynein light-intermediate chains that assist the adaptor ‘search’ mechanism. Although LIS1 is dispensable for efficient DD(A)–MT assembly, its presence expands the conformational landscape of DD(A) assemblies on MTs. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals that LIS1 bridges dynactin p150glued and dynein in both the closed Phi-like and open prepowerstroke states, stabilizing low-MT-affinity intermediates that tether dynein molecules in proximity to MTs and prime them for subsequent DD(A) assembly through alternative pathways. These findings demonstrate the dynamic adaptability of the dynein transport machinery and the coordinated roles of MTs and LIS1 in DDA assembly.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is rising globally, yet effective treatments remain limited1. Here we found that systemic or hepatocyte-specific ablation of the gene encoding glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (Gpnmb)—a top upregulated gene in MASH—protected mice from diet-induced MASH. Notably, MASH progression was driven specifically by the secreted GPNMB ectodomain (G-ECD), rather than full-length GPNMB. Serum G-ECD levels showed a strong positive correlation with MASH severity in human patients. Using an unbiased screen of a cell-surface-displayed transmembrane protein library, we identified related to receptor tyrosine kinase (RYK) as a functional receptor for G-ECD. Hepatocyte-specific Ryk ablation protected mice against MASH and abolished the pathogenic effects of G-ECD. Mechanistically, G-ECD binding to RYK activated ERK1/2 signaling, resulting in transcriptional activation of PPARγ-CD36 and SREBP1C pathways that promote hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis. Multiple therapeutic strategies targeting the GPNMB–RYK axis—including vaccination, short hairpin RNA, neutralizing antibody and N-acetylgalactosamine small interfering RNA—effectively prevented and treated MASH in preclinical models. Our findings identify the GPNMB–RYK axis as a new pathogenic ligand–receptor pathway and a promising therapeutic target for MASH.",

          "authors": "Julia Haas, Sophie Bridgers, Arianna Manzini, Benjamin Henke, Joshua May, Sydney Levine, Laura Weidinger, Murray Shanahan, Kristian Lum, Iason Gabriel, William Isaac",
          "abstract": "The question of whether large language models (LLMs) can exhibit moral capabilities is of growing interest and urgency, as these systems are deployed in sensitive roles such as companionship and medical advising, and will increasingly be tasked with making decisions and taking actions on behalf of humans. These trends require moving beyond evaluating for mere moral performance, the ability to produce morally appropriate outputs, to evaluating for moral competence, the ability to produce morally appropriate outputs based on morally relevant considerations. Assessing moral competence is critical for predicting future model behaviour, establishing appropriate public trust and justifying moral attributions. However, both the unique architectures of LLMs and the complexity of morality itself introduce fundamental challenges. Here we identify three such challenges: the facsimile problem, whereby models may imitate reasoning without genuine understanding; moral multidimensionality, whereby moral decisions are influenced by a range of context-sensitive relevant moral and non-moral considerations; and moral pluralism, which demands a new standard for globally deployed artificial intelligence. We provide a roadmap for tackling these challenges, advocating for a suite of adversarial and confirmatory evaluations that will enable us to work towards a more scientifically grounded understanding and, in turn, a more responsible attribution of moral competence to LLMs.",

          "abstract": "The central nervous system is surrounded by three interconnected membranes referred to as the meninges, which host a diverse immune network1,2,3. Within the skull-interfacing dura mater are venous sinuses, large veins that are traditionally viewed as passive blood drains for the brain and skull4,5. However, these structures also constitute an important neuroimmune interface6,7,8. Here we used intravital microscopy to gain mechanistic insight into this interface and reveal that dural sinuses and their endothelial cells form a highly dynamic surface that continually restructures to regulate blood flow, fluid movement and immune surveillance. We show that sinuses are not passive conduits, but instead undergo RAMP1-dependent constriction and dilation mediated by smooth muscle, resembling arterial behaviour. Moreover, the superior sagittal sinus in mice is bifurcated into upper and lower chambers that contribute to intracranial pressure regulation. Both chambers are lined by specialized, highly fenestrated sinus endothelial cells (SECs) that permit movement of fluids, macromolecules and microorganisms between the sinus lumen and leukocyte-rich perisinus space. To safeguard this permeable interface, SECs dynamically open and close intercellular boundaries in a RAMP2-dependent manner. Transcranial RAMP2 antagonism impaired SEC boundary dynamics and reduced immune cell trafficking along the sinus wall during homeostasis and systemic viral infection. Disruption of SEC dynamics during infection compromised local antiviral immunity and promoted pathogen entry into the meninges. Together, these findings establish dural sinuses as dynamic venous structures that regulate fluid exchange and support immune surveillance and antiviral defence.",

          "abstract": "Dielectric polymers used in electrical energy storage require a combination of key metrics, including a high dielectric constant (K), low loss and high breakdown strength (Eb), all while being capable of operating at high temperatures1,2,3,4,5,6. Decades of research into polymer–inorganic composites have achieved only limited success in reaching these goals5,7,8. Here we introduce high-temperature immiscible blends of two dipolar polymers that, through nanophase separation, self-assemble into three-dimensional all-polymer nanocomposites. The resulting nanostructures induce coiled-chain morphology and large conformation changes, which, combined with relatively low rotational barrier and high dipole moments of both polymers, yield ultrahigh dielectric responses (K > 13) while maintaining a low loss (tanδ approximately 0.002) across a wide temperature range. Simultaneously, the nanostructured interfaces act as barriers for mobile charges, markedly reducing conduction losses at high fields and temperatures. The all-polymer three-dimensional nanocomposites with concurrently high K, high Eb and low loss deliver unprecedented discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures (18.7 J cm−3, 15.1 J cm−3 and 8.6 J cm−3 at 150 °C, 200 °C and 250 °C, respectively). The approach is applicable to other immiscible dipolar blends, demonstrating its universality and tunability. This work addresses the urgent needs in electrical energy storage and provides a new paradigm towards high-energy-density polymer dielectrics over a broad temperature range.",

          "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is frequently associated with metastatic relapse, even at an early stage 1 . Here we assessed an individualized neoantigen mRNA vaccine in 14 patients with TNBC following surgery and after neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. In peripheral blood of nearly all patients, high-magnitude, vaccine-induced, mostly de novo T cell responses to multiple neoantigens were detected that remained functional for several years. Characterization of individual patients revealed that a large proportion of these T cells developed into two subsets: a late-differentiated phenotype with markers indicative of ‘ready-to-act’ cytotoxic effector T cells, and T cells with a stem cell-like memory phenotype. Eleven patients remained relapse-free for up to six years post-vaccination. Recurrence occurred in three patients: the individual with the weakest vaccine-induced T cell response relapsed, but achieved complete remission on subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy; another patient had a tumour with low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression with MHC class I-deficient cells growing out under vaccination; and the third patient was BRCA-positive and had a recurrence from a genetically distinct primary tumour. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of individualized RNA vaccines in TNBC, document persistence of vaccine-induced, functional neoantigen-specific T cells and provide insights into possible immune escape mechanisms that will guide future approaches.",

          "abstract": "Centromeres ensure accurate chromosome segregation, yet their DNA evolves rapidly across eukaryotes leaving the origins of new centromere architectures unclear 1–4 . The brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exemplifies this long-standing puzzle. Its centromeres shifted ancestrally from large, repeat-rich, epigenetically specified forms to the compact, genetically defined ‘point’ centromeres 1,5 . How this transition occurred has remained unresolved 6 . Here we identify evolutionarily related ‘proto-point’ centromeres that provide a resolution to the evolutionary origins of point centromeres. Proto-point centromeres contain a single centromeric nucleosome positioned over an AT-rich core, accompanied by relaxed organization and sequence variability of flanking cis -elements. In two species, these proto-point centromeres lie within retrotransposon-derived repeat clusters, linking ancestral repeat-rich centromeres to genetically encoded ones. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses indicate that proto-point and point centromeres evolved in an ancestor with retrotransposon-rich centromeres. These results identify long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons, specifically Ty5 sequences, as the genetic substrate for point-centromere evolution and provide a mechanistic route by which an epigenetic centromere can become genetically specified. More broadly, they show how selfish elements can be co-opted to perform essential chromosomal functions.",

          "abstract": "The severity of malaria varies substantially between individuals, but the mechanisms that underlie these differences remain unclear. Because erythrocytes have a key role in malaria biology, genetic variants associated with the development of these cells could inform the mechanisms that determine disease severity. Here we investigate the mechanistic basis of the association of the variant rs112233623-T with erythrocyte properties, and examine its role in modulating malaria severity. This variant is associated with increased levels of haemoglobin A2, increased erythrocyte size and reduced erythrocyte number 1,2 . It is found in an erythroid enhancer of CCND3 , which encodes cyclin D3—a cell-division activator that enhances the pentose phosphate pathway and thereby helps to counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS) 3 . We show that rs112233623-T disrupts a binding site for the transcription factor SMAD3, weakens enhancer activity and, in erythrocyte precursors (erythroblasts), is associated with reduced CCND3 expression and inhibition of the G1–S cell-cycle transition, concomitant with a reduction in the number of erythrocytes and an increase in their size. Using population genetic methods, we observe signatures of positive selection for rs112233623-T in the genetic history of Sardinia, a region in which malaria was once prevalent. Furthermore, we show that parasite growth is impaired in cultured Plasmodium falciparum -infected erythrocytes from rs112233623-T carriers, and that this impairment correlates with ROS levels. This mirrors our observations in erythrocytes from individuals who are deficient in the pentose-phosphate-pathway enzyme G6PD—a trait associated with protection against malaria in some settings—and highlights a common ROS-based mechanism of malaria resistance. Our results suggest that a reduction in CCND3 in erythroblasts constitutes a mechanism of resistance to malaria, and could enable therapeutic interventions.",

ISR signals converge on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which controls cell-intrinsic transcriptional programs that are involved in metabolic adaptation, survival and growth2,3. However, whether the ISR–ATF4 axis influences anti-tumour immune responses remains mostly unknown. Here we show that loss of ATF4 decreases tumour progression considerably in immunocompetent mice, but not in immunocompromised ones, by enhancing T cell-dependent anti-cancer immune responses. An unbiased genetic screen of ATF4-regulated genes identifies lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as the principal ATF4-dependent effector that impairs anti-tumour immunity by favouring infiltration with immunosuppressive interstitial macrophages. Furthermore, we find that LCN2 promotes T cell exclusion and immune evasion in preclinical mouse models, and correlates with decreased T cell infiltration in patients with lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Anti-LCN2 antibodies promote robust anti-tumour T cell responses in mouse models of aggressive solid tumours. Our study shows that the ATF4–LCN2 axis has a cell-extrinsic role in suppressing anti-cancer immunity, and could pave the way for an immunotherapy approach that targets LCN2.",

Here we present a cold-injection method based on pseudo-emulsion, enabling scalable synthesis of PeNCs with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, ~100%) and enhanced stability by injecting precursor solution below 4 °C. In the cold-injection method, PeNCs grow through the assembly of fully coordinated plumbates out of the pseudo-emulsion with the assistance of a demulsifier. We discovered that slow assembly of polybromide plumbates, assisted by cold temperature, is essential for defect suppression, resulting in reproducible, stable and pure-green-emitting PeNCs with near-unity PLQY. Furthermore, this method enables efficient large-scale production, achieving 20-l-scale synthesis with remarkable batch weight while maintaining near-unity PLQY.

IDRs exist in a broad ensemble of structurally distinct conformations. This structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function2,3,4. Here we combine advances in physics-based force fields with the power of multi-modal generative deep learning to develop STARLING, a framework for rapid generation of accurate IDR ensembles and ensemble-aware representations from sequence. STARLING supports environmental conditioning across ionic strengths and demonstrates proof of concept for the interpolative ability of generative models beyond their training domain. Moreover, we enable ensemble refinement under experimental constraints using a Bayesian maximum-entropy reweighting scheme. Beyond ensemble characterization, STARLING sequence representations can be used in multiple ways. We showcase two examples: first, STARLING lets us perform ensemble-based search for ‘biophysical look-alikes’. Second, we demonstrate how these latent representations can be used to accelerate ensemble-first sequence design from weeks or hours per candidate to seconds, enabling library-scale designs. Together, STARLING dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties, complementing bioinformatic protein sequence analysis. We evaluate the accuracy of STARLING against extant experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function and aid the interpretation of experimental data.",

This challenge further complicates unified system design and hinders the realization of high-throughput-density, congestion-free fibre–wireless links under wideband-access scenarios 4 . Here we present an ultra-wideband (UWB) integrated photonics scheme that facilitates fibre–wireless communication over a shared-bandwidth infrastructure. Built on electro–optic (EO) and optic–electro (OE) conversions featuring 3-dB operational bandwidths exceeding 250 GHz and cross-architecture adaptability, our system demonstrates unprecedented data transmission capabilities in both wired and wireless links. Using the same set of devices and powered by the proposed complex bidirectional gated recurrent unit (complex-biGRU) algorithm, ultrahigh single-lane data rates of 512 Gbps for short-reach fibre and, for the first time to the authors’ knowledge, 400-Gbps high-speed wireless transmission have been achieved. Furthermore, high-density access is enabled by an all-optically assisted ultra-broadband wireless scheme. Real-time multichannel 8K video transmission is successfully demonstrated across 86 channels, seamlessly using a spectral range from 138 to 223 GHz. These findings in unified telecommunication development show the potential for the development of high-speed, densified and low-latency communication networks.",

However, recent datasets indicate that some ecosystems may be experiencing widespread oligotrophication—declining N availability—which is suggested to be a response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) 2 . Plant N isotope (δ 15 N) chronologies have served as primary evidence for oligotrophication, but there is wide disagreement whether rising CO 2 or temporal changes in N deposition explain these patterns 3–6 . Here we construct δ 15 N tree-ring chronologies using archived samples from Sweden’s 23.5-million-hectare forest area from 1961 to 2018. The study area spans a 1,500-km latitudinal distance where N deposition varies fourfold, but where rising CO 2 is spatially uniform. Our data show declining δ 15 N chronologies throughout Sweden, including forests in the far north where atmospheric N deposition rates are very low. Linear mixed-effects models showed that rising CO 2 is the strongest predictor of δ 15 N values, whereas N deposition variables, temperature and forest basal area had lower explanatory power. Our findings suggest that elevated atmospheric CO 2 is causing oligotrophication in boreal forests, which has implications for predicting their future role as sinks in the global carbon cycle 7–9 .",

The discovery that PIII and PV phosphorus intermediates can undergo transition metal-like two-electron chemistry raises the question whether radical PIV intermediates can mimic other elementary steps in organometallic chemistry2,3. Here we describe a phosphine-photoredox catalyst system that promotes intermolecular Markovnikov hydroamination of unactivated terminal alkenes with numerous classes of N–H azoles, a reaction that is not possible with late transition metal catalysis. Experimental and computational mechanistic studies support a new elementary step for main group catalysis wherein a phosphine radical cation activates the alkene to nucleophilic amination by the azole, a step otherwise associated with transition metals. Given the broad value of nucleophilic alkene functionalization in transition metal catalysis, this PIV mechanism could offer new opportunities for main group element catalysis and chemical synthesis.",

          "abstract": "Paternal care is rare among mammals and the neural mechanisms governing its emergence are poorly understood1. We leveraged the natural paternal behaviour of African striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio)2,3, and integrated brain-wide cFos mapping, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, virally mediated gene perturbation and environmental manipulation to dissect the neural basis of natural variation in male parenting. Here we find that socio-environmental conditions drive individual variation in male alloparenting such that postweaning social isolation increases paternal care whereas social living in higher density groups increases infanticide. This natural variation in care corresponds to neural activity in the medial preoptic area and changes in correlated activity across brain regions. Within the medial preoptic area, expression of agouti signalling protein (Agouti) in neurons is increased by group housing and is negatively associated with care, and overexpression of Agouti reduces care and enhances infanticide in previously tolerant mice. Naturalistic manipulations further reveal that Agouti integrates long-term housing conditions rather than food availability or hunger. Our findings reveal that variation in male paternal care reflects context-dependent regulation of conserved hypothalamic and melanocortin signalling mechanisms rather than the presence or absence of paternal capacity.",

Previous vaccine strategies against CDI failed to reduce pathogen burden, a prerequisite for preventing C. difficile transmission and recurrence 6–11 . These vaccines were administered parenterally, which induced a systemic immune response, rather than a mucosal response in the colon, the site of infection. Here we compare protection and colonization burden between mucosal (rectal) and parenteral (intraperitoneal) administration routes of a multivalent, adjuvanted vaccine combining inactivated C. difficile toxins and novel surface antigens. We found that mucosal immunization, but not parenteral, clears C. difficile from the host. Unique correlates of decolonization included faecal IgG responses to vegetative surface antigens and a colonic, T helper type 17 (T H 17)-skewed tissue-resident memory T cell response against spore antigen. Importantly, mucosal vaccination protected against morbidity, mortality, tissue damage and recurrence. Our results demarcate notable differences in correlates of protection and pathogen clearance between vaccine administration routes and highlight a mucosal immunization regimen that elicits sterilizing immunity against CDI.",

          "abstract": "The cellular nucleotide pool is a major focal point of the host immune response to viral infection. Immune effector proteins that disrupt the nucleotide pool enable animal and bacterial cells to broadly restrict diverse viruses, but reduced nucleotide availability induces cellular toxicity and can limit host fitness1,2,3,4,5. Here we identify Clover, a bacterial anti-phage defence system that overcomes this trade-off by encoding a deoxynucleoside triphosphohydrolase enzyme (CloA) that dynamically responds to both an activating phage cue and an inhibitory nucleotide immune signal produced by a partnering regulatory enzyme (CloB). Analysis of phage restriction by Clover in cells and reconstitution of enzymatic function in vitro demonstrate that CloA is a dGTPase that responds to viral enzymes that increase cellular levels of dTTP. To restrain CloA activation in the absence of infection, we show that CloB synthesizes a dTTP-related inhibitory nucleotide signal, p3diT (5′-triphosphothymidyl-3′5′-thymidine), that binds to CloA and suppresses activation. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of CloA in activated and suppressed states reveal how dTTP and p3diT control distinct allosteric sites and regulate effector function. Our results define how nucleotide signals coordinate both activation and inhibition of antiviral immunity and explain how cells balance defence and immune-mediated toxicity.",

They are versatile platforms for strongly correlated electronic phenomena3,4 and support new ferroelectric5,6, magnetic7 and superconducting states8. Among incommensurate materials9, moiré materials are aperiodic composite crystals10,11 whose long-wavelength superlattices enable tunable properties without chemically modifying their layers. So far, nearly all reports of moiré materials have investigated van der Waals heterostructures assembled far from thermodynamic equilibrium (T < 150 °C)1,2. Here we introduce a conceptually new approach to synthesizing high-mobility moiré materials in thermodynamic equilibrium. We report a new family of foliated superlattice materials (Sr6TaS8)1+δ(TaS2)8 that are exfoliatable, incommensurate-lattice, van der Waals crystals. Lattice mismatches between alternating layers generate moiré superlattices, analogous to 2D moiré heterobilayer superlattices, which are coherent throughout these crystals and tunable through synthesis conditions without altering their chemical composition. Quantum oscillation measurements map the complex Fermiology of these moiré metals12,13,14, showing that the Fermi surface of the structurally simplest moiré metal comprises more than 40 distinct cross-sectional areas. This is naturally understood by proposing that these bulk moiré metals encode electronic properties of higher-dimensional superspace crystals in ways paralleling well-established crystallographic methods for incommensurate lattices15,16. More broadly, our work demonstrates a scalable synthesis approach potentially capable of producing large-area moiré materials for electronics applications and evidences a new material design concept for accessing phenomena proposed in higher dimensions17,18,19,20,21.",

          "abstract": "Cross-coupling of aryl boronic esters forms a cornerstone of how chemists make molecules. More recently, enantiomerically enriched boronic esters have shown great promise in modular synthesis as versatile building blocks for the rapid construction of diverse molecules. A significant challenge in this area is to employ boronic esters for the catalytic construction of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds, especially those where the reaction site is a stereogenic carbon center. Addressing this challenge would not only expand the utility of boronic esters in the modular synthesis of organic frameworks, but also prove more broadly beneficial in the synthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules.1 In this connection, we have developed a stereospecific C(sp3)–C(sp3) coupling reaction catalyzed by a copper acetylide complex. This reaction operates with four-coordinate boron “ate” complexes while remaining inert to simple functional groups including boronic esters, and thereby enables efficient strategies for modular synthesis of complex molecules. Applications to the synthesis of (–)-spongidepsin and the carbon skeleton of fluvirucinine A1 are described.",

Latin American samples are substantially under-represented in global cancer genomics studies 5 , which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures 6–8 . To address this, we characterized the genome and transcriptome of 123 acral melanoma tumours from 92 Mexican patients—a population notable because of its genetic admixture 9 . Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF , NRAS or NF1 . Although most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations. The tumours with activating BRAF mutations had a transcriptional profile more similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, indicating that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared with other tumours arising in these locations. Transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with recurrence-free and overall survival. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.",

The assembly is stabilized through IN–RNA interactions involving mainly the IN C-terminal domains and RNA backbone. The spacing and orientation of the IN filament repeat units closely matched those of consecutive capsid (CA) hexamers within the mature CA lattice. Using cryo-EM images of native purified HIV-1 cores, we refined the structure of the IN filament as it propagates along the luminal side of the CA lattice. Each IN tetramer within the filament nestled in a CA hexamer, engaging closely with the major homology regions. Substitutions of residues involved in IN–CA contacts yielded eccentric virions with RNA nucleoids located outside of the cores.

Snijders Blok–Campeau syndrome (SNIBCPS)1, which is caused by pathogenic variants in CHD3, manifests with intellectual disability, autistic-like behaviours and motor deficits2. Whether somatic gene correction can reverse such phenotypes in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that modelling the recurrent CHD3 variant p.R1025W in a humanized mouse model (Chd3hR1025W/+) recapitulates key features of SNIBCPS, including reduced CHD3 protein levels and abnormalities in social communication, cognition and motor coordination. We engineered a TadA-embedded adenine base editor (TeABE) and delivered it brain-wide using a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) system and achieved efficient on-target A•T-to-G•C correction across multiple cortical and hippocampal regions with minimal bystander activity. This intervention restored CHD3 levels and ameliorated behavioural abnormalities in vivo. Furthermore, intrathecal dual AAV delivery in nonhuman primates resulted in widespread neuronal transduction and efficient TeABE reconstitution, a result that supports its translational feasibility. These findings establish in vivo base editing as a viable therapeutic approach for CHD3-related neurodevelopmental disease. More broadly, they demonstrate that precise single-base correction in the postnatal brain can restore protein dosage and function, thereby offering a framework for the treatment of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders.",

          "abstract": "Long-term preservation of digital information is vital for safeguarding the knowledge of humanity for future generations. Existing archival storage solutions, such as magnetic tapes and hard disk drives, suffer from limited media lifespans that render them unsuitable for long-term data retention1,2,3. Optical storage approaches, particularly laser writing in robust media such as glass, have emerged as promising alternatives with the potential for increased longevity. Previous work4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 has predominantly optimized individual aspects such as data density but has not demonstrated an end-to-end system, including writing, storing and retrieving information. Here we report an optical archival storage technology based on femtosecond laser direct writing in glass that addresses the practical demands of archival storage, which we call Silica. We achieve a data density of 1.59 Gbit mm−3 in 301 layers for a capacity of 4.8 TB in a 120 mm square, 2 mm thick piece of glass. The demonstrated write regimes enable a write throughput of 25.6 Mbit s−1 per beam, limited by the laser repetition rate, with an energy efficiency of 10.1 nJ per bit. Moreover, we extend the storage ability to borosilicate glass, offering a lower-cost medium and reduced writing and reading complexity. Accelerated ageing tests on written voxels in borosilicate suggest data lifetimes exceeding 10,000 years.",

          "abstract": "The three-dimensional architecture of natural habitats is a key determinant of species biodiversity, harvestable biomass and resilience to disturbance1,2. Indeed, some species, including trees, corals and oysters, alter resource availability and modify biotic and abiotic pressures through their own three-dimensional structures—thereby enhancing their own survival3,4. However, which aspects of the three-dimensional architecture of these ecosystem engineers shape ecosystem dynamics and species survival are rarely examined by empirical studies, leaving much of the broader ecological and conservation impact of ecosystem engineering underexplored4,5,6. Here we show that oyster reefs have combinations of geometric variables that maximize recruit survival, which is a key factor influencing oyster reef growth and persistence. Using three-dimensional habitat designs that capture the full spectrum of natural oyster reef architectures, as well as a geometric theory7 that links habitat surface area, fractal dimension and height, we show that oyster settlement and survival are greatest at particular combinations of fractal dimension and height that minimize predation. Our study provides a template for understanding optimal three-dimensional habitat configurations for habitat restoration projects that are proliferating globally, without targeting key architectural features of habitat space that maximize restoration success8,9.",

          "abstract": "Asgard archaea were pivotal in the origin of complex cellular life1. Heimdallarchaeia (a class within the phylum Asgardarchaeota) are inferred to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. Limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution2,3, including their role in eukaryogenesis. Here we use massive DNA sequencing of marine sediments to obtain 404 Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia and several novel lineages. Analyses of their global distribution revealed they are widespread in marine environments, and many are enriched in variably oxygenated coastal sediments. Detailed metabolic reconstructions and structural predictions suggest that Heimdallarchaeia form metabolic guilds that are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmark proteins of an aerobic lifestyle, including electron transport chain complex (IV), haem biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species detoxification. Heimdallarchaeia also encode novel clades of respiratory membrane-bound hydrogenases with additional Complex I-like subunits, which potentially increase proton-motive force generation and ATP synthesis. Thus, we propose an updated Heimdallarchaeia-centric model of eukaryogenesis in which hydrogen production and aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. This expanded catalogue of Asgard archaeal genomic diversity suggests that bioenergetic factors influenced eukaryogenesis and constitutes a valuable resource for investigations into the origins and evolution of cellular complexity.",

          "abstract": "Organic batteries using abundant and recyclable organic electrode materials provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to commercial lithium-ion batteries1,2,3,4,5, which rely on resource-limited mineral-derived inorganic electrode materials6,7,8. However, the practical use of organic batteries has been severely hindered by the intrinsic insulation and dissolution of organic electrode materials9,10. Here we report practical organic batteries using an n-type conducting polymer cathode, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO), which exhibits excellent mixed ionic and electronic transport and low solubility. The PBFDO cathode maintains its n-doped state throughout the electrochemical processes and exhibits stable and reversible redox characteristics, high electrical conductivities and significant lithium-ion diffusion coefficients, without the need for additional conductive additives. Consequently, ultrahigh-mass-loading polymer cathodes, with mass loadings up to 206 mg cm−2, are realized, delivering a high areal capacity of 42 mAh cm−2 and demonstrating robust cycling stability. Furthermore, practical 2.5 Ah lithium–organic pouch cells were fabricated, achieving an impressive energy density of 255 Wh kg−1. Notably, the conducting polymer cathode operates efficiently over a wide temperature range from −70 °C to 80 °C and demonstrates excellent flexibility and safety, marking considerable potential for applications in extreme conditions and wearable electronics.",

Among these, alternative splicing has been shown to drive cell-type specificity and, when disrupted, is strongly linked to neurological disorders 12–17 . However, genome-wide measurements of mRNA translation with isoform sensitivity at single-cell resolution have not been achieved. To address this, we deployed Surveying Ribosomal Targets by APOBEC-Mediated Profiling (Ribo-STAMP) coupled with short-read and long-read single-cell RNA sequencing in the brain 18 . We generated the first isoform-sensitive single-cell translatomes of the mouse hippocampus at postnatal day 25, discovering cell-type-specific translation of 3,857 alternative transcripts across 1,641 genes and identifying isoforms of the same genes undergoing differential translation within and across 8 different cell types. We defined high and low translational states in CA1 and CA3 neurons, with synaptic and metabolic genes enriched in high states. We found that CA3 exhibited higher basal translation compared with CA1, as confirmed by metabolic labelling of newly synthesized proteins and immunohistochemistry of translational machinery components. This accessible platform will expand our understanding of how cell-type-specific and isoform-specific translation drives brain physiology and disease.",

          "abstract": "Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects ≈90-95% of the global population1,2 and persists in B cells as a life-long infection3. Prior EBV-infection is associated with autoimmune and neoplastic disease4. Still, the biological basis of host control during EBV persistence remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of non-genetic and genetic factors that are associated with EBV control during persistent infection. Using blood-based genome sequence (GS) data from 486,315 UK Biobank and 336,123 All of Us participants, we identified short read-pairs mapping to the EBV genome in 16.2% and 21.8% of individuals, respectively. EBV-read detection (EBVread+) reflects increased viral load in blood cells, as shown by orthogonal measurements, and was associated with HIV infection, immunosuppressive drug intake, and current smoking. Genome-wide analyses of EBVread+ identified strong associations at the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), including 54 independent HLA-alleles of MHC class I and II, and at 27 genomic regions outside MHC. Epistasis with distinct HLA-alleles of MHC class I was observed at the ERAP2 locus. Analysis of individuals with EBV-associated diseases4 revealed a higher polygenic burden of EBVread+ for HLA-alleles at MHC class I in multiple sclerosis (driven by HLA-A*02:01), and at MHC class II in rheumatoid arthritis. Phenome-wide analyses identified a polygenic overlap of EBVread+ with inflammatory bowel disease, hypothyroidism, and type 1 diabetes. Our study establishes by-products of human GS as a surrogate marker of EBV viral load. This will facilitate investigation and treatment for EBV and other persistent viral infections.",

          "abstract": "The fundamental characteristics of math ability in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), specifically proficiency and variability, remain inadequately understood. Here, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we addressed this gap by synthesizing evidence on math ability in autistic individuals relative to the non-autistic population. Searches in multiple databases yielded 66 studies. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. Random-effects meta-analyses used Hedges’ g and natural logarithm of variability ratio (lnVR) as effect sizes. Publication bias was adjusted for using the precision-effect test and precision-effect estimate with standard errors, as well as a three-parameter selection model. Results show that, compared with the non-autistic population, as represented by standardized norms (mean 100, s.d. 15; 3,051 participants) and typically developing (TD) control groups (2,351 participants), individuals with ASD exhibit significantly lower math scores (ASD versus norms: Hedges’ g = −0.360, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.605 to −0.114; ASD versus TD: Hedges’ g = −0.696, 95% CI −0.947 to −0.445) and greater variability (ASD versus norms: lnVR 0.159, 95% CI 0.102 to 0.216; ASD versus TD: lnVR 0.298, 95% CI 0.199 to 0.396). Group discrepancies were moderated by intelligence, age or their interactions. The math–intelligence relationship in ASD provides a theoretical framework for understanding their mathematical development. In addition, the ASD–TD discrepancy has widened over the past four decades. These findings underscore the need for sustained, individualized mathematical education for ASD and investigation of the developmental trajectories of mathematical skills in ASD. Methodological challenges in the field included potential publication bias and insufficient rigour in sample matching.",

          "abstract": "This research explores the impact of large language models (LLMs) on consumer complaints submitted to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Analysing 1,134,512 complaints from 2015 to 2024, we document a sharp increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. An instrumental variable analysis estimates that LLM usage increases the probability of obtaining favourable relief by 6.9 percentage points (95% confidence interval, (4.9, 8.9)). The analysis also reveals evidence of negative selection, where consumers otherwise prone to adverse outcomes are more likely to adopt LLMs. To further substantiate these findings and test the mechanism, we conducted three online controlled experiments (total N = 1,010 US participants); these demonstrate that LLMs can increase the likelihood of obtaining relief by enhancing the presentation of complaints without altering factual content. These findings suggest that LLMs can act as an equalizer, highlighting the need for policies that expand access to these technologies.",

          "abstract": "Narratives about the motivations and conditions for mass violence as a persistent feature of conflict throughout human history have evolved in complexity and materiality. Victims of these events are key for understanding the evolution and transformative power of violent behaviour as it developed from simple intergroup conflict to more strategic mass violence. Here we present the results of a bioarchaeological study of 77 and biomolecular analysis of 25 individuals from a ninth-century BCE mass grave from Gomolava in the Carpathian Basin, Southeast Europe. The site is located at the interface of complex sociospatial relations, divergent cultural traditions and values, and competing ideologies of landscape use. We show that excessive lethal violence enacted mostly on women and children suggests a selective demographic bias. The people buried together shared few, even distant, genetic relationships, and so their killing presents striking evidence for an episode of cross-regional conflict and an underlying aggressive shift in power, violence and gender relations in the region. Gomolava provides evidence consistent with deliberate annihilation of select sections of a regional population as a motivation for mass violence behaviour in later prehistoric Europe. It also shines new light on the socioeconomic agency and importance of women and young individuals in later European prehistory.",

          "abstract": "Human sex ratios at birth (SRBs) shape population composition and are closely linked to maternal health and gender discrimination. In the context of environmental change, SRBs may theoretically be skewed by physiological or behavioral responses to exposure to extreme heat. However, evidence for this is limited. In this study, we estimate the effect of prenatal exposure to temperature on birth sex by linking survey data on 5 million live births in 33 sub-Saharan African countries and India with high-resolution temperature data. To distinguish between spontaneous and induced abortions, we exploit sociodemographic differentials, exposure timing, and regional differences in son preference. We find that days with a maximum temperature above 20 °C are negatively associated with male births in both regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, we observe fewer male births after high first-trimester temperature exposure, consistent with increased spontaneous abortions from maternal heat stress. This is particularly true for births by mothers in rural areas, with little formal education, and for higher birth orders. By contrast, in India, we find that second-trimester temperature exposure is associated with fewer male births, consistent with reductions in induced sex-selective abortions. As expected, these reductions are concentrated in high birth orders and older mothers. We also find large reductions in male births by sonless mothers in northern Indian states, where son preference is greater. These findings demonstrate that heat exposure harms maternal health, increases prenatal mortality, and influences family planning behavior, leading to a complex effect on SRBs.",

          "abstract": "The presence of high levels of PM 2.5 pollution is a major health threat in India. We evaluate the benefits of reducing ambient PM 2.5 and household air pollution from a 2019 baseline, when over 70% of the population of India was exposed to annual average PM 2.5 of more than 40 μg/m 3 and 56% of households burned solid fuels for cooking. We estimate the health benefits from reduced mortality that arise when lowering ambient PM 2.5 to the India standard (40 μg/m 3 ) and to two World Health Organization (WHO) interim standards (25 μg/m 3 and 15 μg/m 3 ). The benefits of the ambient standards are moderated by the high levels of household air pollution to which people are exposed due to the concavity of the exposure–response function. We therefore examine the benefits of achieving each standard paired with a 50% reduction in the percentage of households burning solid fuels. Annual mortality reductions from the combined policies exceed 300,000 lives saved for the India standard, 500,000 lives saved for the WHO 25 μg/m 3 interim standard, and 675,000 lives saved for the WHO 15 μg/m 3 interim standard. The economic benefits of each of these joint policies equal 2.2%, 3.6%, and 4.9% of Indian gross domestic product (GDP), using a Value per Statistical Life of 100 times per capita GDP. Results underscore the importance of considering household air pollution when evaluating ambient standards and the synergistic benefits of combined policies when the exposure–response function is concave.",

          "abstract": "Negative social ties, or “hasslers,” are pervasive yet understudied components of social networks that may accelerate biological aging and morbidity. Using ego-centric network data and DNA methylation-based biological aging clocks (i.e., DunedinPACE and age-accelerated GrimAge2) from saliva from a state representative probability sample in Indiana, we examine how negative social ties are associated with accelerated biological aging and a broad range of health outcomes, including inflammation and multimorbidity. Negative relationships are not rare within close relationships, as nearly 30% of individuals report having at least one hassler in their network. These hasslers tend to occupy peripheral network positions and are more likely to be connected through weak, uniplex ties. Importantly, exposure to negative social ties follows patterns of social and health vulnerability, with women, daily smokers, people in poorer health, and those with adverse childhood experiences more likely to report having hasslers in their networks. Having more hasslers is associated with accelerated biological aging in both rate and cumulative burden: Each additional hassler corresponds to approximately 1.5% faster pace of aging and roughly 9 mo older biological age. Moreover, not all hasslers exert the same influence; kin and nonkin hasslers show detrimental associations, whereas spouse hasslers do not. Finally, a greater number of hasslers is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes beyond epigenetic aging. These findings together highlight the critical role of negative social ties in biological aging as chronic stressors and the need for interventions that reduce harmful social exposures to promote healthier aging trajectories.",

          "abstract": "Autonomy promotes important psychological outcomes. Although cooperation and competition are the building blocks of social interactions, little is known about how they shape feelings of autonomy in dyads, teams, and work organizations. We hypothesize that cooperation liberates relative to competition and situations that are neither cooperative nor competitive. We theorize that this effect emerges because cooperation facilitates social support and psychological safety, whereas competition promotes social threat and stress. We found support for this hypothesis in nine studies ( N total = 16,669) that used survey, archival, and experimental methods, diverse samples, and different operationalizations of cooperative and competitive environments, as well as two kinds of environments that are neither cooperative nor competitive (i.e., independence and unknown interdependence). Studies 1 to 3 found that perceived situational cooperation correlated positively with feelings of autonomy among varsity athletes and employees. Study 3 also provided initial evidence for the proposed mechanisms. To provide causal evidence, Study 4 used an incentivized decision-making task in which we experimentally created cooperative, competitive, and independent situations. Participants felt greater autonomy under cooperative vs. competitive and independent incentive structures. Study 5 found evidence for our hypothesized mechanisms in an experiment conducted in the context of negotiation. Four supplemental studies replicated our experimental findings, extended them to another incentivized decision-making task, and established the causal effect of social threat and stress on autonomy. Overall, our findings underscore the liberating effects of cooperative situations relative to competitive situations and situations that are neither cooperative nor competitive, with consequences for people’s feelings, motivation, and well-being.",

          "abstract": "Humans have been using psychoactive substances for millennia, despite their potential negative health and social consequences. According to some scholars, our craving for mind-altering drugs is an evolutionary mistake—a hijacking of our reward system. In contrast, the “drunk hypothesis” argues that intoxication has been adaptive and essential for the rise of large-scale societies because it promotes social bonding, increases cooperation, alleviates stress, and enhances human creativity. Here, we test this hypothesis using the example of kava, a traditional Pacific beverage with a range of psychoactive effects, made from the root of Piper methysticum . Our analysis of 83 Oceanic-speaking societies shows a positive relationship between traditional kava consumption and both political complexity and social stratification. However, the results are not robust to controls for nonindependence. Moreover, we found no evidence of coevolution between kava drinking and either of the two sociopolitical traits after controlling for spatial nonindependence. Despite the cultural significance of kava in many Pacific societies, our results suggest that its consumption was unlikely to have been a major driver of sociopolitical complexity, underscoring the importance of controlling for nonindependence in cross-cultural studies.",

          "abstract": "Pedestrian routing choices play a crucial role in shaping collective crowd dynamics, yet the influence of interactions among unfamiliar individuals remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.",

          "abstract": "The Hippo pathway, which is highly conserved from Drosophila to mammals, plays a crucial role in regulating organ size and tissue homeostasis. Dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to various diseases, including tumors. The pathway controls the subcellular localization of the transcription coactivator Yki through core kinases Hpo and Wts, ultimately influencing the expression of target genes. Extensive studies have shown that most components in this pathway undergo posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Nevertheless, the role of acetylation in Hippo signaling is still not fully understood. In this study, we find that Hpo is subject to reversible acetylation by Nej and Hdac3, thereby regulating its stability. Loss of Hdac3 leads to an increase in the expression of Hippo target genes, which is completely rescued by overexpressing Wts, positioning Hdac3 upstream of Wts. Although Hdac3 localizes in both the cell cytoplasm and nucleus, only the cytoplasmic Hdac3 is involved in regulating the Hippo pathway, where it interacts with Hpo to deacetylate and stabilize it. Additionally, knockdown of the acetyltransferase Nej decreases the expression of Hippo target genes, a phenotype that can be reversed by simultaneously silencing Hdac3. Taken together, these findings shed light on the role of reversible acetylation in controlling the Hippo pathway and provide insights into growth regulation and potential therapeutic approaches for related diseases.",

          "abstract": "Plasma membrane (PM) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P 2 ] regulates indispensable processes such as exocytosis, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in eukaryotic cells. Since phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P] has long been regarded as the primary precursor of PI(4,5)P 2 , perturbing PM PI(4)P is expected to impact the dynamics of PM PI(4,5)P 2 . Yet, recent evidence suggests that PM PI(4)P has a limited role in the synthesis and function of PI(4,5)P 2 . In this paper, we address this puzzling discrepancy by studying the collective dynamics of PM PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 . Leveraging live-cell imaging, we observed periodic traveling waves of PI(4)P on the PM of mast cells, challenging the notion that this precursor lipid is spatially homogeneous at the PM. We then found that a reduction in PM PI(4)P synthesis rate attenuated PI(4,5)P 2 oscillation amplitude while conserving the total PM density of PI(4,5)P 2 . We assessed the functional consequences of PI(4,5)P 2 oscillation amplitude by examining its interplay with Rho GTPase Cdc42, which cooperatively regulates the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton with PI(4,5)P 2 . We showed that both PM PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P 2 oscillations are coupled to oscillations of membrane-bound active Cdc42. Finally, we demonstrated that lowering PM PI(4)P synthesis rate alone was sufficient to reversibly quench Cdc42 oscillations and to suppress F-actin oscillations. These results suggest that, beyond the steady-state regime, oscillations of PI(4,5)P 2 and its effector proteins require a critical threshold of PI(4)P flux.",

          "abstract": "Cancer cells migrate through regions of tissue confinement during metastasis, causing nuclear envelope (NE) rupture, which generates heritable DNA damage and disease aggression. We sought to determine if NE rupture was intrinsic to malignant transformation and seek a mechanistic cause. We found that metastatic cells from multiple cancer subtypes have increased NE fragility in confinement compared to their benign counterparts. Meta-analysis of transcriptomic data from clinical samples of melanoma progression together with an siRNA-based live-cell confinement screen revealed that lamin B receptor (LBR) transcriptional upregulation correlates with melanoma progression and NE fragility. LBR is an inner nuclear membrane protein (INM) that scaffolds lamins and chromatin and has sterol reductase activity in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Applying superresolution and atomic force microscopies to characterize the cellular and biophysical events leading to NE rupture revealed that upregulated LBR increased nuclear deformability and can generate local ruptures of the INM, promoting blebs in the nuclear membrane that burst to release nuclear contents into the cytoplasm. Structure–function analysis showed that LBR’s sterol reductase activity is required for its promotion of NE fragility in cells confined in vitro. Use of tumor organoids and an in vivo melanoma model revealed that upregulation of LBR was associated with increased NE fragility, metastatic invasion, and decreased patient survival.

          "abstract": "Nuclear Envelope Membrane Protein 1 (NEMP1) is crucial for metazoan fertility; loss of Nemp1 causes death of primordial oocytes that reside in the mechanically challenging ovarian cortex. Here, we show that softening the ovary rescues oocyte loss and restores fertility in N emp1 knockout (KO) mice. In cell culture, NEMP1 depletion on stiff substrates leads to death, while cells remain viable on soft substrates. We further show that NEMP1 regulates YAP nuclear translocation, essential for mechanotransduction. Mechanistically, Nemp1-depleted cells on stiff substrates or subjected to stretching exhibit reduced nuclear YAP localization, and expressing nuclear YAP5SA restores cell viability. Loss of NEMP1 disrupts actin organization. Inducing actin polymerization partially rescues nuclear YAP, indicating a role for F-actin in NEMP1 mediated mechanotransduction. NEMP1 forms a complex with NESPRIN’s Klarsicht, Anchorage (ANC)-1, Syne Homology (KASH) domain, strengthening the actin cytoskeleton to withstand mechanical forces, independent of SUN proteins. Thus, the Nemp1–Nesprin complex supports a mechanosensitive pathway parallel to the LINC complex, enabling cellular response to mechanical stress in vitro and in vivo.",

          "abstract": "Cardenolides, widely distributed across multiple plant families, have long been utilized in traditional and modern medicine for treating heart failure and various cancers. Despite progress in understanding the initial steps of cardenolide biosynthesis, the evolutionary mechanisms behind the production of structurally diverse cardenolides across plant families remain poorly understood. Here, we report the genome sequence of Periploca sepium Bunge, a member of the Apocynaceae family, and identify two closely linked genes— PsCYP87 and Ps14βPH —governing sterol side-chain cleavage and C14β-hydroxylation, respectively. Although CYP87A enzymes are known to initiate cardenolide biosynthesis in other species, PsCYP87, now classified in the CYP87N subfamily, appears to have evolved independently within the Apocynaceae. Moreover, Ps14βPH contains an unusual plastid-targeting transit peptide and is specific to the family. Notably, 14β-hydroxy pregnenolone, the product of Ps14βPH, was not previously considered as a biosynthetic precursor for cardenolides. However, through gene silencing and isotope labeling experiments, we show that it functions as a precursor in P. sepium . Our findings uncover diverse evolutionary mechanisms—such as the co-opted enzyme pair, atypical subcellular localization, and enzyme convergence at the subfamily level—that underscore the remarkable ability of plants to independently evolve complex metabolic pathways for specialized metabolism. These findings also identify enzyme classes that catalyze a rare stereo-inverted hydroxylation reaction unique to cardenolide biosynthesis.",

          "abstract": "The skin epidermis is a multilayered lipid rich organ completely reliant on exogenous delivery and uptake of the essential fatty linoleate for the synthesis of acylceramides required for barrier function. Disruption of the epidermal skin barrier is a common clinical feature for prevalent diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The granulosum layer of the epidermis contains specialized secretory keratinocytes that synthesize and secrete lamellar bodies (LB), making it likely that this epidermal layer has a high demand for phosphatidylcholine. While the pathway for acylceramide biosynthesis and roles in barrier formation has been largely elucidated, the mechanisms by which keratinocytes acquire phospholipid for the demands of lipid barrier maintenance and repair are not entirely understood. Here, we demonstrate that Mfsd2a, a lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) transporter, is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes and mediates the uptake of a plasma-derived LPC fluorescent probe. Epidermal-specific deficiency of Mfsd2a in mice resulted in dermatitis and defective desquamation of the epidermis, and inducible deletion of Mfsd2a in primary mouse keratinocytes in vitro prevented their epidermal stratification. Untargeted lipidomic analysis indicated that Mfsd2a deficiency resulted in a significantly altered phospholipidome, with specific reductions in linoleic acid in phosphatidylcholine and triglycerides in the epidermis. Functional studies using primary human keratinocytes demonstrated that LPC-oleate and LPC-linoleate promoted keratinocyte differentiation in a Mfsd2a-dependent manner. Our findings identify a pathway by which keratinocytes acquire plasma-derived LPC via Mfsd2a transport for the maintenance of normal keratinocyte phosphatidylcholine pools and for optimal keratinocyte differentiation.",

          "abstract": "Hallucinated facts in large language models have recently been shown to obey a statistical lower bound determined by the monofact rate (related to the classical Good-Turing missing mass estimator) minus model miscalibration [A. T. Kalai, S. S. Vempala, “Calibrated language models must hallucinate” in Proceedings of the 56th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) (New York, NY, USA, 2024), pp. 160–171]. We present empirical investigation of this three-way relationship in classical n -gram models and fine-tuned transformer models. By generating training data from Pareto distributions with varying shape parameters, we systematically control the monofact rate and establish its positive relationship with hallucination. To bridge theory and practice, we derive an empirical analog of the hallucination bound by replacing the population miscalibration term (Section 1.1) with an empirical bin-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and confirm its practical viability. We then introduce selective upweighting—a simple yet effective technique that strategically repeats as little as 5% of training examples—to deliberately inject miscalibration into the model. This intervention reduces hallucination by up to 40%, challenging universal deduplication policies. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off: selective upweighting maintains preinjection levels of accuracy while substantially reducing hallucination, whereas standard training gradually improves accuracy but fails to address persistently high hallucination, indicating an inherent tension in optimization objectives.",

          "authors": "Sonali Puri, Jiun Sang, Prakash Pandey, Youngseok Lee",
          "abstract": "Salt intake must be tightly regulated: Too little compromises physiological function, while too much is harmful. Animals therefore display an adaptive salt appetite, dynamically switching between attraction and avoidance depending on internal sodium status. Although this behavioral flexibility is well documented, the central brain mechanisms that link internal salt need to changes in sensory-driven behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a brain-centered neuroendocrine circuit that enables adaptive regulation of salt appetite in Drosophila melanogaster . Using targeted genetic screens, we show that leucokinin ( Lk ), its receptor ( Lkr ), and the insulin-like peptide Ilp2 are essential for shifting salt preference according to sodium deprivation. Under salt-sated conditions, high salt remains aversive. In contrast, salt-deprivation selectively activates Lk neurons in the anterior leucokinin (ALK) region, which in turn recruit Lkr -expressing insulin-producing cells (IPCs), also referred to as medial neurosecretory cells, to promote salt-seeking behavior. Functional imaging and circuit manipulation demonstrate that silencing either neuronal population abolishes this adaptive switch, whereas pathway activation overrides innate salt aversion through PKA-dependent signaling. Notably, both ALK neurons and IPCs directly detect extracellular sodium independent of synaptic input, identifying them as central sodium sensors that couple internal state to behavioral output. Together, our findings define a neuroendocrine mechanism by which the brain adaptively recalibrates salt appetite to maintain internal homeostasis. This work provides a conceptual framework for state-dependent nutrient seeking and suggests conserved principles relevant to salt balance disorders in mammals.",

Metabolomic profiling and isotopic tracing revealed upregulated non-oxPPP flux in effector (T eff ) and memory (T m ) CD8 + T cells, enabling a pentose cycle that amplifies NADPH yield and sustains metabolic fitness for T cell immunity. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of Tkt or Taldo1 impaired NADPH production, leading to ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) accumulation, oxidative stress, reduced lipid synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and compromised T eff cell proliferation, cytokine production, and antitumor efficacy. Conversely, enhancing non-oxPPP activity promoted T m differentiation, persistence, and recall responses. Targeting the non-oxPPP represents a promising strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy and vaccine efficacy by bolstering T cell effector and memory responses.",

          "abstract": "The transport of deformable self-propelling objects like bacteria, worms, snakes, and robots through heterogeneous environments is poorly understood. Here we use experiment, simulation, and theory to study a snake-like robot as it undulates without sensory feedback through a linear array of boulder-like hemispherical obstacles. The profile of the boulder landscape approximates a one-dimensional potential for quantum waves introduced by Aubry and André (AA), who found that wave function localization occurs when this potential is sufficiently aperiodic. This behavior is related to the phenomenon of Anderson localization, where waves localize in the presence of a sufficiently random potential. When the boulder landscape is periodic, the robot passes through the array. But if the landscape is sufficiently aperiodic, the robot becomes trapped. The metrics we use to quantify this transition—including exponential distributions of robot position when localized—agree well with earlier experimental and theoretical work on a localization transition that occurs when quantum waves interact with the AA potential. A theoretical treatment of the robot’s motion using resistive force theory modified to include spatially varying drag forces reproduces the behavior we observe. Further, our results indicate that the transition is generated by large fluctuations in the driving torques required for self-propulsion. These results point to an unexpected connection between the Hamiltonian mechanics of quantum and classical wave systems and the highly dissipative, continuously driven, and far-from-equilibrium dynamics of active embodied waves in nonperiodic landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Lateralization of neuronal functions plays a critical role in regulating behavioral flexibility, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are challenging to establish at a single-neuron level. We previously showed that attraction of Caenorhabditis elegans to a medium-chain alcohol switches to avoidance in a uniform background of a second attractive odorant. This context-dependent behavioral plasticity is mediated by symmetric inversion of the odor-evoked response sign in the bilateral AWC olfactory neurons. Here, we show that this symmetric response plasticity is driven by asymmetric molecular mechanisms in the AWC neuron pair. Mutations in the gcy-12 receptor guanylyl cyclase abolish odor response plasticity only in AWC OFF ; the opposite odor-evoked response signs in AWC OFF and AWC ON in gcy-12 mutants result in these animals being behaviorally indifferent to this chemical. We find that gcy-12 is expressed, and required, in both AWC neurons to regulate odor response plasticity only in AWC OFF . We further show that disruption of AWC fate lateralization results in loss of asymmetry in the response plasticity in gcy-12 mutants. Our results indicate that symmetric neuronal response plasticity can arise from asymmetric underlying molecular mechanisms and suggest that lateralization of signaling pathways in defined conditions may enhance neuronal and behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, we find that their energy landscape is better represented by a connected network of inherent structures than a collection of isolated TLS. Each connection is a single energy barrier between two minima, and a network is connected if all states (minima) can be reached from any given state. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.",

Comparative analyses to help disentangle the functions of insect SSB are lacking. To address this, we quantified male–male interactions in controlled trials across eight North American field cricket species ( Gryllus spp.). While limited taxonomic sampling precluded a formal phylogenetic comparative analysis, we were able to assess variation across species with structural equation models. Using this technique, we distinguished focal from partner influences and evaluated support for mistaken identity vs. other models of SSB. SSB expression varied extensively across species. It was always associated with reduced aggression, but the strength of this association and the balance of focal vs. partner effects varied. Temporal analysis of behavioral interactions showed that males exhibited SSB while able to discern the sex of their partner. These findings, along with observations of a previously undescribed sexual behavior not seen in different-sex interactions, imply a history of adaptive evolution inconsistent with mistaken identity SSB.",

          "abstract": "Promotion of remyelination has become a new therapeutic avenue, to prevent neuronal degeneration and promote recovery in white matter diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Clemastine fumarate among several promyelinating agents, has been validated as a promyelinating agent in rodents and has led to a first successful double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating a remyelinating therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) [A. J. Green et al. , Lancet 390 , 2481–2489 (2017)]. To date, most of promyelinating strategies have been developed in short-lived rodent models of demyelination, which spontaneously repair. Well-defined nonhuman primate models closer to man would allow to efficiently advance therapeutic approaches, and namely to assess noninvasively, their efficacy in promoting functional repair. We developed a nonhuman primate model of optic nerve demyelination which leads to failed remyelination, progressive neuronal degeneration, and visual dysfunction, thus recapitulating several features of MS lesions and providing the missing link to translate emerging preclinical therapies to the clinic for myelin disorders such as multiple sclerosis [N. Sarrazin et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 119 , e2115973119 (2022)]. We used this model to assay the therapeutic benefits of clemastine. Our histological and ultrastructural findings show that clemastine is able to overcome the failed remyelination of the nonhuman primate optic nerve. We also used visual evoked potential, optical coherence tomography, and electroretinogram as noninvasive means to follow up the optic nerve de/remyelination process and correlated these findings with postmortem analysis to establish the safety and efficacy of clemastine therapy in promoting functional and morphological recovery in nonhuman primates. We demonstrate that clemastine can overcome chronic demyelination in nonhuman primates.",

          "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved a remarkable strategy to thrive in hostile environments by creating well-organized microcommunities known as biofilms. Biofilms pose a serious global health challenge due to their contribution to antibiotic resistance and suppression of the effectiveness of immune responses, thereby exacerbating pathogenic conditions. Biofilm-dwelling bacteria are difficult to eliminate since the cells are embedded within a self-produced, intricate 3D extracellular matrix composed of protein polymers (amyloids), polysaccharides, and extracellular nucleic acids. The robustness of the matrix poses a significant challenge to curb biofilm infections. Moreover, there is a lacuna in understanding how biofilm may be controlled under physiological conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the role of host proteins in keeping a check on biofilm formation. In the present study, we have established β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 m), a human protein integral to innate immunity, as a potent inhibitor of biofilm formation in Escherichia coli . Our comprehensive biophysical, biochemical, computational, microscopic, and in vivo analyses revealed that β 2 m effectively prevents E. coli biofilm formation by specifically inhibiting amyloid curli, a major matrix component of E. coli biofilm. In a rat skin wound infection model, β 2 m significantly accelerated wound healing, underscoring its therapeutic potential against biofilm infections. Our results illustrate a crucial function of β 2 m as an endogenous antibiofilm and anticurli protein, provides a host-derived strategy to combat biofilm infections, and presents a method to augment existing antimicrobial therapies.",

          "abstract": "Amorphous materials driven away from equilibrium display a diverse repertoire of complex, history-dependent behaviors. One striking feature is a failure to return to equilibrium after an abrupt change in otherwise static external conditions. Instead, amorphous materials often exhibit physical aging: an ever-slowing, nonexponential relaxation that can span a huge range of timescales. Here, we examine the aging behavior of three different amorphous materials subjected to slow periodic driving. The results reveal a generic aging phenomenon characterized by a logarithmic decay of dissipation per cycle. This observation is evaluated against several mesoscopic models of amorphous matter that successfully capture aging under static conditions: i) a collection of noninteracting relaxation processes ii) a noisy hysteron model with random pairwise interactions, and iii) a structural model consisting of a random network of bistable elastic bonds. We find that only the latter model reproduces all experimental findings and relates its success to its persistent, slow exploration of a complex energy landscape with clear signatures of replica symmetry breaking. Thus, cyclic driving emerges as a simple yet powerful protocol to characterize amorphous materials, probe their complex energy landscapes, and distinguish between different models.",

          "abstract": "Evolution is a historical process whose trajectories are determined in part by the introduction of new phenotypes. Although most phenotypes have evolved repeatedly within and among clades of organisms, others are unique and apparently originated only once, and even the earliest occurrences of repeated traits were unique for their time. To investigate the timing and circumstances of these unique events, we compiled adult skeletal phenotypes with single origins and first occurrences of repeated traits as recorded in the fossil record in the phylum Mollusca. Of the 24 unique and 72 repeated traits we considered, 46 (48%) originated during the first 96 m.y. of molluscan history (frequency 1 per 2.1 m.y.) and only 50 in the 444 m.y. since then (frequency 1 per 8.9 m.y.), with secondary peaks of frequency in the Triassic and Cenozoic. We interpret this finding to mean that molluscan evolutionary history has become substantially more predictable over time despite increasing diversity. Expansions of the phylum from its ancestral marine epifaunal benthic environment to other habitats including fresh water and dry land were generally not associated with unique or earliest occurrences of repeated phenotypes. Most of the innovations enhanced individual defense or activity and were therefore honed by interactions within and among species, although it remains possible that they originated in temporarily permissive conditions in which genetic and other constraints were relaxed.",

However, clinical translation is limited by poor cell survival and engraftment in a hostile injury microenvironment, where detachment-induced anoikis and insufficient extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion compromise their therapeutic efficacy. Here, we engineered MSCs with surface-anchored von Willebrand factor A3 domain (vWF A3), a natural collagen-binding domain with exceptional affinity for type I and III collagen, to simultaneously confer collagen-targeting and prosurvival functionalities. The vWF A3-modified MSCs (vWF A3-MSCs) exhibited enhanced collagen-binding capacity, improving retention in myocardial infarction (MI) and osteoarthritis (OA) lesions. Beyond adhesion, vWF A3-MSCs demonstrated improved reparative capacity and anoikis resistance, driven by the activation of ECM–receptor interaction and integrin β3 signaling. These modifications promoted proangiogenic effects via mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation while enhancing cell survival through Hippo pathway suppression. In vivo studies confirmed the superior therapeutic efficacy of vWF A3-MSCs in both MI and OA models, highlighting how the artificially constructed collagen-targeting receptors on cell and ECM-adhesion-targeted strategy reprogram cellular fate and enhance therapeutic efficacy in stem cell–based regenerative medicine.",

          "abstract": "Marine ecosystems are facing multiple pressures from human activities, such as fishing and nutrient inputs from farming and agriculture, compounded by the global effects of climate change. As a result, the ecosystem services that societies depend on are at risk from the cumulative impact of these pressures. To better understand how different ecosystems respond, it is essential to assess their resilience. While predicting ecosystem resilience remains challenging, significant progress has been made in developing methods to measure it. In this study, we assessed resilience in four northern European marine ecosystems: the Icelandic Waters, the Barents Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the North Sea, spanning 3 to 5 decades. “Folded stability landscapes” were constructed for the Baltic and North Sea. This region provides a unique setting, with a south-north gradient from temperate to subarctic environments and a southeast-northwest gradient from open to semienclosed topographies. The Icelandic Waters and Barents Sea evolved relatively continuously, while the Baltic Sea and North Sea underwent more drastic changes. By comparing results across these gradients, we explore the role of isolation, level of pressures, and food web complexity in shaping resilience patterns and discuss the implications for managing resilient marine ecosystems in the future.",

However, the molecular mechanisms driving this process remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), a protein associated with a severe neurodevelopmental condition known as CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), as a critical regulator of structural plasticity at excitatory synapses. We show that CDKL5 undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and in cultured neurons, forming cocondensates with PSD95. This LLPS-driven process spatially organizes synaptic components, specifically enabling the synaptic recruitment of Kalirin7 to promote dendritic spine enlargement. Pathogenic mutations disrupt condensate formation by impairing the LLPS capacity of CDKL5, directly linking phase separation defects to the pathogenesis of CDD. Our findings reveal a crucial role for CDKL5 in synaptic plasticity and establish LLPS as a fundamental mechanism by which CDKL5 coordinates molecular events to reorganize PSD architecture during synaptic remodeling.",

Understanding the climate response to such natural forcings is essential for obtaining reliable estimates of its response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. While the climate impacts of volcanic sulfate aerosols are well documented, other natural forcings—including wildfire smoke reaching the stratosphere and water vapor injections from a submarine eruption—pose new challenges for detecting and attributing their atmospheric temperature impacts. Here, we demonstrate robust detection of statistically significant temperature anomalies in the troposphere and stratosphere using multidecadal satellite observations and internal variability estimates from a climate model ensemble and from observations. We analyze three landmark events: the 1991 Pinatubo eruption, the 2019-2020 Australian wildfires, and the 2022 Hunga Tonga eruption. Each leaves a fingerprint with distinct altitudinal, geographical, and temporal structure. The global-mean stratospheric signal from Australian wildfires is detectable even in time averages extending beyond 10 mo, despite injecting only ~5% of Pinatubo’s aerosol mass. For Hunga Tonga, we detect significant and prolonged stratospheric cooling, but no robust tropospheric signal in the first 2 y. These findings show that both sulfate and nonsulfate stratospheric perturbations produce distinct, statistically identifiable global temperature signals. Accounting for such forcings in climate model simulations is therefore essential for improving comparisons of simulated and observed variability.",

MCM2–7 not bound to DNA forms a single hexamer (SH) with an open DNA entry gate between MCM2 and MCM5. Two MCM2–7 SHs can be loaded sequentially to form the double hexamer (DH) that encircles the DNA duplex. Activated MCM2–7 then unwinds DNA and initiates DNA replication. Our cryoelectron microscopy analyses show that a fraction of human MCM2–7 without DNA exists as DH. Unexpectedly, we find that the MCM3 winged helix domain (WHD) docks on MCM2 in both DNA-free DH and SH, creating a safety latch across the DNA entry gate to block DNA entry into the central channel. The safety latch can be opened by ORC-CDC6 binding. Perturbing this latch by structure-based or disease-related mutations of MCM3 causes replication defects and DNA damage checkpoint activation. Shortening the MCM3 linker between the helicase domain and WHD alleviates the cell cycle defects of the latch-strengthening mutation. Our findings uncover a regulated step in MCM2–7 loading with implications for human diseases.",

          "abstract": "In daily life, living beings encounter a continuous stream of mixed information, which has to be disentangled by the brain to form proper representations. Using computational modeling, we demonstrate that the interplay between dendritic calcium–mediated action potentials (dCaAPs) with synaptic plasticity and rewiring can enable single neurons to successfully perform this complex task. Compared to other types of dendritic spikes, dCaAPs exhibit a high triggering threshold, large, but graded spike amplitude, with lower amplitudes for stronger synaptic inputs. We show that these properties enable neurons to successfully learn to represent discrete items from a continuous input stream by facilitating the clustering of synapses with temporally correlated presynaptic activities onto the same dendritic branch. In comparison to N-methyl-D-aspartate spikes, dendrites generating dCaAPs can form representations of individual items more efficiently, independent of the temporal order of their presentation during learning—whether randomly, sequentially, as part of a random stream of simultaneously shown input items, or even as items with shared properties. Thus, our results provide further evidence about the critical role of dCaAPs for the computational capabilities of single neurons.",

In this study, we delineate the consequences of a mutation located at a site distal to the functional region in a promiscuous acyl-CoA binding domain. A W86A mutation at a distal C-terminal segment induces two-stage noncooperative unfolding in an otherwise cooperatively unfolding protein, with the mutant exhibiting properties of a molten-globule with large equilibrium fluctuations at 310 K. Under the same conditions, NMR reveals a fourfold increase of a slow-exchanging alternate conformation in the W86A mutant, relative to the wild-type. These manifest as altered dynamic and thermodynamic coupling patterns promoting significant conformational excursions of helix 1, thus stabilizing an intermediate involving unfolded or undocked helix 1. The nonnative interactions mediated by helix 1, in turn, partially occlude the ligand-binding pocket influencing function in a chain-length-dependent manner. Further, the two-stage unfolding switches to a single transition in the W86A mutant in the presence of the ligand while simultaneously suppressing the population of the alternate conformation. Our results provide insights into how mutations could trigger long-range effects through modulation of the native ensemble properties, and the uniquely interconnected nature of the underlying molecular mechanisms.",

Shifts in plant–microbial interactions can lead to significant changes in ecosystem-level functioning. In one of the world’s longest climate change experiments, we studied the effects of 29 y of warming on a native subalpine grassland in the Rocky Mountains of North America. Warming caused a transition from herbaceous to woody-dominated vegetation, with shrubs increasing by 150% in warmed plots and a concurrent ~28% decrease in both forbs and grasses. This shift was accompanied by functional traits changing by 20% toward more conservative values relative to acquisitive ones. Consequently, plant–symbiont associations decreased with root-associated fungi—arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal and septate root colonization—both declining by 17 to 20% under warming. In turn, soil saprotrophic fungi increased by 10% with warming. Strikingly, warming decoupled above- and belowground communities and their functions. This decoupling was evident as plant–available phosphorus increased and both individual plants and plant communities reduced their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi, while plant connectedness to decomposer fungi tightened. Our results suggest that, as the planet warms, subalpine grasslands will become more conservative and desert shrubland-like in both above- and belowground properties.",

This occurs via S-nitrosylation-mediated activation of histone deacetylase 19, which silences AAO3 and ABA2 .

Accurately simulating this pattern is critical for reliable near-term climate projections, yet persistent discrepancies between models and observations remain. While global warming is unequivocal, satellite-era observations reveal pronounced cooling in the southeastern tropical Pacific and Southern Ocean, contrary to the warming simulated by most CMIP models. These discrepancies raise concerns about the reliability of current models in projecting near-term regional climate change. Here, we present the historical simulation with the ICON coupled model at a 5 km ocean and 10 km atmosphere grid-spacing. ICON successfully reproduces the observed SST trends, including cooling in both the Southern Ocean and the southeastern tropical Pacific. Its fidelity is enabled by the direct representation of eddy heat transport across the Antarctic Circumpolar fronts and realistic stratocumulus cloud feedbacks in the subtropical southeast Pacific. These findings highlight the importance of fine spatial resolution in capturing the mechanisms of heat uptake in the eddy-rich Southern Ocean.

The two leading hypotheses are organic radical pairs in cryptochrome flavoproteins and crystals of inorganic magnetic minerals such as magnetite. Here, we propose a magnetoreception mechanism that combines radical pair chemistry with magnetite nanoparticles. Instead of directly detecting the tiny dependence of a radical pair reaction on the direction of the Earth’s (~50 μT) magnetic field, this hybrid sensor uses a magnetic particle to amplify the Earth’s field. Directional information is thereby encoded in the response of nearby radical pairs to the intensity of a much stronger (~5 mT) magnetic field. The result is a magnetoreceptor with potentially 10 to 100-fold greater sensitivity than afforded by radical pairs alone.",

We introduce a quantum algorithm that provably accelerates a broad class of continuous-time sampling dynamics. For Langevin dynamics, our method encodes the target Gibbs measure into the amplitudes of a quantum state, identified as the kernel of a block matrix derived from a factorization of the Witten Laplacian operator. This connection enables Gibbs sampling via singular value thresholding and yields up to a quartic quantum speedup over best-known classical Langevin-based methods in the non-logconcave setting. Building on this framework, we further develop the first quantum algorithm that accelerates replica exchange Langevin diffusion, a widely used method for sampling from complex, rugged energy landscapes.",

Yet, how long-term, especially extreme, drought affects these C reserves across soil profiles remains unresolved. Here, we present the response of SOC stocks at various depths (0 to 60 cm) using an experiment involving a 10-year drought gradient (P, 1/2 P, 1/4 P, and 1/12 P, where P is ambient precipitation) in an alpine grassland. We found that extreme drought (1/12 P) caused significant SOC losses in the subsoil, whereas mild to moderate droughts had no significant effects on SOC at any depth. Under extreme drought, SOC stocks declined by 27% in the 20 to 30 cm layer and by 37% in the 30 to 40 cm layer, while no significant changes were observed in the topsoil (0 to 20 cm) and the deeper layer (40 to 60 cm). Subsoil C losses were primarily driven by reductions in mineral-associated organic C (MAOC) rather than particulate organic C. Multiyear extreme drought disrupted soil–microbe–mineral interactions, as indicated by reductions in soil nitrogen availability, microbial biomass, carbon use efficiency, and mineral-binding agents. These changes collectively undermined the formation and stabilization of MAOC. Our findings suggest that prolonged extreme drought can weaken subsoil C storage and stability, highlighting the need to incorporate subsoil processes into Earth System Models to better predict soil C–climate feedback under future drought scenarios.",

However, the molecular event triggering this initial accumulation remains unknown. We report that phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a consistent biomarker of prodromal sAD, drives Aβ production through a previously unrecognized RNA-binding function. Specifically, PHGDH binds the 3′UTR of EIF2AK1 mRNA, enabling the physical interaction between PHGDH and the EIF2AK1 protein. By facilitating the recruitment of EIF2AK1 to its substrate EIF2α, this complex drives EIF2α phosphorylation, thereby selectively promoting the translation of BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme for Aβ generation. We demonstrate that PHGDH overexpression elevates BACE1 protein and intracellular Aβ in neurons and astrocytes across mouse models and human brain organoids, independent of its canonical enzymatic or transcriptional roles. Mechanistically, this process requires a specific RNA-binding surface within PHGDH and the EIF2AK1 3′UTR. These findings define a PHGDH–EIF2AK1–EIF2α–BACE1 axis as a key driver of the earliest amyloid pathology in sAD.",

In Caenorhabditis elegans , favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct self-organized swarming behavior, where C. elegans move and feed in groups driven by uncontrolled local increases in population density despite abundant food availability. While various environmental factors have been implicated in collective behaviors in C. elegans , the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a key role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors.

          "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. It is often diagnosed at advanced stages and characterized by high recurrence rates. Although chronic liver inflammation and metabolic dysfunction are established contributors to tumorigenesis, the molecular mechanisms that link microenvironmental stress to malignant transformation remain poorly understood. MYCN, a proto-oncogenic transcription factor, has emerged as a potential biomarker of cancer stemness. However, its role in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we elucidated the oncogenic role of MYCN and its dynamic transcriptional regulation during liver tumorigenesis. Using a hydrodynamic tail vein injection-based transposon system in mice, we demonstrated that MYCN overexpression synergizes with AKT activation to promote liver tumorigenesis. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that MYCN-driven tumors exhibited features of human HCC subtypes enriched in stress-adaptive transcriptional programs. Time-resolved spatial transcriptomics further uncovered a MYCN-enriched niche characterized by epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which expanded during tumor progression and was spatially proximate to transformed malignant cells. To translate these findings to human HCC, we developed a machine learning-based MYCN niche score and validated its clinical relevance across multiple human HCC cohorts. This score reliably predicted recurrence risk and identified EMT-prone microenvironments, with stronger predictive performance in nontumor tissues, suggesting its potential in detecting precancerous niches predisposed to de novo tumorigenesis. Collectively, our findings establish MYCN as a functional driver and spatial marker of tumor-promoting microenvironments in liver tumorigenesis; additionally, we propose a clinically actionable strategy to identify high-risk patients through transcriptomic profiling of nontumor liver tissue.",

          "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism. One common physical feature of FXS is macrocephaly, a condition typically associated with brain overgrowth and dysfunction; however, the mechanisms underlying its occurrence are unclear. Here, we uncover a role for the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP) in regulating tissue growth through the Minibrain (Mnb) kinase, also known as DYRK1A, a gene up-regulated in Down syndrome and mutated in a specific form of autism. Using fly models of FXS, we find that Drosophila FMRP (dFmrp) suppresses the translation of Mnb. Loss of dFmrp leads to the up-regulation of Mnb in the developing brain, resulting in macrocephaly and brain enlargement. We find that brain overgrowth begins early in development and can be suppressed with DYRK1A inhibitors. At the cellular level, the Mnb/DYRK1A signaling pathway drives brain enlargement by inducing both neuronal hypertrophy and excessive proliferation of neural progenitors. We further demonstrate that Mnb up-regulates protein synthesis, and reducing Mnb activity or disrupting essential translational machinery restores brain size and improves locomotor coordination in the Drosophila FXS model. These data suggest that dysregulation of the Mnb/DYRK1A signaling pathway contributes to brain overgrowth and aberrant protein synthesis in FXS. More broadly, our findings highlight that neurodevelopmental disorders such as FXS, Down syndrome, and autism share disruptions in common molecular pathways.",

Inspired by GFP’s barrel-like peptide scaffold, which stabilizes the chromophore within a confined space, here we develop photobleaching-resistant super-resolution DNA framework (SDF) dots that enables programmable confinement of various types of fluorophores within the inner cavity resembling GFP. We find that SDF dots are resistant to reactive oxygen species-induced photobleaching due to the shielding effects of DNA frameworks. SDF dots with four fluorophores labeling inside of the cavity leads to ~1.8-fold enhancement in photostability compared to the corner labeling, whereas ~50-fold enhancement compared to single fluorophore labeled on double-stranded DNA. These ultrastable SDF dots are readily adaptable for super-resolution imaging including stimulated emission depletion (STED) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging. We realize STED imaging of live cell membranes over 30 min. We further construct ultrastable super-resolution SIM barcodes that can distinguish eighteen colored barcodes with a spatial resolution of ~70 nm.

Given the role of spike (S) glycoprotein in mediating SL-CoV cell entry and cross-species transmission, there remains urgent need of structural information on SL-CoV S to guide therapeutic countermeasure development. Among SL-CoVs, bat-derived WIV1 is capable of using as receptor the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from a variety of mammals, thereby representing a prototype model for studying SL-CoV precursors to future pandemics. We present a WIV1 S cryo-EM structure in prefusion state which reveals molecular signatures reminiscent of the tightly-packed locked-1 conformation described for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. To decipher the molecular basis for bat SL-CoV WIV1 host range tropism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of WIV1 S-ACE2 interaction across reservoir bat, potentially intermediate hosts civet, raccoon dog and pangolin, and accidental human hosts. We found that, in all interactions, upon complex formation with ACE2, the linoleic acid responsible for locking the S receptor binding domain (RBD) dynamically persists in its binding pocket, however repositioning to potentially unlock the system. Complex formation between WIV1 S-RBD and ACE2 from different hosts was characterized in vitro by mass photometry and microscale thermophoresis, revealing that interaction is stronger with ACE2 from bat and human than other hosts, within the latter stronger for the Thr92Ile polymorphism correlated to higher SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. These findings provide critical insights with crucial implications for pandemic preparedness.",

The nematode Steinernema carpocapsae , long regarded as an ambusher, paradoxically infects the cryptic red palm weevil ( Rhynchophorus ferrugineus ), which resides deep in plant tissue. Here, we show that this contradiction stems from a context-dependent modulation of foraging-related behaviors, triggered by butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)—a host-derived volatile emitted by R. ferrugineus larvae. BHT functions as a potent behaviorally active volatile, increasing locomotion, jumping, host attraction, and infection success in S. carpocapsae . Mechanistically, BHT engages a lysosome-associated signaling pathway involving mfsd8 , SLC17A5 , and ptr . Knockdown of these genes disrupted BHT-induced behavioral changes, supporting their functional involvement.

Given its physiological importance, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms of γ1 action. However, structural and functional studies have yielded conflicting conclusions regarding the modulation of BK channels by γ1. Here, using macroscopic, single-channel, and gating-current measurements, we demonstrate that at zero mV, γ1 increases 106-fold the equilibrium constant for the closed–open transition by destabilizing the channel’s closed state and enhancing coupling between the voltage sensor and the pore domain, without affecting voltage-sensor activation. These results suggest that γ1 not only increases the energetic coupling between the voltage sensors and the pore but also primarily enhances the channel-opening reaction.",

This pipeline called Pichia–Codon language model (Pichia-CLM) was applied to the industrial host organism, Komagataella phaffii. With this approach, production of heterologous proteins was enhanced up to threefold compared to their native sequences. Furthermore, Pichia-CLM consistently yielded constructs with enhanced productivity for proteins of varied complexity, compared to commercially available tools. Finally, we showed that Pichia-CLM generates sequences resembling the properties of codon usage found in the host’s intrinsic host cell proteins and learned features such as avoiding negative cis-regulatory and repeat elements based on patterns in the genome data.

          "abstract": "Insect sociality is a major evolutionary transition based on the suppression of worker reproduction in favor of a queen’s reproductive monopoly. Although sophisticated insect societies have arisen independently on multiple occasions in the Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps), how worker sterility evolved through natural selection is not fully understood. In honey bees ( Apis mellifera ), dietary cues (royal or worker jelly) and social chemical signals (e.g., queen pheromones) promote caste differentiation by modulating the levels of juvenile hormone (JH), the key physiological orchestrator of caste determination in larvae and the maintenance of caste identity in adults. However, the precise molecular effects of JH on the ovaries of larvae and adult bees remain open questions. Here, we describe lncov1 , a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), whose expression correlates with sterility in the ovaries of larvae and adult honey bees. Mechanistically, the low JH levels in worker larvae promote high lncov1 expression in their ovaries, which subsequently show extensive programmed cell death. Moreover, lncov1 expression is tightly connected to a reduction in the reproductive capacity of adult queens and workers, as this lncRNA responds to key environmental cues that regulate fertility, including royal jelly and queen pheromone. The sequence conservation of the lncov1 gene across eusocial bees, especially the genus Apis , suggests the evolutionary stability of the JH/ lncov1 pathway. Therefore, by revealing how nutritional and social cues acting through JH and lncov1 shape queen and worker fertility in honey bees, these findings position lncRNAs as key components in the evolution of social complexity in insects.",

In addition, TTP-ICG enabled efficient intraoperative evaluation of surgical margins and visualization of mSLNs at a submillimeter level in preclinical models. Additionally, we optimized the rapid incubation imaging method (RIIM) by shortening the procedure to less than 8 min, illustrating TTP-ICG’s high performance in distinguishing malignant from normal tissues/fibroadenoma lesions as well as detecting metastatic lymph nodes in a cohort of 59 patients.

Because these ecosystems can be both sinks and sources of carbon to the atmosphere as environmental conditions and human influence change, the net climate mitigation potential of wetlands at regional to global scales remains uncertain. We used a data-driven approach to measure ground-based and airborne fluxes to upscale carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) fluxes using satellite-based surface reflectances at 500-m resolution across a gradient of saline to freshwater wetlands in Southern Florida, USA. Daily time series of CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes from 2000 to 2024 integrated surface properties related to vegetation productivity, flooding, and disturbance, and captured 80% and 91% of the variability in annual fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 , respectively. Long-term (23-y) patterns in the fluxes of CH 4 , CO 2 , and their CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 eq) are represented as Global Warming Potential 100 (GWP100) and were shown to vary spatially with wetland management, revealing higher carbon uptake in mangroves susceptible to hurricane damage and coastal hydrology, and greater carbon emissions in freshwater sawgrass marshes where freshwater hydrology is managed for restoration. Regional net annual CO 2 eq uptake in coastal and freshwater wetlands increased by 18% from −7.0 ± 3.3 MMT CO 2 eq y −1 in ~2003 to −8.4 ± 3.8 MMT CO 2 eq y −1 in ~2020 at an uptake rate of −0.06 ± 0.01 MMT CO 2 eq y −2 .

Archaeology can benefit from multitemporal and multisensor satellite data even when direct archaeological site and feature detection is not possible by using these data to examine relationships between archaeological, ecological, and climactic variables across vast geographies. With this, archaeologists can ask questions about diverse landscape matrices and how these shaped the flow of past cultural processes. We demonstrate the value of thermal sensor data—common in satellite arrays—by developing an automated routine for analyzing Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor time series data. We fit a harmonic regression to extract amplitude and phase shift values for thousands of inland lakes in Michigan’s lower peninsula and computed perimeter-to-area ratios. Treating these thermal data not as absolute equivalents to past conditions but as relative indices, we compared lakes with and without Late Precontact (ca. 1200–1600 CE) burial mounds. Results show lakes with mounds warmed later in the spring, cooled later in the fall, and were more regularly shaped, suggesting Late Precontact communities placed mounds on lakes with specific resource benefits, including extended growing seasons. Considering our findings alongside emerging evidence for widespread precontact Indigenous agriculture in the Great Lakes region, it is important to reconsider maize’s subsistence and ceremonial significance. The analytic workflow—leveraging free, global Landsat data in Google Earth Engine—offers a replicable framework for archaeologists worldwide to integrate relative thermal patterns into cultural landscape studies.",

In neurons, GSK-3β coordinates the cytoskeleton by phosphorylating microtubule-binding proteins. In this study, we found that tight regulation of GSK-3β kinase activity is required for the maintenance of parallel microtubule bundles in Drosophila and rat axons. Up- or downregulation of GSK-3β led to axons forming pathological swellings in which microtubule bundles disintegrated into disorganized, curled microtubules. We identified the microtubule bundling proteins Shot and Tau as key GSK-3β targets and found that GSK-3β exerted its regulatory effect on microtubule bundling through them. GSK-3β regulates the ability of Shot and Tau to attach to microtubules and/or Eb1. Misregulation of GSK-3β leads to the loss of Eb1–Shot-mediated guidance of polymerizing microtubules into parallel bundles, thus causing disorganization. We propose that microtubule disorganization during both active and inactive states of GSK-3β links its hyperactivity to neurodegeneration and may explain why global GSK-3β inhibition has failed in clinical trials.",

          "abstract": "Human-induced climate change has increased wildfire risks, associated air pollution, and health damages in North America. Despite its large potential for damage, climate-induced wildfire smoke is rarely incorporated in estimates of the societal costs of climate change. We develop an integrated framework to estimate air pollution from climate-induced wildfire smoke (fine particulate matter, PM 2.5 ) and the associated mortality damage in the United States across different trajectories of greenhouse gas emissions and global mean surface temperature. Our framework accounts for fire–vegetation feedbacks by empirically estimating the effects of past fires on future burn probability. Under 3 °C of global warming (relative to 1850–1900), we estimate that smoke exposure will lead to 64,000 deaths annually in the United States (95% CI: 33,500 to 112,300; calculated using historical population), a 60% increase above estimated annual smoke deaths during 2011-2020. Limiting global warming to 2 °C reduces smoke-related mortality by 14% (8,900 deaths per year) relative to our estimate for 3 °C. For every additional tonne of CO 2 emissions in 2025, we calculate a net present value of monetized damage (i.e., a partial social cost of carbon) of $11.2 (95%CI: − $1.1 to $41.6; 2020USD) due to climate-induced wildfire smoke mortality in the United States. Incorporating wildfire smoke damages into existing nonwildfire damage estimates increases the US domestic social cost of carbon by 74%, substantially increasing the expected benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation within the United States.",

          "abstract": "Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide globally, especially due to the extensive cultivation of genetically modified glyphosate-resistant crops. However, its intensive application has raised public concerns about the risks to food safety and human health. Identifying enzymes capable of metabolizing glyphosate in plants represents an ideal strategy for addressing this issue, but few are known. Here, we identified the rice variety Kitaake with natural tolerance to glyphosate and demonstrated that this tolerance is driven by glyphosate glycosylation metabolism. Seven up-regulated UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase ( UGT ) genes associated with glyphosate tolerance were identified in Kitaake. Molecular-docking analysis indicated that these UGT proteins have moderate binding affinity for glyphosate. Among these, a deletion of an adenine at position –803 in the promoter region of GLYPHOSATE RESPONSIVE GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE 1 ( GRGT1 ) enhances its expression in Kitaake. GRGT1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and catalyzes glyphosate glycosylation both in vivo and in vitro. Rice lines complemented with GRGT1–GFP rescue the inability of grgt1 knockout mutants to produce glycosylated glyphosate derivatives. Overexpression of GRGT1 in the susceptible Nipponbare cultivar confers glyphosate tolerance by up-regulating glyphosate metabolism to produce glycosylated glyphosate derivatives M329, M331, and M345. This provides a strategy for developing herbicide-tolerant crops, but also offers a potential approach to consequently reduce glyphosate residues in crops.",

          "abstract": "Racemic compounds, consisting of an equimolar mixture of enantiomers in crystalline form, are conventionally regarded as fully symmetric and are often dismissed as a trivial phenomenon due to their abundance—as they account for a substantial fraction (90 to 95%) of entries in structural databases. Here, we uncover the symmetry-breaking hierarchical organization within racemic compounds: single-handed molecules first self-assemble into homochiral domains, which then periodically self-organize with domains of opposite chirality to form the final crystal. Using a folded-plane model by applying isometry, we introduce a quantitative descriptor (angle θ ) to probe symmetry breaking in racemic compounds, directly derived from crystal symmetry and unit cell parameters. We further develop a big-data analysis tool based on coset decomposition (a method of group theory) to comprehensively examine structural data from Cambridge Structural Database. Our analysis confirms the widespread occurrence of symmetry breaking in racemic compounds. This finding challenges the traditional view of racemic crystals as inherently symmetric, revealing their hidden complexity and potential implications for crystallography, materials science, and so on.",

Peptide therapeutics are developed using library screening that samples a diverse chemical space within primary sequences and secondary structural conformations. DNA-encoded peptide libraries (PDELs) are ideal for the development of peptide-based therapeutics as novel building blocks, and diverse chemical modifications are easily incorporated. However, current PDEL construction is limited by precipitation-based purification, which constrains libraries to three or four building blocks in length due to decreasing quality with each synthetic step. Herein, we developed a solid-phase capture-based purification method to generate longer PDELs with increased purity. We modified the conventional Fmoc protecting group with an azido handle to introduce click chemistry for selective immobilization during purification. Using this method, we achieved &gt;95% purity in the synthesis of a five-round PDEL that showed great efficiency in identifying high nanomolar binders against transferrin receptor protein 1.

Here, we develop an axiomatization of quantum computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This approach allows combinatorial optimization, including brute force computer search, to optimize quantum computations. The free model may be interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model, but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.",

Our hominin ancestors harnessed the surfaces of mobile artifacts and cave walls as information carriers since the Paleolithic time period. Theories abound as to the meaning and function of these Paleolithic signs. However, very little is known about their basic, measurable properties. We here analyze a corpus of more than 200 mobile objects of a 43,000 to 34,000 y old Aurignacian culture—associated with the first modern humans to settle in Central Europe. These objects are adorned with several thousand geometric signs. We apply classification algorithms and statistical models to capture their quantitative properties. First, our analyses illustrate that these sign sequences are clearly distinguishable from modern day writing. Second, however, their statistical properties are comparable to sign sequences on the earliest protocuneiform tablets. Third, Paleolithic signs were systematically applied to yield higher information density on certain types of objects, e.g. ivory figurines compared to tools. These results cannot be taken to strictly prove that Aurignacian sign sequences encoded numero-ideographic information as in the case of protocuneiform. However, they prove that the first hunter-gatherers arriving in Europe already applied sign sequences of comparable complexity in a deliberate, systematic, and conventional manner—several ten thousand years before the advent of genuine writing.",

          "abstract": "The integrated stress response (ISR) plays a crucial role in cognition via bidirectional modulation of the two major forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, and long-term depression (LTD). Specifically, inhibition of the ISR blocks metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD (mGluR-LTD), whereas its activation facilitates this form of synaptic depression. However, the contribution of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the best studied downstream effector of the ISR, to mGluR-LTD remains unknown. Here, we show that pharmacological activation of group I mGluRs in mouse hippocampal slices increases ATF4 protein levels without altering its transcription and concurrently downregulates the expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) proteins. Selective deletion of ATF4 in excitatory neurons impairs mGluR-LTD and prevents the downregulation of OXPHOS proteins. Notably, administration of a small molecule inhibitor of OXPHOS rescues the impaired mGluR-LTD in ATF4-depleted hippocampal slices, indicating that ATF4 regulates this type of synaptic plasticity by modulating mitochondrial function. Moreover, ATF4 deletion in excitatory neurons disrupts object-place learning, an mGluR-LTD-dependent behavior paradigm. Together, these findings reveal a role of ATF4 as a key mediator of protein synthesis-regulated synaptic depression and related behaviors.",

The insular cortex, a multifunctional hub buried within the Sylvian fissure, has been implicated in motor control through clinical observations and neuroimaging. Yet its precise relation to primary sensorimotor processing remains one of the least understood aspects of motor neurophysiology. To address this gap, we quantified electrophysiological changes from implanted depth electrodes in patients performing simple movement tasks combined with single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) to map effective connectivity. The movement data reveal somatotopically specific representation bilaterally, as well as intereffector regions that are active for different movement types. Hand representation is centered along the contralateral ventral aspect of the middle and posterior short gyri bilaterally, while tongue/mouth tuned sites cluster in the dorsal posterior short gyrus and the dorsal long gyri. Insular activity temporally follows the primary motor cortex (M1) and precedes movement onset. SPES revealed somatotopically specific connectivity between corresponding sites in M1 and insula (hand-to-hand, tongue-to-tongue) and between bilateral insulae. These observations establish that somatotopy is a conserved property of distributed motor control incorporating the insular representations and connectivity.",

Here, in agreement with established theories, we show that in graphene oxide (GO) and related two-dimensional polyelectrolytes, nematic order and structural color emerge as surface charge density is reduced, concomitant with a decrease in self-generated ionic strength and an increase in the effective range of electrostatic repulsion. Using a minimal model combining counterion-only Poisson–Boltzmann electrostatics, van der Waals attraction, and Helfrich undulation, we show that ordering is governed by a self-screened electrostatic length scale, d EDL , set by particle-released counterions. When d EDL scale becomes comparable to the interlayer spacing, spacing fluctuations are suppressed and long-range orientational order is enhanced.

          "abstract": "Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell damage is a critical factor of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness among the aged population. This study focuses on the AMD susceptible gene, Death associated protein like 1 (DAPL1), and provides insights with significant therapeutic implications. DAPL1-deficient mice exhibit dry AMD-like pathological features, a phenomenon whose mechanisms have remained largely unknown. Here, we reveal that DAPL1 deficiency promotes the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) to cause mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload and dysfunction, which triggers the activation of inflammasomes, leading RPE cells to RIPK1-mediated PANoptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death, in an experimental dry AMD (dAMD) mouse model. Knockdown of Ripk1 in the Dapl1−/− mice RPE inhibits RPE cell PANoptosis and ameliorates the severity of dAMD pathological features. Conversely, overexpression of DAPL1 inhibits MAM formation and protects RPE cells from PANoptosis in the model. Mechanistically, DAPL1 suppresses MAM formation by downregulating GRP75 expression. This disrupts the formation of the VDAC–GRP75–IP3R axis, which comprises critical tethering proteins responsible for endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria coupling and Ca 2+ trafficking. Knockdown of Grp75 inhibits the formation of MAM and prevents mitochondrial Ca 2+ overload, improving mitochondrial quality and inhibiting PANoptosis in RPE cells, thereby interrupting the progression of experimental dAMD in Dapl1 -deficient mice. These results unveil the role of MAMs regulated by DAPL1 in RPE cell PANoptosis and AMD progression, highlighting targeting MAM formation as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating dAMD.",

          "abstract": "Natural ecosystems are increasingly threatened by global agricultural supply chains, and a narrow policy focus on forests has fueled agricultural expansion into ecologically significant but severely overlooked non-forest ecosystems, including grasslands and open wetlands. While a few emerging policies attempt to protect non-forest ecosystems, a globally consistent assessment of their conversion extent and drivers, especially related to livestock production and commodity-specific supply chain demand, remains lacking. Here, we conducted a spatially explicit analysis to identify pasture and cropland expansion into non-forest ecosystems between 2005 and 2020, as well as conversion-linked primary agricultural commodities and their underlying demand drivers (end uses and final market destinations). We found that the conversion rate of natural non-forest ecosystems was nearly four times that of lands with tree cover exceeding 5 m (a common forest height threshold), with Brazil contributing 13% of the global total and Russia, India, China, and the United States each contributing about 6%. While drivers varied greatly across regions, globally 50% of the conversion was linked to pasture, and 27, 17, and 6% to cropland for food, feed, and other uses (mainly bioenergy), respectively. Among conversion-linked commodities, most livestock-associated products served domestic demand, while 32% of feed crops and 20% of all crops were exported, with export shares reaching 70 to 80% in Brazil and Argentina. These findings reveal important areas for non-forest ecosystem conservation and highlight the need for integrated policies to prevent leakage across different ecosystems and different sustainable development goals while also aligning local actions with global supply chain governance.",

          "abstract": "Ecologists use multiple approaches to decipher factors mediating the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Using closely related species, we retrospectively investigated divergence in diet and defense among seed bugs that co-occur at small spatial scales. The small milkweed bug ( Lygaeus kalmii ) primarily feeds on milkweeds (Apocynaceae) and sequesters toxic cardenolides as an antipredator defense, both traits representing the ancestral condition of Lygaeinae. Little was previously known about the false milkweed bug ( L. turcicus ); we report that the primary host of L. turcicus is false sunflower, Heliopsis helianthoides (Asteraceae), and that its seeds produce cardenolides, the second report of these toxins in Asteraceae. The dominant cardenolide was novel, which we resolved and named heliopside. We found divergent trends in performance and defense of the two bugs. L . kalmii had &gt;40% higher survival and growth on milkweeds compared to H. helianthoides , an effect that was primarily explained by H. helianthoides’ thick seed shell. Nonetheless, L. kalmii sequestered toxins equivalently from the two seed species. Conversely, L. turcicus had equally high survival and growth on the two seeds, but sequestered toxins more effectively from H. helianthoides than milkweed, potentially due to specialized detoxification of H. helianthoides’ cardenolides. Thus, adaptation to host-plant traits in these two seed bugs is asymmetric for diet and defense, and distinct constraints are likely to limit the bugs’ host ranges and contribute to coexistence. Shared seed chemistry apparently facilitated host shifts in the Lygaeinae from Apocynaceae to Asteraceae, with divergent adaptation to their food niches likely facilitating coexistence.",

          "abstract": "Scaling up solar photovoltaics (PV) is essential for global decarbonization, particularly in China—the world’s largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter. Despite leading in PV installations, China has yet to widely adopt the more efficient tracking technologies for capturing solar radiation (12% adoption rate), in stark contrast to the United States (90%). To examine the rationale behind this divergence and its consequences, we develop a spatially explicit, integrated model to evaluate and compare tracking and fixed-tilt systems in China—comparing power generation, land use, cost, sustainability, and policy resilience. We find that although single-axis tracking provides electricity gains and appears technically more cost-effective, rising land prices in China could offset its benefits. Land costs increase the levelized cost of electricity by 20% for tracking systems, compared to 8% for fixed-tilt, making the latter cheaper in real-world conditions. Consequently, land-efficient fixed-tilt systems are favored, despite requiring 18 to 26% more panels for the same output—intensifying material demands. Under a 6 PWh target in 2060, current land policies would drive 59% of electricity toward fixed-tilt. Reducing soft land costs could increase the adoption of tracking systems to 63% and reduce installed capacity by up to 8% (219 GW) under the same electricity output, compared with an increasing costs scenario, but would expand land use by 35% or 12.9 thousand km 2 . Our findings underscore how land economics and policy shape renewable technology deployment. They highlight critical trade-offs between energy yield, land use, and material demand, offering insights for designing more balanced and resilient decarbonization strategies.",

We report a spontaneous canine dysmyelinating leukodystrophy in English Cocker Spaniel puppies. The most severely affected male pup displayed pronounced generalized tremors, progressive motor dysfunction, and markedly impaired growth. Histopathology at 5 wk of age revealed profound central nervous system (CNS) dysmyelination with no evidence of peripheral nerve involvement. Western blotting confirmed markedly reduced expression of CNS myelin-associated proteins. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated a near absence of compact myelin, rare myelinated axons, and significant oligodendrocyte abnormalities, the majority of which had an immature cellular morphology. More mature, yet infrequent oligodendrocytes had distended rough endoplasmic reticula. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified a hemizygous c.92T&gt;A missense variant in the PLP1 gene predicted to cause a leucine-to-glutamine substitution in the first transmembrane domain, p.(L31Q). This variant was absent in over 1,600 public canine genomes and was predicted to be deleterious by multiple bioinformatic tools. Heterozygous females exhibited variable, transient clinical signs. We compared this canine leukodystrophy with the previously reported shaking pup and found that it represents a more severe phenotype recapitulating key clinical, pathological, and molecular features of severe connatal PMD in humans, including extreme CNS dysmyelination and associated neurological deficits. Interestingly, this genetic variant seems to cause a defect at the oligodendrocyte progenitor stage limiting subsequent oligodendrocyte maturation and preventing myelination. The identification of this naturally occurring model provides a potential resource for investigating the mechanisms and therapeutic targets for specific PLP1 genetic variants.",

          "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is crucial for host defense against pathogen invasion and is implicated in various inflammatory disorders. The pathogenic association and the involved mechanism between the NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory diseases have garnered significant attention. Here, we demonstrate that Crohn’s disease–associated SNP RNF123-R854H aggravates colitis in vivo through the NLRP3-dependent pathway. Deficiency of RNF123 also aggravates dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-induced endotoxemia, and Alum-induced peritonitis and enhances host defense against bacterial infection via the NLRP3-dependent pathway in vivo and promotes the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cells. We establish RNF123 as a regulator for the NLRP3 inflammasome, highlighting its implication in the NLRP3 inflammasome-driven inflammatory diseases. Mechanistically, RNF123 catalyzes unanchored K63-linked ubiquitination of NEK7, thereby preventing NEK7-mediated dissociation of the inactive cage-like NLRP3 aggregates and the subsequent NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Additionally, we prove that K63-linked polyubiquitin chains can be specifically captured by NEK7 in vitro and inhibit the NEK7-licensed NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. We propose that NEK7-captured unanchored K63-polyubiquitin chains serve as a key determinant for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, acting as a molecular brake to limit the excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation and preserve immune homeostasis. Our work yields mechanistic insights into the NLRP3 inflammasome regulation and its pathogenic link to inflammatory disease.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a chronic liver disease driven by the confluence of metabolic stress and destructive inflammation. The immunoregulatory mechanisms that temper this process remain poorly understood. Multipronged data on a complementary pair of murine MASH models and published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from MASH patients revealed a critical protective role for Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) in MASH. Tregs progressively accumulated in diseased livers, adopting an activated, nonlymphoid-tissue phenotype marked by expression of the transcription factor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) as well as a reparative transcriptional program. Punctual ablation of Tregs during established MASH unleashed a catastrophic inflammatory cascade, including exaggerated T-helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 responses, expansion of a pathogenic CD8 + T cell population, and hepatocellular injury. Concomitantly, Treg deficiency disrupted key metabolic pathways in the liver, accelerating disease progression. These findings establish Tregs as nonredundant custodians of both immunologic and metabolic homeostasis in the liver, highlighting their promise as targets for temporally tuned immunoregulatory therapies in metabolic liver disease.",

          "abstract": "The generality of the worldwide leaf economics spectrum (LES) has made it a pillar of trait-based ecological research. Yet, few studies have examined the processes shaping the evolution of the LES within species, in part, because most species occupy only a small portion of the LES. To address this gap, we took advantage of the distinct leaf economics strategies present in different ecotypes of the phenotypically diverse perennial grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) to generate a genetic mapping population, which we planted in common gardens at three sites spanning 12 degrees of latitude in the central United States. With this genetic mapping population, we evaluated two potentially interacting causes of LES evolution: 1) genetic architecture, where multiple traits are influenced by either the same gene (pleiotropy) or by genes in close physical proximity (genetic linkage), and 2) correlational selection, where selection acts on traits in combination rather than in isolation. We found that shared genetic architecture influenced covariation between photosynthetic rate ( A MASS ) and leaf nitrogen ( N MASS ) and between A MASS and leaf mass per area (LMA). We also found that correlational selection favored the trait combinations predicted by the LES (e.g., high LMA with low N MASS or low LMA with high N MASS ) and disfavored other, mismatched trait combinations at two of the three sites. Together, these results demonstrate how the evolution of an integrated LES within species can arise from multiple evolutionary causes.",

          "abstract": "Straw return reshapes the biogeochemical processes in paddy soils by driving microbial transformation of key elements. Despite growing awareness of these individual processes, the integration of these processes under millimeter-scale spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains unclear. Combining high-resolution geochemical profiling with multiomics, we revealed that straw addition altered the depth-dependent dynamics of arsenic, carbon, and nitrogen, establishing a sophisticated three-layer microbial stratification. We identified 1) an 18 mm organic matter (OM)-rich layer extending from the straw layer, which serves as a methanogenic epicenter co-occurring with active nitrogen fixation microbes; 2) an overlying layer dominated by aerobic methane oxidation and denitrification microbes; and 3) a deeper substraw layer dominated by anaerobic arsenite oxidation and denitrification microbes. Significantly positively correlated abundances of transcribed mcrA with nifH genes and pmoA or aioA / arxA with denitrification genes were identified. Corroboratively, intensified co-occurrence patterns of mcrA with nifH , pmoA with denitrification, and aioA / arxA with denitrification genes were observed in the OM-rich, upper, and lower layers, respectively. Moreover, the co-occurred mcrA - nifH and aioA - nirS / arxA - narG genes in different metagenome-assembled genomes presented 80.6 to 260.8- and 1.55 to 6.85-fold greater transcriptional activity in the OM-rich and lower layers than in the other layers, respectively. Our results demonstrated that straw incorporation established a dynamic soil redox zone, restructuring millimeter-scale microbial networks and promoting potentially coupled denitrification with arsenite or methane oxidation, as well as methanogenesis with nitrogen fixation. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for optimizing subsurface straw placement and nitrate application to enhance nutrient cycling and mitigate environmental risks.",

Similar isomorphic mapping of the environment is absent in most higher association areas such as the hippocampus; however, some studies have suggested that in hippocampal regions spatially tuned cells may be organized in small anatomical clusters with similar firing field locations. Here, we take advantage of the high spatial resolution provided by two-photon calcium imaging to probe the extent of local functional clustering of hippocampal place cells in freely moving mice. Almost one thousand highly packed CA1 neurons were recorded simultaneously per mouse while they foraged freely in open arenas. Among pairs of place cells, there was no relation between preferred firing position and anatomical proximity. Firing fields were no more similar for nearest neighbors than distant cell pairs. When place cells remapped between different arenas, there was no tendency for correlations in one environment to be transferred to the other. A similar lack of relationship between function and anatomical position was expressed in CA1 cells with firing fields tuned to local objects in the environment. The findings suggest that the encoding of location in CA1 place cells is likely fully nontopographical.",

          "abstract": "Enhanced plant productivity under climate warming may partially offset soil carbon losses in cold ecosystems, but this compensation depends on whether soil nitrogen (N) supply can keep pace with the increased N demand associated with accelerated plant growth. However, it remains unclear whether existing soil N supply processes are sufficient to support this rising plant N demand. Based on a unique whole-ecosystem warming experiment in the permafrost region on the Tibetan Plateau, we assess 43 variables encompassing plant N demand and soil N supply. After 2 y of warming, plant N demand significantly increases, while leaf N resorption remains unchanged, indicating a heightened reliance on external soil N inputs. Among all quantified N-supply processes, moss-associated biological N fixation is the only process that responds positively to warming, providing partial compensation for the elevated plant N demand over the two experimental years. This enhancement is associated with warming-driven changes in moss functional traits that likely expand colonization niches and increase carbon availability for diazotrophs, coupled with a warming-induced increase in the breadth and intensity of taxon-level 15 N incorporation into the DNA of N-fixing bacteria. These findings highlight that moss-associated N fixation may act as an early contributor in helping satisfy the elevated plant N demand under warming, offering insights into understanding the dynamics of vegetation productivity and permafrost carbon-climate feedback through the lens of moss–soil–microbial interactions.",

However, the specific changes in intracellular signaling that are induced by T-cadherin in metabolic tissues/cells remain unclear. We demonstrated that T-cadherin suppresses ERK signaling in both cultured cells and murine tissues. T-cadherin knockdown increased ERK phosphorylation in C2C12 myocytes and F2 endothelial cells, whereas T-cadherin overexpression suppressed ERK phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis revealed that many proteins that are downstream targets of ERK signaling were upregulated by T-cadherin knockdown in myocytes. T-cadherin knockdown in myocytes or knockout in heart or skeletal muscles altered the levels of membrane proteins that are involved in signal transduction, including IGF1R and EGFR. Ablation of T-cadherin in mice was accompanied by increased ERK signaling, leading to increased cardiac hypertrophy and decreased appropriate muscle atrophy during starvation. Thus, T-cadherin, whose protein expression is maintained by adiponectin, modulates intracellular signaling and regulates cardiac and skeletal muscle homeostasis in addition to promoting exosome production by adiponectin.",

The GRIN2B transcript encodes the GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and has a 25 kb-long 3’-untranslated region (3’UTR) of unknown function. To investigate its role, we generated a ∆3’UTR mouse line by deleting the Grin2b 3’UTR while preserving the coding sequence. Despite unchanged Grin2b mRNA levels in ∆3’UTR mice, GluN2B protein was reduced 50%. In wildtype (WT) mice, Grin2b mRNA was enriched in synaptosomes, but this enrichment was impaired in ∆3’UTR mice along with reduced GluN2B phosphorylation. Notably, ∆3’UTR mice had no long-term potentiation (LTP) and exhibited hippocampal-dependent spatial learning impairments. Together, these findings demonstrate that the 3’UTR is critical for Grin2b mRNA function, ultimately influencing synaptic composition and plasticity.",

For this reason, the field of behavioral ecology, which specializes in testing adaptive explanations for biological observations, is dominated by research on larger multicellular animals such as insects, mammals, fish, and birds. The vast majority of modern life sciences, however, is concerned with the study of cells, genes, and molecules, which are often impossible to observe directly in nature. This severely compromises our ability to complement mechanistic understand of traits of interest with adaptive understanding. This matters because only the theory of adaptation can provide an explanation for why biology operates in the way that it does, why it varies across individuals and species, a formal tool for making predictions about the future. The good news is that technological advances are creating new opportunities for understanding cellular and subcellular traits as the products of natural selection.",

While some genetic mechanisms underlying such traits have been identified, the role of physical properties of cellular and extracellular components remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that the evolution and development of the bulbus arteriosus (BA)—a teleost-specific, smooth muscle-rich heart outflow tract—is regulated by the mechanical properties of its extracellular environment. Specifically, we demonstrate that the teleost-specific extracellular matrix gene elastin b confers the uniquely low stiffness of the BA. In contrast to the BA, the homologous organ in nonteleost actinopterygians, the conus arteriosus (CA), and the ventricle are predominantly composed of cardiomyocytes and exhibit higher extracellular stiffness. Loss of elastin b function by knockdown or knockout leads to ectopic cardiomyocyte formation in the BA, accompanied by increased extracellular stiffness comparable to that of the ventricle. Furthermore, artificial stiffening of the BA extracellular environment is sufficient to induce ectopic cardiomyocyte differentiation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that extracellular stiffness governs cell fate determination and highlight its role in the emergence of evolutionary novelties in the teleost heart.",

Previous observational searches for the formation boundary were hampered by the lack of large unified samples of wide-orbit giant planets and substellar companions. A combined analysis of radial velocity and astrometry mitigates this problem and has significantly enlarged the sample. Here, we present a rigorous statistical analysis of the sample of 55 giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions orbiting FGK stars. We quantitatively analyze the occurrence rates of brown dwarfs and identify a distinct brown dwarf desert at approximately 30 M J , with no evidence of disappearance up to 20 au. Unlike previous studies that predicted a declining planet occurrence rate beyond the water-ice line, we identify a population of giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs in this region. The metallicity and eccentricity trends in our sample suggest that these are the consequences of two different formation scenarios. Our combined population synthesis model successfully accounts for the observed brown dwarf desert, supporting the dual formation hypothesis.",

Here, we collate cryo-ET data from hundreds of cells and tissues across the biosphere to i) identify emerging methodological trends, ii) pinpoint strategies to reduce imaging time and costs, iii) quantitatively compare methods for cell freezing and sectioning, and iv) census cryo-ET species coverage across all domains of life. Comparing the fraction of cellular material within a single lamella across all domains of life reveals an order of magnitude difference between eukaryotes (1%) compared to bacteria (9%) and archaea (14%). We calculate the fraction of cellular material which can be imaged using distinct sectioning methods on multicellular communities and tissues—identifying serial lift-out as a powerful approach for obtaining more complete cellular depictions. Finally, we show that the biodiversity of current cryo-ET studies is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than in sequence libraries and 4 to 5 lower than the total predicted on Earth.

Single sensillum recordings (SSR) revealed two types of pheromone-responsive sensilla, one narrowly tuned to the sex pheromone, and another that responded to both ( R )- and ( S )-japonilure, albeit with lower sensitivity to the latter. Functional characterization of A. corpulenta odorant receptors (ORs) by two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) led to the identification of two key receptors, AcorOR18, which was selective for ( R )-japonilure, and AcorOR29, which was activated by both enantiomers, and 10 ORs sensitive to plant-derived compounds. SSR combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments suggested that AcorOR18 is expressed in pheromone-specific sensilla, whereas AcorOR29 is localized in sensilla responsive to both the pheromone and its antagonist. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of either receptor reduced male attraction to ( R )-japonilure, while simultaneous knockdown of both genes abolished behavioral responses, confirming that both receptors are required for full pheromone detection. Three orthologous receptors were identified in the Japanese beetle ( Popillia japonica ) genome. Two of them, PjapOR42 and PjapOR37, exhibited strict enantioselectivity for ( R )-japonilure, whereas PjapOR39 showed a relaxed enantiospecificity, responding to both enantiomers and preferentially to the behavioral antagonist. These results suggest that PjapOR39 may mediate detection of ( S )-japonilure and contribute to behavioral antagonism, revealing a shared molecular mechanism of enantiomeric discrimination in scarab beetles.",

Zinc is essential for erythropoiesis, yet the mechanisms linking zinc availability to heme biosynthesis and anemia risk remain unclear. This study aimed to define zinc-responsive pathways in differentiating erythroid progenitors and to evaluate the translational relevance of SLC39A10 ( ZIP10 ) genetic variants to hematological health. To elucidate the molecular basis of zinc’s role in erythropoiesis, we performed transcriptomic profiling of zinc-restricted G1E-ER4 cells during differentiation and compared it to iron chelation and δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase inhibition. Zinc deficiency uniquely enriched genes involved in not only heme biosynthesis but cellular maintenance functions. Zinc restriction caused a marked suppression of Alad transcript abundance, impairing the first enzymatic step of cytosolic heme biosynthesis. Notably, Slc39a10 ( Zip10 ) was the only zinc transporter strongly induced by zinc deficiency, independent of iron status. Loss of ZIP10 exacerbated zinc depletion, further reduced Alad expression, and diminished heme output, highlighting its role as a compensatory importer during zinc scarcity. GWAS database analyses revealed that SLC39A10 variants are significantly associated with hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, and iron deficiency anemia risk. Together, ZIP10 safeguards erythroid zinc homeostasis and heme synthesis under limiting zinc conditions. Genetic variation in SLC39A10 may heighten sensitivity to zinc deficiency, providing a potential nutrigenetic marker for anemia risk. These findings establish a mechanistic and translational basis for genotype-guided precision nutrition strategies to improve hematological health.",

Eutectic gallium–indium, a type of liquid metal, serves as both the deformable electrode for capacitive sensors and a low-resistance conductor for inductors. It is integrated into a thin-film, battery-free, inductive-capacitive wireless sensing platform. Scalable wireless sensor arrays are created through microfabrication for large-area pressure mapping. The wireless pressure sensor is also integrated with soft ferromagnetic and self-healing layers in cuff-type sensors to allow for autonomous folding in response to external magnets, eliminating the need for suturing. In addition, a miniaturized wearable readout system integrated into medical gloves enables wireless and real-time pressure monitoring. The presented wireless soft pressure-sensing method with large-area mapping and secure implantation capabilities offers alternatives to conventional medical tools for intraoperative monitoring and examinations.",

          "abstract": "Classical mate choice theories assume independent decision-making, yet mounting evidence shows that individuals often use social information and copy conspecifics’ mate choices, a behavior termed mate copying. While this nonindependent mate choice has been documented across vertebrates and notably in Drosophila melanogaster , theoretical and experimental frameworks have been mainly restricted to binary choice scenarios, limiting our understanding of its evolutionary implications in natural populations. Here, we develop a theoretical model of mate copying applicable to populations with multiple morphs, incorporating both private (inherent) and public (cultural) information in mate choice decisions. The population dynamics of the different male morphs are driven by the differing intensities of conformist and anticonformist mate copying. We demonstrate that mate copying can lead to the fixation of low-quality morphs and identify the conditions necessary for the existence of a polymorphism consisting of all male morphs in the population. Furthermore, we identify a plausible mechanism that could maintain a stable polymorphism in the case of conformist mate copying with two morphs. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding how social learning in mate choice can influence evolutionary trajectories and contribute to maintaining phenotypic diversity in populations, with potential implications for sexual selection and speciation.",

          "abstract": "Enzymatic detoxification of organophosphate (OP) insecticides can confer resistance in some insects, yet the precise molecular basis of this trait, and how it has evolved, remains poorly understood. In certain dipteran species, a G→D mutation in the oxyanion hole of α-carboxylesterases (CBEs) enhances OP hydrolysis, yet this adaptation is not widespread despite the presence of orthologous CBEs in other insect species that are also exposed to OPs. The extent, and molecular basis, of evolutionary contingency and epistasis in this catalytic OP resistance has not been explored, and how further mutations might optimize OP detoxification in the future is not clear. Here, we systematically compare OP hydrolysis and analyze structures of CBE orthologs across several dipteran species, revealing that the success of the G137D mutation is sequence context-dependent. We employed laboratory-directed evolution to enhance OP turnover over 1,000-fold vs. the wildtype enzyme and tested these variants in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster , demonstrating that improved catalytic rates do not directly translate to increased resistance. By highlighting the trade-off between organophosphate affinity and turnover, this work further clarifies the complex evolutionary trajectories determining why a particular resistance mechanism may evolve in some species but not others.",

Currently, many computational efforts seek to elucidate the conformational ensembles of these disordered proteins, yet most methods still struggle to fully capture their structural diversity. Here, we integrate structural libraries of various IDRs—derived from coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning models—with experimental chemical shifts obtained from NMR spectroscopy. Through a maximum entropy reweighting approach, we obtain reliable ensembles that more accurately reflect observed chemical shifts and reveal transient states. Our results highlight the importance of comprehensive sampling strategies for capturing diverse conformational states. Furthermore, we show that these weighted ensembles faithfully track conformational rearrangements under various conditions such as temperature, mutational effects, and environment, which are not fully captured by experiments alone. This approach provides a dataset encompassing each IDR’s specific structures along with their weights, offering a foundation for systematically exploring IDR structural landscapes, refining our understanding of their functional roles, and shedding light on processes related to misfolding and aggregation.",

          "abstract": "Mycolic acids (MAs) are the major component of the mycobacterial outer membrane, a key contributor to the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to external insults including multiple antibiotics. After being synthesized in the cytoplasm and before reaching the outer membrane, MAs are transported across the inner membrane in the form of an acylated sugar, generally believed to be trehalose monomycolates (TMMs). Whether trehalose is the only mycolate carrier during transport is under debate, and why this highly abundant disaccharide is essential for mycobacterial growth is unclear. To address these questions, we leveraged a trehalose auxotrophic Mycobacterium smegmatis strain to investigate the biosynthetic steps affording TMMs. We show that in addition to TMMs, mature MAs are also not produced in the absence of intracellular trehalose. This is likely due to a product inhibition mechanism where unreduced MA precursors accumulate on Pks13, the protein catalyzing the ligation of mycolic acids and the sugar head group. We establish that the unreduced mycolates could only be released by trehalose, revealing exquisite Pks13 specificity, and subsequently reduced by CmrA in vitro. Furthermore, only trehalose and its analogs can reactivate MA biosynthesis in cells. Finally, by replacing trehalose with a 6-deoxy analog in cells, we demonstrate that the cord factor trehalose dimycolate is dispensable for M. smegmatis growth in vitro. Our work gives a clear depiction of how TMMs are formed and provides a compelling reason for the essentiality of trehalose, shedding light on the development of future antimycobacterial strategies.",

          "abstract": "The ocean’s biological carbon pump exports atmospheric CO 2 to the deep ocean, where it can remain sequestered for decades to centuries, and attempts to artificially enhance this natural carbon sink by fertilizing portions of the open ocean could help mitigate the impacts of excessive anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. However, differences in the cycling rates of carbon and other nutrients may impact the long-term response to ocean fertilization. In this study, we use a steady-state global biogeochemical inverse model, optimized to match hydrographic observations, to examine how differential production, remineralization, and circulation-driven re-exposure timescales of organic carbon and phosphorus affect long-term carbon sequestration. We partition global organic matter production based on the time required for regenerated carbon and phosphorus to return to the ocean surface. We find that less than 15% of total organic carbon and 31% of total organic phosphorus production remains sequestered in the ocean interior for ≥ 1 y, with only 3.3% (1.8 Pg C y −1 ) and 8.3% (0.046 Pg P y −1 ), respectively, remaining for a century or longer. The C:P ratio of the sequestration flux declines with increasing residence time, from 255:1 for total production to 98:1 for material sequestered for 100+ years, indicating that carbon is recycled to the surface more rapidly than phosphorus. This decoupling between carbon and phosphorus sequestration timescales could result in a “productivity hangover,” where the slow recovery of surface phosphate leads to a long-term suppression of global productivity, reducing the net removal of atmospheric CO 2 .",

This study demonstrated both the stability of epigenetic inheritance across generations and demonstrated a generational increase incidence of disease pathology. Building on this research, the present study follows the same lineage of rats with ancestral vinclozolin exposure through twenty generations. The findings offer important insights into long-term mammalian models of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance. Observations demonstrate an increase in differential DNA methylated regions across multiple generations. This indicates a persistent and stable transmission of epigenetic alterations. Additionally, deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) transferase-mediated nick end labeling apoptosis assays revealed elevated levels of germline apoptosis in the male rats of the maternal and paternal lineages. This suggests a potential consequence of epigenetic dysregulation in spermatogenesis. Ancestrally exposed rats to vinclozolin showed significant parturition abnormalities in both the maternal and paternal lineages after 16 generations. This included maternal deaths during labor and stillbirths. Pathological assessments revealed abnormalities across multiple tissue types and an increased incidence of disease. This suggests the physiological consequences of the generational stability of epigenetic inheritance. Observations establish the generational stability of epigenetic inheritance over twenty generations in a mammalian model system; however, new pathology in later generations involving parturition abnormalities was also observed. The generational stability of transgenerational effects observed in this study has implications for human health, particularly regarding environmental toxicant exposures, reproductive health disorders, and disease susceptibility.",

          "abstract": "Habitat fragmentation is one of the most immediate and substantial threats to biodiversity, generating isolated populations with reduced genetic diversity. Genetic monitoring has become essential for detecting fragmentation and tracking its progress. However, the coherent interpretation of genetic monitoring data and understanding the genetic consequences of fragmentation require frameworks that accurately represent real-world complexity. Existing theoretical frameworks typically rely on simplified spatial structures and do not adequately capture the heterogeneous migration patterns of natural populations. Here, we integrate network theory and mathematical population genetics to develop a framework for studying the genetic consequences of fragmentation processes, explicitly accounting for heterogeneous connectivity and temporal dynamics. We apply this framework to examine how different fragmentation processes affect genetic measures commonly used in genetic monitoring. Through analysis of simulated and empirical networks, we find that different fragmentation scenarios produce substantially distinct trajectories in key genetic measures, sometimes exhibiting rapid transitional dynamics. Furthermore, fragmentation can cause deviations from classical theoretical expectations, such as the expected correlation between genetic and geographic distance (isolation-by-distance) or between genetic diversity and connectivity. Finally, we propose and demonstrate detectable early warning signals in genetic monitoring data that precede rapid transitional phases. Our framework thus provides a practical interpretation of genetic monitoring data, and a proof-of-concept that bridges the gap between idealized theoretical models and real-world connectivity dynamics.",

          "abstract": "The relationship between different cell populations in monkey primary visual cortex and their role in visual function is not fully resolved. We combined high-density Neuropixels recordings across layers of macaque V1, and a state-of-the-art nonlinear dimensionality reduction approach on waveform shape to delineate nine putative cell classes: 4 narrow-spiking (NS), 4 broad-spiking (BS), and 1 triphasic (TP). Then, we performed targeted analyses of laminar organization, spike amplitude, multichannel spatial features, functional properties, and network connectivity of these cell classes. These analyses have uncovered four fundamental aspects of V1 laminar microcircuitry never fully demonstrated before in vivo. First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and outnumbered parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with findings on potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large-amplitude NS cell class in layer 4b was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms suggestive of a stellate morphology, a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons projecting from V1 to MT. Third, another NS cell class in layer 4b showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis revealed distinct feedforward interactions between cell classes in layer 4 and layer 5/6 and those in layer 2/3. These results demonstrate how high-resolution electrophysiology can reveal links between laminar organization and in vivo function of neurons. Our findings offer key insights for biologically realistic microcircuit models of primate V1 and may generalize to other regions.",

Mechanistic studies show that homopentameric CorA is regulated through an intracellular [Mg 2+ ]-dependent negative feedback loop, involving the asymmetric participation of individual subunits. To understand the connection between asymmetry and activation, we used single-particle cryo-EM to solve sixteen structures of nanodisc-reconstituted CorA. We utilized conformation-specific synthetic antibodies to stabilize subtle but significant conformational differences in the cryo-EM structures. Our results demonstrate that CorA exists as a set of conformational ensembles, where population size inversely correlates with intracellular Mg 2+ concentration. These ensembles include channels with a variety of pore conformations, both constricted and dilated, suggesting a spectrum of active CorA functional states. The ensembles connect asymmetric structural transitions in the cytoplasmic domain with conformational changes in the permeation pathway via an electrostatic network, ultimately controlling channel-gating events.

Our model captures the configurational complexity of experimentally relevant (4 to 10 nm) particles and reveals that disordered Pt 0.85 Cu 0.15 nanoparticles exhibit optimal mass activity near 5 nm and a saturated specific activity plateau at ~6 nm, driven by the high density of catalytically active Pt(111) terrace sites. We further identify a size-dependent crossover in catalytic performance between ordered and disordered Pt–Cu particles, governed by subsurface atomic ordering and the distribution of *OH binding energies.

However, its structural flexibility and broader cellular roles are not well understood. Here, we offer a comprehensive analysis of RMRP ’s structure in solution, its interactions with human proteins, and its mitochondrial functions. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that RMRP adopts different Mg 2+ -dependent shapes, shifting from an extended Y-shaped form to a more compact one as Mg 2+ levels increase. We identified and characterized interactions between RMRP and the DEAD-box RNA helicases DDX5 and DDX3X, with DDX5 binding strongly and exhibiting ATP-dependent helicase activity on RMRP , while DDX3X mainly acts as an expression regulator. Both helicases are crucial for the proper mitochondrial localization of RMRP , working within a complex regulatory network. Functionally, reducing RMRP levels disrupts mitochondrial stability, leading to membrane depolarization and an increase in reactive oxygen species, without affecting cell growth. Mechanistically, RMRP specifically controls nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins involved in cristae structure (DNAJC11) and respiratory chain function (NDUFS8). Our results position RMRP as a structurally adaptable lncRNA that collaborates with RNA helicases to preserve mitochondrial health through specific gene regulation. These insights provide perspectives on RMRP ’s biology and the molecular mechanisms underlying RMRP -related disorders, which could inform future therapies for conditions resulting from RMRP dysfunction.",

Deciphering how aging influences cancer evolution is critical for improving risk assessment, prevention, and treatment. Here, using a N-nitroso-N-methylurea (NMU)-induced rat mammary tumor model that recapitulates key features of human breast cancer, we integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, whole-exome sequencing, and histopathological analysis to dissect age-associated differences in mammary tumorigenesis. We found that the age at NMU exposure critically influences tumor incidence, mutational burden, molecular subtype, and the tumor immune microenvironment. Tumors arising in aged rats originated from aging luminal progenitor-like cells, exhibited increased genomic instability, reduced immune cell infiltration, and impaired antigen presentation linked to loss of heterozygosity at chromosome (Chr) 20p. The age-associated epithelial and immune changes we identified were conserved in human breast cancers, where the loss of the homologous Chr 6p region correlated with reduced lymphocyte infiltration and shorter relapse-free survival. These findings reveal that aging profoundly affects tumor-initiating cell populations and promotes immune evasion through chromosomal instability-driven defects in antigen presentation. Our work provides a molecular basis for understanding disease onset and progression that may impact efficacy of immunotherapy in older breast cancer patients.",

Hasp170 targets the intrinsically disordered region (IDR1) of the wheat nuclear protein TaPSTE (phase separation protein targeted by effector), which forms LLPS-dependent biomolecular condensates. Within these condensates, TaPSTE recruits the transcription factor TaNF-YC, thereby activating the expression of genes driving reactive oxygen species burst and Ca 2+ influx, key components for disease resistance. By binding TaPSTE’s IDR1, Hasp170 impairs condensate formation and prevents TaNF-YC recruitment, consequently suppressing host immunity and facilitating fungal parasitism.

          "abstract": "The Great Unconformity (GUn)—a widely recognized discontinuity and associated gap in the rock record between Precambrian and Cambrian rocks—represents a globally important interval of continental exposure and erosion that is notable also for the first appearance of all major animal phyla on Earth. However, its origin remains the subject of vigorous debate. Here, we present field relationships, and zircon and monazite U–Pb, biotite and muscovite Rb–Sr, and zircon (U–Th)/He thermochronology data for Precambrian crystalline basement rocks from North China to constrain the exhumation history below the unconformity. Dates from multichronometers and thermal history inversions show that the most substantial cooling of continental basement took place from ~2,100 to 1,600 Ma. Comparison with thermal history data from Laurentia, Baltica, and Amazonia suggests that protracted plate tectonics broadly modulated by supercontinent cycles, and not “snowball Earth” glaciation, is responsible for crustal exhumation below the unconformity. The most pronounced erosion evident in both the thermochronologic record and geochemical indicators of continental weathering is shown to correspond with development of Earth’s first true supercontinent (Columbia), rather than with either the Cambrian explosion or the emergence of modern plate tectonics.",

          "abstract": "The Golden Horde, the northwestern extension of the Mongol Empire ruled by Genghis Khan’s descendants, holds a pivotal place in the history of Central Eurasia and Eastern Europe. Consequently, understanding the genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his lineage has long been of both academic and public interest, especially concerning the hypothesized association of his Y-chromosome with haplogroup C3*. Here, we present ancient DNA data from four archaeological individuals—three males and one female—from medieval elite mausoleums of the Golden Horde in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. Our genomic analyses reveal that the three male individuals are paternally related and share the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, confirming the association between the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3* and the Mongol Empire, supporting the long-standing hypothesis about the genetic legacy of Mongols. Additionally, our findings demonstrate that the Golden Horde elites primarily derive their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA), with an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population, e.g., the Kipchaks. Archaeological evidence, in turn, sheds light on a medieval population undergoing religious and cultural transition, offering insights into the societal changes experienced by Mongolian conquerors. Furthermore, through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network, we successfully identify medieval relatives of these individuals on the Mongolian Plateau, linking genetic data to broader population dynamics. In essence, this study provides ancient DNA evidence that advances our understanding of the genetic background of the Mongolian elites and the population dynamics in Central Eurasia.",

          "abstract": "Adoptive cell therapies that genetically engineer immune cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have shown limited success against solid tumors due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and logistical challenges of ex vivo cell manipulation. Here, we introduce an immune cell-tropic lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform that enables systemic delivery of CAR-encoding mRNA for the in vivo generation of panCAR immune cells. A single intravenous injection of this LNP system efficiently and transiently engineers T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells across the spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood, yielding a synergistic, multilineage antitumor response. Using human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as a CAR target, we demonstrate that repeated administration of LNP formulated with HER2-CAR mRNA (LNP-panCAR HER2 ) effectively inhibits tumor growth and prolongs overall survival in three murine syngeneic xenograft tumor models, without causing obvious side effects. Immune profiling of treated tumors reveals a remodeled TME with a shift toward an immunostimulatory phenotype, characterized by reduced M2-like macrophages and an increased presence of effector T cell subsets. Our findings establish LNP-panCAR as a broadly applicable, off-the-shelf in vivo CAR cell therapy platform for solid tumor immunotherapy and beyond.",

Their biological function critically depends on mobility within densely crowded environments, yet the mechanisms governing their motion remain elusive, largely because conventional techniques cannot access the relevant microsecond timescales. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility to resolve LDL dynamics in native yolk-plasma. This approach reveals transient caging and memory effects and shows that the combined influence of particle softness and hydrodynamic coupling slows diffusion by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to dilute solutions. However, this reduction could not be scaled with an increase in macroscopic viscosity obtained from rheometry, indicating deviations from the Stokes–Einstein relation. Despite this slowdown, yolk-plasma remains a “sluggish yet liquid state”, balancing dense packing and the fluidity required for lipid release during embryonic development. These results establish a quantitative framework connecting microstructure, hydrodynamics, and transport in crowded soft-matter systems, with implications for developmental biology and nanomedicine.",

We tested 185 individually identified wild wolves across 44 locations covering a wide urbanization gradient, exposing them to novel objects and human playbacks. Wolves from more urbanized areas showed reduced fear at first exposure to an object but heightened caution when the object changed, indicating increased attention to environmental changes, rather than uniform fear reduction. By contrast, playbacks of human voices elicited strong fear responses (&gt;80%), regardless of urbanization. However, individuals habituated to both stimuli quickly and at a similar pace, highlighting their rapid learning abilities. Sociality buffered fear, with wolves in groups reacting less fearfully than wolves alone. Results show that wolves are capable of flexibly modulating their behavioral responses to both the risks and opportunities of human-dominated landscapes, which likely underpins their urban success and requires us to rise to the challenge of peaceful coexistence.",

          "abstract": "We previously reported initial results from a clinical trial testing a strategy in which patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) achieving a clinical complete response after cystoscopic resection of the bladder tumor plus systemic therapy could forgo removal of their entire bladder (cystectomy). While the results were highly promising, a subset of patients omitting initial cystectomy developed recurrence highlighting the need for biomarkers to refine selection of patients for this approach. We here report long-term follow-up of these patients and investigate whether tumor DNA in the plasma (ctDNA) or urine (utDNA) could inform prognosis and the need for cystectomy. Three-year bladder-intact survival among patients with a complete clinical response following four rounds of systemic therapy was 69%. Metastatic risk was significantly higher for patients with detectable versus undetectable ctDNA presystemic therapy (HR 4.68; 95% CI 1.10-43.35; log-rank P = 0.036). Only 4.5% (1 of 22) of patients with undetectable baseline ctDNA developed metastatic disease. Undetectable ctDNA before or after systemic therapy was associated with extremely low metastatic risk. Urine utDNA was more sensitive than plasma ctDNA at detecting residual disease within the bladder, and detectable urine utDNA in patients with a complete clinical response was associated with shorter bladder-intact survival (HR 6.47, 95% CI 1.34-31.31; log-rank P = 0.008). These findings establish the conceptual and experimental foundation for incorporating ctDNA and utDNA assays into the management of patients with MIBC, particularly with respect to the need for cystectomy.",

          "abstract": "The island species−area relationship (ISAR) is known to be near-ubiquitous, but its properties across the fullest span of island areas globally and how island endemism shapes the ISAR remain poorly understood. We determine the global ISAR for native (Nat Rich ) and for single-island endemic richness (SIE Rich ) of vascular plants, employing data for 1,262 islands, spanning 60.7S to 80.7 N and ten orders of magnitude in area. Using logged species number and area, we compared the power model and four different breakpoint models. For Nat Rich , a simple power model (slope, z = 0.32, R 2 = 66%) was best supported. For SIE Rich , a flat-steep breakpoint model outperforms the power model, with the latter producing a steeper slope ( z = 0.48, R 2 = 0.47) than for Nat Rich . Rerunning the Nat Rich power model for subsets of islands of increasing endemism generates increased ISAR slope and improved prediction of continental richness values. Controlling for island area, Nat Rich declines with isolation, while endemism increases. Semilog analyses show that old, tropical, mountainous continental fragments and landbridge islands, rich in SIE, drive an accelerated increase in Nat Rich for islands &gt;10,000 km 2 in size. The global Nat Rich archipelago species–area relationship was best described by a power model ( z = 0.41, R 2 = 0.54), and there is also evidence of declining richness but higher endemism with increased archipelago isolation. Our findings provide no support for the existence of an upper asymptote in the global plants ISAR, while supporting the application of the power model at a global scale, and highlighting roles for island type, endemism, and isolation as influences on ISAR form.",

          "abstract": "Viewed from space, a “green wave” seasonally traverses Earth’s surface, from the north in boreal summer to the south in austral summer. This wave represents vegetation phenology, driven primarily by solar irradiation and modulated by climate variability and ecosystem dynamics. Despite its significance for multiple Earth system processes, we lack a unified metric to characterize and understand its dynamics. Here, we propose a concept to quantify global phenology by tracking the green wave’s centroid using satellite and Earth system model data. The resulting trajectory summarizes global phenological dynamics and directional trends. Earlier reports on global greening led us to hypothesize a rapidly northward shifting trajectory during boreal summer and a moderate southward shift during austral summer. Contrary to this expectation, we find that the centroid moves northward during both summer periods, with the austral summer shift consistently exceeding the boreal shift across datasets. As a consequence, the amplitude of the green wave trajectory is decreasing, a trend projected to intensify throughout this century. We also detect an accelerating eastward shift, a phenomenon not previously reported. Tracking the green wave’s centroid reveals how regionally changing land dynamics affect the global functioning of Earth’s terrestrial biosphere.",

These nanoscopic channels emerge from packing defects in the jammed interfacial assemblies of the charged NPSs and support size and charge selective, hysteretic ion transport governed by interfacial electrostatics and dimensional constraints. The NPS-DIBs show short-term and long-term plasticity, hallmarks of neuromorphic behavior, that are mediated by the structural and chemical design of the bilayer.

          "abstract": "To trigger precipitation, water droplets in warm clouds need to attain a sufficient size. Theoretical estimates based on condensation and gravitational collisions alone fail to explain the observed timescales for the onset of precipitation for a range of droplet sizes. This suggests the involvement of collisional growth mediated by turbulence to resolve the so-called “size-gap problem.” For the onset of rain, it is sufficient that statistical outliers, coined “lucky droplets,” cross the size gap. In this study, we explore the influence of turbulence on droplet growth, focusing on correlated collisions and intermittency. Using direct numerical simulations of droplets in turbulent flow, we constrain a non-Markovian stochastic framework that allows us to assess memory effects on the droplet-size distribution arising from correlations between consecutive collisions. Using our framework, we find that correlated collisions accelerate the initial growth of lucky droplets but have subleading effect at later stages. Consequently, we neglect correlations from collisions and model an ensemble of cloud parcels representing fluctuations in the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Here, the distribution of droplet sizes in each parcel is described by a linear master equation with a time-dependent collision rate according to the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Our analyses of this toy model show that intermittency can significantly reduce the time required by lucky droplets to cross the size gap.",

The onset of MCV at ~2.7 Ma was heralded by isolated precursor events, followed by multiple millennial climate oscillations at ~2.5 Ma. These events coincided with deposition of ice-rafted detritus in the North Atlantic, suggesting a role for marine-terminating ice sheets.

We describe an intranasal liposomal formulation combining toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and 7/8 ligands with a model antigen, ovalbumin, that provided broad, durable protection in mice for at least 3 months against infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Staphylococcus aureus . In addition, the vaccine protected mice from other viruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS, SCH014 coronavirus), bacteria ( Acinetobacter baumannii ), and allergens. Protection was mediated by persistent ovalbumin-specific CD4 + and CD8 + memory T cells that imprinted alveolar macrophages (AMs), enhancing antigen presentation and antiviral immunity. Following infection, vaccinated mice mounted rapid pathogen-specific T cell and antibody responses and formed ectopic lymphoid structures in the lung. These results reveal a class of “universal vaccines” against diverse respiratory threats.",

          "abstract": "Humans across multiple languages spontaneously associate the nonwords “kiki” and “bouba” with spiky and round shapes, respectively, a phenomenon named the bouba-kiki effect. To explore the origin of this association, and whether it is unique to humans, we tested the bouba-kiki effect in baby domestic chickens ( Gallus gallus ). As a precocial species, chicks can be tested shortly after hatching, allowing us to control their pretest experiences. Similar to humans, both 3-day-old [Experiment 1 (Exp. 1)] and 1-day-old (Exp. 2) chicks spontaneously choose a spiky shape when hearing the “kiki” sound and a round shape when hearing the “bouba” sound. Results from naïve young animals suggest a predisposed mechanism for matching the dimensions of shape and sound, which may be widespread across species.",

Proofreading is typically assumed to evolve when selection for fidelity outweighs costs in energy and the speed of replication. We show that when stalling after misincorporations is accounted for, proofreading can instead speed up replication. Consistent with data on polymerase mutagenesis, our results suggest that proofreading can evolve under selection for speed alone. We generalize to multicomponent self-assembly and show that analogous error-correcting processes, such as dynamic instability, can likewise emerge purely from selection for rapid assembly. Thus, nonequilibrium error correction can evolve from selection for speed, even without direct fidelity advantages. We discuss implications for mutation-rate evolution, molecular assembly processes, and models of early life.",

In this work, we show that the filamentous hemagglutinin FhaB adhesin of Bordetella carries a C-terminal microtubule-binding domain (FhaB-CT), which is translocated into host cells to promote colonization. FhaB-CT delivery is required to occupy a niche at the base of cilia in airway epithelia, and mutant bacteria lacking this domain are defective for nasal colonization. These observations suggest that FhaB-CT is transferred into motile respiratory cilia to interact with core axonemal microtubules. We propose that Bordetella adheres initially to the tips of cilia and then deploys multiple FhaB adhesins to migrate to the base of the cilia forest, where the bacteria resist removal by the mucociliary “escalator” that normally clears the respiratory tract of microbes.",

Joint inversion of teleseismic and InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for the space-time slip distribution, with validation by means of forward modeling of deep-water tsunami recordings, revealed a southwestward elongated large-slip patch on the curved plate boundary. A slip of up to 14 meters was located offshore southern Kamchatka and Paramushir Island. The 1952 earthquake generated stronger tsunami signals in Hawaii, indicating a different slip distribution. Peak slip in 2025 exceeded the maximum slip deficit accumulated since 1952.

Longitudinal single-cell tracking suggested that improved hormone responsiveness reflects increasing activity of SC-α and -β cells with low and high basal firing, linked to induction of energy and hormone metabolism genes. Daily metabolic entrainment showed that circadian hormone secretion rhythms reflect daily oscillation of SC-α and -β electrical characteristics, tied to induction of cell-cell communication and exocytic gene networks, revealing circadian coordination of cell-level, stimulus-coupled responses. Lastly, we showed that electrical stimulation, via implanted actuators, enhances SC-α and -β glucose responsiveness.

Building on advances in feature learning, we developed an approach for extracting linear representations of semantic notions or concepts in AI models.

We demonstrated that concept representations were transferable across languages and enabled multiconcept steering. Across hundreds of concepts, we found that larger models were more steerable and that steering improved model capabilities beyond prompting. We showed that concept representations were more effective for monitoring misaligned content than for using judge models.

We found that in mice, ACC theta oscillations are involved in empathy-driven prosocial allogrooming. Moreover, orexinergic neurons are selectively activated in the ACC during observational fear and prosocial allogrooming, but only when the animals had prior fear experience. Real-time, gaze-dependent optogenetic inhibition of lateral hypothalamic orexinergic inputs to ACC suppressed theta power and reduced both behaviors. These findings show that hypothalamic orexinergic inputs drive ACC theta oscillations to modulate observational fear and prosocial behaviors, providing circuit-level insight into how affective empathy translates into prosocial action.",

We found that in some mammalian cells, including neurons, stress also resulted in the formation of inactive ribosome-ribosome clusters (disomes). We used cryo–electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize ribosomes in situ and observed that this ribosome dimerization was mediated by a homotypic interaction of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) expansion segment ES31Lb. ES31Lb interactions were both necessary and sufficient for disome formation and conferred a growth advantage and stress resistance to brain cells. ES31Lb is predicted to homodimerize in ~20% of chordates, including variants in both chicken and human. Cryo-ET analysis of chicken tetrasomes revealed an interaction between ES31Lb and ES9La.

The integrated stress response (ISR) is elicited by phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2, which traps and inhibits rate-limiting translation factor eIF2B, thereby attenuating translation initiation. Termination of this pathway thus requires relieving eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition. Here, we found that eIF2 phosphatase subunits PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (R15B) bound P-eIF2 in complex with eIF2B. Biochemical investigations guided by cryo–electron microscopy structures of native eIF2-eIF2B and P-eIF2-eIF2B complexes bound to R15B demonstrated that R15B enabled dephosphorylation of otherwise dephosphorylation-incompetent P-eIF2 on eIF2B.

          "abstract": "The Perseverance rover landed in Jezero crater on Mars, which once contained a lake of liquid water. We report the rock properties encountered by Perseverance during a 10-kilometer traverse extending over 400 meters in elevation, from beneath Jezero’s western sedimentary fan to the upper crater rim. These rocks consist of coarse-grained olivine, magnesium and iron carbonates, silica, and phyllosilicates, including some of the oldest materials exposed within Jezero. We infer that these rocks formed by olivine accumulation in an igneous system of layered intrusions, followed by exposure to water and carbon dioxide, which caused extensive carbonation of the silicate minerals. Aqueous alteration was more pronounced at lower elevations. Higher-elevation exposures on the crater rim appear similar to olivine-rich rocks distributed over the wider Nili Fossae region.",

          "abstract": "People are influenced by the choices of others, a phenomenon observed across contexts in the social and behavioral sciences. Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet, several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock in. Here, we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the “marginal majority effect”: a discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of a marginal majority effect in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.",

          "abstract": "Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is a widely studied multidomain redox enzyme that produces the key signaling molecule and cytotoxic agent nitric oxide (NO) for functions that range from mammalian vasodilation to prokaryotic antibiotic resistance. NOS enzymes from metazoans and cyanobacteria rely on dynamic associations of their oxygenase and coupled diflavin reductase domains that have largely evaded detailed structural characterization. Cryo–electron microscopy studies of a representative dimeric six-domain Synechococcus NOS reveal the architecture of the full-length enzyme, which contains an unusual regulatory C2 domain, and additional nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) and pseudoglobin modules. Five distinct structural states depict how pterin binding couples to tight and loose oxygenase conformations and how the Ca 2+ -sensitive C2 domain moves over 85 angstroms to alternatively regulate either the NOS or NOD heme center. The extended carboxyl-terminal tail and its dynamic interactions highlight an added layer of regulation required by multidomain NOSs compared to other diflavin reductases.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T cell) therapy for leukemia and lymphoma, solid tumors remain challenging because of limited target specificity and safety concerns. Neoantigens like KRAS G12V , a highly prevalent yet undruggable mutation in solid tumors, offer tumor-exclusive specificity. This study developed CAR T cells targeting KRAS G12V /HLA-A*02:01 using phage antibody display to identify high-affinity single-chain variable fragments. Engineered B9 CAR T cells specifically lysed tumor cells and patient-derived cancer organoids expressing KRAS G12V /HLA-A*02:01, demonstrating potent antitumor activity. Animal studies showed that B9 CAR T cells effectively controlled tumor growth in subcutaneous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) xenografts, as well as in metastatic and peritoneal PDAC models. Safety assessments in NCG-HLA-A2.1 and C57BL/6 mice revealed no detectable in vivo toxicity, supporting the clinical applicability of B9 CAR T cells. Collectively, our neoantigen-targeted CAR T cell therapy against solid tumors shows great potential for future clinical trials in patients with KRAS G12V /HLA-A*02:01, paving the way for clinical translation.",

          "abstract": "Global change reshapes biodiversity through shifts in species composition, richness, and body size. How these shifts combine to alter higher-level ecological processes within food webs can have important implications for entire ecosystems. However, the strength and direction of these shifts will depend on combinations of ways that species and trait compositions change through time. We combine long-term data from ~15,000 freshwater and marine fish communities (1949–2019) with information about their size, diets, and trophic status to evaluate how food webs change through time at local spatial scale. We found that selective species turnover driven by body size reductions is associated with widespread alteration to fish food web topology and function, including increased connectance and generalism, leading to higher predation pressure and increased prey vulnerability. Food webs were also less modular. These changes extend across food web trophic structures, causing a cascading shift in the proportion of species across trophic levels. Our study highlights complex biodiversity responses to confluent changes across multiple facets.",

          "abstract": "Microglia critically shape neuronal circuit development and function, yet their region-specific properties and roles in distinct circuits of the human brain remain poorly understood. In this study, we generated region-specific brain organoids (cortical, striatal, and midbrain), each integrated with human microglia, to fill this critical gap. Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered six distinct microglial subtypes exhibiting unique regional signatures, including a subtype highly enriched for the GABA B receptor gene within striatal organoids. To investigate the contributions of microglia to neural circuitry, we created microglia-incorporated midbrain-striatal assembloids, modeling a core circuit node for many neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism. Using chemogenetics to activate this midbrain-striatal circuit, we observed increased calcium signaling in microglia involving GABA B receptors. Leveraging this model, we examined microglial responses within neural circuits harboring an SCN2A nonsense (C959X) mutation associated with profound autism. Microglia displayed heightened calcium responses to SCN2A mutation–mediated neuronal hyperactivity and engaged in excessive synaptic pruning. These pathological effects were reversed not only by pharmacological inhibition of microglial GABA B receptors but also by knockout of the GABBR1 gene in microglia. Collectively, our findings establish an advanced platform that can be used to dissect human neuroimmune interactions in subcortical regions and to evaluate previously undiscovered therapies, highlighting the important role of microglia in shaping critical circuitry related to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Unfortunately, two-dimensional (2D) histopathology—the gold standard for pathological understanding of many liver diseases—can misrepresent or leave gaps in our understanding of complex 3D structural features. Here, we used immunostaining, tissue clearing, microscopy, and computational software to create 3D multilobular reconstructions of both nonfibrotic and cirrhotic human liver tissue. We found that spatial architecture in human cirrhotic liver samples with varying etiologies had sinusoid zonal dysregulation, reduction in glutamine synthetase–expressing pericentral hepatocytes, regression of central vein networks, disruption of hepatic arterial networks, and fragmentation of biliary networks, which together suggest a pro-portalization/decentralization phenotype in cirrhotic tissue. Further implementation of 3D pathological analyses may provide a deeper understanding of cirrhotic pathobiology and inspire treatments for liver disease.",

          "abstract": "Conventional semiconductor device engineering regards intrinsic device nonidealities as reliability concerns to be minimized or eliminated. Here, we demonstrate the strategic repurposing of these nonidealities as functional resources for advanced stochastic analog computing. We leverage two underutilized phenomena—deep-level channel trap-induced generation-recombination (G-R) noise and impact ionization–induced negative differential resistance (NDR) in body current—which have received limited attention compared to the extensively studied 1/ f noise and monotonic drain current behavior in logic-centric transistors. By exploiting G-R noise with controllable temporal correlation and NDR with an unprecedented peak-to-valley ratio (2.78 × 10 4 ) within fully depleted silicon-on-insulator transistors fabricated in industry silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process, we achieve multifunctional analog computation at the single-device level. Our transistor seamlessly performs stochastic encryption, deterministic signal readout, and analog inversion simply through reconfiguration of applied bias conditions, thereby eliminating the need for peripheral random-number generators, dedicated analog inverters, or amplifiers. This approach not only reveals the previously unrecognized computational potential embedded in mature CMOS technologies but also presents a scalable and energy-efficient alternative to architecture based on exotic materials, laying the foundation for next-generation analog computing systems.",

FBL17 null mutants exhibit severe cellular defects leading to lethality. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FBL17 operate remain poorly understood. Here, we show that FBL17 interacts with different components of the RETINOBLASTOMA-RELATED1/E2F module and is involved in the protein turnover of E2Fa and E2Fb. However, mutations in E2Fa or E2Fb do not alleviate the severe fbl17 phenotype but worsen it. By contrast, it is the accumulation of the transcriptional repressor E2Fc that causes fbl17 mutant lethality. Our results highlight a key role for FBL17 in modulating the transcriptional control of E2F target genes ensuring precise control of cell cycle progression and avoiding uncontrolled DNA damage response.",

To enhance hydrogen selectivity, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) were incorporated into ZIF-8 fillers, forming a physically confined structure conducive to hydrogen transport. The metal-organic framework (MOF)/GNR filler embedded into a polyimide (PI) matrix yielded a much higher H 2 permeability (298 Barrer, +40%) and H 2 /N 2 selectivity (15, +25%) than the neat PI membrane.

Studies in piglets demonstrated appropriate constraint of the device to small diameters (8 to 9 millimeters) upon implantation, acute valve function, and the ability of the stent to proportionately expand with growth up to 13 millimeters after 6 weeks without subsequent interventions after implantation.

Significant increases in SFW occurred during 1979 to 2024, with more than a twofold increase observed in most regions.

Internal modes of climate variability strongly influence SFW in several regions, including Equatorial Asia, which experiences 43 additional intraregional SFW days during El Niño years.

Here, we reveal chaotic MJO propagation arising from cross-scale nonlinear interactions, based on 4000-member ensemble simulations of two MJO events with a global cloud-system–resolving model. Against conventional linear thinking, multiple regimes with distinct timings of MJO propagation emerge under a single atmosphere-ocean background. The emergence of regime bifurcation depends critically on the equatorial asymmetry of climatological sea surface temperature. Selection of the bifurcated regimes is probabilistic, influenced by whether tropical-extratropical interplay promotes moistening associated with westward-propagating tropical waves over the western Pacific.

Accordingly, steroid microparticles were developed via three fabrication processes in this work, where a metal or an organic acid facilitates steroid microparticle formation. Particles fabricated using these methods exhibit consistent shape, size, and crystallinity. Furthermore, results from our coarse-grained computational model show that hydrogen bonding dictates steroid monomer-monomer interactions that determine overall particle shape and size.

          "abstract": "How intestinal immunity develops during early life remains a key question in understanding defense against infections. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are critical for this defense, and their developmental progression and subset balance are essential for effective immune function. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor Nur77 helps control NKp46 + ILC3 development in newborn mice. Mice lacking Nur77 have fewer ILC3s and failed to convert one ILC3 subtype (NKp46 − ) into a more protective form (NKp46 + ), reducing their ability to fight Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection. We found that 12R-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12R-HETE), a natural lipid found in the intestine, binds to Nur77 and boosts the expression of transcription factor T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet), promoting the shift to NKp46 + ILC3s and increasing the production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), a key immune molecule. This response is dependent on Nur77. Further analyses have revealed that Nur77 directly regulates a gene called Impdh1 , which supports this immune transition. Our findings uncover a Nur77-driven pathway that helps shape gut immunity in early life.",

Using a facile yet versatile template-guided growth strategy, vertically aligned Au-Ag nanowire arrays are directly fabricated on 1D nano/microneedles, 2D elastic films, and 3D porous architectures. On 2D substrates, the arrays act as FlexoSERS interfaces with high sensitivity, uniformity (RSD = 7.2%), and durability, maintaining stable SERS signals under 100% strain and after 2500 cycles. On 3D porous sponges, the NWs serve as dry bioelectrical electrodes, enabling stable electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring with long-term stability. Continuous ECG recording, combined with deep learning analysis, enables accurate classification between sleep and wake states. Meanwhile, the EMG signals capture subtle motor activities such as finger bending, typing, and clicking. By uniting strain-tolerant FlexoSERS with reliable bioelectrical sensing across 1D-3D substrates, this platform provides a robust material foundation and a scalable route toward next-generation wearable health monitors, intelligent sleep evaluation, and human-machine interfaces.",

Cell type–specific adaptation of the properties is induced within hours in response to stress or changes in cell wall metabolism.

We identified Parvimonas micra ( P. micra ), an anaerobic oral-derived bacterium, as significantly enriched in tumor tissues and associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, the abundance of P. micra correlated with increased regulatory T cell (T reg cell) infiltration in the ESCC tumor microenvironment. Through cellular and animal experiments, we demonstrate that P. micra promotes tumor growth by secreting p -cresol, a metabolite of amino acid fermentation, which elevates reactive oxygen species levels and induces FOXP3 + T reg differentiation, thereby fostering immunosuppression and tumor growth. Our study establishes a mechanistic link between intratumoral microbiota and the immune microenvironment, highlighting the microbial contribution to ESCC progression and prognosis.",

These two regions contained NCSTN and PSEN2 , genes that code two subunits of the γ-secretase complex. Evaluation of 267 precancerous lesions revealed that extra copies of NCSTN and PSEN2 were common (49%) in noninvasive neoplasms (high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms), which are at relatively high risk for progression to PDACs, but uncommon (6%) in low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions, which have low malignant potential.

Helicases emerged as the most commonly mutated cancer driver enzyme family, altered in two-thirds of all cancers. Functional screens and genomic analyses revealed that helicase dysfunctions contribute to genomic instability and faulty DNA repair. We observed a marked phenotype of Aquarius helicase ( AQR ), which was recurrently hemizygously deleted as an early clonal event in cancer genomes. These deletions were associated with high genomic instability and homologous recombination deficiency signatures.

Parasites lacking BTP2 are still enveloped by membranes but fail to separate from each other, resulting in multiorganellar mutants. We isolate the defect to a specific step during basal complex development and demonstrate that the contractile ability remains intact. By revisiting BLEB, we identify a distinct plasma membrane region that is excluded from daughter cells and associated with the basal complex. Integrating these findings, we propose a three-step model for basal complex biogenesis that highlights the specific role of BTP2 and suggests a role for the BLEB-associated membrane.

We identified 922 SNPs and 487 CpG-containing elements modulating enhancer activity in primary cells and found 3136 SNPs and 3008 methylation-sensitive elements with metastasis-specific regulatory effects. Multi-omics integration linked these variants to target genes, and CRISPR editing validated their roles in driving tumorigenic and metastatic phenotypes.

Mechanistically, hypermethylation at cg08640619 disrupts RUNX2 binding, leading to inhibition of KIRREL1 and ETV3 .

Moreover, catalytic allosteric hairpin assemblies achieve ~30-fold signal amplification with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. Concurrently, allosteric DNA neural networks discriminate conformational signals based on loop lengths (7 to 15 nucleotides) at two-nucleotide resolution.

Four representative branched alkanes were selected to validate the MOF’s high selectivity. Results showed its capacity to generate a constant carbon-atom-count–dependent permeation gradient, realizing a four-step sequential separation that increased C 6 H 14 purity from 25 to 92.2%.

Activation of complement occurs through three main pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative; which converge at the central component, component of complement 3 (C3).

The molecular mechanisms governing C3 recognition by these convertase complexes remain incompletely understood. Here, we present the 3.1-angstrom cryo–electron microscopy structure of the C4b2a-C3 Michaelis complex, alongside 2.9- and 3.1-angstrom structures of the C4b2 zymogen in loading and activation states, elucidating the structural basis for C3 engagement by C4b2a and conformational changes during the classical and lectin pathway convertase maturation.

Here, we demonstrate that scanning tunneling microscopy–induced luminescence enables real-space reconstruction of amplitude and phase of delocalized excitonic states in molecular chains. Through subnanometer-resolved photon imaging of linear molecular chains, coherent purely excitonic (0–0) emission patterns reveal the wave function’s relative phases, while incoherent vibronic (0–1) emission maps the squared wave function amplitudes. This near-field technique enables the reconstruction of wave functions for both bright superradiant states and optically dark subradiant states inaccessible by conventional far-field optics. Furthermore, the submolecular resolution of the vibronic maps allows for the contributions of different vibrational symmetries, namely, Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller modes, to be distinguished. Our findings establish a unique approach for the excitonic wave function reconstruction and open a route for exploring exciton dynamics and interactions in molecular systems.",

Analyzing a global dataset of marine surface sediments, we find that GDGT distributions exhibit systematic shifts with water depth. Using random forest machine learning models trained on combined isoGDGT and OH-GDGT profiles, we achieve high predictive performance ( R 2  = 0.85, RMSE = 646 m). Applying this approach to a 6-million-year sedimentary record from the northwest Australian Shelf reproduces key features captured by foraminifera-based reconstructions and reveals tectonically driven bathymetric evolution, including potential influences on the development of the Leeuwin Current. These results demonstrate the GDGT-based machine learning models offer a robust and effective framework for reconstructing paleo-ocean depths and probing the links between oceanography and tectonics.",

Although the basal forebrain (BF) is known to modulate cortical activity and support attention, it remains unclear whether BF activity directly conveys an attention signal. Here, we show that selective attention to auditory and visual stimuli converges onto a shared population of noncholinergic BF neurons. Using a cross-modal task where rats rapidly switched attention between modalities, we found that these neurons responded strongly to attended targets but weakly to the same stimuli when ignored, regardless of modality. These effects closely tracked both task-driven and spontaneous attention shifts on a single-trial basis. Moreover, BF responses reflected the linear summation of attended and ignored inputs, suggesting that sensory streams are filtered in parallel before converging in the BF. These findings suggest that the BF may serve as a subcortical hub integrating attention signals across modalities to guide adaptive behavior.",

Here, we identify an exonuclease REXO4, which collaborates with RNaseH1 endonuclease to degrade R-loops in an “endo/exo-cleavage coupling” manner. Specifically, REXO4 directly degrades the RNA strand in R-loops from the end or internal nick through its 3′-5′ exonuclease activity and stimulates RNaseH1 endonuclease activity. The genome-wide R-loop regions regulated by REXO4 highly overlap with those regulated by RNaseH1, and REXO4 overexpression counteracts genome-wide R-loop accumulation caused by RNaseH1 deficiency. Furthermore, REXO4-deficient tumors display elevated R-loop mutation burden, and tumor patient-derived mutations in REXO4 enzymatic region all impair R-loop cleavage activity. Besides, we identify a compound 17 (named REXO4-IN-17) capable of inhibiting REXO4 nuclease activity. Interfering with REXO4 increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to alkylating and G4 stabilizing chemotherapeutic drugs and activates cGAS-mediated antitumor immunity. Therefore, our study proposes an endo/exo-cleavage coupling the R-loop processing model, which provides additional insights into the link between R-loop–associated genome instability, antitumor immunity, and tumors.",

We identified an interferon response program enriched in BAP1 -mutant tumors, and, in bulk ATAC-seq cohorts with linked clinical data, this program was associated with poor prognosis.

We now show that cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA 2 α), which is essential for the synthesis of LTB 4 , functions as a nuclear curvosensor. cPLA 2 α responds to nuclear squeezing by localizing to ceramide-rich inner nuclear membrane microdomains and incorporating onto the exofacial surface of nuclear envelope–derived exosomes. This unique topology enables localized LTB 4 synthesis, which synchronizes calcium spikes, promotes myosin light chain II phosphorylation, and sustains polarity and directional persistence after constriction. In neutrophils passing through tight spaces, cPLA 2 α activity drives the chemotactic response to nuclear squeezing by promoting exosomal LTB 4 production and persistence after constriction. These findings uncover a cPLA 2 α-dependent mechanochemical axis linking nuclear architecture to chemotactic efficiency and offer alternative strategies to modulate inflammatory responses.",

Given the large-scale coupled variability of western boundary currents and extensions (WBCEs), further investigation into its seasonality, predictability, and potential future changes is needed. Observations and high-resolution climate simulations reveal distinctive covariance between North Pacific and North Atlantic WBCE sea surface temperatures during boreal summer, possibly linked to preceding Arctic sea-ice variability. Model simulations suggest that cold-season Greenland and Barents Sea ice loss enhances anomalous planetary-scale atmospheric waves and meridional jet shifts, contributing to summertime WBCE temperature anomalies. Although we show that summer WBCE covariability arises from intrinsic variability, future climate projections and targeted model experiments imply that this internal coupled variability may be modulated by radiatively forced changes.

Chemosensation plays an essential role in larval settlement preferences. However, the mechanisms for sensing chemical cues underlying these preferences remain unknown. Using urochordate ascidian larvae, the prominent marine fouling organisms affecting coastal ecosystems, we explored the mechanism of larval chemosensation and its role in settlement preference. Here, we identified taurine, a specific sulfur-containing amino acid secreted from marine adult animals, as a chemical attractant for ascidian larvae to locate salubrious environments for metamorphosis. Taurine stimulates primary sensory neurons within larval papillae, and this neuronal excitation is integrated in the simple brain (also known as sensory vesicle) to elicit chemoattraction and attachment of swimming larvae. We discuss the implications of this study in the emerging field of marine Eco-Evo-Devo research by establishing a model system for understanding developmental mechanisms in the context of marine ecosystems and aquaculture. Of interest is the potential development of antifouling strategies by targeting taurine chemosensation.",

Specifically, chromosome 8 (chr8) gain, a prevalent form of aneuploidy in human cancers, promotes the expansion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in teratomas and MSC proliferation in vitro. We further show that human embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, tumors of mesenchymal origin, lack dominant driver mutations but frequently harbor chr8 gain.

These “tephra seismites,” embedded in unconsolidated, organic-bearing lake sediment, increase in occurrence and dimensions toward known faults and indicate the occurrence of a local hidden fault segment. Through incorporating peak ground acceleration modeling, we found that the spatial distribution of tephra seismites directly relates to the ground shaking induced by near-field fault ruptures. We used the variability in tephra seismites within the stratigraphic record and tephrochronology to better constrain the recurrence intervals and magnitudes of paleoearthquakes from both the Hamilton Basin and adjacent Hauraki Basin fault systems.

The mechanisms behind RGC vulnerability to mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. We developed a patient-specific Opa1 V291D/+ knock-in mouse model to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and retinal metabolism in ADOA. We observed that Opa1 V291D/+ mice exhibited anatomical and functional RGC abnormalities recapitulating the ADOA phenotypes. Reduced optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) protein levels were noted in Opa1 V291D/+ mice, accompanied by decreased protein stability. Moreover, mitochondrial function was compromised, as indicated by reduced Complex I activity, increased oxidative stress, and diminished adenosine triphosphate production in the retinas of Opa1 V291D/+ mice. Spatial metabolomics revealed energy deficits in the inner retina and heightened glycolysis in the outer retina. Immunostaining showed decreased expression of glycolytic proteins in the ganglion cell layer. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing disclosed significant down-regulation of energy-production genes in RGCs, while other retinal cell types remained unaffected. These findings emphasize the specific vulnerability of RGCs to bioenergetic crises, connecting disrupted energy homeostasis to their degeneration. By increasing the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )/reduced form of NAD + (NADH) redox ratio through the overexpression of mitochondrial-targeted Lactobacillus brevis NADH oxidase ( MitoLbNOX ) in RGCs, we demonstrated improved RGC function and survival through enhanced energy metabolism and reduced oxidative stress. These findings confirm that disrupted energy metabolism leads to RGC degeneration and emphasize the enhancement of the NAD + /NADH redox ratio as a promising treatment strategy to protect RGCs from degeneration in ADOA.",
