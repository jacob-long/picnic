          "title": "Mortality impacts of rainfall and sea-level rise in a developing megacity",
          "authors": "Tom Bearpark, Ashwin Rode, Archana Patankar",
          "abstract": "Rainfall and flooding frequently disrupt the lives of urban residents worldwide, posing substantial public health risks1,2. Rapid urbanization is exposing larger and more vulnerable populations to flooding3, while climate change intensifies rainfall patterns4,5 and rising sea levels impair drainage systems6,7,8,9,10,11. Despite the growing recognition and urgency of these hazards, the health impacts of rainfall remain poorly understood, and those of sea-level rise are entirely unquantified. Here we estimate the mortality consequences of rainfall in one of the world’s largest cities—Mumbai, India. We integrate high-resolution data on rainfall, tides and mortality to analyse how unmanaged rainfall, and its interaction with tidal dynamics, contribute to urban health risks. We find that rainfall causes more than 8% of Mumbai’s deaths during the monsoon season, and that more than 80% of this burden is borne by slum residents. Children face the biggest increase in mortality risk from rainfall, and women face a greater risk than men. We also demonstrate that mortality risk from rainfall increases sharply during high tides and use this relationship to evaluate how rising sea levels could amplify rainfall-induced mortality in the absence of adaptation. Our findings reveal that the mortality impacts of rainfall are an order of magnitude larger than is documented by official statistics12,13, highlighting the urgent need for investment in improved drainage, sanitation and waste-management infrastructure.",

          "abstract": "The number of spatial omics technologies being developed is increasing1. However, a missing tool is one that can locate proteins in tissues in an untargeted manner at high spatial resolution and coverage. Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications.",

          "abstract": "Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) sits at the nexus of nutrient metabolism and shuttles between the canonical and non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle1,2, which is dynamically regulated by nutritional status, such as fasting3. Here we find that mitophagy is triggered after a reduction in cytosolic AcCoA levels through short-term fasting and through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase (encoded by ACLY), mitochondrial citrate/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A1) or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (encoded by ACSS2), and the mitophagy can be counteracted by acetate supplementation. Notably, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member X1 (NLRX1) mediates this effect. Disrupting NLRX1 abolishes cytosolic AcCoA reduction-induced mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the mitochondria outer-membrane-localized NLRX1 directly binds to cytosolic AcCoA within a conserved pocket on its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, AcCoA binds to the LRR domain and enhances its interaction with the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which helps to maintain NLRX1 in an autoinhibited state and prevents the association between NLRX1 and light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, we find that the AcCoA–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance. Thus, cytosolic AcCoA is a signalling metabolite that connects metabolism to mitophagy through its receptor NLRX1.",

          "authors": "Emily C. Geyman, David A. Paige, Michael P. Lamb",
          "abstract": "It has long been proposed1, and then observed2,3, that faster rates of soil production occur beneath thinner soils. It remains uncertain, however, whether soil thickness is the driving variable regulating production from the top-down2,3,4,5,6, or whether soil thickness is simply responding to changes in bedrock weathering controlled from the bottom-up7,8. Answering this question is difficult because the feedbacks between soil production and soil erosion, the processes that jointly govern soil thickness2,9,10, respond to perturbations on timescales of thousands to millions of years11,12, timescales that are too long for scientists to observe directly. Here we leverage a space-for-time substitution at a transient mountain range along the San Andreas Fault13,14,15, where the remarkable tectonic setting allows for independent quantification of uplift, soil production and erosion. We show that, following a pulse of tectonic uplift, the conversion of rock to soil accelerates before the overlying soils thin, but at the same time that topographic stresses increase7 and the rock weakens16. This observation challenges the long-standing assumption that soil production rates are controlled predominantly by soil thickness1,2, and instead lends evidence for a bottom-up, rock strength control on soil production.",

          "abstract": "Two-dimensional moiré materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. Correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered by precise choice of stacking geometry1,2,3. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry4,5. An open question is how the atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. On above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of 0.6°, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons and correlation-driven behaviours.",

          "abstract": "Axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) do not regenerate following injury, in contrast to neurons in the peripheral nervous system and neuronal growth during embryonic development. The molecular mechanisms that prevent regeneration of neurons in the CNS remain largely unknown1,2. Here, to address the intracellular response to injury, we developed an in situ cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy platform to mimic axonal damage and present the structural mechanism underlying thalamic axon regeneration induced by the drug epothilone B. We observed that stabilized microtubules extend beyond the injury site, generating membrane tension and driving membrane expansion. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the in situ structure of microtubules at 3.19 Å resolution, which engage epothilone B within the microtubule lattice at the regenerating front. During repair, tubulin clusters are delivered and incorporated into polymerizing microtubules at the regenerating site. These microtubule shoots serve as scaffolds for various types of vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the supply of materials necessary for axon repair until membrane tension normalizes. We demonstrate the unexpected ability of neuronal cells to adjust to strain induced by epothilone B, which creates homeostatic imbalances and activates axons to regeneration mode.",

          "abstract": "Rare coding variants shape inter-individual differences in human phenotypes1. However, the contribution of rare non-coding variants to those differences remains poorly characterized. Here we analyse whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank2,3 to quantify the relative contribution of 40 million single-nucleotide and short indel variants (with a minor allele frequency (MAF) larger than 0.01%) to the heritability of 34 complex traits and diseases. On average across phenotypes, we find that WGS captures approximately 88% of the pedigree-based narrow sense heritability: that is, 20% from rare variants (MAF < 1%) and 68% from common variants (MAF ≥ 1%). We show that coding and non-coding genetic variants account for 21% and 79% of the rare-variant WGS-based heritability, respectively. We identified 15 traits with no significant difference between WGS-based and pedigree-based heritability estimates, suggesting their heritability is fully accounted for by WGS data. Finally, we performed genome-wide association analyses of all 34 phenotypes and, overall, identified 11,243 common-variant associations and 886 rare-variant associations. Altogether, our study provides high-precision estimates of rare-variant heritability, explains the heritability of many phenotypes and demonstrates for lipid traits that more than 25% of rare-variant heritability can be mapped to specific loci using fewer than 500,000 fully sequenced genomes.",

          "abstract": "Marburg virus (MARV) is a filovirus that causes a severe and often lethal hemorrhagic fever1,2. Despite the increasing frequency of MARV outbreaks, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use in humans. Here, we designed mutations that improve the expression, thermostability, and immunogenicity of the prefusion MARV glycoprotein (GP) ectodomain trimer, which is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in development3–8. We discovered a fully human, pan-marburgvirus monoclonal antibody, MARV16, that broadly neutralizes all MARV isolates as well as Ravn virus and Dehong virus with 40 to 100-fold increased potency relative to previously described antibodies9. Moreover, MARV16 provides therapeutic protection in guinea pigs challenged with MARV. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of MARV16-bound MARV GP showing that MARV16 recognizes a prefusion-specific epitope spanning GP1 and GP2, blocking receptor binding and preventing conformational changes required for viral entry. We further reveal the architecture of the MARV GP glycan cap, which shields the receptor binding site (RBS), underscoring architectural similarities with distantly related filovirus GPs. MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies9–11 can bind MARV GP simultaneously. These antibody cocktails require multiple mutations to escape neutralization by both antibodies, paving the way for MARV therapeutics resilient to viral evolution. MARV GP stabilization along with the discovery of MARV16 advance prevention and treatment options for MARV.",

          "abstract": "Chirality is central to life, and controlling the formation of one of a pair of mirror-image molecules (enantiomers) is a central tenet of synthetic chemistry. Although controlling stereogenic carbon1,2,3, silicon4,5, phosphorus6,7 and sulfur8,9 centres is commonplace, nitrogen centres in amines are not typically stable. Limited achievements in the enantioselective construction of nitrogen chirality have primarily been established in quaternary ammonium salts10,11,12 and bridged bicyclic amines13,14,15,16,17, which have a restricted pyramidal configuration. The asymmetric synthesis of non-bridged pyramidal nitrogen-chirogenic compounds suffers from a super-stoichiometric chiral source and exhibits poor stereoselectivity18,19,20,21,22,23,24. Here we present a catalytic enantioselective strategy for construction of acyclic nitrogen stereocentres via a chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed chlorination reaction. We designed a stereospecific intramolecular reaction to overcome the structural and configurational instabilities of nitrogen-chlorinated hydroxylamines. The resulting 2-alkoxy-1,2-oxazolidines showed good enantiopurities, and density functional theory calculations confirmed successful enantiocontrol of nitrogen chirality during the chlorination process. Furthermore, this strategy has been applied successfully to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre. Control experiments provide evidence for an SN2 pathway for the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution event.",

          "abstract": "Despite the adoption of the Paris Agreement ten years ago, fossil CO2 emissions continue to rise, pushing atmospheric CO2 levels to 423 ppm in 2024 and driving human-induced warming to 1.36°C, within years of breaching the 1.5°C limit 1,2. Accurate reporting of anthropogenic and natural CO2 sources and sinks is a prerequisite to tracking the effectiveness of climate policy and detecting carbon sink responses to climate change. Yet notable mismatches between reported emissions and sinks have so far prevented confident interpretation of their trends and drivers 1. Here, we present and integrate recent advances in observations and process understanding to address some long-standing issues in the global carbon budget estimates. We show that the magnitude of the natural land sink is substantially smaller than previously estimated, while net emissions from anthropogenic land-use change are revised upwards 1. The ocean sink is 15% larger than the land sink, consistent with new evidence from oceanic and atmospheric observations 3,4. Climate change reduces the efficiency of the sinks, particularly on land, contributing 8.3 ± 1.4 ppm to the atmospheric CO2 increase since 1960. The combined effects of climate change and deforestation turn Southeast Asian and large parts of South American tropical forests from CO2 sinks to sources. This underscores the need to halt deforestation and limit warming to prevent further loss of carbon stored on land. Improved confidence in assessments of CO2 sources and sinks is fundamental for effective climate policy.",

We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas 19,20 that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the interatomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, at which the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck’s constant and the particle mass, or, equivalently, by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium 21–34 , are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems.",

Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny.",

          "abstract": "Rare diseases are collectively common, affecting approximately 1 in 20 individuals worldwide. In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.",

          "abstract": "Organ shortage remains a major challenge in transplantation, and gene-edited pig organs offer a promising solution1–3. Despite gene-editing, the immune reactions following xenotransplantation can still cause transplant failure4. To understand the immunological response of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation, we conducted large-scale multi-omics profiling of the xenograft and the host’s blood over a 61-day procedure in a brain-dead human (decedent) recipient. Blood plasmablasts, natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells increased between postoperative day (POD)10 and 28, concordant with expansion of IgG/IgA B-cell clonotypes, and subsequent biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection (AbMR) at POD33. Human T-cell frequencies increased from POD21 and peaked between POD33-49 in the blood and xenograft, coinciding with T-cell receptor diversification, expansion of a restricted TRBV2/J1 clonotype and histological evidence of a combined AbMR and cell-mediated rejection at POD49. At POD33, the most abundant human immune population in the graft was CXCL9+ macrophages, aligning with IFN-γ-driven inflammation and a Type I immune response. In addition, we see evidence of interactions between activated pig-resident macrophages and infiltrating human immune cells. Xenograft tissue showed pro-fibrotic tubular and interstitial injury, marked by S100A65, SPP16 (Osteopontin), and COLEC117, at POD21–POD33. Proteomics profiling revealed human and pig complement activation, with decreased human component after AbMR therapy with complement inhibition. Collectively, these data delineate the molecular orchestration of human immune responses to a porcine kidney, revealing potential immunomodulatory targets for improving xenograft survival.",

          "abstract": "Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity 1–3 . Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Echocardiography is the most widely used cardiac imaging modality, capturing ultrasound video data to assess cardiac structure and function1. Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015 (refs. 1,2 ), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention.",

          "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behaviour and neural representations in vision tasks 1,2 . However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do 3,4 , raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref. 5 ), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems.",

Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems.",

It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults 2 , and is associated with several severe outcomes 3–11 . Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified 12,13 , but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes ( MAP1A , ANO8 and ANK2 ; P &lt; 3.07 × 10 −6 ; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD ( n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes.",

          "abstract": "Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies 1 . NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis 2,3 , but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases.",

CMEs play an important role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star3,4,5. However, this conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive event6,7,8,9. A signature of a fast CME is a type II radio burst10,11, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time and polarization properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar type II burst. We demonstrate that the rate of these events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs is \\(0.8{4}_{-0.69}^{+1.94}\\times 1{0}^{-3}\\) per day per star. Our detection implies that we are no longer restricted to extrapolating the solar CME kinematics and rates to other stars, allowing us to establish observational limits on the impact of CMEs on exoplanets.",

Recent AI systems, often reliant on human data, typically lack the formal verification necessary to guarantee correctness. By contrast, formal languages such as Lean1 offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired2 agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation. AlphaProof substantially improves state-of-the-art results on historical mathematics competition problems. At the 2024 IMO competition, our AI system, with AlphaProof as its core reasoning engine, solved three out of the five non-geometry problems, including the competition’s most difficult problem. Combined with AlphaGeometry 23, this performance, achieved with multi-day computation, resulted in reaching a score equivalent to that of a silver medallist, marking the first time an AI system achieved any medal-level performance. Our work demonstrates that learning at scale from grounded experience produces agents with complex mathematical reasoning strategies, paving the way for a reliable AI tool in complex mathematical problem-solving.",

          "abstract": "Xenotransplantation of genetically-modified pig kidneys offers a solution to the scarcity of organs for end-stage renal disease patients.1 We performed a 61-day alpha-Gal knock-out pig kidney and thymic autograft transplant into a nephrectomized brain-dead human using clinically approved immunosuppression, without CD40 blockade or additional genetic modification. Hemodynamic and electrolyte stability and dialysis independence were achieved. Post-operative day (POD) 10 biopsies revealed glomerular IgM and IgA deposition, activation of early complement components and mesangiolysis with stable renal function without proteinuria, a phenotype not seen in allotransplantation. On POD 33, an abrupt increase in serum creatinine was associated with antibody-mediated rejection and increased donor-specific IgG. Plasma exchange, C3/C3b inhibition and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG), completely reversed xenograft rejection. Pre-existing donor-reactive T cell clones expanded progressively in the circulation post-transplant, acquired an effector transcriptional profile and were detected in the POD 33 rejecting xenograft prior to rATG treatment. This study provides the first long-term physiologic, immunologic, and infectious disease monitoring of a pig-to-human kidney xenotransplant and indicates that pre-existing xenoreactive T cells and induced antibodies to unknown epitope(s) present a major challenge, despite significant immunosuppression. It also demonstrates that a minimally gene-edited pig kidney can support long-term life-sustaining physiologic functions in a human.",

By contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene stack densely and can exhibit molecular impermeability4,5,6. Solution-synthesized 2D polymers that exhibit the latter by poly-condensation have been a longstanding goal. Herein, we demonstrate self-supporting, spin-coated 2D polyaramid nanofilms that exhibit nitrogen permeability below 3.1 × 10−9 Barrer, nearly four orders of magnitude lower than every class of existing polymer, and similar for other gases tested (helium, argon, oxygen, methane and sulfur hexafluoride). Optical interference during the pressurization of nanofilm-coated microwells allows measurement of mechanosensitive rim opening and sealing, creating gas-filled bulges that are stable exceeding three years. This discovery enables 2D polymer resonators with high resonance frequencies (about 8 MHz) and quality factors up to 537, similar to graphene. A 60-nm coating of air-sensitive perovskites reduces the lattice degradation rate 14-fold with an oxygen permeability of 3.3 × 10−8 Barrer.

          "abstract": "Tandem light-emitting diodes (LEDs), achieved by vertically stacking multiple units in series to combine the luminance of individual light-emitting elements, are effective for improving efficiency and lifespan compared to single-unit devices1–3. In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2. These findings represent a significant advancement in achieving high-performance and multicolor LEDs through the stacking of perovskite LEDs.",

          "abstract": "Marine picocyanobacteria are abundant photosynthetic organisms of global importance. They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages—viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit1,2,3,4,5. One such gene is nblA, which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6,7,8. Under nutrient deprivation cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9,10,11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light-harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation6,8,13. However, the benefit of the virus-encoded NblA for cyanophages and the broader impact on the host are unclear. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that viral NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and comprise 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of NblA to the cyanophage, while it exerts a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA has an adverse global impact on light harvesting by oceanic picocyanobacteria.",

          "abstract": "Florigen, encoded by FT genes, is synthesized in leaves and transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to induce flower development 1–3 . At the SAM, 14-3-3 proteins are proposed to act as receptors for FT protein and to mediate the indirect interaction between FT and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD to form the florigen activation complex (FAC) that activates transcription of flowering genes 4–6 . Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development.",

In particular, enantioselective preparation of atropisomers is of great interest owing to their privileged status as chiral ligands and pharmacophores2,3,4. Although chromatographic- or crystallization-based methods are commonly used to separate atropisomers, we urgently need more efficient and economical approaches to access enantioenriched atropisomers5,6. The use of stereoconvergent methods to access molecules with point chirality is well established but we have not tapped the potential of stereoconvergent catalytic methods to arrive at enantioenriched atropisomers. Here we report deracemization activity of a P450 enzyme and explore its ability to deliver a stereoconvergent route towards enantioenriched atropisomers. Using a curated set of P450 variants, we found that a wide variety of symmetric and non-symmetrically substituted 2,2′-binaphthol (BINOL) building blocks can be deracemized to high enantiomeric purity. This deracemization activity is mechanistically distinct from the activity of previously reported P450 enzymes, which operate through enantioselective bond formation to afford enantioenriched atropisomers. By contrast, the deracemization process reported here is proposed to proceed through bond rotation. As engineered variants have complementary selectivity profiles and substrate scope, this biocatalytic platform should be readily tunable for any desired substitution pattern. We anticipate that these results will inspire new stereoconvergent approaches to synthesizing conformationally stable atropisomers.",

          "authors": "Sandy Ong, Felicity Nelson",
          "abstract": "Studying age-related diseases gives researchers a better understanding of the risk factors that affect people in later life. By focusing on heart disease, Alzheimer’s and obesity — conditions that have major quality-of-life implications for ageing populations — these three early career researchers are bringing fresh perspectives to a fast-moving field.\n\nTHOMAS KARIKARI: Targeting tau\nThomas Karikari wants to develop more accessible blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease.Credit: Tom Altany/University of Pittsburgh\n\nTwo key hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease are tangles of tau proteins that form inside neurons and amyloid plaques that build up between the neurons. Brain scans and spinal taps are useful for detecting these abnormalities, but Thomas Karikari wants to give patients a less invasive option: a simple blood test.\n\n“We need to find the best ways of understanding and identifying individuals who may be at risk,” says Karikari, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. A blood test, he says, “can provide a snapshot of what’s happening in the brain, even up to 20 years before symptoms manifest”.\n\nEarly in Karikari’s career, the general consensus around blood-based tests was one of incredulity, he says. “Everyone just went: ‘No, no, no, we don’t talk about it because they’re too difficult to do’.” So, as a postdoctoral student at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, he set himself the challenge of designing a blood test that can detect a form of tau called p-tau181, which exists in high levels in the brains of people who have Alzheimer’s and accumulates as the disease progresses.\n\nNature Index 2025 Ageing\n\nAfter screening dozens of antibodies, Karikari and his collaborators had a lightbulb moment: the part of the tau protein that is commonly detected in blood is the left end section — not the middle part that spinal-fluid tests usually target. This insight helped them to design antibodies that could bind to the left portion of the tau protein in a blood sample. The discovery was like “cracking the code”, says Karikari, and the team went on to develop a blood test1 that detects p-tau181 with an accuracy of more than 82%.\n\nSince then, Karikari has developed numerous other blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease, including two that can detect p-tau217, another blood biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease2.\n\nAlzheimer’s blood tests have limitations, which has curbed their widespread use. For one thing, labs use different methods to measure the same protein, which means the results aren’t always consistent. And the fact that tau doesn’t just appear in the brain, but is also common in the liver, kidney, heart and other organs of a healthy person means “we might run into some false positivity” when it’s detected in the blood, says Karikari. One of the blood tests that his team has developed specifically targets brain-derived tau3.\n\nA key driver of Karikari’s work is making tests accessible enough to be used in places such as his home village of Manfo in Ghana. Blood tests are often difficult to use in remote and low-resource settings because the samples need refrigeration, and the analysis equipment requires trained staff to operate.\n\nKarikari’s lab has developed a pared-back method for detecting amyloid plaques that requires smaller blood samples than other tests4. His lab has also developed “remote-friendly tools”, such as a collection tube that can store blood at room temperature for up to 96 hours5. “I will feel most accomplished when all that we are doing gets to reach my village,” says Karikari. — Sandy Ong\n\nLAURA GRAY: Fighting fat\nLaura Gray believes body mass index is often not the best way to determine obesity.Credit: FilmFolk/Vivensa Foundation\n\nLaura Gray wants researchers and clinicians to stop using body mass index (BMI) exclusively to measure obesity rates, especially in older people. Beyond 60 years old, the average BMI — calculated as weight divided by height squared — across the population decreases, she says, which doesn’t accurately reflect what’s really going on with obesity rates.\n\n“It looks like they’re losing weight, but actually, it’s because they’ve often lost muscle instead of fat,” says Gray, an econometrician at the University of Sheffield, UK, who incorporates economics and statistics to map how trends in ageing and obesity interact across populations.\n\nBMI does not distinguish between muscle mass, fat mass and other factors such as bone density and water retention, which can lead to confusing results. For example, at their peak, American footballer Tom Brady would have been classified as overweight, and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as nearly overweight, due to their high muscle mass skewing their BMI.\n\nBMI is also an unreliable measure to use with children, says Gray, because of the way it fluctuates during growth spurts.\n\nWhen Gray and her colleagues tracked the BMIs and health conditions of people over 50 in England between 1998 and 2015, they found that declining BMIs were linked to higher rates of diabetes, asthma, arthritis and heart problems6. “We associate a decrease in BMI with positive health outcomes, but in older people, it might be the opposite,” she says.\n\nAs one of the most widely used metrics in public health, BMI would be difficult to replace entirely, says Gray. “It’s so ingrained in everything.” Instead, she recommends looking at BMI trends over time — rather than at single snapshots — to assess a person’s health risks.\n\nGray likes to use other metrics alongside the BMI, such as waist-to-height ratio, which directly reflects harmful belly fat at any age. When she and UK-based econometrician, Magdalena Breton, used both BMI and waist-to-height ratio to analyse the health data of more than 120,000 people in England, they found that waist-to-height ratio was better at showing how obesity risk increases with age, especially in older adults. The study7 is under peer review.\n\nOne trend that Gray is watching closely is the use of popular weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic. She suspects they will start to make a dent in obesity rates at a global population level, but worries that inequities will grow between people who can and can’t afford them. “There are just so many [obesity drugs] coming out, and they are so effective,” she says. “It’s come from a situation where there was just no treatment. It’s a massive switch.”\n\nObesity is a fascinating condition because of how tied it is to social changes over time, says Gray. “It’s really interesting how it affects so many people now, and 50 or 60 years ago, it wasn’t so much of a problem.” — Felicity Nelson",

          "authors": "Carsten Lund Pedersen",
          "abstract": "How’s this for an academic dream team? Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Richard Feynman. The three physicists and I often get together over coffee to chat about career decisions, difficulties and dilemmas. Of course, not the real Einstein, Bohr and Feynman — the last of the trio to die was Feynman, in 1988 — but rather, simulations of the three that I have assembled, using artificial intelligence (AI), to serve as my personal advisory board.\n\nAI is seemingly everywhere these days. It’s in productivity apps, web browsers and technical support lines. AI users increasingly report developing friendships, and even romantic relationships, with AI companions. I used the technology to develop an advisory board that can provide customized input into my career decisions and reflections. The resulting advice has been surprisingly useful — not to mention entertaining.\n\nMy board has provided advice on how to progress to my next career stage, how to contextualize my past and future work and how I might structure my next semester for maximum impact on my career. It also provided guidance when I received a job offer at a different university, helping me to see that accepting it might not be the best decision.\n\nAlthough some people in corporate settings have proposed using AI to build a personal board of directors, I think the term ‘advisory board’ is more fitting, because the AI panellists are only advisers — they should not make decisions for you, and they cannot own the consequences of their decisions.\n\nThe make-up of my advisory board often changes, and has included an eclectic mix. Besides Bohr, Feynman and Einstein, I’ve also tapped microbiologist Alexander Fleming, poet Piet Hein and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. Sometimes I include experts from my specific disciplines of AI and marketing; other times, I ‘invite’ artist Pablo Picasso or architect Bjarke Ingels for a completely different perspective. But whatever the board’s composition, I typically retain a core group of three seminal scientists.\n\nThe make-up of the board influences not just what I might be told, but also the mood in the room. Picasso might push for an intuitive representation or metaphor, whereas Bohr tends to insist on complementarity and paradoxes. Different ‘personalities’ might dominate depending on the question — but, unlike with human discussions, you can often prompt your way out of any issues. You can, for example, prompt the AI to synthesize the board’s answers into a single coherent piece of advice, or to fuel ‘constructive conflict’ between members. As a result, I sometimes find myself acting more as a moderator than a passive recipient of information.\n\nBuild-a-board workshop\n\nSo, how do you build your own AI-generated board?\n\nFirst, choose your favourite chatbot, such as ChatGPT (provided by OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic) or LeChat (Mistral AI). Choosing one that has some memory of your previous conversations can be helpful. My profile remembers that I’m an associate professor, as well as the specific challenges I face and my interests. As a result, I don’t have to start every conversation from scratch.\n\nNext, prompt the AI to act like an academic advisory board. Here’s a prompt I might use to initiate an AI brainstorming session:\n\n“Assemble an imaginary advisory board consisting of [INSERT PEOPLE HERE]. Have them discuss my current academic situation and give me contrasting, thought-provoking advice. End with a short synthesis that integrates their perspectives into one actionable insight.”\n\nOf course, this is only a starting point. The real value lies in continuing the conversation.\n\nCarsten Lund Pedersen.Credit: Carsten Lund Pedersen\n\nYou could also try presenting the board with a dilemma you’re facing and asking for input.\n\nFinally, experiment and tinker with the make-up of your board. Try including different personalities, such as talk-show host Oprah Winfrey or author Stephen King. The sheer diversity can often reveal surprising perspectives on the challenges you face. For instance, in response to the generic prompt above, ‘Nelson Mandela’ reminded me that institutions often follow people of integrity, so I should focus on lifting other people up and ask whose lives will be improved if I succeed in my academic career.\n\nDanger on board\n\nThere are, of course, pitfalls to consider when creating your own advisory board.\n\nFirst, never outsource your decision-making. Use the technology to ‘open up the problem’ to perspectives that differ from your own, and, through this, to aid your own decision-making on a career-related matter. Because an AI can never take responsibility for its decisions (and might not have all the relevant information), you must always make the final decision yourself.",

Slathered in butter and dripping with syrup, hotcakes are a hug for the human soul, a comfort so simple that it makes everything else simple, too.\n\nKelley found this adage proved true on more than one occasion during his tenure living aboard inter-planetary transport. He had been among the first to live full-time on the vast civilian ships, the first to create an on-board breakfast diner, the first to turn a sterile, lifeless barge into a thriving community that folks could call home. And all them firsts came over the top of a fluffy stack of hotcakes.\n\nSo, when the emergency alarms blared just as Kelley was opening up the diner for the day, he hesitated only a moment before firing up the griddle.\n\nThe all-ship loudspeaker crackled to life as Kelley tossed an apron over his shoulders and began rummaging in the cupboards.\n\nMain drive disabled. Concerning, but that’s what the back-up drives were for, Kelley reasoned. But maybe he should … Kelley dispelled that thought before it could form, shaking his head and grabbing the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Best not to do nothing before breakfast anyhow.\n\nCaught in a gravity well. Whelp, that explained the slight, swaying pull beneath his feet. Unfortunate, Kelley thought, whisking the batter hard, destroying any hidden lumps in record time. He slapped a pad of butter on the griddle, testing its heat. It bubbled and melted and was gone. Perfect.\n\nLimited escape pods … report to … immediately ... Kelley could no longer hear the announcer over the sudden thumps and thuds and metallics clangs, but he thought he could make a good guess what it said, what with the people now streaming into the halls, shouting and swearing. He thought some of them came into the diner, yelled something at him, and he called a general greeting over his shoulder, voice cracking almost as much as the loudspeaker.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\n“Food’ll be up in a jiffy!”\n\nThe all-ship message was playing on repeat now, and Kelley thought he should listen to it, he really should, but instead found himself leaning closer to the griddle. Hotcakes required a person’s full attention, no distractions allowed, big or small. Inattention, even for a second, led to burnt batter and disappointed customers. So, Kelley kept his eyes down and his ears tuned to the slight sizzle of the cakes. He’d just have to listen to the message later, that’s all.\n\nThe hotcakes were ready to flip just as the main power went out, everything flickering from bright fluorescent to dim, auxiliary blue in the space of a second. It was dark, but Kelley could still tell each cake was a perfect golden brown. Only a couple more minutes, Kelley thought. Then everything would be finished.\n\nHe turned to grab a plate and found a woman stumbling into the diner, staring listlessly at nothing. She seemed dazed, and when she sat down in the nearest booth, it was more as if her body had given up on standing than a deliberate act.\n\nCoffee, and lots of it, Kelley thought, turning on the machine.\n\n“They’re all gone,” the woman whispered.\n\n“Hm?” Kelley asked, pouring out a large cup.\n\n“The pods, they’re … gone.” She looked up at Kelley, eyes shining. “I — missed the last pod. And they all … they’re all …”\n\nShe inhaled sharply, breath hitching as she let it back out.\n\nKelley hastily scooped the hotcakes from the griddle, depositing them all onto a plate. Grabbing the coffee, he breezed around the counter to the booth, setting down plate and cup with an attention-grabbing thump.\n\n“Now, now. No point tryin’ to solve problems before breakfast. Eat up.”\n\nSuddenly, the ship lurched violently, spilling the coffee and almost sending the hotcakes flying. The lights went out completely, gravity dropping and coming back several times. Shrieks from beyond the halls could be heard. The all-ship loudspeaker bluntly told the populace to take shelter where they were.\n\n“We’re going to die!” the woman moaned. “I don’t want to die! I don’t — Mom! Mom!”\n\n“Hush now,” Kelley said gently. He took her shaking hand, placed a fork in it, and guided it down, helping her cut the stack of hotcakes.\n\n“I’m scared!” the woman cried.",

          "authors": "Rachel Nuwer",
          "abstract": "Credit: Simon Prades\n\nThe study of ageing has shifted from a niche pursuit to a major area of research. Over the past two decades, scientists have flooded the field, determined to unlock the secret to a longer, healthier life. “Various people have started to think we could intervene in the ageing process and extend lifespan. [The field] has really exploded because of that view,” says Alan Cohen, a biologist at Columbia University in New York City.\n\nBut even as interest grows, scientists have yet to reach consensus on fundamental concepts in biological ageing, Cohen says. There is no widespread agreement on what ageing is or when it begins, or what the goal should be in investigating it. “There are people like me who think we can’t intervene — and even if we could, we shouldn’t — to people at the far end of the extreme who say we should make humans immortal and every moment we delay is equivalent to murder,” Cohen says. “Serious scientists are at every point along that spectrum.”\n\nNature Index 2025 Ageing\n\nA key contention is whether ageing should be considered a disease. As Richard Faragher, a biogerontologist at the University of Brighton, UK, puts it, if a disease is defined as something abnormal, then ageing does not count. But if a disease is defined as something that is preventable, treatable and able to be slowed down, then ageing is a disease.\n\nScientists, doctors and philosophers have pondered this question for centuries, but as more countries confront the realities of an ageing population, the debate has taken on new urgency, and it has the potential to influence everything from the direction of research to how older people are treated in society. “This is the early phase of an incredibly rapidly growing field,” says John Beard, an epidemiologist at Columbia University. “I think people are open to thinking about it in new ways, if a new way makes sense.”\n\nIs ageing a disease?\n\nThe concept of what is and isn’t a disease has changed over time. For example, before the 1960s, developing high blood pressure in older age was not considered a problem, says Faragher. “Now, we know that your blood pressure going through the roof is not benign.” Crucially, he adds, labelling high blood pressure, or hypertension, as a disease brought both funding and research attention to find treatments for it. “Things only start to get studied when they become problems.”\n\nSome people like to think of ageing as “a kind of optimal, almost benign decline” with certain diseases overlaid, says Faragher. But he and some other researchers argue that this oversimplifies things, that ageing and disease aren’t necessarily separate, and that treating them as such can hold back progress on understanding and managing the process. Ageing “is inseparable from pathology”, says Faragher. He points to senescent cells — damaged cells that behave in harmful ways and accumulate with age — which not only contribute to conditions such as heart disease, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment, but are also linked to hallmarks of ageing such as grey hair and wrinkles. In animal studies1, deleting these cells leads to “dramatic increases” in health and lifespan, Faragher says, which suggests that this aspect of ageing “is both treatable and reversible”.\n\nJames Pacala, an academic geriatrician at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says that for some researchers, the ideal scenario in ageing science is to find “some common cellular and molecular denominator that leads to all of the declines we see with ageing”. Cohen says it’s unlikely, however, that a single cause could explain ageing, because millions of factors probably contribute to the body gradually losing its ability to stay organized and function properly. Faragher agrees that there probably isn’t one single mechanism of ageing, but that there is a small set of key mechanisms — such as a build-up of senescent cells — that act together as a loose network and cause many age-related diseases as well as ageing itself.\n\nIf ageing were to be categorized as a disease, it would probably cause the biggest ripples not in laboratories, but in the regulatory and funding support that those labs receive, says Ming Guo, director of the Aging Center at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. “It would be a paradigm shift,” she says.\n\nThis would be especially true in places such as the United States, where federal science agencies and drug-approval bodies tend to focus on diseases that produce clear, measurable results, such as improvements in symptoms. Declaring ageing a disease “would unleash a lot of research funding, facilitate drug development and ultimately lead to faster approval of the geroprotective therapies”, Guo says.\n\nFaragher agrees that the ‘disease’ label would expedite solutions. “I think the question is more along the lines of ‘Do you want to do something about these problems or not?’” he says. “If ageing is a disease, then you’ve decided it’s worth doing something about it.”\n\nThe case against\n\nSome scientists argue that the way ageing is discussed in research has major ethical implications. ‘Old age’ nearly became an official disease in 2022, when the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) — a global catalogue of known human diseases — sought to give it a diagnostic code in its latest revision2. Some doctors and scientists pushed back, however, which ultimately led the World Health Organization (WHO), the ICD’s publisher, to withdraw the listing. “The WHO retracted it based on the science — and on the unintended ethical, moral and social consequences,” says Kiran Rabheru, a geriatric psychiatrist at the University of Ottawa in Canada.\n\nFor one thing, calling ageing a disease could negatively change people’s view of their agency over the process, says Sundeep Khosla, an endocrinologist who studies ageing at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “From a patient’s perspective, it leads to a mindset of ‘Well, I need a drug to cure the disease’,” he says. “It perhaps shifts focus away from what should remain the major intervention: lifestyle.”\n\nAgeism is another concern. If ageing is classified as a disease, then anyone over 60 or 65 (or whatever cut-off was chosen) would be considered ‘diseased people’, Guo says. Half of the world’s population is already ageist, according to a 2021 WHO report on the issue of ageism3 (see ‘Ageism attitudes’) so categorizing older people as diseased would only add to that stigma, Rabheru says.\n\nSome researchers argue that it doesn’t make sense, biologically, to call ageing a disease. Because although ageing increases the risk of most chronic diseases, “you either have a disease or you don’t — and who doesn’t have ageing?” says Beard.\n\nThe tendency to think of ageing as a disease reflects what Beard describes as an “outdated way of thinking” — one that focuses too narrowly on individual problems and their specific biological causes. For example, the fact that the immune system naturally weakens with age doesn’t just impact the heart, as previously thought, but seems to increase arthritis4 and dementia5 risk, too. “We now understand from geoscience that age-related biological change simultaneously increases the risk of almost all chronic conditions,” says Beard.\n\nFuture outcomes\n\nFor some, the debate over whether ageing should be classified as a disease is growing tiresome. “At major international meetings, after people have a second beer, this topic comes up over and over and over again,” says Richard Miller, a biogerontologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “I walk away from those discussions.”\n\nThere seems to be a strong cultural element to the debate, says Cohen, and points out that it’s mostly being carried out by researchers in North America and Europe. Joe Poh Sheng Yeong, director of immunopathology at Singapore General Hospital, agrees, noting that in Asia, many governments and societies are more focused on dealing with the real-world pressures of ageing populations rather than getting caught up in the semantics.\n\nBeard adds that the push to label ageing as a disease is likely to be strongest in countries where research funding is tied to disease-based categories, and where health-care systems pay doctors and hospitals for each test, procedure or treatment they perform. This creates more incentive to classify ageing as a medical problem, because it opens up more opportunities for billable services.\n\nKey dates in ageing research\n\n1903: The term ‘gerontology’ coined to describe the study of ageing\n\n1961: Cellular senescence discovered\n\n1974: US National Institute of Aging established\n\n1995: Senescent cells detected in human ageing skin\n\n2007: Geroscience introduced as an interdisciplinary science\n\n2013: Metformin found to expand lifespan of mice\n\n2013: Concept of epigenetic ‘clock’ linking DNA methylation to biological age proposed\n\n2016: Human metformin trial launched\n\n2021: The WHO releases global report on ageism\n\n2022: The WHO introduces ‘age-related’ code in International Classification of Diseases after withdrawing ‘old age’\n\n2025: Map of DNA methylation changes shows that some tissues age faster than others",

          "abstract": "Brittany Janis (right) and Cathy Richards.Credit: Benn Craig (Brittany Janis)\n\nIn February, the administration of US President Donald Trump barred scientists who work at federal agencies from attending the latest plenary session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Hangzhou, China. The move ended US participation in what the White House described as “international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values”. It marked a sharp break from decades of US leadership in the IPCC, where US scientists and diplomats have helped steer negotiations, shape reports and fund the process that underpins global climate action.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nAlthough some non-federal US scientists remain involved in the IPCC, funding for their participation is uncertain. At the same time, the US government is drastically cutting budgets and staff across the federal agencies that track and interpret climate data. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), responsible for more than 50% of global ocean monitoring, faces significant cuts of about 25% of its current budget which poses a threat to climate modelling and weather prediction. More than 100 climate-focused National Science Foundation grants have been cancelled. The US Global Change Research Program, a federal initiative that coordinates and integrates climate-change research across multiple agencies, has also lost its funding. Its website, a crucial repository for climate reports, has been shut down.\n\nThese cuts to US climate science leave American cities without the information they need to respond to weather emergencies. And further cuts are expected, including plans to shut down ten NOAA laboratories that study how climate change is altering weather patterns, for example, including a Miami-based team of ‘hurricane hunters’ that operates a specialized fleet of aircraft that fly directly into and around storms to gather lifesaving data that can more accurately warn communities when they need to move out of harm’s way.\n\nThis seismic shift in US science investment will send ripple effects across the globe. The United States owns 42% of the 1,309 Earth observation satellites in operation — far more than any other country. (China, with the second largest fleet, owns 25%.) With fewer US experts to analyse satellite data, coastal cities all over the world face increased risk without the climate intelligence needed for resilience planning.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago’s 2024 National Adaptation Plan, for instance, relies on methodologies and data from IPCC assessments, which themselves heavily integrate observational data and climate modelling generated by US institutions. In the Caribbean, researchers use US data sets to predict the potential impact of climate change on tourism and other major economic sectors.\n\nEfforts are in place to help cities and coastal communities produce their own climate data, but these are moving slowly. In 2017, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated the Programme for Building Regional Climate Capacity in the Caribbean to train local meteorologists and hydrologists and set up computing facilities for climate modelling and simulations. But a 2023 report on the progress in Jamaica found that there were still not enough skilled professionals who could independently produce Earth observation services. Another initiative, SERVIR, a joint NASA–USAID programme, has trained thousands of specialists around the world to access and interpret Earth observation data and integrate them into their national and regional planning, such as for flood forecasting and air-quality monitoring. But with the end of USAID in May, these efforts have now been cancelled.",

          "authors": "Jan Witkowski",
          "abstract": "Credit: J. Conrad Williams, Jr/Newsday via Getty\n\nJames D. Watson was one of the most influential — and controversial — scientists of the twentieth century. He helped to uncover the structure of the DNA double helix, wrote a textbook that transformed science education, and led institutions that shaped modern biology. Although his later years were marred by contentious remarks about race, his scientific legacy remains immense.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Watson grew up during the Great Depression and identified with the ideals of the New Deal Democrats, who thought that government power should be used to create a fairer, healthier society. A gifted student, he entered the University of Chicago at 15 and graduated in zoology four years later. Although keen on birdwatching and ornithology, reading What Is Life? by physicist Erwin Schrödinger convinced him that genes were the key to understanding life. So he pursued a PhD in genetics with Salvador Luria at Indiana University Bloomington, studying viruses that infect bacteria, and became fixated on finding the structure of DNA.\n\nDNA pioneer James Watson has died ― colleagues wrestle with his legacy\n\nAt 23, Watson joined the Medical Research Council’s molecular biology research group at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, UK. He shared an office with Francis Crick and there was an immediate synergy between them. They decided to build molecular models of DNA by combining X-ray crystallographic data with what was known of DNA’s chemistry.\n\nThe crystallographic data came from Rosalind Franklin, Ray Gosling and Maurice Wilkins at King’s College London. Before moving to Birkbeck College in London in 1953, Franklin had given her data — including Photograph 51, the X-ray diffraction image of DNA taken by her PhD student Gosling — to Wilkins, who then showed it to Watson. The image confirmed that the DNA molecule was helical. Working with cardboard cut-outs of the bases, Watson had the crucial insight that the molecule’s building blocks fitted together in specific pairs. This discovery, published in 1953, revealed how genetic information is copied and passed on — one of the most important insights in modern science. Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the work.\n\nWatson’s account of the discovery, The Double Helix (1968), broke all the conventions of the typically staid scientific autobiography. Written in the voice of the brash 25-year-old he was in 1953, and reflecting the attitudes of the time, it provoked accusations that his portrayal of people, especially Rosalind Franklin, was cruel. Despite this, the book became one of the most successful accounts of research, conveying the visceral thrill of scientific discovery.\n\nWhat Rosalind Franklin truly contributed to the discovery of DNA’s structure\n\nFollowing a fellowship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Watson moved in 1956 to the Department of Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There, his laboratory made major discoveries in protein synthesis, including sharing in the discovery of messenger RNA. His textbook Molecular Biology of the Gene (1965), which was based on his Harvard lectures, was revolutionary, changing the style of science texts and attracting generations of students to molecular biology. He considered this and his other writings to be among his greatest achievements.\n\nWatson first visited the Biological Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, in 1948 and returned almost every year. He became a trustee and, in 1968, was asked to become director of what is now the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). In the same year, he married Elizabeth Lewis, a graduate of Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, whose own contributions to the lab cannot be overestimated. In his 26-year tenure, Watson transformed the CSHL into one of the world’s leading institutes, known for its education programmes as much as for its research. Watson’s great success as director came from identifying important problems, recruiting remarkably talented scientists and providing them with an environment in which to flourish.",

          "abstract": "NASA and other science-oriented federal agencies were closed for more than six weeks as lawmakers wrangled.Credit: Anda Chu/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News/Getty\n\nThe historic shutdown of the US government, which shuttered science agencies, halted grant operations and left tens of thousands of federal scientists without pay cheques, ended on 12 November after lasting a record-breaking 43 days. A deal approved by Congress and signed by US President Donald Trump will fund most government agencies until 30 January. Science advocates expressed hope that Congress will use this intervening time to finalize research budgets for the remainder of the 2026 fiscal year — which could help to ward off massive cuts proposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe shutdown began on 1 October owing, in part, to a Congressional dispute over federal spending on health care. Most work at federal agencies ground to a halt, including activities related to the issuing of federal research grants. That work will now restart. Under the terms of the deal, federal scientists will get back pay for earnings that they did not receive during the shutdown, and those who were laid off will be rehired — at least for now.\n\nThe prospective ramp-up of activities after such a long hiatus has been welcomed by science-advocacy groups. Any interruption in science activities slows research and innovation that bolsters the US economy, national security and public health, says Joanne Carney, chief government-relations officer at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC. “We’re in a global competition, and we cannot wait any longer.”\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.\n\nHere, Nature looks at what comes next for US science as the government reopens for business.\n\nHow quickly will science agencies get back to work — especially on grant reviews?\n\nDuring the shutdown, scientists whose activities were considered essential, such as ‘hurricane hunters’ who collect data by flying into storms, kept working, although without pay. Other research activities also continued. NASA’s Mars rovers, for example, continued to operate throughout the shutdown, funded in advance by contracts that were not affected by the lapse in Congressional funding.\n\nBut activities that were deemed non-essential, such as reviewing research grant proposals, stopped. Now that the government has reopened, programme officers will reschedule such reviews.\n\nTrump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?\n\nAt the US National Science Foundation (NSF), for example, more than 300 grant-review meetings will need to be rescheduled. Each grant-review panel consists of about six to ten researchers, so rescheduling all the panels before the end of the year would be ‘miraculous’, says an NSF programme officer who requested anonymity out of concern of retaliation for speaking without authorization. The delay in reviewing grants will almost certainly lead to a delay in getting them out the door, they say. (After a request for comment from the NSF on 12 November, Nature received an automated response that said the agency is not answering e-mails during the shutdown.)\n\nFederal workers “will do what it takes to keep things on track”, says Eleanor Dehoney, vice-president of policy and advocacy at Research!America, a science advocacy group in Arlington, Virginia. “The staff at science agencies, the rank and file, are complete workhorses.”\n\nWhat’s the funding outlook for science agencies in the 2026 fiscal year?\n\nIn the budget proposal it released in May for the 2026 fiscal year, which began 1 October, the Trump administration called for unprecedented cuts to US science agencies, including a 40% cut for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The budget for the NSF, one of the country’s main providers of grants for basic science, would be slashed by more than 50%, and NASA’s science budget would be cut nearly in half.\n\nBut draft legislation moving through Congress in the months before the shutdown rejected the president’s most drastic cuts. For example, lawmakers in the US House of Representatives proposed an 18% cut for NASA’s science programme, and lawmakers in the Senate called for almost no cut at all. The Senate sought an overall increase of more than 10% for research unrelated to defence, according to the AAAS.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nThis week’s deal to end the shutdown finalized funding for the 2026 fiscal year for the US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Agency (FDA). The agreement slashed support for climate programmes at the Department of Agriculture, but cut the FDA budget to only 1% below that of the 2025 level. “Hopefully this is a good sign for science agencies”, Dehoney says.",

The organ survived for 61 days in the recipient, a 57-year-old brain-dead man in the United States, the longest a genetically modified pig organ has survived in a brain-dead person.\n\nIn two papers1,2 published in Nature today, researchers describe the main factors that cause the human immune system to reject transplanted organs. Researchers say the findings will improve outcomes for living people who receive organs from other people, or from animals.\n\n“In my mind, this is the first evidence of how to reverse rejection,” says Muhammad Mohiuddin, a clinician researcher at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, who led the first pig-heart transplant into a living person in 2022.\n\nIn the past three years, around a dozen living people have received organs from genetically modified pigs, including hearts, kidneys, livers and a thymus. But most of these organs were eventually removed after losing function or no longer providing enough benefit to justify the immunosuppression treatment required. Other recipients died shortly after the transplant.\n\nAlong with the pig kidney, the male recipient also received the pig’s thymus, a small gland that taught the man’s immune system to recognize the pig’s cells as part of the body. The thymus probably played a big role in helping the pig organ survive for longer, says co-author of the studies, Robert Montgomery, a surgeon and researcher at the New York University Langone Transplant Institute in New York City. In past experiments with non-human primates, he says, the modified kidney survived better when transplanted with the thymus than without it.\n\nAvoiding rejection\n\nThe latest pig-organ transplant was performed on 14 July 2023 at New York University Langone in New York City. The kidney and thymus were taken from a pig supplied by Revivicor, a subsidiary of biotechnology firm United Therapeutics, based in Virginia. The pigs had a single genetic modification, removing gene GGAT1, to stop the production of a sugar called alpha-gal on cells. Alpha-gal has been found to cause organ rejection in transplant surgeries in non-human primates.\n\nImmediately after the transplant, the kidney appeared healthy and produced urine. But 33 days after the procedure, the kidney’s function suddenly declined, and a biopsy showed that the organ was being rejected and damaged by antibodies. The team replaced the person’s plasma and gave them steroids and a drug called pegcetacoplan, which stopped pig cells being tagged for destruction by the immune system. But on day 49, another biopsy showed a different type of rejection, in which inflammatory cells had infiltrated the kidney’s surface. This was treated with an immunosuppressant that destroys T cells and stopped the organ from being rejected. Kidney function was also fully restored. The research team chose to end the experiment at 61 days.\n\nImmune system investigation",

In the past three years, a parade of highly accomplished researchers has emigrated there.\n\nWolfgang Baumeister, a molecular biologist, started working in China in 2019, following nearly three decades at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany.\n\nBaumeister is the pioneer of cryogenic-electron tomography, which enables researchers to construct 3D images of large molecules and the insides of cells. For this work, he was awarded Hong Kong’s Shaw Prize for life science and medicine this year.

But we have mandatory retirement in Germany. My contract was extended beyond the normal retirement age, and my colleagues in China knew that and said, ‘Why not come to China and you can continue?’\n\nI also had offers from the United States to continue my research there, but they would have requested that I move there permanently. With ShanghaiTech University, I can come and go. I have been there six times this year, typically for two weeks at a time.\n\nWhat is it like working as a scientist in China?\n\nThere are things I had to get used to. For instance, human resources departments at universities are more powerful here. In my role as managing director of the institute in Munich, I always tried to make sure that administration serves the scientists and does not command them.\n\nIn Germany, when we bought an instrument, I was used to making that decision myself. What happens here is that the university wants the responsibility for such a decision to be with a committee, who are often non-experts. Very often I say, okay, we can pay for the instrument and then I will be told that the committee will meet in two months and then make the decision. This is often a waste of time.\n\nBut when it comes to purchasing very expensive, high-end instrumentation, such as a $15 million electron microscope, I just talked to the president of the university for 10 minutes and he approved it. The very big things are often decided spontaneously by the leadership. That is pretty good.",

          "authors": "Lynne Peeples",
          "abstract": "A ‘black box’ warning has appeared on hormone replacement therapies in the United States for more than 20 years.Credit: Getty\n\nOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration announced its intention to eliminate safety warnings for hormone replacement therapy creams, pills and patches used to treat the symptoms of menopause. The move, which the FDA called “a historic action to restore gold-standard science to women’s health”, is drawing both praise and concern from scientists and advocates.\n\nMany argue that the warnings, which have appeared on the products for more than 20 years, have contributed to chronic underuse of menopausal hormone therapy among women who were likely to benefit. Yet some now worry that removing the labels entirely, or making overly broad claims about hormones, health and longevity, might swing the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. “I’m afraid comprehensive discussion about the risks and benefits may not occur in absence of that warning,” says Stephanie Faubion, the director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health in Jacksonville, Florida, and medical director of The Menopause Society a non-profit organization based in Pepper Pike, Ohio, that provides tools and resources to health-care professionals. “We need to end up somewhere in the middle.”\n\nHormone crash\n\nHormone therapy was widely prescribed for decades to ease common menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats and poor sleep. But prescriptions plunged worldwide in 2002 after an initial report from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) — a long-term US study — suggested that postmenopausal participants who were taking oestrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) had slightly increased risks of breast cancer, heart attack and stroke1. The findings — widely misinterpreted and overgeneralized — sparked fear among women and clinicians.\n\nIn January 2003, the FDA announced that oestrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy products would require a ‘black box’ safety warning, the agency’s strongest. Regulatory agencies around the world followed the FDA’s lead by changing labels and issuing advisories. Use of these products remained low even though later research hinted at reduced risks of heart disease and death among hormone-therapy users, and lower rates of breast cancer among those taking oestrogen-only therapy.\n\nHow menopause reshapes the brain\n\nA 2024 review reiterated that the hormone formulations, doses and delivery routes used in the WHI trials differed from those typically used today2. Transdermal patches don’t show the same links to blood clots found with oral hormones, for example. And using lower doses and hormones that are identical to those found in the body might further limit risks. Researchers have also noted that most participants included in the initial, concerning WHI analysis were a decade or more beyond menopause, a stage when the sudden return of oestrogen might pose health problems.\n\nBefore the WHI results were reported, about one-quarter of women over the age of 40 used systemic hormone therapy. Now, that figure is about 1.7%, according to data from the Mayo Clinic, says Faubion. “I don’t know what percentage should be getting the therapy, but I’d venture to say it is probably more than 1.7%,” she says. “On the other hand, I don’t think we should go back to thinking this is the be-all-end-all longevity drug.”\n\nThe balance of risks and benefits depends on a person’s age, years elapsed since menopause, whether the individual has a uterus, existing medical conditions and the therapy’s formulation, route of delivery and dose. “Hormone therapy is not for everyone,” says JoAnn Manson, a women’s health researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston and a former president of The Menopause Society. Generally, she says, women under the age of 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause who are experiencing symptoms might be good candidates.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Eco Clement/UPI/Alamy\n\nCosmologist George Smoot contributed to our understanding of the Universe on the largest scales and at the earliest observable times by measuring temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background. His key experiment in 1992 reported detecting these ‘ripples’ in the microwave sky. Smoot’s discovery, for which he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2006, revealed the long-anticipated traces of the formation of structures including stars and galaxies (G. F. Smoot et al. Astrophys. J. 396, L1–L5; 1992). This work led to many similar experiments, which used ever-more-precise measurements to cement our modern description of the Universe. Smoot has died aged 80.\n\nHow did the Big Bang get its name? Here’s the real story\n\nThe cosmic microwave background is the radiation from the Big Bang, which marked the beginning of the Universe 13.8 billion years ago. Smoot led the design of the detector that flew on NASA’s Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite. The data it collected gave a snapshot of variations in the density of matter in the hot, young Universe only about 400,000 years after the Big Bang. The amplitude of these variations aligned closely with predictions assuming that today’s galactic structures were formed under the gravitational influence of dark matter, rather than plasma, from that early time.\n\nSmoot was born in Yukon, Florida, the son of a hydrologist and a science teacher. In 1966, he earned degrees in physics and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. He remained at MIT for his PhD in experimental particle physics, before joining the research group of Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, where he built his research career.\n\nSmoot was using a high-altitude weather balloon to study cosmic rays, until it crashed into the ocean. His team then explored new research directions, in particular Big Bang cosmology. In the early 1970s, prompted by a theoretical paper from one of us (J. Silk Nature 215, 1155–1156; 1967), he began to study the relic microwave radiation. “My physics colleagues dismissed this work as speculation,” he wrote in his Nobel lecture. “It seemed to me a field ripe for observations that would be important no matter how they came out.” Early results using differential microwave radiometers (DMRs) on U-2 spy planes made it possible to measure how the motion of the Solar System makes one side of the sky seem hotter than the other.\n\nWhy we still don’t understand the Universe — even after a century of dispute",

Both types of molecule are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and levels of both fell by roughly 50% in people who were treated with the highest dose of the therapy1.\n\nCRISPR genome-editing grows up: advanced therapies head for the clinic\n\nSo far, only 15 people have received the treatment. But, if all goes well in future studies, investigators hope that gene editing might one day liberate many thousands of people from daily regimens of cholesterol-lowering medication.\n\n“What a revolution to be able to do that,” says Luke Laffin, a specialist in preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio and a lead investigator on the trial. “Conceptually, it’s a great idea: we can move from chronic therapy to something that’s one-and-done.”\n\nThat revolution will take years: considerably more safety testing would be needed to make the concept a reality, he adds. And there are questions about how much such a treatment would cost, and whether consumers would be willing to embrace it. But the trial results — published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 8 November — are the latest to show promise in harnessing gene-editing techniques to tackle some of the most common diseases.\n\nDecade-long dream\n\n“The dream scenario for me is getting these gene-editing therapies broadly applied,” says Kiran Musunuru, a cardiologist at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “These things are coming.”\n\nA little over a decade ago, Musunuru wondered whether CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing, then a new technology, could be harnessed to prevent or treat the world’s leading killer: cardiovascular disease. He pitched the idea to a few venture capitalists. “No one was interested at all,” he says. Instead, they wanted to focus on rare genetic disorders.\n\nHope for diabetes: CRISPR-edited cells pump out insulin in a person – and evade immune detection\n\nNow, Musunuru says he knows of about a dozen companies that intend to use gene editing to tackle high cholesterol. Other cardiovascular projects include treatments for a rarer condition called transthyretin amyloidosis, which can lead to heart failure. Biotechnology company CRISPR Therapeutics in Zug, Switzerland — the sponsor of the current cholesterol trial — has begun work on a gene-editing therapy to treat high blood pressure. “It’s fertile ground,” says Musunuru, who is himself a co-founder of a company that’s pursuing similar treatments.\n\nBut shifting from rare diseases to more common ones will require big safety studies that are capable of detecting unusual side effects, and CRISPR-based therapies have been used in only a few hundred people so far.",

          "authors": "Mariana Lenharo",
          "abstract": "Snack bars, yogurts, ice cream, even bottled water: it seems like food makers have worked out ways to slip extra protein into just about anything as they seek to capitalize on a growing consumer trend.\n\nToday, protein-fortified foods and protein supplements form a market worth tens of billions of US dollars, with fitness influencers, as well as some researchers and physicians, promoting high-protein diets as the secret to strength and longevity. Protein is undeniably essential, but how much people really need is still a topic of debate.\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet\n\nOn the one hand, most official guidelines recommend a minimum of close to one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or the equivalent of about 250 grams of cooked chicken (which contains around 68 g of protein) for an adult weighing 70 kilograms. On the other hand, a growing narrative in wellness circles encourages people to eat more than double that amount. Many scientists fall somewhere in the middle and take issue with some of the advice circulating online.\n\n“It’s really frustrating because there isn’t evidence to support the claims that they’re making,” says Katherine Black, an exercise nutritionist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, referring to the super-high protein recommendations often shared on social media. What research does show is that protein needs can vary from person to person and can change throughout a lifetime. And people should think carefully about what they eat to meet those needs. “On social media, it’s like everyone’s worried about protein, putting protein powder into everything,” she says.\n\nHealth authorities can help to guide people’s dietary choices on the basis of the latest research. The next Dietary Guidelines for Americans, a document that advises on what to eat for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, is due to come out by the end of this year. But its recommendations, which have tended to be broadly influential, might be changing.\n\nCalculating protein needs\n\nResearchers have been trying to estimate how much protein people need for more than a century. In 1840, chemist Justus von Liebig estimated that the average adult required 120 grams of protein a day, on the basis of a group of German workers’ diets. Later, scientists started to use nitrogen to calculate protein requirements. Protein is the only major dietary component that contains nitrogen. So, by measuring how much of it people consume and the amount they excrete, researchers could estimate how much the body uses.\n\nSince the 1940s, this nitrogen-balance method has been used to determine the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), a set of nutrient recommendations developed by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.\n\nAre ultra-processed foods really so unhealthy? What the science says\n\nThe latest such recommendation for protein, from 2005, establishes the RDA for both men and women at 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, which it states should be enough to meet the needs of 97–98% of healthy people. European and global-health authorities recommend similar or slightly higher levels.\n\nAlthough scientists recognize that RDAs are a useful reference point, many say that people could benefit from a higher amount. “The RDA is not a target; it’s simply the minimum that appears to prevent any detectable deficiency,” says Donald Layman, a researcher focusing on protein requirements at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Evidence suggests1 that the optimal range is between 1.2 and 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, he says.\n\nThat is especially true for older adults, who often experience muscle loss as they age, as well as for certain athletes and people trying to gain muscle.\n\nFor example, in an observational study of 2,066 adults aged 70–79, those who reported eating the most protein — about 1.1 gram per kilogram of bodyweight — lost 40% less lean mass during the three years of follow-up than did those who ate the least — around 0.7 grams per kilogram2.\n\n“For older adults, 1.2 grams per kilogram is just giving them a little extra protection,” says Nicholas Burd, a nutrition and exercise researcher also at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign. Furthermore, older people might experience a decline in appetite, which makes it particularly important for them to pay attention to their protein intake. It doesn’t mean that they need to take protein supplements, he says. “It’s all things we can do with just normal incorporation of high-protein foods in our lives.”\n\nFasting for weight loss is all the rage: what are the health benefits?\n\nFor healthy adults, increasing protein can boost the effects of resistance exercise, such as weightlifting. A 2017 systematic review found that, among people engaged in this type of training, taking protein supplements enhanced muscle gain and strength3. But increasing protein beyond 1.6 grams per kilogram per day provided no further benefit.\n\nMeanwhile, some fitness influencers swear by eating 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight. For most people, that’s simply overkill, says Burd. There’s little harm, other than for people with kidney disease, but Burd adds: “You just create an inefficient system where your body gets very good at wasting food protein.”\n\nSome practitioners might recommend higher protein targets to ensure that people get enough, Burd says. But the protein craze has been driven mostly by aggressive marketing of high-protein foods and supplements, he says.\n\n“The myth of increased protein needs has seeped into popular imagination, including among health professionals, and has been conveniently reinforced by the food industry,” says Fernanda Marrocos, a researcher specializing in nutrition and food policy at the University of São Paulo in Brazil.\n\nAmino-acid goals",

Credit: Oliver Berg/dpa via Alamy\n\nThe obesity drug tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound, can suppress patterns of brain activity associated with food cravings, a study suggests. Researchers measured the changing electrical signals in the brain of a person with severe obesity who had experienced persistent ‘food noise’ — intrusive, compulsive thoughts about eating — shortly after the individual began taking the medication.\n\nThe study is the first to use electrodes to directly measure how blockbuster obesity drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1 affect brain activity in people, and to hint at how they curb extreme food cravings.\n\n“It’s a great strategy to try and find a neural signature of food noise, and then try to understand how drugs can manipulate it,” says Amber Alhadeff, a neuroscientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The findings were published today in Nature Medicine1.\n\nBonus finding\n\nCasey Halpern, a neurosurgeon-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and his colleagues did not set out to investigate the effects of obesity drugs on the brain. The team’s goal was to test whether a type of deep brain stimulation — a therapy that involves delivering a weak electrical current directly into the brain — can help to reduce compulsive eating in people with obesity for whom treatments such as bariatric surgery haven’t worked.\n\nHow to keep weight off after obesity drugs\n\nThe scientists set up a study in which participants had an electrode implanted into their nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is involved in feelings of reward. It also expresses the GLP-1 receptor, notes Christian Hölscher, a neuroscientist at the Henan Academy of Innovations in Medical Science in Zhengzhou, China, “so we know that GLP-1 plays a role in modulating reward here”. This type of electrode, which can both record electrical activity and deliver an electrical current when needed, is already used in people to treat some forms of epilepsy.\n\nFor the study’s first two participants, the researchers found that episodes of intense food noise were accompanied by a surge in low-frequency brain activity. This pattern suggested that these changes could serve as a measurable sign of compulsive food cravings.\n\nThe third trial participant, a 60-year-old woman, had just started taking a high dose of tirzepatide — which had been prescribed by her physician to treat type 2 diabetes — when she had the electrode implanted. “We took advantage of this serendipitous opportunity because of the excitement around these drugs,” Halpern says.\n\nFood noise silenced",

          "abstract": "In the nervous system, synapses are where the action is. There, across a narrow gap between adjacent cells, neurons talk to one another through the dynamic exchange of chemical and electrical signals. Molecules known as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators induce or inhibit action potentials — spikes in voltage across neuronal cell membranes that trigger the release of other molecules. This cross-talk ultimately enables the production of emotions, thoughts, behaviours — everything that makes the brain what it is.\n\nA new way to capture the brain’s electrical symphony\n\nTo decode these conversations, researchers have relied on various tools. These include electrophysiology, in which electrodes are inserted into the brain or individual cells (in the case of patch-clamp recording) to measure the voltage changes linked to action potentials; microdialysis, in which some of the fluid surrounding neurons is extracted and analysed; and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, which uses implanted electrodes to detect certain signalling molecules.\n\nBut these methods have limitations. For instance, electrophysiology can precisely measure action potentials, but scientists can’t pinpoint the exact neurotransmitters or neuromodulators (collectively called neurochemicals) that drive them. Microdialysis can identify specific molecules, but it lacks the spatial and temporal resolution to pinpoint exactly when and where these neurochemicals are released, and voltammetry often struggles to distinguish molecules that are similar to each other.\n\nThe development of genetically encoded sensors over the past two decades has offered a way for neuroscientists to circumvent these issues. Such sensors were initially developed to identify action potentials in cells by tracking changes in calcium ions, but in recent years, researchers have expanded the toolbox to detect key neurochemicals.\n\nThe next generation of these sensors now enables scientists to ask questions such as: how much of a specific neurochemical is released in response to the firing of an action potential? How many action potentials are required to release a given neurochemical? And how long does that molecule stick around? “All these kinds of questions, for the vast majority of molecules — we’re talking about dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and many others — we know virtually nothing about,” says Nicolas Tritsch, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. “This new class of genetically encoded sensors has really opened up this world.”\n\nLighting up cells\n\nThe revolution in genetically encoded neurochemical sensing began with calcium. Action potentials activate specialized channel proteins on the neuron’s cell membrane and allow calcium to enter, changing the calcium concentration. By fusing the calcium-binding protein calmodulin with a fluorescent protein and genetically targeting the hybrid molecule to specific populations of cells, researchers have developed sensors that light up in response to calcium fluctuations — a proxy for neuronal activity.\n\nOne popular variety of genetically encoded calcium indicators, known as GCaMPs, has been around since 2001. Researchers have since optimized the sensors’ speed and sensitivity — and they are now mainstays of neuroscience research. “They’re so ubiquitous that most papers that use GCaMPs stopped citing the relevant papers,” says Loren Looger, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), whose team has been developing these sensors.\n\nGenetically encoded sensors offer several advantages (see ‘Tracking neurochemicals’). Researchers can express them at specific times in particular cells, then pair them with techniques such as optogenetics to cause them to fire in response to light. But they also require genetic manipulation and might change the biology of cells in unexpected ways.\n\nSources: GCaMP: Y. Yang et al. Ann. Rev. Anal. Chem. 17, 367–392 (2024); PBP & GPCR: Z. Wu et al. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 23, 257–274 (2022)\n\nStill, the success of these sensors motivated many tool developers, including Looger, to dream up similar strategies for detecting other neurochemicals. Among them are neurotransmitters such as glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine — which activate or inhibit nerve cells — and neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin and endocannabinoids, which trigger molecular pathways in the brain1.\n\nIn 2018, two papers2,3 published just weeks apart by teams in the United States and China independently described GCaMP-like sensors for dopamine, a neuromodulator involved in reward-based decision-making, learning and many other processes.\n\nDubbed dLight1 and GRAB-DA, respectively, both teams’ sensors were built on the dopamine receptor, one of a family of proteins known as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The teams, led by neuroscientist Lin Tian, then at the University of California, Davis, and by Yulong Li, a neuroscientist at Peking University in Beijing, modified the receptor to fluoresce in the presence of dopamine and inserted that gene into a virus. Researchers could then inject the sensors into a living animal and observe the activity of specific molecules in infected cells in the brain using fibre photometry, a technique that measures changes in fluorescence using an optical fibre implanted in the brain.\n\nHow to keep the lights on: the mission to make more photostable fluorophores\n\nThese sensors quickly became popular additions to the neuroscience toolkit, and the papers have been cited more than 800 times apiece. In part, says Mark Walton, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, their popularity is due to their ease of use. Conventional methods can be difficult to master — voltammetry, in particular, “is a bit of a black art”, he says. But with genetically encoded sensors, “we’ve never looked back”. Among other things, Walton and his team have used them to investigate dopamine fluctuations in almost 200,000 tests in mice, revealing that, contrary to previous results from conventional approaches, reward-based decision-making can happen independently of dopamine4.\n\nAnother benefit of GPCR-based sensors is their generalizability, with a design that has now been extended to receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin and endocannabinoids. “Those initial dopamine sensors and their subsequently optimized variants have been transformative,” says Matthew Banghart, a neuroscientist at UCSD. “It’s so easy to implement, and the sky’s the limit in terms of being able to apply this approach to any GPCR of interest.”\n\nEnabling discoveries\n\nThese sensors have begun to fundamentally shift our understanding of how neurotransmitters and neuromodulators work. Take dopamine, for instance. Although scientists have long known what it does, how exactly it transmits information in the brain has remained a mystery.\n\nAs a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in the late 2010s, Arif Hamid wanted to understand how dopamine fluctuates in the brain. One leading hypothesis at the time was that, when dopamine neurons were activated, the neuromodulator would be released across the brain uniformly. But when Hamid and his colleagues used the dLight sensor to track the molecule’s movements in the striatum of mouse brains — a region that contains many dopamine-responsive neurons — they discovered instead that the neuromodulator was released in waves5. “We were completely floored,” says Hamid, who is now a neuroscientist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. “It really defied our expectations.”\n\nGenetic light bulbs illuminate the brain\n\nTritsch and his team have found that acetylcholine, too, propagates in waves across the striatum. Using two-colour imaging in live mice with GRAB-DA-based sensors for both acetylcholine and dopamine, the researchers reported in 2023 that, rather than there being a stable, baseline concentration of the two molecules, their levels fluctuate with sub-second kinetics6. “We found signatures of dopamine and acetylcholine on timescales that are much, much faster than we thought was possible,” Tritsch says. “Our next step is to see how that’s influencing the brain on these timescales.”\n\nThe sensors are also revealing the secrets of other important neurochemicals. In 2021, a team led by researchers in California and Canada used a GRAB-based sensor to study endocannabinoid signalling in the mouse brain7. And earlier this year, another team used a GPCR sensor, called ntsLight1.1, that responds to the neuropeptide neurotensin, which is involved in feeding behaviour. The aim was to study what drives mice that are fed purely a high-fat diet to start avoiding calorie-rich foods8. Among other things, that analysis implicated a decline in neurotensin levels in a brain region linked with dopamine signalling as a possible cause.\n\nAnd it’s not only in basic neurobiology that these sensors show promise. For instance, Tian, who is now at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience in Jupiter, Florida, and her team have found a use that could help to develop treatments for anxiety. They showed that a sensor targeting neurons affected by the psychedelic drug 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine can be used to identify other cells that contribute to the drug’s anxiety-reducing effects in mice without producing hallucinogenic effects9. That’s a finding that could support the development of future psychedelics that could have therapeutic benefits without the mind-bending side-effects, the study authors write.\n\nMixed signals\n\nGenetically encoded sensors do have some important caveats, however.\n\nOne key consideration is how these proteins affect the biology of the cells in which they are expressed. Like most proteins, excessive expression can be toxic to neurons, so identifying the best concentration at which to use a sensor is paramount, says Tritsch. “With every batch, we need to know how much to dilute so we can see it, but so it’s not too much that it kills the neurons.”\n\nWhy this happens is an open question, but Tritsch and others suggest two possibilities: The GPCRs could be siphoning off molecules that are required for healthy neuronal functioning, or their overexpression could be overextending the cellular machinery required to build these molecules and deliver them to the membrane.",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "The Chinese government hopes a new visa will encourage talented young researchers to move there.Credit: VCG via Getty\n\nChina has introduced a visa that will allow young foreign researchers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) to move there without having to secure a job first.\n\nBefore the introduction of the K visa, most foreign STEM researchers hoping to move to China had to find a job in advance and then apply for a work visa.\n\nThe Chinese government is making “a serious bid” to attract the world’s brightest minds in STEM, says Jeremy Neufeld, the director of immigration policy at the Institute for Progress, a think tank in Washington DC. South Korea, Singapore and several other countries have also launched STEM-oriented visa programmes.\n\nThe K visa was officially rolled out on 1 October, but Nature understands that applications are yet to open. Few details about eligibility have been released, except that restrictions will apply on the basis of an applicant’s age, education and work experience. Foreign researchers who have graduated from ‘famous’ universities or institutes in China or abroad with a bachelor-or-higher degree in STEM will be eligible to apply. That also includes people who teach or research STEM topics in such organizations.\n\nA ‘big step forward’\n\nThe visa is designed to help the country boost its competitiveness in areas that it deems important for its future, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and new materials, says Yuen Yuen Ang, a political economist at Johns Hopkins University in in Baltimore, Maryland. As the US government cuts back on its support for science, Chinese leaders see an opportunity to attract the best foreign scientists, particularly those working in fundamental research, Ang says.\n\nLu Fengming, a political economist at the Australian National University in Canberra, says it is a big step for the Chinese government to allow scientists to move to the country without a job offer. Sponsorship is needed for most other Chinese visa types, Lu says. The visa is a smart move given China’s desire to attract global talent, he adds.\n\nThe country’s immigration figures are relatively low compared with those of other leading science nations. In 2023, only 0.05% of China’s overall population were foreigners, compared with 4.9% in South Korea and 14.3% in the United States, according to an analysis by Direct HR, a recruitment firm based in Shanghai. It is unclear how many of them work in STEM, but some estimates show that China has 5,000–10,000 foreign researchers with a PhD, compared with at least 100,000 foreign scholars at this level in the United States.\n\nHowever, the United States is now restricting some immigration. In late September, the administration of President Donald Trump imposed a US$100,000 fee on applications for an H-1B visa, which many foreign STEM researchers rely on to live in the country.\n\n“While the US seemed to be raising barriers, China sent a strong counter-signal that it was opening its doors,” says Changhee Kim, a human-resource researcher at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou, China.\n\nBut Wang Zichen, a research fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank based in Beijing, says China did not launch the K visa on a whim. He notes that the government called for “more proactive, open and effective talent policies” as early as 2022.\n\nChallenges ahead",

          "title": "The computers that run on human brain cells",
          "authors": "David Adam",
          "abstract": "In a town on the shores of Lake Geneva sit clumps of living human brain cells for hire. These blobs, about the size of a grain of sand, can receive electrical signals and respond to them — much as computers do. Research teams from around the world can send the blobs tasks, in the hope that they will process the information and send a signal back.\n\nWelcome to the world of wetware, or biocomputers. In a handful of academic laboratories and companies, researchers are growing human neurons and trying to turn them into functional systems equivalent to biological transistors. These networks of neurons, they argue, could one day offer the power of a supercomputer without the outsized power consumption.\n\nCan lab-grown brains become conscious?\n\nThe results so far are limited. But keen scientists are already buying or borrowing online access to these brain-cell processors — or even investing tens of thousands of dollars to secure their own models.\n\nSome want to use these biocomputers as straightforward replacements for ordinary computers, whereas others want to use them to study how brains work. “Trying to understand biological intelligence is a very interesting scientific problem,” says Benjamin Ward-Cherrier, a robotics researcher at the University of Bristol, UK, who rents time on the Swiss brain blobs. “And looking at it from the bottom up — with simple small versions of our brain and building those up — I think is a better way of doing it than top down.”\n\nBiocomputing advocates claim that these systems could one day rival the capability of artificial intelligence and the potential of quantum computers.\n\nOther researchers who work with human neurons are more sceptical of what’s possible. And they warn that hype — and the science-fictional allure of what are sometimes labelled brain-in-a-jar systems — could even be counterproductive. If the idea that these systems possess sentience and consciousness takes hold, there could be repercussions for the research community.\n\n“I’m nervous that, if this kind of work gets a lot of attention and is overstated, that the reaction won’t just be, ‘We need to think about this work a little more carefully’. It will be, ‘We need to stop this work entirely,’” says Madeline Lancaster, a developmental biologist who uses neural tissue to study development and disease at the University of Cambridge, UK, but is not involved in biocomputing projects. “That could bring in regulations that prevent all work, including on the side of the field that’s really doing research to try to help people.”\n\nPower down\n\nComputer scientists have long coveted the astonishing power efficiency of the human brain. Running on less than 20 watts — about enough to work a small desktop fan — its billions of neurons can spin through the equivalent of one billion billion mathematical operations each second. The best supercomputers can match that speed, but consume a million times more power in doing so.\n\nSome researchers are trying to replicate the super-efficient structure of the brain using silicon chips. This approach, broadly called neuromorphic computing, takes inspiration from how neurons connect and fire to communicate. Specifically, some systems seek to mimic how neurons must charge to a threshold before firing an electrical impulse.\n\nBiocomputing, on the other hand, goes back to the biological source material. Starting with induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which can be reprogrammed to become almost any type of cell, researchers culture communities of brain cells and nurture them with nutrients and growth factors. To communicate with them, researchers sit the cells on electrode arrays, then pass signals and commands to them as sequences of electrical pulses. These signals change the way that ions flow into and out of neurons, and might prompt some cells to fire an electrical impulse known as an action potential. The biocomputer electrodes can detect these signals and employ algorithms to convert them to usable information.\n\nNeurons in a dish learn to play Pong — what’s next?\n\nThe most common biocomputing approach cultures the neurons as 3D clusters called organoids. The composition of these brain-cell communities varies, depending on how the iPS cells differentiate, but typically includes neurons and cells that support them, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.\n\nIn August, Ward-Cherrier and his colleagues reported1 using human brain organoids of around 10,000 neurons to ‘recognize’ Braille letters. They first used a robot fitted with a tactile sensor to read the letters, and then converted the data collected for each letter into a distinct pattern of electrical pulses — varying the timing and intensity, for example — which they passed through a series of eight electrodes placed next to the surface of the organoid. These electrodes record the collective activity of many nearby neurons.\n\nThe researchers wanted to learn whether the patterns of firing in the organoid were different depending on the stimulation pattern it received, and whether those responses were consistent.\n\nFor each letter, they collected the response from each electrode, averaged them to yield an overall organoid output, and used machine learning to identify any patterns.\n\nThe results showed that, when fed electrical pulses corresponding to specific letters, a single organoid would produce the same characteristic response 61% of the time, on average. When responses from three organoids were combined, that went up to 83%. In other words, the organoids could perform a simple processing task: to distinguish between and identify inputs.\n\nFor Ward-Cherrier, it’s a solid proof of principle. “It is an initial kind of stab at showing that we can do these types of tasks. The next step is doing something a little bit more complex.” That could include interpreting messages from the cultured cells as instructions for the robot — to read the letter again, for example. Such abilities define what researchers call closed-loop-systems, which have not yet been demonstrated with human brain organoids — although a 2024 study2 reported that such a system, made of mouse neuronal organoids, could play Cartpole, a computer game in which the aim is to keep a wobbly pole upright on a moving cart.\n\nBecause the inputs and outputs in cultured systems are simple electrical signals, it’s easy to offer remote access to organoids through the web. So, even though the Braille-reading robot is based in Ward-Cherrier’s lab in Bristol, the organoids are grown and housed at the company FinalSpark, in Vevey, Switzerland.\n\nDevices containing tiny clumps of human brain cells sit inside a fridge at FinalSpark in Vevey, Switzerland.Credit: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty\n\nA self-confessed fan of science fiction, FinalSpark co-founder Fred Jordan says he wants to develop systems of biological neurons that can “perform some similar things as are done with AI today”.\n\nThere is a long way to go. As computers, the organoid systems are currently “totally useless from a practical perspective”, he admits. “There is a very big difference between dreaming or thinking about something and doing it for real. And I would love to be one of those people who make this step.”\n\nSelected academic groups, such as Ward Cherrier’s, get free access to FinalSpark organoids, and many teams have signed up for this. A team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, for example, is testing different types of stimulation to see how the organoids behave, and researchers at the Free University of Berlin are focusing on how machine-learning tools can best extract information from neural firing patterns.\n\nFor clients with deeper pockets, including private companies, monthly fees of US$5,000 can secure exclusive online access to an organoid system. And plenty do. “We have very, very big companies active in individual fields that you would think are disconnected to this,” Jordan says. Unlike with the free work done by academic groups, FinalSpark does not know what paying customers use the organoids for.\n\nOther independent groups with organoid expertise are jumping into biocomputing. The neural organoids in Alysson Muotri’s lab at the University of California, San Diego, each contain about 2.5 million neurons of various types. Muotri aims to apply organoids to a real-world problem: predicting the path of possible oil spills in the Amazon jungle. The project, financed by an oil company, is due to conclude by 2028. “We’re taking the challenge,” he says. “We’ll see where we are in three years.”\n\nTraining ground\n\nFor many organoid users trying to run more-complex tasks, one immediate aim is to find ways to train the neurons and thereby encourage goal-directed behaviour. At present, the responses from FinalSpark’s lab-grown organoids have more in common with the reflex actions of the peripheral nervous system — when someone’s leg kicks in response to a tap below the knee, for example — than with the malleable processes that guide decision-making in the brain.\n\nTo handle more complexity, these neural systems must be able to learn. One way to encourage that, Jordan says, is to deliver neurotransmitters such as dopamine to try to tune the organoids’ responses to particular stimuli. Dopamine makes neurons more likely to fire and strengthens the synapses that connect them — two changes that make the same neural response to a stimulus more likely to be repeated in future.\n\nAnother is a technique called pattern training stimulation, which was used in 2022 by researchers at Cortical Labs, a company based in Melbourne, Australia, to encourage lab-grown brain cells to play the 1970s computer game Pong3.\n\nRather than working with organoids, they chose to create networks of cells in dishes (see ‘Computing with cells’). Then the researchers wired them up to a computer, which was programmed so that the response of the neurons to stimulation moved a virtual paddle while a virtual ball bounced around. To direct the paddle towards the ball, the researchers fed the neurons with an organized burst of electrical activity if the cells (at first, randomly) got it right. If the neurons moved the paddle in the wrong direction, they were blasted with chaotic white noise. Over time, the neurons learnt to hit the ball to receive the patterned response rather than the random one.\n\nThe strategy is drawn from the observation that brain cells tend to repeat activity that yields a predictable outcome, so will learn the kinds of behaviour that trigger familiar stimulation.\n\nCortical Labs has now developed a modular system that can link increasing numbers of individual wells, each containing at most 1,000 neurons, to form what the company calls a bioengineered intelligence. Each cell culture has a useful life of about six months before it must be replaced.",

          "abstract": "China has seen increasing international enrolments as its universities grow in stature, but this has also brought challenges.Credit: Yang Bo/China News Service/VCG via Getty\n\nIn 2018, I argued that China’s meteoric growth in research output masked deeper structural issues, including inconsistent research quality and a ‘publish or perish’ academic culture. Seven years on, that picture has changed.\n\nResearch quality in China has improved: in 2023, it overtook the United States as the leading country in the Nature Index, which tracks output in high-quality natural- and health-sciences journals. Since then, the gap between the two countries has only widened.\n\nThese gains reflect deliberate policy interventions, including the Chinese government’s Double First-Class Initiative, launched in 2017 to cultivate world-class universities and disciplines by awarding different levels of funding on the basis of performance and strategic goals, with a focus on quality over quantity.\n\nAt the institutional level, performance evaluations now place greater weight on originality, quality and international visibility, rather than raw output. Since 2020, in response to a national policy that aimed to address the pervasive focus on research output, rather than quality, some universities have reduced or abolished cash rewards for sheer numbers of publications, replacing them with recognition tied to global impact and peer esteem.\n\nBut structural challenges remain. Some universities are using pay bumps, rather than cash payments for papers, as a more indirect way to reward prolific authors1. Progress has been uneven: improvements are concentrated in a small cluster of elite universities and disciplines. Political sensitivities continue to constrain academic openness and freedom.\n\nEarlier this year, I interviewed 10 university administrators and academics and 12 international postgraduate students at two Chinese research universities to gain an understanding of how the country’s increasingly cautious approach to global collaborations is affecting their work.\n\nChanging landscape\n\nOne of the biggest changes the interviewees described is the shift away from US and UK collaborations, especially in politically sensitive areas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), aerospace and cybersecurity. Many universities now encourage partnerships with researchers in South and southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and continental Europe — regions with which China aims to strengthen trade and economic ties through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nSome universities are using planning tools to manage international partnerships more carefully. A few interviewees mentioned a system that ranks potential research partners by geopolitical and reputational risk — green for low risk, amber for moderate and red for high, which needs approval from senior university leaders. It “has become a routine part of proposal review — even for conference participation or faculty exchanges”, one academic-affairs supervisor said.\n\nThis shift also affects international students, especially those from low- and middle-income countries participating in the BRI, who account for a growing share of enrolments at Chinese universities.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nMany of these students face major challenges, including limited institutional support and language barriers. Some interviewees noted that as Chinese universities have shifted their focus from recruiting students from high-income countries, such as South Korea, Japan, the United States and United Kingdom, to students from lower-income regions, the system seems less equipped to accommodate their academic and cultural needs.\n\nFor example, interviewees suggested that students from richer countries generally received clearer information and stronger institutional support than did those from low- and middle-income countries, who were frustrated about being enrolled in ‘English-speaking’ classes that, in reality, were not taught in English. “Many assignments are in Chinese,” said a Pakistani student studying English linguistics. “I translate everything myself.”\n\nSome interviewees noted that administrative hurdles, such as delayed visa renewals, have intensified, particularly as enforcement of residency and exit–entry rules has become stricter. China’s regulations on the enrolment of international students — jointly issued in 2020 by the ministries of education, foreign affairs and public security — require universities to coordinate with local public-security bureaus and foreign-affairs offices to process visa and residence-permit approvals, thereby institutionalizing several layers of oversight.\n\nStudents sponsored by their home government said that they face strict requirements to return after graduating. “I have to return to Bangladesh and work in a government office for five years, or repay everything,” a student from the country explained. “It blocks career options.”\n\nThese rules reflect China’s policy of cultivating foreign talent — especially students from BRI countries who gain local experience and later return to their home countries to work in government or development sectors. The intent of the policy is to foster long-term ties and mutual understanding between China and these countries, as part of a broader strategy of education-driven diplomacy that combines talent development with international influence-building.\n\nSelf-funded international students, however, said they have reduced access to institutional support, travel grants and career resources compared with their government-sponsored peers, creating a two-tier system.\n\nAmbiguity and self-censorship\n\nIn addition to administrative hurdles, many students described an academic environment in which certain topics were ‘off-limits’, without clear guidelines. “We’re often discouraged from raising questions in class because we’re unsure what is politically acceptable,” said one European student studying international relations.\n\nDifferent disciplines seem to have different boundaries. Science, technology, engineering and mathematics students reported restricted access to international databases in genomics and biotechnology, for instance; social-science students encountered extended review processes or informal bans on politically sensitive topics.\n\nOne European student told me that they wanted to compare Taiwanese and mainland media narratives as part of an assignment, and their adviser told them to avoid “sensitive framing”, including terms such as “independence” and “resistance”.",

In a clinical trial, ganaplacide–lumefantrine (GanLum) cured 97.4% of participants, outperforming an existing treatment, which cured 94%.\n\nNovartis, the maker of GanLum, based in Basel, Switzerland, says it is in the process of submitting the drug for regulatory approval, and it could be available in 12–18 months. It would be the first new class of malaria drug approved in more than 25 years.\n\nTackling resistance\n\nMalaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites and transmitted to people mainly through mosquito bites. It infects hundreds of millions of people and causes nearly 600,000 deaths each year, most of which occur in children under the age of five.\n\nCurrently, the most widely used malaria treatments rely on artemisinin, a plant-derived compound that rapidly kills malaria parasites. But partial resistance to this compound has been identified in southeast Asia and several African countries. “There is a great need for non-artemisinin-based drugs to treat malaria,” says Philip Rosenthal, a malaria specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAlthough it’s not clear whether this resistance is causing treatment failures, having alternatives is important in case current therapies lose effectiveness. For that reason, GanLum moving towards approval gives a “tremendous sense of relief”, says George Jagoe, executive vice-president at Medicines for Malaria Venture, an organization in Geneva, Switzerland, focused on increasing access to new malaria treatments. It collaborated with Novartis to develop the therapy, providing financial and scientific support.\n\nThe clinical-trial results were presented today at the American Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene (ASTMH) annual meeting in Toronto, Canada. Researchers compared GanLum with artemether–lumefantrine, a standard artemisinin-based treatment for malaria. The trial included 1,688 adults and children with malaria in 12 countries across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nTransmission block\n\nData from the study showed that GanLum could clear parasites with a mutation associated with artemisinin resistance in around 47 hours, much faster than the standard treatment, which took around 71 hours.",

          "abstract": "A Tiny Reasoning Model beat Large Language Models in solving logic puzzles, despite being trained on a much smaller dataset. Credit: Getty\n\nA small-scale artificial-intelligence model that learns from only a limited pool of data is exciting researchers for its potential to boost reasoning abilities. The model, known as Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), outperformed some of the world’s best large language models (LLMs) at the Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI), a test involving visual logic puzzles that is designed to flummox most machines.\n\nThe model — detailed in a preprint on the arXiv server last month1 — is not readily comparable to an LLM. It is highly specialized, excelling only on the type of logic puzzles on which it is trained, such as sudokus and mazes, and it doesn’t ‘understand’ or generate language. But its ability to perform so well on so few resources — it is 10,000 times smaller than frontier LLMs — suggests a possible route for boosting this capability more widely in AI, say researchers.\n\n“It’s fascinating research into other forms of reasoning that one day might get used in LLMs,” says Cong Lu, a machine-learning researcher formerly at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. However, he cautions that the techniques might no longer be as effective if applied on a much larger scale. “Often techniques work very well at small model sizes and then just stop working,” at a bigger scale, he says.\n\nA test of artificial intelligence\n\n“The results are very significant in my opinion,” says François Chollet, co-founder of AI firm Ndea, who created the ARC-AGI test. Because such models need to be trained from scratch on each new problem, they are “relatively impractical”, but “I expect a lot more research to come out that will build on top of these results”, he adds.\n\nThe sole author of the paper — Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, an AI researcher at Samsung AI Lab in Montreal, Canada — says that her model shows that the idea that only massive models that cost millions of dollars to train can succeed at hard tasks “is a trap”. She has made the model’s code openly available on Github for anyone to download and modify. “Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction,” she wrote on her blog.\n\nTiny model, big results\n\nMost reasoning models are built on top of LLMs, which predict the next word in a sequence by tapping into billions of learned internal connections, known as parameters. They excel by memorizing patterns from billions of documents, which can trip them up when they come to unpredictable logic puzzles.\n\nThe TRM takes a different approach. Jolicoeur-Martineau was inspired by a technique known as the hierarchical reasoning model, developed by the AI firm Sapient Intelligence in Singapore. The hierarchical reasoning model improves its answer through multiple iterations and was published in a preprint in June2.\n\nThe TRM uses a similar approach, but uses just 7 million parameters, compared with 27 million for the hierarchical model and billions or trillions for LLMs. For each puzzle type the algorithm learns, such as a sudoku, Jolicoeur-Martineau trained a brain-inspired architecture known as a neural network on around 1,000 examples, formatted as a string of numbers.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide\n\nDuring training, the model guesses the solution and then compares it with the correct answer, before refining its guess and repeating the process. In this way, it learns strategies to improve its guesses. The model then takes a similar approach to solve unseen puzzles of the same type, successively refining its answer up to 16 times before generating a response.",

A team of scientists took a submersible vessel beneath the Arctic sea ice and completed more than 40 dives, going as deep as 5,277 metres.\n\nThe analyses are far from complete, but this section of the Gakkel ridge might have hot-water vents that spew from the sea floor. Similar vents on the western, and better-explored, part of the ridge are home to bizarre ecosystems that thrive far from the reach of sunlight. They provide scientists with some of the best opportunities to understand how life might arise and evolve in icy oceans on worlds beyond Earth, such as on Jupiter’s ice-encrusted moon Europa.\n\nMissing piece\n\nExpedition scientists will spend the next few years studying the rocks, water and animals that they gathered during the submersible dives. “It’s the last piece of the puzzle” to understanding this unique Arctic environment, says Xiaoxia Huang, a marine geophysicist at the Institute of Deep-Sea Science and Engineering in Sanya, China, and the expedition’s chief scientist.\n\nThe Gakkel ridge stretches from off the coast of Greenland to Siberia. Volcanic eruptions along it create new sea-floor crust, which spreads away from the ridge at some of the slowest rates on the planet — slower than the rate at which fingernails grow. Yet, somehow that sluggish geology manages to produce enough heat and chemical energy to sustain hydrothermal vents on the sea floor.\n\nIn 2001, a US–German expedition discovered hydrothermal vents on the western part of the Gakkel ridge1. Researchers have returned multiple times to that area to study the rich chemistry and biology of the deep, dark vent system2,3.\n\nBut the eastern side of the ridge is more remote and challenging to explore. Russian scientists have conducted some surveys, but the latest Chinese expedition is the first intensive geological survey and diving expedition in the area, Huang says.\n\n“It’s so hard to get there that anything anybody does is almost guaranteed to be exciting and different and new,” says Christopher German, a marine geochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “The Chinese expedition is poised to yield significant new insights,” adds Elmar Albers, a marine geoscientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany.\n\nRisky expedition\n\nThe Chinese expedition, organized by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, paired a deep-sea crewed submersible, named Fendouzhe, with an ice-breaker. It was the first time Fendouzhe, which has explored many parts of the oceans, including the Mariana Trench, has visited the Arctic region. Other expeditions have used remotely operated vehicles to explore the Gakkel Ridge, because of the dangers of the vehicle becoming trapped under floating sea ice.",

His pin badge collection hung on the wall beside him, one for each port he’d visited; he hadn’t been to Tremulos yet. He hoped to get that promotion soon and visit systems farther out, like Tremulos, while he trained other spaceport controllers.\n\n“What’s the deal?” Cara asked beside him.\n\n“Dunno,” Ako said. He opened comms with the ship. “Identify yourself, Tremulos origin.”\n\nNothing.\n\nAlarming scenarios rushed into Ako’s mind and he notified security as he kept trying to raise the pilot.\n\nSecurity swarmed Bay 30, weapons ready. When the ship docked but didn’t open or respond to security’s commands, Ako sent a hangar robot to open the door, and security entered the ship. Ako sat forward, staring at the gaping ship door, hardly breathing.\n\n“Ever seen a Tremulo?” Cara asked.\n\n“Never,” Ako said. “You?”\n\n“Once. You know how aspen groves look like individual trees but are really one organism?”\n\nHe nodded.\n\n“That’s a Tremulo. But they’re tall and thin and sort of humanoid.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nA security guard emerged, helmet removed, and looked up to where Ako and Cara sat safely in their controller’s office. “Get down here,” she said. She looked annoyed and not at all alarmed.\n\nMoments later Ako stood inside the ship, staring at what appeared to be dozens of small aliens but was really one Tremulo. A child, according to security, with development equivalent to a human preschooler, and no alien adult on board.\n\nThe Tremulo was all knobbly knees and elbows and skinny bodies connected by thin filaments. Each one had a pair of large eyes staring up at Ako.\n\n“We just spoke to their parents,” the security guard said. “They’re on their way, but it’ll be a while.”\n\n“How’d they end up on a ship alone?” Ako asked. “And how’d they get here?”\n\n“Their parent had the ship ready for launch,” she said. “Then realized they forgot something, and they were so distracted when they left the ship that they left it primed for launch. All the kid here had to do was push a button and, boom, unauthorized joy ride. At any rate, keep an eye on them until the parent gets here.”\n\nPanic spiked in Ako’s gut. “Why can’t you watch them?”\n\n“I’ve got a whole shift to finish. And I checked the schedule. No more ships arriving until the parent gets here. You’ve got the time.” She replaced her helmet, eyes hidden by dark reflective armour.\n\nAko whirled on Cara. “Can you —”\n\n“Oh, no,” she said, backing up. “Just ’cause I’ve got a uterus doesn’t mean I’m automatically the babysitter.”\n\n“But I don’t know a thing about young Tremulos.”\n\n“Neither do I. As no one has an advantage, you’re as good a babysitter as anyone else.”\n\n“But what do I do with them?” Ako asked, trying not to squirm under the heavy stare of 80 pairs of eyes.\n\n“Entertain them.”\n\nAko checked the parent’s ETA. He would have to keep an eye on this alien child for several hours. In the meantime, the child was wandering everywhere and touching everything.\n\n“Stop that,” he said via the translator device. “Don’t touch that. Don’t climb that. Come here. No, stay out of there.” He glanced at his watch. Only 15 minutes had passed? He wanted to sit on the bay floor and cry.\n\nOne pair of Tremulo eyes looked up, then they all snapped in the direction of the controller’s office. “Shiny,” they said.\n\nThey were looking at Ako’s pin badge collection, winking in the bright lights from the bay. It was the first time they’d stood still. Ako didn’t want those grubby hands anywhere near his hard-earned collection, but he didn’t think he could spend the next few hours chasing this kid around and keeping them from pressing some crucial button and accidentally, say, exposing him to the vacuum of space.\n\nAko bolted up the stairs, muttering the whole way about the sacrifices he was making. He snatched the board and ran back down.",

Now, a team in China has developed a system called AI-Newton that, after being fed experimental data, can autonomously ‘discover’ key physics principles, such as Newton’s second law describing the effect of force and mass on acceleration.\n\nThe model mimics the human scientific process by incrementally building a knowledge base of concepts and laws, says Yan-Qing Ma, a physicist at Peking University in Beijing who helped to develop the system. Being able to identify useful concepts means that the system can potentially discover scientific insights without human pre-programming, Ma adds.\n\nKeyon Vafa, a computer scientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, explains that AI-Newton uses an approach called symbolic regression, in which the model hunts for the best mathematical equation to represent physical phenomena. This technique is a promising method for scientific discovery, he adds, because the system is programmed in a way that encourages it to deduce concepts.\n\nThe team at Peking University used a simulator to generate data from 46 physics experiments1 involving the free motion of balls and springs, collisions between objects and the behaviour of systems exhibiting vibrations, oscillations and pendulum-like motion. The simulator also deliberately introduced statistical errors to mimic real-world data.\n\nFor example, AI-Newton was given data on the position of a ball at a given time and asked to come up with a mathematical equation that explains the relationship between the two variables of time and position. It was able to provide an equation for velocity. It stored this knowledge for the next set of tasks, in which it successfully derived the mass of the ball using Newton’s second law. The results have not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nPlanetary trajectories\n\nScientists have previously used AI models to predict planetary orbits. In 2019, researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich developed ‘AI Copernicus’, a neural network that used Earth-based observations to derive formulae for planetary trajectories. In that case, humans were needed to interpret the equations and understand how they relate to the movement of the planets around the Sun.\n\nVafa and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge tried a similar experiment with several foundation models, a type of AI model trained on vast data sets, including large language models such as GPT, Claude and Llama.\n\nThey trained the models to predict the location of planets across solar systems and then asked them to predict the forces that govern planetary trajectories. In a preprint2, the researchers showed that when the models were trained on orbital trajectories, they could not use the knowledge to do any task other than predicting planetary trajectories. When trying to turn those orbital trajectory data into a law about how forces behave, the foundation AI models derived a nonsensical law of gravitation.",

          "abstract": "This week, as world leaders gather in Belém, Brazil, for the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), once again it seems that there will be more rhetoric than real solutions for the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate.\n\nMy native Belize — with its tropical rainforests, coastal wetlands and coral reefs — is one such country. Warming seas are killing our reefs. Hurricanes and wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity.\n\n‘Almost utopian’: how protecting the environment is boosting the economy in Brazil\n\nAs a biologist with two decades of experience in academia and conservation, I have learnt that, to protect natural resources, local communities must be empowered to steward these efforts — and that women are often best placed to drive them, at least in Latin America and the Caribbean, but probably everywhere.\n\nIn many cultures, women are the de facto main carers and custodians of community knowledge. They are often in positions, paid or otherwise, to make their communities healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful — making them well-suited to lead climate action and conservation work.\n\nI am the managing director of the Belize Maya Forest Trust, a non-profit organization dedicated to conserving nearly 1,000 square kilometres of the country’s tropical forest. I also chair the board of directors of the Belize Network of NGOs, an umbrella organization for many of the more than 100 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country. In Belize, many prominent conservation organizations are led by women. Take the Community Baboon Sanctuary, a globally recognized conservation effort that protects the habitat of the Yucatán black-howler monkey (Alouatta pigra). Today, the sanctuary is managed by the Community Baboon Sanctuary Women’s Conservation Group, which is directed by women from seven Belizean villages.\n\nAnd over the past five years, working with the government of Belize and The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, women in Belize have had key roles in the execution of game-changing sustainable-financing initiatives. One is Belize’s first large-scale project to reduce emissions by avoiding deforestation, which is helping to protect the Belize Maya Forest, an area that includes some of the world’s most biodiversity-rich lands. Another is Belize Blue Bonds — which, when the deal closed in November 2021, was the world’s largest debt-refinancing scheme for ocean conservation.\n\nThe more I participate in advocacy and interact with civil-society organizations — both in Belize and internationally — the more I find myself in rooms full of women striving to protect the environment and defend human rights.\n\nBut I have also noticed that women are not usually negotiating for funds, deciding whether to launch large initiatives or setting national priorities.\n\nIs it time to give up trying to save coral reefs? My research says no\n\nBelize is again a case in point. In any of the ten elections since Belize gained independence in 1981, at most four women have been elected to the 28–31-member House of Representatives, the most powerful arm of the country’s legislature. Other female parliamentarians have been appointed by the prime minister, but these positions tend to have much less authority than do those elected through popular vote. Also, female ministers are usually put in charge of human or rural-development issues, rather than the country’s economy, land, infrastructure or defence.\n\nFor countries to build resilience and protect their biodiversity in the time needed, more women must be made equal partners in decision making.",

          "title": "To reform universities, first tackle global rankings",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gadd",
          "abstract": "University reputations and finances often hinge on their position in global ranking tables. Students use rankings to quickly identify the best place to study — or, at least, what might be perceived to be the best by any future employer. Even a small shift in rank can affect how many students apply to a university, altering the income from tuition fees (R.-D. Baltaru et al. Stud. High. Educ. 47, 2323–2335; 2022).\n\nThe future of universities\n\nAnd governments love the simplicity of rankings. Many will fund their citizens’ overseas study only at institutions that are high up the listings. National investment initiatives — such as Russia’s 5-100 Academic Excellence project and Japan’s Top Global University project — often focus on universities that have a chance of making it into the upper echelons of the rankings. The UK government offers its High Potential Individual visas only to candidates who have studied at highly ranked universities.\n\nSuch reliance on rankings means that universities are shaped not by the needs of society or by innovations driven from inside the international higher-education community, but by unappointed third-party ranking agencies.\n\nThe indicators used by some of the dominant flagship rankings don’t capture the full range of qualities and functions of higher-education institutions. Each agency uses a slightly different ranking method, but all typically focus on a narrow range of criteria. These are centred heavily on publication-based measures, such as citations, and on reputation surveys.\n\nThe consequence is that most of the world’s universities tend to pursue one flavour of ‘excellence’, which looks rather like the old, wealthy, conservative, research-intensive institutions of high-income nations.\n\nInside our university’s mission to pivot to research\n\nMeanwhile, universities are facing a series of problems — from diminishing public funding and trust, to decreasing curriculum relevance in a rapidly changing job market and the need to demonstrate real-world impact from research. There is no shortage of ideas about how to reshape universities in response to these challenges, but the dominance of rankings as a measure of institutional success means that universities lack incentives to try. Many fear that stepping away from the status quo might result in a drop down the tables, making it harder for them to attract funding and talent.\n\nScholarly communities and universities must push for change. Here, I outline how.\n\nA flawed system\n\nIn my view, flagship global rankings over-rely on the data sources that they have easy access to: publication data or survey data that they collect themselves. (The Nature Index, produced by Springer Nature, ranks universities solely using contributions to research articles published in natural-science and health-science journals.) In many rankings, evaluations of teaching are based on flimsy proxies, such as staff-to-student ratios or the number of alumni with Nobel prizes. Most rankings place little to no weight on open-science practices, societal impacts, outreach or efforts to improve diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nRanking indicators are also weighted in a variety of ways without clear justification. For example, a ranking might allocate a 20% weighting to citations involving faculty members and only 5% to employment outcomes. Rankings are also presented without error bars, even though the data used are imperfect.\n\nEfforts to push back on narrow, publication-dominant forms of assessment have mostly put the onus on universities to change how they evaluate their staff and departments. Many universities have risen to the challenge. Narrative CVs and biosketches — accounts written by researchers that highlight the full range of their contributions — are becoming more common. In European universities, the development of templates to elicit evidence of a broader range of contributions from faculty members, known as Career Assessment Matrices, is expanding.\n\nBut there is a limit to how far institutions can move away from citation- and publication-based assessments, if they continue to be judged on these measures by global university rankings.\n\nStudents use rankings to choose universities.Credit: Getty\n\nIn the past three years, several groups, including the Union of Students in Ireland and the United Nations University think tank, the International Institute for Global Health, have appealed for universities to escape this stranglehold. They have called on institutions to stop supplying data to the rankings, which some, such as the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the University of Zurich, Switzerland, have done. And the groups have asked universities to stop promoting their rank and to reduce how much they consider rankings of someone’s previous institution when making decisions, such as which staff members to recruit. The groups also endorse the More Than Our Rank initiative, which encourages institutions to describe their many achievements, activities and aspirations not captured by the rankings, through a narrative statement on their web pages. (I chair the INORMS Research Evaluation Group, which developed the More Than Our Rank initiative.)\n\nThese are valid recommendations, but asking individual universities to take responsibility will not lead to global reforms in how university performance is defined and assessed. To achieve this, a three-pronged solution is needed.\n\nCall out current rankings\n\nThe higher-education sector should collectively — and vocally — agree that the current rankings are not fit for purpose. It might seem unlikely that institutes currently at the top of the rankings, mostly located in Europe and the United States, would call out a system that benefits them. But geopolitical changes should give pause for thought. Chinese and Indian universities are taking more of the top spots in the rankings than before, with UK, US and Australian institutions in decline. If those currently at the top wait too long to speak out, they might soon find themselves lower down the ranks, with less clout to drive the reforms that would serve all institutions.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\nThe call for change should involve an education campaign aimed at students and policymakers, who rely on rankings for decision-making. This should be led by an independent body that is governed by experts from the international higher-education sector, many of whom have already expressed concern about the harms of global university rankings (see, for example, go.nature.com/4hy1kq9). The goal should be to help consumers of rankings to understand that ‘Which is the best university in the world?’ is not a useful question. ‘Which university might be best for me, given that I care about X and Y?’ is a better question — but one for which current measures are unlikely to provide a good answer.\n\nThe campaign should note that good assessments need to be nuanced and contextualized, and will take time to digest. Just as ‘the best’ researcher cannot be identified by the single number that makes up their h-index, ‘the best’ university cannot be determined by the single number that makes up their rank. This message might not be popular, but it is a crucial one.\n\nGather better data",

          "title": "Could humans live to 150? Why some researchers think we’re on the cusp of a major longevity breakthrough",
          "authors": "James Mitchell Crow",
          "abstract": "Credit: Simon Prades\n\nWill a human ever celebrate a 150th birthday? You bet, says Stephen Austad, a biology of ageing researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Austad is so sure that life expectancy is poised for another rapid rise, he put money down in 2000 that the first person to reach 150 was already alive.\n\nIt’s a fantastical idea, counters Jay Olshansky, a longevity researcher at the University of Illinois Chicago, who took Austad’s bet and foresees a payout for his descendants in 2150.\n\nSo far, the numbers seem to fall in Olshansky’s favour. During the twentieth century, medical advances added 30 years to human life expectancy. Since then, the rise has slowed significantly — as Olshansky was sure it would.\n\nNature Index 2025 Ageing\n\n“In 1990, colleagues and I forecast that the rise in life expectancy will slow, as more people live long enough to be exposed to the immutable force of ageing,” Olshansky says1. When Olshansky revisited this analysis in 2024, he and his co-authors confirmed that life expectancy in the developed world was flatlining2.\n\nThe human body has been pushed about as far as it can go by conventional medicine, Olshansky says. “As long as ageing remains unmodified, you can’t push out the envelope of survival much beyond where we are today.” The only path to further radical human lifespan extension, he concluded, is to slow the ageing process itself.\n\nAustad agrees. “I think we’re very close to being able to do it,” he adds, noting numerous approaches that have shown promise in animals and, increasingly, in people.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, given their wager, Olshansky also sees great potential in this work. “I’m very optimistic that we will be able to slow down the biological process of ageing,” he says. “I think it will happen in our lifetime.” On how much this might impact lifespan, Olshansky and Austad differ, although both agree that such considerations are a distraction. Ultimately, the point is not how long we live, but how well we live.\n\nYoung of heart\n\nLiving longer is a secondary goal of geroscience, a fast-growing field focused on uncovering the biological changes that make our cells, tissues and organs more prone to conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders as we age. Targeting individual diseases might extend lifespan, but it no longer guarantees a longer ‘healthspan’ — years lived fit and well, Austad says. For instance, age-adjusted deaths from heart disease have fallen by one-third since 2000, but people who don’t die from it typically never fully recover, compromising their quality of life and burdening health-care systems.\n\n“The fear is, if we continue with the disease model, we’re going to live longer and longer in the ‘red zone’ — with frailty and disability,” Olshansky says.\n\nGeroscience resets age-related disease management by targeting the biggest risk factor for their onset: ageing itself. One line of research has been to study centenarians who have remained naturally fit and healthy far beyond average life expectancy. “As a clinician, I was always intrigued by individuals who are very old and functioning very well” and finding out “what stimulates the longevity and healthspan in these individuals”, says Andrea Maier, a healthy-ageing researcher at the National University of Singapore.\n\nOther leads have come from the observation, first made in rodents a century ago, that animals fed a heavily calorie-restricted diet live longer. “In mice, it works, it slows down ageing,” says Zahida Sultanova, a postdoc at the University of East Anglia, UK, who studies factors that affect ageing. Studying how cellular processes changed in these long-lived animals has delivered many insights into ageing.\n\nSeveral processes identified in calorie-restricted animals have also shown up in healthy human centenarians. One such mechanism, identified by biology of ageing researcher, Leonard Guarente, and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, pointed to the importance of a set of genes and associated proteins called sirtuins3. Many organisms are now known to possess them. “If you make them more active, you extend the lifespan,” Guarente says. Some centenarians also carry extra-active sirtuins. Sirtuins were found to play a role in DNA maintenance and repair, but they rely on a molecule called NAD+, which naturally declines with age. In ageing mice, dietary supplements that increase cellular NAD+ levels can boost sirtuin activity and extend healthspan and lifespan.\n\nGuarente has spun off a company from his research to test this concept in people. “You can’t realistically run a clinical trial to determine how long humans live, because you’d have to wait 50 years for the result. So, we look at surrogate markers of health,” Guarente says. So far, in early-stage trials, boosting NAD+ has safely lowered markers of inflammation thought to be at the core of conditions including non-alcoholic fatty liver syndrome4 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease5.\n\nDousing inflammation\n\nChronic inflammation is so closely associated with ageing that it has been dubbed ‘inflammageing’. This over-activation of the immune system involves a complex interplay of signalling molecules called cytokines, some promoting inflammation and some suppressing it.\n\nCytokine interleukin-11 (IL-11) was long thought to be anti-inflammatory until, in 2017, Stuart Cook from Duke-National University of Singapore Medical School and his colleagues showed the opposite was correct6.\n\n“We found that IL-11 was involved in multiple ageing processes,” says Cook, a clinician scientist researching new biomedical targets for healthspan. Following a chance observation that IL-11 levels were increased in the organs of old rats, they investigated further. In a mouse study7 published in 2024, the team showed that treating the animals with an antibody that binds IL-11 and blocks its effects extended lifespan by up to 25%. “The benefits of anti-IL-11 were apparent in every organ we looked at,” says Cook, who suspects IL-11 is an evolutionary appendage that once played a role in limb regeneration in ancient fish but has no beneficial function in humans.\n\nClinical trials of IL-11-inhibitors have already begun. In June 2025, Alphabet-owned Calico Life Sciences struck a licensing deal for one such IL-11 blocker, developed by Chinese biotech firm Mabwell, based in Shanghai. Some of the big companies collaborating with Calico — including US pharma company AbbVie — should enable large-scale clinical trials to test IL-11 inhibition in people, Cook says. “Then we will know once and for all if anti-IL-11 is an anti-ageing drug for humans.”\n\nCleaner living\n\nOf course, there’s no guarantee that any potential anti-ageing medicine that generates results in mouse studies will succeed in human clinical trials. In the anti-ageing field, a group of drugs called senolytics have not, so far, fulfilled their preclinical promise.\n\nSenolytics are designed to clean out dysfunctional ‘senescent’ cells, which accumulate in many tissues and cause inflammation, prompting the hypothesis that such cells could be a fundamental driver of ageing. Following animal studies looking at the potential healthspan and lifespan benefits of senolytics, multiple clinical trials have been launched in the past five years — but so far, have failed to show the anticipated benefits in people, Austad says. “Senolytics went from the laboratory to clinical trials extremely fast — we’ll see if they fall out of favour just as fast,” he says.\n\nFor Austad, one reason for the poor success rate in translating animal-study successes into human findings is the way animal studies are conducted. Lab animals are cosseted, kept continually warm, well-fed and protected from pathogens. “This artificial situation has completely misled us about how treatments are going to translate into the real world,” says Austad, who is testing anti-ageing interventions in mice kept under a range of conditions to better approximate real life. “Treatments that work under all those conditions are the things that we should be most interested in,” he says.\n\nReuse and recycle\n\nSeveral anti-ageing approaches repurpose existing drugs, rather than looking for new ones. Two have been examined for their ability to mimic the metabolic effects of calorie restriction. One is the widely prescribed blood-glucose-lowering diabetes drug, metformin. Another is rapamycin, an immunosuppressant that inhibits a cellular nutrient sensor controlling cell growth and repair. Blocking this receptor can mimic caloric restriction by tricking the body into thinking food is scarce, Sultanova says. “You eat normally but hide it from yourself.”\n\nIn 2024, Sultanova and her colleagues released a meta-analysis of 167 animal studies8, looking at the lifespan impacts of rapamycin and metformin compared with actual caloric restriction. The analysis found that caloric restriction gave the largest and most consistent lifespan extension, closely followed by rapamycin. Metformin showed no clear benefit.\n\nSource: World Health Organization",

          "abstract": "Carbon emissions are continuing to increase each year and are projected to rise by 1.1% by the end of 2025.Credit: Hendrik Schmidt/dpa via Alamy\n\nGlobal fossil-fuel emissions are likely to hit yet another record high this year, scientists announced today at the COP30 UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, but there are signs that the world is approaching a peak. Indeed, some researchers argue that carbon dioxide emissions might have already begun to decline, and many think that overall greenhouse-gas emissions (including methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases) could begin to decline by the end of the decade.\n\nEmissions from the burning of fossil fuels and cement production are projected to rise by 1.1%, to 38.1 billion tonnes of CO2 this year, according to data published on 13 November by the Global Carbon Project, an international consortium of researchers who track carbon emissions.\n\nOverall carbon emissions could decline slightly if a projected drop in deforestation and other land-use changes is factored in, but researchers warn that it’s still too early to say that the world has turned a corner on its fossil-fuel addiction (see ‘When will carbon emissions peak?’).\n\n“We don’t [project] the global inflection point until around 2030, unfortunately, but it does look like emissions are flattening off,” says Bill Hare, a physicist who is head of Climate Analytics, a non-profit consultancy in Berlin that analyses the impact of global climate policies.\n\nThe China factor\n\nAs things stand, greenhouse-gas emissions are around 10% higher than a decade ago, when the Paris climate agreement was signed, and a far cry from what is needed to limit warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, as called for under the agreement.\n\nEmissions among the major industrialized countries, which are responsible for the bulk of historical emissions, have been falling for more than two decades (see ‘Which regions emit the most greenhouse gases?’).\n\nHowever, they are rising nearly everywhere else. Although much of the focus tends to fall on rapidly developing juggernauts such as India and China, the emissions growth is widespread as low- and middle-income countries seek to grow their economies and fulfil energy demands.\n\nBy far the biggest driver over the past two decades has been China, which now accounts for nearly one-third of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. The main culprit is the country’s vast and still-growing fleet of coal-fired power plants, which burnt nearly 2.3 billion tonnes of coal last year, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nThere are signs of change, however, with China now leading the global clean-energy sector. The country is rapidly turning to electric vehicles as well as wind and solar energy and has committed to reducing its overall greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 7% from peak levels by 2035. When China’s emissions peak, so, too, will global emissions, predicts Hare.\n\nHave China’s emissions already peaked?\n\nOthers argue that China’s carbon emissions have already begun to decline. Data from Carbon Monitor, a frequently updated data set that began tracking daily carbon emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that China’s carbon emissions peaked in 2024 and will fall by 1.2% this year. Researchers at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a think tank based in Helsinki, have also documented a downward trend.\n\nAlthough the expansion of electric vehicles and renewable energy is having an impact, the biggest factor in the current decline is the collapse of the Chinese real-estate market, which has resulted in less demand for cement and steel, says Zhu Liu, an Earth-systems scientist at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nEarth shattered heat records in 2023 and 2024: is global warming speeding up?\n\nGiven current energy and economic trends, as well as China’s climate goals, Liu says, emissions of CO2, at least, are likely to continue to decline. “I would say this is the peak of China’s carbon emissions,” Liu says.\n\nIf that’s the case, the question is whether emissions of other greenhouse gases will follow.",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi, Benjamin Thompson",
          "abstract": "Bengio has pivoted his research to explore the risks posed by AI.Credit: Joel Saget/AFP via Getty\n\nYoshua Bengio is a computer scientist at the University of Montreal in Canada. In 2019, he won an A. M. Turing Award — considered the most prestigious honour in computer science — for pioneering the ‘deep learning’ techniques that are now making artificial intelligence (AI) ubiquitous. Last month, he also became the first person to top one million citations on Google Scholar.\n\nBengio has since turned his focus to exploring the risks posed by AI. He chairs an international panel of advisors in this field, which includes representatives from 30 countries, the European Union, the OECD and the United Nations. The group issued the International scientific report on the safety of advanced AI earlier this year.\n\nNature met with Bengio in London to talk about the potential and pitfalls of the technology he helped to invent. The following is an edited version of the conversation.\n\nAmong the many papers that you’ve written, are there any that you’re particularly proud of?\n\nThe string of papers that I co-authored on language modelling and attention — that started in the late ‘90s — on how we could introduce attention mechanisms in neural nets to make them more ‘system 2’, meaning more deliberate, and not just intuition machines.\n\nIs that the attention technique at the heart of a 2017 paper1 from Google researchers that introduced transformers — the technique that became the ‘T’ in ChatGPT?\n\nYes, but I would mention also another paper, which doesn’t get nearly as much attention — and that's the work on curriculum learning2, in which a machine is trained by feeding it data in a particular order rather than at random. It has become the standard way of doing things. The inspiration for me was learning in animals.\n\nThe existential risk posed by uncontrollable AI was not at the top of your worries until a few years ago. What has changed?\n\nWhen ChatGPT came out, in November 2022. It took me two or three months to realize we were on a path that could be extremely dangerous. And although I was initially pleased to see that deep learning had finally reached that milestone, I realized that because of the nature of these systems, we didn't know how to make sure they would behave in the ways that we want.\n\nI started thinking about my grandchild, and I thought, in 20 years, he’s going to be 22; will he have a life? Will he live in a democracy?\n\n‘Godfather of AI’ becomes first person to hit one million citations\n\nWhoever will control very advanced AIs in the future will have huge power. And they could use that power in ways that are good for them, maybe, but not for most of us. Democracy is about sharing power. If the power is concentrated in the hands of a few, that is not democracy — that is a dictatorship.\n\nBut there are other existential risks due to the power of AI in the wrong hands. There are people who, for ideological or mental health reasons, would press the red button — ask an AI to do something terrible that could cause the death of billions of people, like unleashing a new kind of extremely potent virus, or even mirror bacteria that could kill all animal life on this planet.\n\nThe International AI Safety Report identified three main areas of risk: unintended risk from malfunctions; malicious use; and systemic risk, such as loss of livelihoods. Which one is most likely to have a big impact in the short term? And which concerns you the most?\n\nMalicious use is already happening, but I think we're only seeing just the shades of it, with things like deepfakes and cyberattacks that are very likely to be driven by the most recent cyber capabilities of AI. We need to have much better guardrails to mitigate those risks. Those guardrails have to be both technical and political, meaning regulation or other kinds of incentives to make sure companies will do the right thing to avoid or mitigate those risks.\n\nWhat keeps me even more awake at night, of course, is the possibility of human extinction. That's why I pivoted my research to the question: How do we build AI that will not harm humans by design? And I now think that it is possible to do it. So it’s a big progress in my mind. I’m much more optimistic about this.\n\nIn this realm, you and your team have proposed the idea of the ‘Scientist AI’ with safety built in from the start. Tell us about that.\n\nThe way it’s designed is very much inspired by how human scientists go about understanding the world, and building models of the causal mechanisms and the laws of the world.\n\nThe Scientist AI is non-agentic. In other words, it has no goal, it has no intention. So, we can trust what it says. We can build systems that have the kind of ideal trustworthiness if we follow that path.\n\nNow, companies want to build agents — AIs that do things in the world, and actually scientists want to build AIs that help them design experiments, which is something you do in the world. You’re not just passively making predictions. The good news is that if you have good predictors, you can use them to construct guardrails, like predict whether an experiment or the action of an AI in a computer could give rise to bad outcomes and with what probability.\n\nHow was the International AI Safety Report received? Has it begun to have an impact on what governments do about AI?\n\nIt has. I’m really excited to see how much impact it's already having. What it has done is establish rigorously based on the scientific literature: what are the risks that we already understand? It also establishes what are the current mitigation approaches, and their limitations.\n\nHow AI agents will change research: a scientist’s guide",

          "title": "On the move: why PhD students study abroad in 2025",
          "authors": "Linda Nordling",
          "abstract": "When Calvin Santiago Lee decided to look beyond his home in the United States for a PhD position, finances played a decisive part. “I believed that unless I got extremely lucky in the US, there would be little chance of being financially stable during my PhD and having good career prospects thereafter,” says the theoretical computer scientist.\n\nThe global PhD landscape 2025\n\nHis current position working on category theory — a mathematical field related to programming languages and logic — at Reykjavik University in Iceland pays well and provides good work–life balance. “I feel like a valued member of society and can live a comfortable life while pursuing a PhD. I believe that even at top US institutions, this would not be a guarantee.”\n\nLee’s move captures a sentiment shared by many young researchers. When Nature surveyed nearly 3,800 PhD students worldwide in May and June, about one-third were based outside their country of origin (see ‘Mobility of PhD students studying abroad’). Among the 1,232 respondents studying abroad, the most common reason for their move — cited by 43% — was “a lack of funding at home”.\n\nThat proportion is on a par with Nature’s two previous PhD surveys in 2019 and 2022, when around 45% of those earning a PhD abroad said finances had played a key part in their move. However, in both of those surveys, it was not the top reason. Instead, that was “to experience another culture”, chosen by roughly half of respondents (49% in 2022 and 46% in 2019). But this year, only 35% selected that option. (Note that some options have changed from previous surveys, which might have influenced respondents’ selections.)\n\nOther motivations for studying abroad that have seen a drop include “more job opportunities post-study” (from 42% in 2019 to 35% in 2025) and “a lack of, or low quality, programmes at home” (40% in 2019 to 28% in 2025). Altogether, this suggests that students are making more-pragmatic decisions, guided by financial and career considerations rather than by personal exploration.\n\nThe numbers make sense, says Chris Glass at Boston College in Massachusetts, who researches trends in higher education. He says that shifting visa rules, uncertain post-study work permissions and geopolitical turbulence have “changed the calculus” for prospective PhD students globally. “International doctoral talent today demands tangible economic and scientific returns — not just the promise of experiencing another culture,” he adds.\n\nGlass says that students are increasingly asking: “Will I be able to stay and build a research career? Are my skills marketable in the host country — and globally?” He thinks that it’s both an adaptive response to policy headwinds and a sign that students are optimizing their choices for impact and opportunity in a world in which “uncertainty is the norm”.\n\nPolitical push\n\nPolitics is a minor motivation for moving abroad. Overall, just 7% of respondents say that political reasons influenced their decision, a share that has changed little since Nature asked the question in 2017.\n\nHow money, politics and technology are redefining the PhD experience\n\nBut among some nationalities, notably Russians and Americans, the proportion is higher. More than half (56%) of the 16 respondents from Russia studying abroad cited politics as a factor, as did nearly one-quarter (24%) of 46 students from the United States. By comparison, just 4% of respondents from India and 7% of those from China who were studying abroad said the same.\n\nUS students living and studying abroad said that repressive politics and the current presidential administration’s attitudes towards science and research were key reasons for their choice. Asked to elaborate on her reason for leaving, one woman studying in Switzerland simply wrote: “Trump…”\n\nTensions at home are also thwarting US students’ desire to move back after their PhDs. “I had planned to strongly consider returning to the United States but now those plans are, at a minimum, on hold,” says one in Australia, who requested anonymity out of fear of career repercussions. He says he has “little interest in returning to what amounts to a totalitarian regime” where people like him — a Jewish liberal in a polyamorous relationship — are “effectively targeted for maltreatment, harassment and potentially worse”.\n\nHe says that most of his friends who are early-career researchers back in the United States either have escape plans or are developing them. Australia is great, he says, because it’s more tolerant than the United States, and the physical infrastructure of roads and buildings “isn’t crumbling, like at home”. It’s also much safer. He used to keep his ‘stop the bleed’ kit clipped to his bag for instant access in case of a mass shooting. “Now, it’s just tucked in the bottom of my backpack.”\n\nRussian PhD student Daniil Kiselev studies in France, where he connects with the culture, including this eighteenth-century self-portrait of French painter Joseph Ducreux.Credit: Daniil Kiselev\n\nDaniil Kiselev, a PhD student originally from Russia, now at the University of Montpellier in France, left his home country in 2021. At the time, Russia had occupied Crimea, but the full-blown invasion of Ukraine had yet to happen. “Back then, options remained relatively rich. The path to work abroad was demanding, but straight and offered some visibility,” he says.",

          "abstract": "Inside a laboratory at AstraZeneca, which is currently Britain’s most valuable company. Credit: Peter Byrne/PA via Alamy\n\nThe UK government says it wants to make Britain one of the top three places in the world to create, invest in and scale-up a fast-growing technology business. Launching the country’s industrial strategy earlier this year, ministers set themselves an ambitious target: to produce a domestic trillion-dollar company by 2035.\n\nPharmaceutical giants pull out of UK: why it matters for global science\n\nLast week, a report from a House of Lords committee poured cold water on the idea, arguing that the UK science-and-technology sector is, in fact, “bleeding to death”. The report warned that once a technology company reaches a certain level of success it’s likely to move to the United States. And with it would go the associated prosperity, including jobs and tax revenue.\n\nSo, can British science really produce a trillion-dollar technology company? And is such a goal even a good idea?\n\nNot everybody thinks so. “It’s a really silly target,” says Giles Wilkes, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government think tank who was a special adviser on industrial and economic policy to Theresa May when she was prime minister. “But it absolutely bewitches politicians.”\n\nIt is possible, however, he adds. The chances of such a UK corporate giant emerging within 20 years are about one in four, he says. “You never know, there might be some version of an obesity drug or something that can do it.”\n\nSize isn’t everything\n\nMeasured as market capitalization — the combined value of all traded shares — a trillion-dollar company would be almost four times the size of pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, Britain’s current biggest firm. Companies that reach the trillion-dollar mark often do so by exploiting a monopoly position in a large domestic market, Wilkes says.\n\n“That’s of dubious use to the whole economy. Companies that have gone from half a trillion dollars to three or four trillion dollars have not generated widespread prosperity,” he says. “It’s not the same as economic growth.”\n\nAndy Westwood, a public-policy researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, agrees. “It’s an odd way to express a strategic objective, because you could have a very successful industrial policy and not achieve that,” he says. But he thinks that more broadly, the government’s ten-year industrial strategy is good, and that having one is a good move for the United Kingdom. “The idea has gone in and out of fashion, not just in the UK but across lots of different countries.”\n\nGive UK science the overhaul it urgently needs\n\nThe government hopes that the industrial strategy will put the pieces in place to encourage the growth of a mega-company. It focuses on ways to encourage innovative research, help academics to commercialize discoveries, and put in place the financial support to allow rapid expansion. As a starting point, it seeks to support research and development in sectors including advanced manufacturing, clean-energy industries, defence, digital and technology businesses and the life sciences. That support comes in three main forms: funding, government procurement and changes to regulation.\n\nIt’s hard to predict whether such actions will produce anything approaching a trillion-dollar company, Westwood adds. Industrial strategies work on a very broad front, from improvements in infrastructure to targeted grants, making it impossible to know which measures are the most effective. And competing priorities can sometimes impede progress. The best such a policy can do is create what look like the most favourable conditions for successful businesses to thrive.",

The goal sounds almost utopian: by 2050, Brazil aims to double income per capita, slash emissions of every greenhouse gas to attain ‘net zero’, and distribute wealth more fairly to achieve a 20% reduction in the Gini index — a metric that reflects income inequality.\n\nThere has already been substantial progress. For example, deforestation has substantially decreased since the start of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s latest term in 2023, and is now at its lowest rate for 11 years (see go.nature.com/442bqtp). As a member of the team in charge of the Ecological Transformation Plan at Brazil’s Ministry of Finance, I hope that our early successes will encourage other nations to proceed in a similar direction.\n\nFor real climate action, empower women\n\nTwo initiatives, in particular, could fundamentally reshape global climate finance — the funding systems that support climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. The first is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), a fund ran by participating nations, with support from the World Bank, to help low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to preserve their tropical forests. The fund aims to reach US$125 billion in the coming years. An initial investment of $25 billion should come from nations and philanthropic organizations. Brazil has pledged to invest the first $1 billion, and other countries, including Norway, Indonesia, France and Germany, have announced substantial contributions. Another $100 billion is expected to come from capital markets, through the issuing of bonds that pay interest at the market rate.\n\nThe fund is made up of investments rather than donations — the distinction matters. Experience shows that aid flows are volatile and are subject to political winds and fiscal constraints in donor countries. The TFFF breaks this cycle. Here’s how it works: sponsors invest in the fund and receive annual returns that are comparable with those from low-risk sovereign bonds, at, say, 4%. The fund deploys this capital in a diversified portfolio of fixed-income assets, mainly bonds from emerging markets, with an expected yield of 7–8% (historically, a representative portfolio of diversified emerging-market bonds has paid out at around that rate). This portfolio excludes investments that finance fossil fuels or activities linked to deforestation.\n\nWhen mature, this mechanism could generate nearly $4 billion annually for forest conservation — rewarding ecosystem services and paying for anti-deforestation enforcement and capacity-building to foster the bioeconomy, such as biotechnology for pharmaceutical production.\n\nThe ‘implementation COP’: why the Belém summit must ratchet up climate action",

          "abstract": "The road to a first-author paper often isn't short or direct.Credit: Grant Ordelheide/Aurora Photos/Getty\n\nAs a fifth-year PhD candidate, I have a degree in not getting enough sleep and an unhealthy habit of scrolling through LinkedIn. My feed is a relentless highlight of everyone else’s successes: papers, major grants, coveted fellowships. And then there’s me, in a five-year-long, committed relationship with a massive project, in the field of neuroscience.\n\nIt’s not that I haven’t published anything. My name appears on co-authored papers that I’m proud of, collaborations in which I contributed data, analyses and expertise. But my own project was structured as a comprehensive story that kept expanding in scope, rather than as a series of publishable segments. This choice meant a longer road to first authorship compared with some of my peers, who were finishing projects and seeing their work published sooner. However, graduate students know that there’s a different gravity to first authorship. Co-authorship says ‘You were part of the story’, but first authorship says ‘This was your story to tell’.\n\nIt’s treated like the holy grail of the PhD journey, the golden ticket to a good postdoc, the milestone of independence and, in many programmes, the key to graduating. In a mid-sized laboratory such as mine, at Texas A&M University in College Station, landing a high-impact first-author paper isn’t just a personal win — it can be career-defining for the student and is a huge event for the lab. But it can also be a long, long wait.\n\n27 things we wish we’d known when we started our PhDs\n\nMy project began with a simple, elegant question: how does a little-known protein — a receptor that helps neurons to communicate — regulate flexibility in the brain’s learning circuits? The work quickly expanded, demanding new techniques and complex analyses. The results weren’t what we expected — and instead of answers, they led to more questions that had to be tested and untangled. Every new result came with the same question: do we publish a paper now, or do we hold off and build a single, ambitious story? The academic in me understood the power of the big narrative. The graduate student in me desperately wanted something to show for the years of work.\n\nThe tension between the desire to make the project as meaningful as possible and my own professional clock has been one of the hardest lessons of my PhD. Along the way, I’ve discovered three truths that reshaped how I think about progress.\n\nPlaying the long game\n\nThe hardest part of chasing a big paper isn’t the failed experiments or broken equipment. It’s the waiting. Without having something accepted or published, it often felt like my progress didn’t count.\n\nEventually, I realized that if I measured success only by a first-author paper, I’d buckle under the weight of waiting. I had to find other ways to recognize progress.\n\nI started noticing the number of skills I was building up. So, to keep myself honest, I made a simple spreadsheet. Each entry was proof of growth, and within months, I had dozens of examples. Mastering patch-clamp electrophysiology. Learning to run proteomics. Doing analyses that once made my head spin. These weren’t just chores on the road to publication, they were permanent upgrades to how I do science.\n\nWhat makes PhD students happy? Good supervision",

          "title": "Sinking cities: how China is moving subsidence research forward",
          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "As China’s cities become taller, bigger and more modern, they face a major problem: the ground beneath them is sinking. A 2024 study1 found that nearly half of the land under the country’s major cities is subsiding at a “moderate” rate of more than 3 millimetres a year, and 16% is experiencing “rapid” sinking, meaning greater than 10 millimetres annually.\n\nMany of these cities, such as Tianjin, Fuzhou and Ningbo, are located by the sea. The issue of land subsidence is so pressing that the study projected that one in ten residents of the country’s coastal cities will be living below sea level by 2120 if current trends continue.\n\nThe consequences are already showing. In 2023, nearly 4,000 people in Tianjin — a port city of more than 13 million residents — had to be evacuated from high-rise apartment buildings after the streets outside suddenly split apart. Scientists sent to investigate the site believe that the problem was caused by a ‘geological cavity’ some 1,300 metres under the ground, according to the city’s government. They pointed to the drilling of a geothermal well as a possible trigger, which might have caused subterranean water and soil loss, leading the land to give way.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nChina’s plight provides a snapshot of a global crisis. Eight of the world’s ten largest cities are situated on the coast, including Shanghai, New York, India’s Mumbai and Lagos in Nigeria, and all of them are dealing with subsidence. The megacities that are rapidly expanding along Asia’s shores are among the fastest-sinking cities on the planet, according to a 2022 study2.\n\nThe highest subsidence rates have been recorded in Tianjin, Vietnam’s Ho Chi Minh City and Bangladesh’s Chittagong; parts of these cities were found to be subsiding at peak speeds of more than 50 millimetres per year. In North America, subsidence is also widespread. An analysis of 28 major US cities, including coastal cities such as Houston and New York, published this year3 estimated that at least one-fifth of all mapped urban areas are sinking, affecting some 34 million people.\n\nSubsidence is not an issue that any one country can fight on its own. Some Chinese cities, such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, have modelled initiatives based on what’s worked in the Netherlands, for example, one of the lowest-lying countries in the world. Residents and institutions are encouraged by their local government to collect and reuse rainwater, such as by installing ‘green roofs’ covered with vegetation to hold rainwater, and building communal gardens to absorb or slow runoff.\n\nChina is also passing on its knowledge to other developing countries. In 2023, Shenzhen shared its experience of evacuating people from partly subsided buildings with policymakers from Tripoli in Lebanon, through a collaborative effort co-organized by the United Nations Development Programme to help the city better respond to natural disasters.\n\nAccording to Liu Jianxin, a geophysicist at Central South University in Changsha, China, Chinese researchers are increasingly sharing data, writing papers and participating in workshops with international colleagues on the issue of subsidence. And, like Liu, many of them are based in inland cities that are also facing subsidence. “Tackling subsidence is a global effort,” Liu says.\n\nCoastal challenges\n\nCoastal cities are particularly susceptible to sinking because of their natural conditions. For one, they are often built on river deltas or coastal plains, where sediments compact over time, which leads to subsidence, says Ding Xiaoli, a geodesist at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, who measures and monitors Earth’s shape and size. Some coastal cities, such as Tokyo, also sit on earthquake-prone areas, where tectonic activity can contribute to subsidence.\n\nBut the growth of coastal cities itself — nearly one-third of the global population in 2018, or more than 2 billion, lived within 50 kilometres from the shore — is also greatly exacerbating the issue.\n\nSource: Cosby, A. G. et al. Sci. Rep. 14, 22489 (2024)\n\nIn China, the main cause of subsidence linked to human activity is the excessive extraction of groundwater as cities expand, says Zhang Yonghong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping in Beijing. The practice lowers the underground water level, which causes the surrounding soil to compact and the land to sink. “The building of infrastructure, such as subways, can also cause parts of a city to subside,” Zhang says.\n\nDisruption to the natural recharging of groundwater owing to paved urban surfaces can worsen the situation, says Yu Kongjian, a landscape architect at Peking University in Beijing. “Land subsidence is one of the most profound manifestations of ecological mismanagement in urban regions,” he says.\n\nCities are also getting heavier as they grow, says Zhao Qing, a geodesist at East China Normal University in Shanghai. Ongoing research by her team suggests that the increasing weight of buildings is one of the three factors — together with dropping groundwater levels and the nature of the soil — that are causing Shanghai and other cities in the Yangtze River Delta region to subside.\n\nNone of the above is unique to China, and some of these issues — such as groundwater extraction and building weight — often affect cities inland, too. But on the coast, these factors are driving the land downwards in areas that also face accelerated sea-level rise owing to climate change.\n\nThe speed at which sea levels are rising has more than doubled over the past three decades4, increasing from around 2.1 millimetres per year in 1993 to around 4.5 millimetres per year in 2023. By the end of this century, the global average sea level is projected to be up to 0.55 metres higher than the 1995–2014 average, even if the world limits global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.\n\nA 2022 study5 that assessed 99 coastal cities around the world found that most of them saw parts of their land subside faster than the sea level was rising. At their current downward trajectories, they would be challenged by flooding much sooner than the timelines projected by sea-level models, the authors said.\n\nOne of the cities that has been struck by this double whammy is Jakarta, the current capital of Indonesia, an archipelagic country on the frontline of fighting sea-level rise. More than 40% of the city is already below sea level — where risks of flooding, storm surges, infrastructure damage and economic and life losses are particularly high — and by the middle of the century up to 95% of its coastal areas might be submerged. The grim prospect was a major factor in Indonesia deciding to move its capital to a different island by 2028.\n\nSince 2014, Indonesia has been building a 32-kilometre ‘Giant Sea Wall’ in a bid to shield Jakarta from flooding — a project that is expected to cost US$50 billion. But sea walls have shallow foundations, so they follow the movement of the land, says Pietro Teatini, a hydrologist at the University of Padova in Italy, and chair of the UNESCO Land Subsidence International Initiative (LaSII), a working group that aims to spread knowledge on subsidence around the world and help developing countries to better address the issue. “If the land subsides, the wall subsides, too,” he says.\n\nLand and sea\n\nA comparison of five coastal cities and five inland cities in China shows how each group has been pursuing research in areas related to climate change and aquatic life and environments over the past six years. Output is measured by Share — a fractional metric that quantifies cities’ output in the high-quality natural-sciences and health-sciences journals tracked by the Nature Index.\n\nSuccessful measures\n\nShanghai — the first city in China to identify subsidence — also faces the compounding effect of sinking ground and rising sea level. It sank by 1.69 metres from 1921 to 1965 as a result of excessive groundwater pumping. The city’s government has carried out a series of measures to tackle the issue over the past 60 years, mainly by restricting groundwater usage and replenishing groundwater supply using water from the Yangtze River, according to Ye Shujun, a hydrogeologist at Nanjing University in China. Those methods have reduced the speed at which Shanghai is sinking to within 6 millimetres a year, said Ye, who shared the city’s experience at a webinar organized by LaSII in early 2025.\n\nA lot of work has been done in China to address subsidence from scientific and technical points of view, says Teatini. “One of the most important” steps for tackling subsidence is the artificial recharging of groundwater, he says, which has proved effective in Shanghai. But he warns that the method is expensive, so it might be hard to introduce to poorer countries.\n\nTeatini points to the advanced equipment that Chinese cities use, such as extensometers, which measure how materials change under stress. Researchers drill down , sometimes to almost 1,000 metres, to place the devices at the bottom of Earth’s water-bearing layers, known as the aquifer system, to monitor which layers are compacting. “In Italy, we have three or four [extensometers] spread all over the country. In Shanghai, there are about 50,” says Teatini, who works with Chinese researchers regularly.\n\nSome of Teatini’s long-term collaborators come from the Capital Normal University in Beijing, which has forged a formal partnership with the University of Padova. They have teamed up in a series of studies, ranging from assessing the causes of Beijing’s subsidence to developing models for predicting the problem.\n\nTo Teatini, China’s action to reduce land subsidence has been “very, very effective”. One of its achievements comes through the South–North Water Transfer Project, a colossal infrastructure project launched by the government to divert water from the south of the country to the water-stressed north. Although the main goal of the project is to balance water supplies, it has played a crucial role in mitigating long-term subsidence of the North China Plain by reducing the extraction of groundwater. Before the project went into operation in 2014, Beijing, situated in the country’s arid north, had heavily relied on groundwater and suffered severe subsidence of up to 159 millimetres a year as a result.",

          "abstract": "Fair Doses: An Insider’s Story of the Pandemic and the Global Fight for Vaccine Equity Seth Berkley Univ. California Press (2025)\n\nMost people don’t like getting vaccines, much less seeing their children have needles poked into their thighs and arms. But context can change that. Besieged by terrifying outbreaks of paralytic polio and the spectre of iron-lung respirators, many parents were happy to see their children receiving the first polio vaccinations in the 1950s. Similarly, when I got my first COVID-19 vaccine, it instantly relieved the sense of existential dread that I had felt for almost a year as the death toll rose.\n\nThe radical plan for vaccine equity\n\nTraumatic memories from the pandemic are waning for many. But infectious-disease epidemiologist Seth Berkley thinks the prospect of future pandemics means that it is imperative that we do not forget about the powerful impact of the COVID-19 vaccine. In Fair Doses — a fascinating account of the race to distribute the drug around the world — he attempts to provide readers with a ‘booster shot’ to restore public-health awareness.\n\nBerkley is ideally positioned to tell the story. In 2020, he was the chief executive of global-health organization Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gavi, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations and others, co-founded COVAX — a worldwide initiative to access, purchase and deliver billions of doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to those living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The author rightly spends little time on the science of the vaccine or the disease itself. Instead, his aim is to describe the complex and interwoven financial, legal, practical, ethical and political issues involved in securing and equitably distributing vaccines to more than 140 territories.\n\nThese complexities led to a series of challenges for COVAX leaders. As Berkley recalls, “I thought that this time, because of COVAX, we could tackle a pandemic with a meaningful, global commitment to equity. How wrong I was.”\n\nA gargantuan effort\n\nCOVAX’s goal was wildly ambitious, especially given the world’s abject failure to distribute influenza vaccines equitably a decade earlier during the 2009–10 flu pandemic. With those flu vaccines, Berkley notes that LMICs were left “at the back of queue”. As he highlights, the drugs arrived too late to prevent a substantial burden of disease — and in some countries, essentially didn’t arrive at all.\n\nLearn from COVID: Gates’s pandemic prescription\n\nBy contrast, COVAX was, in many ways, a success. By the end of 2021, more than one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses had been distributed, and two billion had been distributed by the end of 2023. More than half (57%) of the population in the world’s 92 lowest-income countries ended up receiving the one or two doses required (depending on the brand of vaccine) for initial protection, as compared with the global average of 67%. Doses supplied by COVAX are estimated to have averted 2.7 million deaths in low-income countries by the end of 2022.\n\nBerkley describes in depth the challenge of raising the billions of dollars needed for the scheme from foundations and governments, which were scrambling to fund their own vaccine programmes. It was this need to attract funds that led COVAX leaders to decide at the outset to invite high-income countries to participate in the initiative.\n\nThe major attraction for wealthy nations was that COVAX negotiated supply contracts with a wide range of vaccine developers. By joining the initiative, these countries could ensure access to the most safe and effective vaccines, rather than being reliant on whichever vaccine developer they could strike a deal with. Although the decision to involve high-income countries was, according to Berkley, “one of the biggest controversies in setting up COVAX”, it proved successful in helping to attract enough funds up front to purchase vaccines for the world.\n\nInitiatives that equitably distribute vaccines during a pandemic can save many lives.Credit: Issam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nOne of the fundamental challenges faced by COVAX leaders when doses started to become available in early 2021 was deciding what equitable distribution would look like. Some countries lacked the infrastructure needed to accept a large number of doses and COVAX didn’t want to send vaccines to countries that couldn’t store or transport them properly. As more doses became available throughout the year, some middle- and higher-income countries that had signed up for COVAX doses managed to procure their own vaccines. That led to a debate about whether they should still be provided with COVAX vaccines that they might not need. Moreover, evidence gradually emerged that many African countries seemed to be less susceptible than elsewhere, on a population-wide basis, to severe COVID-19 disease outcomes. This phenomenon is still not well understood, but it suggested that vaccine needs and demand might be less than previously predicted.\n\nBerkley notes the impossibility of devising a transparent algorithm that can integrate all of these factors and output a fair mechanism for vaccine distribution. Ultimately, and controversially, COVAX leaders decided from the outset that the initiative would aim to meet a blanket 20% of the vaccine needs for each country, regardless of other factors. These targets were based on a prediction of how much vaccine could be produced by the end of 2021 — and were later revised upwards.\n\nThe racial injustice laid bare by COVID must not be forgotten\n\nDespite involving wealthy nations in their initiative, COVAX inevitably ended up directly competing for vaccine supplies with these countries, especially when supplies were initially limited, because wealthy countries could pay higher prices and pay up front. Despite manufacturers’ contractual obligations, COVAX sometimes found their vaccine orders delayed or deprioritized compared with those of other purchasers.\n\nSome countries went from refusing to share any doses with COVAX — despite having secured many more than their populations needed — to offering leftover doses of vaccines that were about to reach their expiration dates. Some earmarked their donations to particular ‘friendly’ countries, regardless of COVAX’s carefully planned distribution programme, and demanded immediate acceptance of their publicly visible, politically sensitive ‘gifts’, regardless of the readiness of countries to receive them.",

Earlier work had found that these specimens’ genomes also resembled that of domestic dogs3. Not long after, in dogs associated with late hunter-gatherers and early farming populations, there was “an explosion” in the variety of dog skull shapes and sizes, says Evin, capturing more than half of the diversity in today’s breeds.\n\n“We often assume that dog diversity emerged since the Victorian period over the last two centuries,” she says “But no — what we found is that from the beginning, there is a huge diversity, much more than what we expected.” Ameen adds that extreme skull shapes such as the flat faces observed in pugs and bulldogs aren’t found in the archaeological record, and must have come later.\n\nThe reason for this early dog diversity is not clear. It could represent early breeding efforts, as humans sought to adapt dogs to the needs of different populations, such as hunting, safety or even companionship, Evin says.\n\nLinked ancestries\n\nThe second Science study suggests that ancient human groups valued the distinctive features of their dogs. The team who carried out the research — which includes several authors in common with the skull study — sequenced the genomes of 17 dogs, found in East Asia and Central Eurasia, from the past 10,000 years, and compared them with previously published genomes from this period.",

Collaborations with Israel and Russia, and between China and the United States, are among those seeing such shifts.\n\nScientific collaborations between Israeli researchers and academics in other countries have declined this year, following the war in Gaza, which began in October 2023 after Hamas attacks on Israel. The analysis, by Science|Business, a network of universities, companies and research and policy organizations, looked at patterns of co-authorship in preprints indexed in the Scopus database.\n\nCountries whose governments have been particularly critical of the Gaza war showed the biggest drops in collaborations with Israel. The percentage of all Israeli preprints that were co-authored with scientists in Spain fell from 9.2% in 2024 to 5.9% this year. Similarly, the proportion of Israeli preprints with South African co-authors declined from 3.4% in 2024 to just 1% this year (see ‘Research collaborations with Israel’).\n\nSource: sciencebusiness.net\n\nSome researchers who spoke to Nature say the data are an early indication that individual academics are boycotting Israeli science because of the war in Gaza. “This is a way of putting pressure on Israel,” says Giacomo Ortona, a nuclear physicist at Italy’s National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Turin. In September, Ortona was involved in a petition calling on CERN — Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland — to suspend cooperation with Israel.\n\nDavid Lehrer, director of the Centre for Applied Environmental Diplomacy at the Arava Institute, in Ketura, Israel, says the boycotts are having an impact on Israeli science. “We have recently encountered European countries such as Spain whose research institutes refuse to work with any Israeli research institute in applying for EU grants,” says Lehrer.\n\nBut Anat Paz, spokesperson for The Association of University Heads in Israel (VERA) says the data do not provide a full picture and that it is “too early to draw a conclusion” regarding the trend of collaborations involving Israeli universities. “We will have a much clearer picture once the complete data for 2025 has been compiled and reviewed early next year,” Paz adds.\n\nTop tips for building and maintaining international collaborations\n\nIn May 2024, VERA published a press release in response to a statement made by the Conference of Rectors of Spanish Universities (CRUE) expressing regret about the situation in Gaza, saying the association wishes to correct misunderstanding which “presupposes the possibility that Israeli academic institutions are not dedicated to peace and to international humanitarian law. [We] too mourn the loss of innocent life in this horrific conflict and want a better future for Palestinians and Israelis both. However, academic boycotts are dangerous and may very well cause more harm than good,” they wrote in the press release.\n\nRussian collaborations\n\nIndications of drop in collaborations between Israel and international research partners is part of a broader geopolitical story. A similar decline in global collaboration was seen with Russia following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nUnlike individual scientists boycotting Israeli research, the decline in partnerships with Russia involves top-down policy statements from governments, most notably in the United States, “to reduce or eliminate scientific work with Russia”, says Caroline Wagner, a science-policy researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus.\n\nAn analysis by Nature in 2023 found research collaborations between Russia and Western institutions had dropped a year into its war on Ukraine. Some funders of these institutions and the Ukrainian government discouraged the co-authoring of papers with Russian researchers. This decline was not seen for China and India, whose collaborations with Russia increased the same year.\n\nA separate analysis published in August this year by VoxUkraine, an independent analytical platform based in Kyiv, found that global publications with Russian co-authors dropped by 26% between 2021 and 2024. These papers were also cited less — with an 89% drop in the number of citations these papers received in 2024 compared to 2021 (see ‘Sharp fall in citations with Russian papers).\n\nThese “formal restrictions” have changed research collaborations with Russia. “Sanctions, funding cuts, brain drain, and tighter state control have deepened the decline since 2022,” says Zhang.\n\nSource: voxUkraine.org\nUS-China collaborations\n\nDeclining rates of collaborations with individual countries such as Russia and Israel are part of a wide-ranging reconfiguration of global academic networks, says Zhang.\n\nPolitical tensions between the China and the United States have also affected collaborations between the two countries. China still remains the top partner of the United States, and Chinese scientists are increasingly leading joint projects with the United Kingdom, United States and Europe, but the number of Chinese research papers with US co-authors dropped by 6.4% between 2017 and 2023.\n\nChina–US research collaborations are in decline — this is bad news for everyone",

          "abstract": "The rules for the 2025 version of the influential Highly Cited Researchers list exclude scientists whose co-authors have engaged in practices such as a tendency to cite their own papers. Credit: Getty\n\nThe creators of an influential list of highly cited researchers have shaken up their methodology this year, taking a swipe at scientists who associate with those linked to possible ethical breaches. The new rules have allowed the field of mathematics to return to the list, after being excluded for the past two years owing to concerns over suspicious citation patterns.\n\nThe Highly Cited Researchers (HCR) list is produced by the multinational data-analytics company Clarivate, which also owns the Web of Science database. The list aims to recognize contemporary researchers with “significant and broad influence”, who are among the authors of papers that are in the top 1% in their field by number of citations. The programme recognizes thousands of individuals each year across 21 natural- and social-science fields and factors into influential rankings of universities.\n\nThousands of highly cited scientists have at least one retraction\n\nThis year, the list was compiled with a new step: exclusion of any papers with an author who had been knocked off the previous year’s HCR list owing to research-integrity issues. This means that anyone who routinely co-authored papers with someone who’d been excluded in the previous year was less likely to be acknowledged than before the change.\n\n“It’s quite a good idea. It’s a big cleaning,” says Lauranne Chaignon, a bibliometrician at PSL University in Paris, who has studied the HCR list1. There is, she adds, a small chance of removing a deserving scientist.\n\nThis year’s list, announced today, recognizes 6,868 people.\n\nGaming the system\n\nStarting around 2016, HCR organizers noticed a rise in suspicious activity in the data used to compile the list, says David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate’s Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). The issue became most pronounced in maths: a few people were publishing large numbers of papers, especially in the field of fractional differential equations. These authors frequently cited each other, causing others to fall off the HCR list. “A lot of these people were not known to us, and they were from institutions sometimes we’d never heard of,” says Pendlebury. “The world-famous mathematicians that we originally were seeing were disappearing.”\n\nMaths is particularly vulnerable to gaming because its metrics are small: mathematicians tend to publish fewer papers with fewer co-authors and citations than do academics in other fields2. “Just a few more citations into the system is quite disruptive,” says Pendlebury. As a result, Clarivate chose to omit the field entirely from the 2023 and 2024 lists.\n\nSimple fix\n\nThe process of constructing the HCR list starts with a ‘long list’ of about 200,000 papers and reviews that are in the top 1% in their field by citation count. The ISI team then whittles this down by removing retracted papers and those with more than 30 authors (on which it’s hard to determine individual contributions), for example.\n\nHundreds of extreme self-citing scientists revealed in new database",

          "title": "Why space exploration needs science leadership now — before it’s too late",
          "authors": "Gioia Rau",
          "abstract": "The past two years have seen a series of milestones in lunar exploration. In February 2024, a commercial lander built by Intuitive Machines in Houston, Texas, did what only superpowers had achieved before: touch down on the Moon and deliver NASA science payloads. Four months later, China’s Chang’e-6 returned the first samples from the far side of the Moon, a site that China plans to build a radio telescope on, in partnership with African nations.\n\nWhy space exploration must not be left to a few powerful nations\n\nThe next few years could be just as momentous. In the United States, President Donald Trump proposed US$7 billion for lunar exploration in 2026. His administration’s 2027 priorities go further, calling for investments that “unlock new mission capabilities, enable discoveries, and achieve exploration goals”, including nuclear power, local-resource use and biotechnology in space (see go.nature.com/4812vla).\n\nIt’s a new era for space exploration, motivated by a mix of geopolitics, potential commerce and discovery. Establishing humans on the Moon, Mars and beyond is no longer just an aspiration: it is driving strategies, markets and missions today.\n\nThe Artemis Accords — a shared set of principles to enhance the governance of civil exploration and use of outer space — had been signed by 59 nations as of October. Yet science is being left behind. Ensuring that space ambitions remain science-driven is essential if exploration is to yield knowledge and innovation.\n\nAs an astrophysicist who has worked across government, academia and philanthropy, here I argue that scientific inquiry must guide and shape this next wave of space exploration; I set out five priorities for action. What happens in the next few years will define our future.\n\nEmbed science in partnerships\n\nIn space, science is the compass that ensures exploration yields lasting value. As a first step, partnerships between academia, government, industry and philanthropy that are focused on space exploration need to be built — with science in the driving seat. These can align around a shared purpose: missions that deliver both knowledge and scientific and technical progress.\n\nEveryone benefits. The record shows that when science leads, it multiplies returns: innovation thrives; economies grow; and national strategies and international partnerships strengthen and drive advances in technologies. For example, Skylab, the first US space station, advanced solar power for human space flight. The Hubble Space Telescope includes modular components that can be replaced or upgraded, demonstrating how modular hardware can enable maintenance in space. The International Space Station is a joint effort between countries including the United States and Russia, demonstrating how scientific partnerships are invaluable for diplomacy.\n\nMany national space agencies, and increasingly private actors working in partnership with them, are planning to establish a sustained human presence on the Moon and chart a path toward Mars (see ‘Window of opportunity’). This Moon-to-Mars era must follow past precedents of scientific diplomacy. It must also ensure that scientific return is a core design principle: shaping missions, payloads and infrastructure from the outset, not as an afterthought. If scientists show up early with clear priorities and mission-ready payloads, industry can integrate them, governments can align policy and philanthropy can bridge funding gaps.\n\nWindow of opportunity\n\nThe next five years will see dozens of spacecraft* head to the Moon and Mars. Each one is a crucial platform for scientific and technological learning, not least because results are hard won — only about 40% of missions have succeeded since 2023.\n\nLaunchNationMission nameMission purposeMission status2023IndiaChandrayaan-3Lunar south-pole lander and roverSuccessful2023RussiaLuna 25Lunar south-pole landerFailed2024ChinaQueqiao-2Relay satellite for far-side commsSuccessful2024ChinaChang’e 6Far-side sample returnSuccessful2024JapanSLIMLunar lander and roversPartial success2024United StatesPeregrine 1Commercial lunar landerFailed2024United StatesIM-1 (Odysseus)Commercial lunar south-pole landerPartial success2025JapanHAKUTO-R Mission 2Commercial lunar lander and roverFailed2025United StatesBlue Ghost 1Commercial lunar lander with NASASuccessful2025United StatesIM-2 (Athena)Commercial lunar lander and roversPartial success2025United StatesESCAPADETo Mars by 2026 to study atmospherePlanned2026ChinaChang’e 7Lunar south pole, orbiter, lander, roverPlanned2026JapanMartian Moons eXploration (MMX)Orbit of Phobos and Deimos and return sample from Phobos to Earth in 2031Planned2026United StatesArtemis IICrewed lunar flybyPlanned2026United StatesBlue Ghost 2Lunar far-side landing with telescopePlanned2026United StatesIM-3Commercial lunar landingPlanned2026United StatesGriffin 1Commercial lunar south-pole landerPlanned2026United StatesBlue Moon Mark 1Lunar lander demonstrationPlanned2026United Statesispace Mission 3Commercial lunar far-side landingPlanned2027IndiaChandrayaan-4Lunar sample return missionPlanned2027RussiaLuna 26Lunar polar orbiterPlanned2027United StatesGateway PPE + HaloLunar orbital station componentsPlanned2027United StatesIM-4Bring technology for later crewed missionsPlanned2027United StatesArtemis IIICrewed landing at south polePlanned2028ChinaChang’e 8Technology demonstration on MoonPlanned2028ChinaTianwen-3Mars sample-return missionPlanned2028India/JapanLUPEXLunar south-pole water-ice explorationPlanned2028United StatesArtemis IVCrewed docking with NASA Gateway lunar space stationPlanned2028United StatesBlue Ghost 3Lunar rover and NASA payloadsPlanned2029United StatesBlue Ghost 4Lunar landing at crater rim with roversPlanned2030ChinaLanyueFirst Chinese astronauts on MoonPlanned2030United StatesArtemis VCrewed lunar landing with Blue Origin landerPlanned2031United StatesArtemis VIDelivery of crew and science module to Gateway and crewed lunar landingPlanned\n\n*This table shows missions with publicly available timelines and is not exhaustive. Source: Analysis by G. Rau.\n\nFor example, NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative exemplifies this new model by procuring delivery services from industry to send science and technology payloads to the Moon more quickly. Yet its commercial timelines and contract structures often lock in technical parameters before science teams can shape key elements such as site access, contamination control and interface standards. If this initiative and other lunar delivery efforts, such as the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Argonaut lander or India’s Chandrayaan missions, are to realize their potential, scientific leadership must move upstream in decision-making: shaping selection of landing sites, contamination-control methods and data policies before contracts are signed.\n\nPhilanthropy can help by financially backing high-risk, high-reward demonstration projects, supporting open-data challenges and creating fellowship programmes that link scientists to commercial payloads. Foundations such as the Breakthrough Initiatives, Washington DC-based Carnegie Science, and Schmidt Sciences and the Simons Foundation, both in New York City, have already catalysed such advances in ground-based astronomy. Similar partnerships must now anchor space exploration in open data, shared tools and talent pipelines.\n\nWhy space foods aren’t just for space\n\nIndustry, too, stands to gain. When scientific needs drive standards — for example, reducing exhaust-plume pollution to avoid sample contamination, or minimizing electronic noise to enable radio astronomy — the resulting systems are more robust, interoperable and exportable. The first companies to align with such standards will shape the global supply chain for space development.\n\nWhen scientific requirements shape infrastructure, they improve reliability and operability. A lander or relay network built within scientific tolerances will outperform one optimized only for cost or speed. Science thus becomes not a constraint, but a competitive advantage.\n\nPolicy can lock in these incentives. For publicly funded lunar and Mars flights, space agencies should reserve a share of payload mass (perhaps 20% or more) for competitively reviewed science projects and require that data are made open within six months of landing. They should tie award fees to science-readiness metrics, such as low radio noise, not just to delivery. Internationally, agencies should set up a science coordination forum under existing frameworks, such as the Artemis Accords, to align emission standards, relay-satellite pointing and site-protection rules.\n\nRecognize the Moon’s significance\n\nThe Moon is more than a stepping stone to Mars and beyond — it is a destination uniquely suited to conducting research. Unlike Earth, it has no atmosphere, liquid water or plate tectonics to erase its history. Its surface is a natural archive of roughly 4.5 billion years of Solar System evolution: from planetary formation and asteroid bombardment to solar and cosmic radiation preserved in the lunar soil, or regolith.\n\nPolar craters might contain water ice and organics deposited by ancient comets. Such records could reveal where Earth’s volatile compounds, such as water, came from; whether life’s precursors were common; and how habitable environments emerged. The far side of the Moon is the only place in the inner Solar System that is shielded permanently from radio signals from Earth, making it a unique site for probing the distant Universe and searching for signs of extraterrestrial life.\n\nHow to chart a moral future for space exploration\n\nThe lunar surface could host observatories that are impossible to have elsewhere. For example, long-baseline interferometers (devices that combine input from multiple telescopes) operating at visible and ultraviolet wavelengths — ones that would be absorbed by the atmosphere on Earth — could image the surfaces of stars1. By detecting ground vibrations from moonquakes and impacts, seismic arrays might map the Moon’s interior. Networks of reflectors could bounce back laser beams from Earth to test fundamental physics and theories of the Earth–Moon system2.\n\nYet these opportunities are fragile. Rocket exhaust, dust and drilling can contaminate pristine deposits at the lunar poles. Communications satellites orbiting the Moon could spill signals that erase the far side’s radio silence. If scientists simply wait their turn, these crucial sites will be disturbed permanently by others.\n\nMoreover, what is constructed on the Moon now will define what is built everywhere else in space. Choices regarding communications, power and mobility infrastructures will shape what science is possible on the lunar surface and beyond, to Mars, asteroids and deep-space orbital platforms.\n\nThe window for action is now: hardware is flying, sites are being chosen and norms are embedded in contracts and operations. Scientists must step up and study the Moon intensely over the next few years, before it’s too late.\n\nFly payloads that are ready now\n\nDespite growing investment in space exploration, many research opportunities remain untapped because instruments are stuck in outdated bureaucratic cycles. NASA’s science budget is expected to face drastic cuts in 2026 and 2027, as federal funds are shifted towards human exploration. Many science missions have long time frames, with launches planned for decades from now, a far cry from the fast and furious approach of the commercial space sector. This cadence gap means that valuable lunar sites could soon be developed without scientific involvement.\n\nThe fix is simple: fly scientific pathfinder payloads now. Iterate fast, learn fast and scale up what works. Announce payload-delivery opportunities on a rolling schedule that is aligned with confirmed flight windows — then scientists can plan and apply on a predictable cadence.\n\nCommercial off-the-shelf parts make it possible to build and fly viable research missions quickly and at a fraction of the cost of bespoke ones. Compact seismometers, neutron spectrometers and radio antennas can hitch rides on commercial landers or piggyback on communication relay satellites. Such projects would complement NASA’s billion-dollar flagship missions and, crucially, ensure that scientists bank essential measurements before lunar environments are irreversibly altered.\n\nPotential projects abound. Radio experiments on the lunar far side and prototype optical or UV interferometers could open the way for future experiments. Lightweight seismic and heat-flow sensors can refresh Apollo-era models of the lunar interior, guide the design of human habitats on the surface and constrain moonquake hazards for future infrastructure. Miniature drills and spectrometers could sample volatile compounds that are frozen at the Moon’s poles, revealing how water and organic molecules were delivered.\n\nThe challenge is coordination. Governments should prioritize ready-to-fly payloads through streamlining of funding channels and speeding up review. An annual budget of at least $1 billion in the United States would match the current pace of commercial international launches. Promising collaboration models include NASA’s Lunar Surface Instrument and Technology Payloads initiative, which selected a dozen instruments in 2024 for short-term delivery, as well as ESA’s Open Space Innovation Platform and Japan’s JAXA small-mission calls.\n\nA $50-million philanthropic programme could deploy a dozen small spacecraft for solar physics and planetary sampling or fund a fine-resolution lunar map. Such investments echo how private foundations once underwrote early radio telescopes and genome sequencing: short-cycle, high-risk and catalytic projects.\n\nAs data volumes from lunar sensors grow, fresh partnerships are pioneering innovative data handling and storage — from relay-based computing on lunar and Martian networks to the first orbital data centres being developed by firms such as Starcloud in Redmond, Washington, among others.\n\nBuild to fit scientific needs\n\nIn space, infrastructure is policy. Choices about how and where we build will determine not only what science is possible, but also who can do it.",

          "abstract": "Apple Chui (left), Hannah Eisler Burnett (centre) and Taukiei Kitara study key issues for coastal communities.Credit: L: CPRO, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Apple Chui), M: Véronëque Ignace (Hannah Eisler Burnett)\n\nThe best asset that a coastal area has in the fight against climate change is its people. Whether they’re building sea walls or coral nurseries, or helping to create rich records of flooding events and cultural artefacts, coastal locals are shoring up their neighbourhoods. Scientists Taukiei Kitara from Tuvalu, Hannah Eisler Burnett from New York City and Apple Chui from Hong Kong are working to ensure that the people dealing with coastal challenges have the advocacy, training and protection they need.\n\nTAUKIEI KITARA: Island advocate\n\nSea levels in the Pacific are predicted to rise by 15 cm or more by the 2050s, regardless of global carbon-emission reductions. When this happens, parts of Tuvalu — a group of nine main islands midway between Hawaii and Australia — will vanish forever. “It’s going to be a significant loss for our people,” says Taukiei Kitara, who was born on Nui, a Tuvaluan atoll. Now based at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, Kitara studies how climate change is impacting the culture, identity and sovereignty of small island states in the Pacific.\n\nNature Index 2025 Science cities\n\nThe effect on Tuvalu, which has an average elevation of less than 2 metres above sea level, is severe. Increasingly warmer waters have bleached corals and forced fishermen farther out to sea. Seawater has seeped into the water table, forcing Tuvaluans to grow swamp taro and other staple crops in raised garden beds rather than underground pits — a practice that dates back thousands of years. Rising sea levels are also eroding the coastlines. Kitara says that after his birth, half of his umbilical cord was buried under a newly planted coconut tree some 30 or 40 metres away from the ocean’s edge, as per Tuvaluan tradition. “Now it’s right on the coastline,” he says.\n\nMoving is an option for some Tuvaluans. Australia offers visas for 280 Tuvaluans each year to migrate and obtain permanent residency under the 2023 Falepili Union Treaty — a first-of-its-kind ‘climate visa’ designed to aid climate-induced migration. More than 3,000 Tuvaluans (almost one-third of the nation’s population) have entered a ballot for the first release of visas. But many Tuvaluans aren’t keen on becoming climate refugees, says Kitara, whose research explores the potential impacts of the treaty.\n\nIn a 2023 opinion piece1, Kitara and Carol Farbotko, also from Griffith University, argued that migrants from climate-vulnerable Pacific nations are often framed in Australia as both ‘unskilled labour’ and ‘climate migrants’, which reinforces harmful stereotypes and puts them at risk of workplace exploitation. Kitara and Farbotko called for more just and compassionate labour and climate-migration policies inspired by the Tuvaluan value of fale pili — caring for others like family.\n\nThose who have chosen to stay on Tuvalu are not giving up. The Tuvaluan government wants to bolster the country’s climate resiliency by “focusing on adaptation projects like land reclamation and raising the elevation of existing land”, says Kitara. Between 2017 and 2023, Tuvalu’s capital Funafuti was expanded by 5%, or 7.8 hectares, by dredging up sand from its lagoon. Sea walls were constructed on the outer islands of Nanumaga and Nanumea to protect some 2,780 metres of coastline from rising sea levels and storm surges.\n\nThe narrowest part of Funafuti island, Tuvalu.Credit: Kalolaine Fainu/Guardian/eyevine\n\nTuvalu is also seeking refuge in a more unusual place: the metaverse. Since 2023, efforts have been under way to create a ‘digital twin’ of the island nation — a virtual reconstruction that includes details such as the locations of shops, houses and trees, as well as records of cultural artefacts, including recipes, dances, stories and memories. The project, which is being run by the Tuvaluan government in partnership with agencies in Australia, the United States and New Caledonia, started with Te Afualiku, Tuvalu’s smallest and most vulnerable island2. Te Afualiku features the most detailed reconstruction, but all nine main islands of Tuvalu, plus its dozens of smaller islands and islets, have now been mapped in three dimensions, and Funafuti has been digitally recreated using drone and street-level imagery.\n\nKitara says there are some concerns around data security and how energy-expensive the exercise is, but “there are good incentives” behind the initiative. “In the worst-case scenario, if every island disappeared, they’ll still exist digitally”, which will help to preserve national identity, culture, government functions, sovereignty and maritime rights, he says. As part of the project, Tuvalu received its first undersea cable, which will boost Internet and mobile connectivity for its residents once completed later this year.\n\nTuvaluans are “pretty vocal” about the need for climate action, Kitara says. But the impacts won’t stop at Tuvalu’s shores. “We’re all in the same boat,” says Kitara. “If we address the issue, it’s a win for us Tuvaluans, but also a win for everyone.” — Sandy Ong\n\nHANNAH EISLER BURNETT: Flood watcher\n\nHannah Eisler Burnett knows first-hand the stresses of living in a flood-prone location. Having grown up on the Gulf coast of Mississippi in the southern United States, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Burnett has dedicated her career to helping coastal communities build resilience to flooding caused by high tides, storm surges and groundwater inundation.\n\n“Flood resilience comes from a variety of sources” beyond raising roads or elevating houses and flood-proofing basements, says Burnett. Behavioural changes such as organizing one’s neighbours to help clear a storm drain before a heavy rain event and building makeshift elevated paths through flood-prone areas are also important.\n\n“In several of the communities I work with, one or two people are central for communicating ahead of potential flooding through e-mail, Whatsapp or Facebook groups, helping people understand what the local impacts of a high-tide flood or heavy rain might be,” says Burnett, an anthropologist at New York Sea Grant, an initiative run by the State University of New York and Cornell University. The programme is one of 34 government–university partnerships that link coastal research with community needs in the United States.\n\nNew York City, where Burnett now lives, is also vulnerable to flooding. Climate change is driving more frequent and intense hurricanes in the Atlantic, which is increasing the risk of major storm-driven flooding in the city. The water that flanks it has risen about 30 cm since 1900 — a rate twice the global average — and is projected to rise by just under 200 cm by 2100. Researchers have estimated that storm-driven flooding events could become up to four times more common along the US east coast, which puts 2.2 million New Yorkers in low-lying neighbourhoods such as Queens and southern Brooklyn at risk.\n\nA core part of Burnett’s work involves building and maintaining a public database of flood photos called MyCoast for the Community Flood Watch Project, run by Sea Grant and the Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay in Brooklyn. The pictures, which are taken by members of the public across New York state, are used by the US National Weather Service to inform its messaging to local flood-management officials.\n\n“The photos from MyCoast helped them understand that tidal/coastal flooding is more widespread than previously thought,” says Burnett. She adds that the database also provided “a big impetus” for policymakers in New York City to install 500 flood sensors across all five of the city’s boroughs in 2022, after realizing their value in early flood prediction.\n\nAn image of a flooded street in Howard Beach, New York, submitted in 2024 to the MyCoast website, a tool for reporting coastal events such as storms and floods in selected US states.Credit: Theresa Miller/MyCoast\n\nLast year, Burnett helped launch the Jamaica Bay Community Flood Fellowship Program, which provides a platform for leaders from different neighbourhoods in and around Jamaica Bay — a large coastal estuary on the southern edge of Brooklyn and Queens — to collaborate on solutions to chronic flooding. She also helps to familiarize community members with resources such as tide tables, which display the predicted times and heights of tides at specific coastal locations.\n\nBurnett says it can be hard to convince some decision-makers that local insights — such as photos and interviews — are important in flood prediction. “A sensor can measure one thing, but a flood is something that’s happening in multiple dimensions,” she says.\n\nAt the same time, she praises how “innovative and clear-eyed” many residents, researchers and government agencies are when it comes to coastal resilience work. “New York City is a city of immigrants, who bring knowledge of flooding from many parts of the world and apply that knowledge in different ways,” says Burnett.

The majority of these concern word order and hierarchical universals: two types that have featured prominently in earlier work. Evolutionary analyses show that languages tend to change in ways that converge on these preferred patterns. This suggests that, despite the vast design space of possible grammars, languages do not evolve entirely at random. Shared cognitive and communicative pressures repeatedly push languages towards similar solutions.",

          "abstract": "Historical efforts to deinstitutionalize those experiencing mental illness in the USA have inadvertently positioned police officers as the typical first responders to emergency calls involving mental health crises and empower them to initiate involuntary psychiatric detentions. Although potentially lifesaving, such detentions are controversial and costly, and they may be medically inappropriate for some of those detained. Here we present evidence from two quasi-experimental designs on the causal effects of a ‘co-responder’ programme that pairs mental health professionals with police officers as first responders on qualified emergency calls. The results indicate that a co-responder programme reduced the frequency of involuntary psychiatric detentions by 16.5% (that is, 370 fewer detentions over 2 years; b = −0.180, 95% confidence interval −0.325 to −0.034) but had no detectable effect on programme-related calls for service, criminal offences or arrests. Complementary results based on incident-level data suggest this reduction reflects both a co-responder’s influence on the disposition of an individual incident and a reduction in future mental health emergencies.",

          "abstract": "Computational modelling is a powerful tool for uncovering hidden processes in observed data, yet it faces underappreciated challenges. Among these, determining appropriate sample sizes for computational studies remains a critical but overlooked issue, particularly for model selection analyses. Here we introduce a power analysis framework for Bayesian model selection, a method widely used to choose the best model among alternatives. Our framework reveals that while power increases with sample size, it decreases as more models are considered. Using this framework, we empirically demonstrate that psychology and human neuroscience studies often suffer from low statistical power in model selection. A total of 41 of 52 studies reviewed had less than 80% probability of correctly identifying the true model. The field also heavily relies on fixed effects model selection, which we demonstrate has serious statistical issues, including high false positive rates and pronounced sensitivity to outliers.",

          "abstract": "There is growing interest in how and why individuals adjust their goals in response to difficulties encountered during goal striving and the outcomes of such adjustments; however, research on these topics is fragmented across theoretical perspectives and life domains. To address this issue, we conducted a systematic search of databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, Business Source Ultimate, Proquest Dissertations and Theses Global, Medline; last updated May 2025) of empirical studies examining antecedents or outcomes of goal adjustment. Studies were eligible if they examined predictors or wellbeing/functional/goal-related outcomes of goal disengagement, goal reengagement, or goal-striving flexibility. We identified 1,421 effect sizes from 235 studies, which we categorized and mapped onto a conceptual model. Further, we used random-effects meta-analyses to examine the strength and direction of associations between model categories and goal adjustment variables. Despite relatively high-quality ratings (assessed using QualSyst), the overall standard of accumulated evidence was determined to be low to moderate due to the reliance on cross-sectional studies, risk of publication bias and high heterogeneity. Nonetheless, we identified associations between multiple antecedent categories and goal disengagement, reengagement and flexibility, as well as associations between these different aspects of goal adjustment and wellbeing, functional and goal-related outcomes. We conclude that different aspects of goal adjustment are predicted by unique combinations of antecedent variables, and predict distinct outcomes. Our conceptual model consolidates the literature on goal adjustment and provides a roadmap for a more systematic investigation of this field going forward.",

          "abstract": "There is an urgent need for targeted, evidence-based interventions to build resilience to misinformation among social media’s most avid users: adolescents. Research on misinformation susceptibility is mostly focused on adults. However, adolescents encounter different types of (mis)information and undergo rapid social, emotional and cognitive changes. These changes can increase vulnerability to misinformation through social influence, emotional manipulation and cognitive biases, while also offering unique opportunities for resilience. Taking a developmental perspective, we outline how adolescents’ susceptibility to misinformation differs from that of adults, propose a research agenda to systematically study these processes and introduce a Bayesian framework of belief updating tailored to social media contexts. Finally, we highlight how these insights inform age-appropriate interventions to promote resilience. This Perspective underscores the vital role that social sciences have in understanding and combating the harmful influence of misinformation on youth’s beliefs and behaviours, while leveraging their strengths.",

          "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have had tremendous success accounting for reward-based learning across species, including instrumental learning in contextual bandit tasks, and they capture variance in brain signals. However, reward-based learning in humans recruits multiple processes, including memory and choice perseveration; their contributions can easily be mistakenly attributed to RL computations. Here I investigate how much of reward-based learning behaviour is supported by RL computations in a context where other processes can be factored out. Reanalysis and computational modelling of 7 datasets ( n = 594) in diverse samples show that in this instrumental context, reward-based learning is best explained by a combination of a fast working-memory-based process and a slower habit-like associative process, neither of which can be interpreted as a standard RL-like algorithm on its own. My results raise important questions for the interpretation of RL algorithms as capturing a meaningful process across brain and behaviour.",

          "abstract": "How does the human brain resolve conflicts in sensory input to generate conscious perception? Using high-resolution 7 T functional MRI, we addressed this question by investigating column- and layer-specific activity in cortical and subcortical regions in humans during binocular rivalry. The results show that eye-specific rivalry arises from interocular inhibition between adjacent ocular dominance columns in the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex, but not between ocular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Eye-specific feedback from the intraparietal sulcus plays an active role in biasing and synchronizing local competitions in the primary visual cortex into perceptually coherent representations, even without awareness of eye-of-origin information. These findings reveal the mesoscale mechanisms of perceptual conflict resolution in humans: local conflicts in sensory input are resolved by inhibitory microcircuits in the sensory cortex, while feedback signals from the parietal attention network bias and integrate local competitions into unified conscious perception.",

Thus, in active olfactory sensing, we would expect the dynamics of the sniff to change according to detailed odour characteristics. Furthermore, percept-related modulations of sniffing behaviour should correspond to neural activity in participating brain regions. Here we analysed a high-precision functional MRI dataset including more than 4,300 sniffs per participant taken of 160 odours during ~18 hours of scanning, to probe the relationship between odour-induced sniff modulations and perceptual features at a high level of granularity. We found that fine-grained perceptual odour information—and even odour identity—can be decoded from sniffing dynamics, and that olfactory brain regions, particularly the amygdala, are involved in percept-driven modulation of sniffing behaviour. Thus, olfactory cortical areas participate in real-time modulations of sniffs according to perceptual properties of the odour at a high level of granularity.",

          "abstract": "As AI systems from decision-making algorithms to generative AI are deployed more widely, computer scientists and social scientists alike are being called on to provide trustworthy quantitative evaluations of AI safety and reliability. These calls have included demands from affected parties to be given a seat at the table of AI evaluation. What, if anything, can public involvement add to the science of AI? In this perspective, we summarize the sociotechnical challenge of evaluating AI systems, which often adapt to multiple layers of social context that shape their outcomes. We then offer guidance for improving the science of AI by engaging lived-experience experts in the design, data collection, and interpretation of scientific evaluations. This article reviews common models of public engagement in AI research alongside common concerns about participatory methods, including questions about generalizable knowledge, subjectivity, reliability, and practical logistics. To address these questions, we summarize the literature on participatory science, discuss case studies from AI in healthcare, and share our own experience evaluating AI in areas from policing systems to social media algorithms. Overall, we describe five parts of any quantitative evaluation where public participation can improve the science of AI: equipoise, explanation, measurement, inference, and interpretation. We conclude with reflections on the role that participatory science can play in trustworthy AI by supporting trustworthy science.",

          "abstract": "Poverty is characterized by multidimensional economic, social, and psychological constraints that undermine people’s agency to pursue new opportunities and shape their life outcomes. How can interventions best support the agency of low-income individuals and, in so doing, boost poverty-reduction efforts? We theorize and find that agency interventions are effective when designed to be “culturally wise,” i.e., attuned to the model of agency predominant in a cultural context. Focusing on low-income women in rural Niger, Study 1 finds that local mental models of economic success primarily reflect interdependence, grounded in relational factors like advancing social harmony, respectfulness, and collective benefits. As evidenced by data from a United States sample, this contrasts with a more independent model common in the West grounded in personal factors like self-initiative. Study 2 finds empirical support for relational factors (e.g., subjective social standing) in addition to self-oriented personal factors (e.g., self-efficacy) as mechanisms of women’s economic advancement in a highly effective multifaceted poverty reduction program. Study 3 reports a field experiment with program participants (n = 2,628) to compare a Western-derived personal agency intervention and a culturally wise relational agency intervention each to a control. Only relational agency caused significant improvements in economic outcomes over 12 mo, as well as in some personal and relational outcomes. By contrast, personal agency showed limited effects, shifting only personal outcomes. These findings reveal the promise of research at the intersection of social and cultural psychology, behavioral science, and development economics to help address global poverty.",

While Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) oversee research activities, they do not assess risks posed by the interventions themselves. We propose establishing External Advisory Committees (EACs) to provide independent, expert oversight of programming risks. EACs complement IRBs by focusing on potential harms to participants and communities, offering dynamic risk assessments, and advising on program adaptations or termination. By providing impartial expertise, EACs help address potential conflicts of interest that may arise when researchers and implementers are invested in a program’s continuation. We illustrate the value of EACs through our experience implementing a cross-border labor migration program in Niger. Our EAC provided crucial guidance on scaling up the intervention after a pilot study and adapting the program following an unexpected military coup. While EACs introduce additional costs and may limit researcher autonomy, they generate accountability and are particularly valuable for novel and politically sensitive interventions in fragile environments.",

          "abstract": "Numerous research efforts have used paleoecological data to reconstruct past biodiversity in Europe. In these projects, researchers have identified increases in biodiversity over the Holocene and hinted at a positive correlation with human population. These are important findings but are not easily translated into effective biodiversity conservation and restoration policy. We argue that, in order to better inform policymaking, studies of past biodiversity dynamics should include analyses of contemporaneous cultural phenomena in order to identify and describe specific anthropogenic drivers of past biodiversity changes. We present an example here, a case study from the Lake Constance region (southwestern Germany), one of the core areas of the Carolingian Empire, the foundational political structure of modern Europe. This uniquely well-documented region offers six fossil pollen profiles characterized by high taxonomic and chronological resolution, archaeobotanical evidence from hundreds of excavation sites, and historical records describing population, commerce, and agriculture dating from the mid-700s CE. These data indicate that a major, sustained increase in plant diversity occurred in the Lake Constance region between 500 and 1000 CE, the formative period of medieval civilization. Plant diversity reached a 4,000-y peak around 1000 CE, making the medieval period a plant diversity optimum in the region. Archaeobotanical evidence independently corroborates this finding. Palynological, archaeobotanical, and archival data suggest that cultural innovations—in agriculture, management, and trade—were the primary drivers of this biodiversity transition and were necessary to maintain elevated levels of plant diversity in the region through the 20th century.",

          "abstract": "Each year, hundreds of millions of people are sickened by diseases that are transmitted through mosquito bites, including dengue, Zika, and malaria. Mosquito biting does not occur uniformly throughout the day and peak biting times follow species-specific patterns. While host-associated cues, like carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), behaviorally activate human-biting mosquitoes to search for a host, the mechanisms that regulate these responses throughout the day remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce an automated behavioral tracking system to investigate time-of-day variation of CO 2 responsiveness in Aedes aegypti . We find that while acute responses to CO 2 remain consistently high throughout the light phase, response persistence peaks only at dawn and dusk, in alignment with field-observed biting rhythms. We identify the circadian neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF) as a key regulator in the daily timing of spontaneous locomotor activity and CO 2 response persistence. Mosquitoes lacking PDF show reduced activity and CO 2 persistence in the morning. In response to a blood meal baited with heat and human odorants, pdf mutants also show reduced feeding in the morning and midday. Additionally, loss of pdf impacts the spatial pattern of PDF immunostaining and cell-autonomous clock gene oscillation in the central circadian system. Notably, acute CO 2 responsiveness remains rhythmic without external zeitgeber cues and is unaffected in pdf mutants, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms for acute CO 2 activation versus response persistence. These findings reveal a circadian layer of control of mosquito activity pattern that temporally modulate host-seeking drive.",

          "abstract": "We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the Nondeterministic Polynomial Time (NP) complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), hence coined DOCSAT, i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N = 15,000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.",

          "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the ecological footprints of pre-Columbian Indigenous peoples in Amazonia persist in modern forests. Ecological impacts resulting from European colonization c. 1550 CE and the Amazonian Rubber Boom c. 1850 to 1920 CE are largely unexplored but could be important additive influences on forest structure and tree species composition. Using environmental niche models, we show the highest probabilities of pre-Columbian and colonial occupation sites, and hence human-induced ecological influences, occurred in forests along rivers. In many areas, the predicted pre-Columbian and colonial distributions overlap spatially with the potential for superimposed ecological influences. Environmental gradients are known to structure Amazonian vegetation composition, but they are also strong predictors of past human influence, both spatially and temporally. Our comparisons of model outputs with relative abundances of Amazonian tree species suggest that pre-Columbian and colonial-period ecological legacies are associated with modern forest composition.",

          "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the primary cause of global mortality, face persistent therapeutic challenges due to poor drug targeting and systemic side effects. While innovative nanotherapeutic approaches offer improved drug delivery through targeting and stimulus-responsive release mechanisms, clinical translation is limited by poor tissue specificity and manufacturing limitations. We present a universal therapeutic hypothermia (TH, i.e., 32 to 35 °C)-enhanced strategy that amplifies nanocarrier targeting across multiple CVD models. Both hard and soft nanocarriers showed 1.6- to 3-fold increased pathological tissue accumulation under TH versus normothermia, correlating with enhanced therapeutic efficacy in multiple murine models of CVDs, including heart failure, myocardial hypertrophy, ventricular fibrillation, ischemic stroke, atherosclerosis, and deep vein thrombosis. Mechanistically, TH induces temperature-dependent enrichment of apolipoproteins C1 (ApoC1) and C4 in the protein corona of nanoparticle surface, enabling receptor-mediated targeting through upregulated lipoprotein receptors in injured cardiovascular tissues. Notably, ApoC1-mediated targeting outperformed established cardiac-targeting peptides in directing nanoparticles to diseased hearts. The TH-driven approach and direct ApoC1 functionalization provide a straightforward, scalable, and cost-effective approach to enhance nanotherapy precision for CVD treatment, potentially addressing critical barriers in clinical translation.",

Most of these organic molecules have been significantly altered by geologic processes through deep time. Nonetheless, the nature and distribution of those ancient fragmentary organic remains have the potential to reveal diagnostic biomolecular information after billions of years of burial. Here, we analyzed 406 fossil, modern biological, meteoritic, and synthetic samples using pyrolysis gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. We explored these analytical data via supervised machine-learning methods to discriminate samples of biogenic vs. abiogenic origin, plant vs. animal phylogenetic affinity, and photosynthetic vs. nonphotosynthetic physiology. Dividing 272 samples with known phylogenetic affinity and physiology into 9 categories, each further divided into 75% training and 25% testing sets, our random forest models accurately predict pairwise assignments of modern vs. fossil or meteoritic organics (100% correct assignments), fossil plant tissues vs. meteoritic organics (97%), modern vs. fossil plant tissues (98%), and modern plants vs. animal tissues (95%). Pairwise comparisons between fossil biogenic samples vs. abiogenic samples resulted in 93% correct classifications, while analysis of modern and ancient photosynthetic vs. nonphotosynthetic samples also resulted in 93% correct assignments. Our analyses demonstrate that molecular biosignatures can survive in ancient fossils and allow for the identification of organismal origins and traits. Consistent with previous morphological and isotopic inferences, we present evidence for biogenic molecular assemblages in Paleoarchean rocks (3.33 Ga) and for photoautotrophy in Neoarchean rocks (2.52 Ga).",

The proposed strategy has enabled us to generate wall-free and self-powered microfluidic systems capable of both cargo transport and mixing along with the downstream flow. We analyze the performance of these active pumps, both isolated and within cooperative ensembles in terms of their output velocity and hydrostatic pressure buildup.

In culture, multicellular groups exhibit spontaneous chiral symmetry break when moving collectively on micropatterned surfaces. Although several studies have shown that actin network integrity and actomyosin network contractility contribute to the establishment of the chirality of the movement, the role of contractile forces to the directionality of the chiral bias in collectives remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied the contractile forces produced by a minimal collective constituted of a pair of endothelial cells. We first show that cell doublets confined on disk-shaped micropatterns undergo spontaneous and persistent chiral swirling, displaying a mild but robust clockwise bias, as the one observed in bigger collectives. This bias could be amplified or reversed by modulating contractile forces. Traction force measurements revealed that high forces tend to drive counterclockwise rotation whereas low forces rather favor a clockwise rotation. Furthermore, the study of heterotypic doublets indicates that the direction of the rotation is determined by the more contractile cells within the doublets. These results thus revealed that contractile leader cells could drive the chiral motion of minimal collectives.",

Here, we identify SNX16 as a key component of the recycler complex, which localizes to autolysosomes and is required for ACR. SNX16 functions in ACR by regulating recycler complex formation, facilitating cargo recognition, and mediating the connection between STX17–SNX4–SNX5 and dynein–dynactin complexes. In addition, SNX16–cargo interactions are regulated by two ACR-related small GTPases, Rab32 and Rab38. Importantly, mTORC1 phosphorylates SNX16 to regulate ACR by inhibiting its interactions with STX17 and other recycler components, thus preventing recycler complex formation. Taken together, our findings identify SNX16 as a recycler component and establish a link between mTORC1 and ACR.",

Here, we identify a polymorphic effector (termed Bhe1) that exhibits a binary presence–absence distribution pattern among strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana . Gene deletion and overexpression in Bhe1- present strains revealed that this gene functions as a virulence factor against Drosophila species but dispensable for infection of mosquitoes, beetles, and locusts. Through targeted protein screening, we verified that Bhe1 targets a drosophilid-specific factor with an unknown function (termed Dsff1). The expression of Dsff1 is induced in Drosophila melanogaster upon fungal infection and is controlled by the Toll pathway. Survival of Dsff1 RNA interference (RNAi) flies was impaired after infection with the wild-type but not Δ Bhe1 strain of B. bassiana . Overexpression of Bhe1 and Dsff1 in D. melanogaster, respectively, suppresses and promotes fly antifungal immunity. Further investigations reveal that Dsff1 binds Bombardier (Bbd), and Bhe1 blocks their interaction. Consistent with Bbd’s role as a Toll-mediated immune factor, both Dsff1 and Bbd RNAi flies exhibit similar defects in the secretion of immune factors, including antifungal peptides. While revealing the mechanistic control of parasite host preference, our identification of a novel immune factor in Drosophila underscores a compelling instance of host–parasite evolutionary arms race.",

While these studies suggested no metal participation or the presence of a Zn 2+ ion in Mak16, we identify a previously unexplored iron–sulfur (Fe/S) cluster in yeast Mak16 through both in vivo and in vitro methods. We demonstrate a functional link between mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe/S protein biogenesis and ribosome assembly, highlighting an overlooked aspect of 60S ribosomal biogenesis. Characterization of human and yeast Mak16 revealed a redox-active [4Fe-4S] 2+/1+ cluster with a midpoint potential below –500 mV. Oxidative stress destabilizes Mak16 and disrupts its interaction with Rpf1 in vivo, while in vitro H 2 O 2 causes [3Fe-4S] 1+ cluster formation. Our findings also reveal that upon binding to rRNA expansion segment 7 the redox properties of the nearby Fe/S cluster largely remain unchanged. However, disruption of Fe/S cluster coordination destabilized Mak16, impaired the Mak16–Rpf1 complex formation and decreased the 25S rRNA level. The critical role of Fe/S proteins in eukaryotic DNA replication and repair, mitoribosomal function, and maturation has now been extended to nuclear ribosomal assembly. Relying on a vulnerable cofactor comes at a cost, as cluster loss can severely disrupt essential cellular processes. The inherent biosynthetic complexity and instability of the Fe/S cluster of Mak16 allows it to function as sensor for redox imbalance, creating the possibility to regulate cellular homeostasis under stress.",

          "abstract": "During photosynthesis, the photosystem II (PSII) enzyme catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water, fueling life on Earth by storing light energy and releasing O 2 as a byproduct. Determining the molecular mechanism for this water oxidation reaction has been of significant interest for the development of synthetic catalysts, but many details remain elusive. One of the open questions is how protons are strategically removed from the active site, a Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster called the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), during the reaction cycle via conserved water channels, and how proton transfer contributes to O–O bond formation energetics. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have investigated the role of conserved amino acid side chains in facilitating proton transfer. One of the most influential mutations is the Val185Asn substitution on the D1 subunit, which substantially slows O 2 release kinetics without abolishing catalytic activity. Forming a molecular understanding of how this mutation affects the active site will provide insight into the water oxidation reaction mechanism. Here, we investigated the structural basis of the Val185Asn substitution by determining a 1.99 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure. We observed that Asn185 orients away from the OEC and donates a H-bond to Cl1, a conserved chloride ion. We furthermore observed an alternative D2-Glu312-facing conformation of the D2-Lys317 side chain in the Cl1 water channel, a conformation that is consistent with recent models for proton transfer. These changes also produce perturbations to the hydrogen-bonding network. Overall, these finding provide insight into proton transfer in the Cl1 channel and its effect on the water oxidation reaction mechanism.",

Measurements were acquired at Jezero Crater, Mars, at midday, retrieving an average ozone column abundance of 3.8 ± 2.3 μm-atm (1σ) around aphelion, which fell below uncertainties in northern summer. The retrieved column abundance is in reasonable agreement with previous space-based and ground-based observations from Earth. The measurements of total ozone column abundance around aphelion from Mars 2020 and other missions, together with vertical profile observations from orbit, indicate that ~90% of the observed ozone is confined below 20 km of altitude, the aphelion layer weakly contributing to the total column abundance. These ozone levels below 20 km are 3 to 4 times higher than those predicted by models, challenging current understanding of atmospheric chemistry and composition in the lower atmosphere of Mars. It may be possible that aerosols are reducing the destruction pathways of ozone and/or that unknown active chemistry in the near-surface atmosphere of Mars is at work.

However, the mechanism by which they alter reaction thermodynamics remains unclear. While extensive research has been conducted displaying the ability of coacervates to compartmentalize a wide variety of reactants, products, and catalysts, insight into how reactant, transition state, and product energies are altered within the droplet continues to be an active area of research. One promising strategy for investigating the thermodynamics and kinetics within the coacervate phase is temperature-dependent electrochemistry, which enables the extraction of reaction entropy, enthalpy, and Gibbs energy. In this work, we use ferri/ferrocyanide, a well-behaved redox couple that has been proposed to be an essential oxidizing agent in prebiotic Earth, to investigate the microenvironment created by the coacervation of poly-L-lysine and polyuridylic acid. We observe an oxidative shift upon partitioning into the coacervates, which temperature-dependent experiments reveal is due to a 40 J/mol K and an 8 kJ/mol increase in reaction entropy and enthalpy, respectively. We attribute the change in entropy to a highly structured water hydrogen-bonding network within the droplets and, subsequently, around the redox probe. Further, we reveal via in situ Raman measurements that the change in reaction enthalpy is due to the destabilization of the product, ferrocyanide, within the ionic coacervate phase.",

          "abstract": "Although Methoprene-tolerant (MET) is well established as the intracellular receptor mediating the genomic actions of juvenile hormone (JH) in insects, the identity of the receptor responsible for initiating extranuclear JH responses has remained elusive. In the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti , we identify the platelet-derived growth factor- and vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor related (PVR) protein as a key mediator of membrane-initiated JH signaling. JH treatment induces robust PVR phosphorylation in the fat body of adult female mosquitoes. Disruption of PVR function suppresses JH-induced activation of the phospholipase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways and impairs primary follicle growth during the previtellogenic stage. Strikingly, JH-induced PVR phosphorylation and downstream signaling require MET, specifically its ligand-binding activity, but not its DNA-binding domain. A subpopulation of MET localizes to the plasma membrane of fat body cells, where it physically interacts with PVR between 24 h postemergence and 24 h post–blood feeding, suggesting that membrane-localized MET functions as the extranuclear JH receptor. Transcriptomic analyses following RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of Met or Pvr demonstrate that PVR broadly contributes to JH-regulated gene expression. Notably, PVR-dependent signaling modulates genes that are also regulated by nuclear MET and enables JH to regulate additional gene sets independently of MET-mediated transcriptional regulation.

          "abstract": "DNA computing circuits leverage molecular interactions to construct a highly parallel and biologically compatible information processing paradigm. However, their development has been constrained by a critical gap between intrinsic computational parallelism and the limited readout bandwidth. Multibit outputs from complex circuits often require multiple separate tests, limiting the integration and debugging efficiency. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by decoupling computation from readout via a DNA origami display-based interface by integrating strand displacement and unstable binding reactions. We convert multibit molecular outputs from DNA circuits into spatially resolved geometric bits, enabling direct visualization via superresolution microscopy for high-throughput readout. We experimentally demonstrated the direct readout of an 8-bit decoder circuit and simultaneous display of 16 parallel-running logic gates. This high-bandwidth platform unlocks capabilities in circuit debugging and multiplexed execution, paving the way for large-scale DNA computing and high-throughput biosensing.",

          "abstract": "Epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation plays a fundamental role in tumor lineage plasticity (LP). However, the underlying mechanisms, especially for the initial events of LP development, are still poorly understood. Here, we report that in progression of prostate cancer from adenocarcinoma to treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC), anti-androgen receptor (AR) signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) reprogram the function of circadian regulator/nuclear receptor REV-ERBα by switching its target gene programs from kinase signaling and metabolic programs to programs of LP, which includes neurogenesis, stem cell, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition as well as over fifteen LP drivers including POU3F2/BRN2, ASCL1, FOXA2, ONECUT2, and MYCN. Unexpectedly, REV-ERBα facilitates the chromatin occupancy of BRN2, ASCL1, and FOXA1 in their activation of LP programs, thus functioning as a master regulator of ARSI-induced LP driver network. Mechanistically, REV-ERBα induces chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac modification at promoters of LP genes through its recruitment of BRD4 and p300. Overexpression of REV-ERBα alone is sufficient to induce LP and neuroendocrine phenotype and confers resistance to ARSI in adenocarcinoma cells. Loss of REV-ERBα potently inhibits NEPC cell growth and abolishes the expression of LP drivers and gene programs. Pharmacological inhibition of REV-ERBα exhibits high potency in blocking the growth of NEPC tumors including patient-derived xenografts. Our findings reveal that therapy-induced LP development entails a coordinated induction of a network of LP drivers and that REV-ERBα is an unexpected master regulator of the network and a promising therapeutic target for treatment of advanced prostate cancer such as NEPC.",

While proresolving pathways are known to regulate inflammatory responses, their potential dysfunction in CWs remains unexplored. Here, we identify dysregulation of the pro-opiomelanocortin-melanocortin 1 receptor (POMC–MC1R) axis as a common feature across pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, and diabetic ulcers. Using MC1Re/e mice lacking functional MC1R, we demonstrate impaired wound healing marked by delayed reepithelialization and increased neutrophil extracellular traps—pathological features observed in human CWs. To investigate MC1R’s therapeutic potential, we developed a new murine CW model that replicates human pathology, presenting as nonhealing, exudate-rich ulcers. Topical application of the MC1R-selective agonist BMS-470539 restored healing by reducing exudate production, stimulating vascularization, and enabling reepithelialization. The critical role of MC1R was further evidenced by MC1Re/e mice, which developed more severe ulcers with excessive exudate and NETosis. In acute wound studies, we found that topical MC1R agonist enhanced wound bed perfusion and lymphatic drainage through increased angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and reduced scarring by modulating fibroblast phenotype. Together, these findings establish the MC1R/POMC axis as a fundamental regulator of skin repair and identify promising therapeutic strategies to drive healing.",

Since the current model of root gravitropism has not been able to integrate all aspects of the response (perception, response, and behavior), research on gravitropism has been dominated by different theories attempting to conceptualize each aspect individually. In this work, we sought to reevaluate all the main components of the root graviresponse through the lens of angle dependence. We show angle dependence in Cholodny–Went-based auxin asymmetry and growth response, which we tracked back to angle-dependent variation in PIN asymmetry and statolith sedimentation in the columella. Thanks to this approach, we were able to suggest distinct roles for PINs and columella cell tiers, and a potential function for auxin vertical flux through the columella. Our findings provide a unifying framework to further explore the mechanisms that regulate angle-dependent gravitropic response, with major implications of time-dependent features of root graviresponse.",

The α 1 -antitrypsin Z variant self-assembles into polymer chains that deposit within hepatocytes, predisposing to liver disease. Here, the 4.0Å subunit structure of polymers isolated directly from human liver tissue has been determined using cryoelectron microscopy. Challenges of flexibility, small subunit size, heterogeneous length, and preferred orientations were mitigated using antibody Fab domains and sample preparation strategies. This structure demonstrates that the formation of polymers in vivo involves self-incorporation of an exposed structural element (the reactive center loop) as an additional β-strand into the central β-sheet of α 1 -antitrypsin and displacement of a C-terminal region from one subunit with incorporation into the next. Unlike amyloid aggregation, this well-folded structure partially recapitulates a conformation adopted during normal function of the protein. These perturbations to the constituent α 1 -antitrypsin subunits of human tissue-derived polymers are consistent with a pronounced stability, their tendency toward long-chain forms, the ability of a subset to undergo canonical secretion, and the action of a class of small molecules that block polymerization in vivo.",

Tropical environments are undergoing intense rates of environmental change, and these changes may be driving large declines in genetic diversity. However, data on genetic diversity are highly skewed towards temperate regions. The degree to which diversity loss has occurred in tropical species, particularly marine species, remains an open and important question. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and museum collections of two commercially harvested nearshore marine fishes ( Equulites laterofenestra and Gazza minuta ) gathered from a single location in the Philippines, spanning a century of intense environmental change. These data reveal a marked loss in genetic diversity and evidence for multiple orders of magnitude reductions in effective population size ( N e ) in both species, indicating substantial genomic erosion. Such a decline highlights the long-lasting genomic consequences of anthropogenic activity and sheds light on an, until-now, invisible loss of diversity from the most biodiverse ocean region.",

          "abstract": "Liquid electrolytes adsorbed at the surface of metallic electrodes display a multitude of structures that can largely differ from the parent bulk system, both in terms of composition and local organization. In particular, the existence of disorder–order or order–order transitions has been increasingly reported in experimental and simulation studies, and the electrode potential identified as the corresponding driving force. The microscopic mechanisms and the stages of the process are, however, poorly understood, and the free energy variation during the transition remains insufficiently characterized. To fill this gap, we investigate the crystallization of the adsorbed layer in a prototypical molten salt–metal interface. We demonstrate that the transition from the disordered to ordered structures proceeds in two stages. Preordering effects are observed across a wide range of potentials, resulting in the formation of a polycrystalline structure on the electrode surface, before an abrupt ordering transition finally occurs. The preordering displays signature of a continuous transition. On the other hand, finite-size effects analysis proves the first-order character of the transition toward the monocrystalline state. Upon increasing the system size, a shift in the onset applied voltage is observed, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the free energy barrier. The latter reflects in the interfacial capacitance, which displays a peak that sharpens with increasing system size.",

          "abstract": "G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest superfamily of human membrane proteins with &gt;800 members, are primary targets for ~1/3 of all marketed drugs. Recent fluorescence experiments underscored the pivotal role of GPCR–G protein complex lifetime in their coupling efficiency and selectivity. However, these experiments are often expensive, time-consuming, and limited to a small number of GPCR–G protein systems. On the other hand, it is challenging to simulate GPCR–G protein dissociation using molecular dynamics (MD) methods. Here, we have employed Protein–Protein Interaction Gaussian accelerated MD (PPI-GaMD) simulations and experiments to probe the kinetics and pathways of G protein dissociation from GPCRs. For five systems with published experimental kinetic data, PPI-GaMD simulations successfully captured G protein dissociation from the GPCRs, including the adrenergic, adenosine, and muscarinic receptors. The simulations allowed identification of two distinct dissociation pathways and calculation of the G protein dissociation rates, which were in good agreement with experimental data. Additionally, we simulated the effect of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the adenosine A 1 receptor (A 1 R) in Gi protein dissociation and supported simulation findings with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor experiments evaluating G βγ kinetics following A 1 R activation. A 1 R PAMs were found to strengthen the agonist–receptor and receptor–G protein interactions and significantly reduce dissociation rates of the Gi protein. In summary, complementary PPI-GaMD simulations and kinetic assays have enabled detailed characterization of the kinetics and pathways of G protein dissociation, a critical event in the GPCR signaling cascade, and the effects of GPCR allosteric modulators.",

Using CRISPR knockout (KO) screens, we systematically characterized the regulators of cellular fitness in the normal mammary epithelium. We found that loss of METTL3 stimulates mammary epithelial proliferation and reprograms gene expression in an m6A methyltransferase-dependent manner. Single-cell analysis in normal breast organoids revealed that METTL3 ablation causes disruption of the mammary cellular hierarchy through increased aberrant luminal differentiation. Mechanistically, METTL3 loss reduces RNA m6A modification of transcribed transposable elements leading to their increased expression and upregulation of interferon-STAT signaling. This inflammatory response leads to cross talk between STAT and GATA3 transcription factors, resulting in transcriptional activation of luminal genes in the mammary epithelium. These findings identify a cell-intrinsic epigenetic loop contributing to mammary epithelial differentiation and highlight a potential role of loss of METTL3-dependent m6A modification during neoplastic transformation.",

However, SERK5, the closest paralog of BAK1/BKK1, is long considered a nonfunctional kinase due to a mutation in the conserved arginine-aspartic acid (RD) motif within its kinase domain. Here, we show that artificial microRNA (amiRNA)-mediated cosilencing of BAK1 / BKK1 / SERK5 induces autoimmunity, which is more severe than that observed in bak1 bkk1 double mutants. Complementation with the amiRNA-resistant mSERK5 , but surprisingly not with mSERK5Km encoding an ATP-binding-deficient SERK5, rescues this autoimmunity. Knockout of ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 , a central component of plant immunity with important functions in effector-triggered immunity (ETI), or BAK-TO-LIFE 2 , a surveillance protein sensing BAK1/BKK1 perturbations in immunity, partially suppresses the amiRNA-mediated autoimmunity. The bacterial elicitor elf18 swiftly upregulates SERK5 expression. BAK1 / BKK1 / SERK5 cosilencing seedlings complemented with mSERK5 maintain wild-type levels of elf18-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, while overexpression of SERK5 , but not unrelated SERK1 or SERK2 , restores normal elf18-induced MAPK activation in bak1 null protoplasts. These findings unmask a substitute coreceptor role for SERK5 in elf18 signaling, and suggest that plants can monitor and discriminate between concurrent BAK1/BKK1/SERK5 inactivation and BAK1/BKK1 depletion to fine-tune the severity of downstream ETI responses.",

The early onset and moderate severity of the US 2022–2023 influenza season may have resulted from reduced use of nonpharmaceutical interventions or lower population immunity after 2 y of limited influenza virus circulation. We used a mathematical model of influenza virus transmission that incorporates vaccine-derived protection against both infection and severe disease to estimate the impact of influenza vaccines on healthcare burden. Assuming reported levels of past vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and hospitalization, we estimate that influenza vaccines prevented 69,886 (95% CI: 51,860 to 84,575) influenza-related hospitalizations nationwide during the 2022–2023 season, with 57% attributable to reduced susceptibility and onward transmission. Despite limited data on VE against infection, our analyses suggest substantial indirect protection, particularly from young adults to other age groups. This is supported by a significant negative correlation between young adult (aged 18 to 49 y) vaccination rates and observed hospital burden across US states. Among those aged ≧65 y, nearly half of averted hospitalizations resulted from vaccinating younger age groups. These findings highlight the need for better estimates of influenza VE against infection and the potential benefits of increasing young adult influenza vaccination rates to reduce both direct and indirect disease burden.",

Despite extensive studies on their molecular constituents, it remains unclear how transsynaptic signals are organized at AZs. The two members of the CASKIN family of multidomain scaffold proteins, CASKIN1 and CASKIN2, bind to several AZ proteins and LAR receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs), and thus likely contribute to presynaptic assembly. Analysis using conditional knockout (cKO) mice deficient for CASKIN1 and/or -2 revealed that CASKIN2, but not CASKIN1, is critical for proper synaptic transmission, synaptic strength, and AZ protein arrangement at glutamatergic synapses. CASKIN1/2 deletion recapitulates Caskin2 -cKO phenotypes. Strikingly, presynaptic CASKIN2 at hippocampal CA3 neurons specifically regulates postsynaptic N -methyl- D -aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses, NMDAR surface expression, and long-term potentiation in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Moreover, PTPσ-mediated tyrosine dephosphorylation and multimerization of CASKIN2 are critical for the ability of CASKIN2 to regulate excitatory synaptic transmission, NMDAR functions, and activity-dependent presynaptic F-actin rearrangement. Last, the presence of CASKIN2 and PTPσ at Schaffer collateral circuits contributes to proper novel object location memory in mice. Our findings establish crucial roles of CASKIN2 in orchestrating LAR-RPTP-mediated transsynaptic NMDAR-related synaptic functions.",

AGO1(ΔF180) unexpectedly rearranges the hydrophobic core of the L1 domain to preserve the overall RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) architecture and recognize guide RNAs similarly to WT. Functionally, the mutant binds target RNAs like WT but more frequently retains passenger strands, implicating a defect in RISC assembly. Biochemical assays of ΔF180 and L190P mutants revealed normal duplex loading but impaired passenger ejection, exposing guide 3′ ends to 3′→5′ exonucleases and generating abnormally short ~11-nucleotide RNAs.

Decimation of the fire coral biotope shows that these short-term coral winners are unlikely to be future reef builders.",

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests combining physical activity with cognitive tasks may have been critical to human evolution and may be beneficial to human brain health today. These combined tasks are key elements of foraging, a lifestyle employed by human ancestors for over 2 My. However, it is unclear whether cognitive engagement during foraging-like tasks impacts endurance, and therefore foraging performance, and whether cognitive adaptations may mitigate these effects. We tested the hypothesis that cognitive engagement during endurance walking increases perceived physical effort without influencing physiological responses, and that enhanced cognition mitigates these effects. Thirty healthy adults ( n female = 17; aged 18 to 53) underwent nonlocomotor cognitive testing and completed two separate randomized endurance tests: one without (Ex) and one with simultaneous executive function tasks (ExCog). For each condition, participants walked on a treadmill for up to 30-min while physiological responses were recorded, and perception of effort was assessed every 2-min using Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale. During the ExCog condition, RPE was significantly greater ( P = 0.005), while energy expenditure was significantly lower ( P = 0.008) compared to the Ex condition. Additionally, we observed significant interactions between cognitive abilities and endurance performance—for example, individuals with greater visuospatial abilities experienced a smaller increase in perceived effort (RPE) in the ExCog condition compared to the Ex condition (FDR P = 0.039). These results indicate that cognitive demands and cognitive abilities associated with foraging distinctly influence endurance, suggesting that evolutionary shifts in human cognitive capacities may have relaxed constraints on endurance foraging performance.",

          "abstract": "Paleolithic representations of human–animal interaction are rare, with only a few painted or engraved examples recorded in Upper Paleolithic contexts, mostly from Europe. Such scenes, depicting real or imagined interactions, are of major importance for understanding a wide range of past human perspectives, starting with how people conceived of their ontological relationship with the environment and nonhuman beings. In the Early Neolithic in Southwest Asia, shifts in perspective led human communities to manipulate and transform their environment while simultaneously depicting new forms of art featuring human–animal interactions. Here, we describe the recent discovery of the earliest figurine depicting a human–animal interaction—a woman and a goose—from the Late Epipaleolithic (c. 12,000 years cal. BP) village of Nahal Ein Gev II in northern Israel. The artistic techniques and raw materials that were used and the mythological scene that was depicted appear earlier than previous examples, foreshadowing the more monumental changes in symbolic expression that occur in the following Neolithic periods. Through technological, archaeometric, and dermatoglyphic analyses, we demonstrate that this unique figurine was meticulously modeled from clay using innovative techniques that created perspective using form and light. Importantly, the figurine captures a mythological scene between the woman and the goose that is consistent with an animistic belief system. Through our combined multidisciplinary approach, this study provides important original data regarding the antiquity and development of symbolic expression using clay at the end of the Epipaleolithic at a crossroads between early sedentary and fully Neolithic societies in Southwest Asia.",

CR increases Sirt6 levels, and its beneficial effects are mediated by the gasotransmitter H 2 S, a one-carbon pathway product. Yet, the role of this pathway in Sirt6-regulated longevity remains elusive. Here, we show that Sirt6 controls hepatic one-carbon metabolism, preventing the aging-dependent H 2 S reduction, and the elevation of the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Sirt6 downregulates Slc7a11 expression in an Sp1-dependent manner, decreasing cystine uptake and increasing Cgl H 2 S production activity. Additionally, comparative acetylome in old livers revealed Sirt6-related differential acetylation of most of the one-carbon enzymes. Specifically, Sirt6-dependent Matα1 K235 deacetylation reduces its SAM production activity and Cbs binding, thereby reducing its activation of Cbs-dependent H 2 S production. The net outcome is H 2 S and SAM levels as observed in young animals. Thus, we unveil a fundamental mechanism for the promotion of healthy longevity by Sirt6.",

Whether and how this process is controlled are not clear. Here, we show that Chlamydomonas MAK (CrMAK), related to mammalian ICK/MAK, regulates axonemal microtubule assembly by phosphorylating FAP256/CEP104, a microtubule plus-end tracking protein. CrMAK, primarily present in cilia, associates with the axoneme via its C-terminal tail, and is enriched at the ciliary tip during active ciliary assembly. It is constitutively active during this process and acts downstream of a ciliary length-regulatory complex composed of LF1, LF3, and LF2, a CCRK homologue. Loss of CrMAK or its kinase activity leads to aciliated cells. CrMAK interacts with and phosphorylates FAP256/CEP104 and dephosphorylation of FAP256/CEP104 impairs ciliary assembly. These findings reveal a molecular mechanism governing the assembly of axonemal microtubules.",

A simple experimental model is constructed in which the elastic sheet is initially stretched and floats on a free surface. When the sheet retracts rapidly from the initially stretched state, the imbalance of the shear stresses exerted on the sheet causes the tip to flutter. Because of this tip flutter, the free surface becomes unstable, breaking up into separated liquid ligaments, and the tip flutter wavelength matches the spacing of the liquid ligaments. Furthermore, the contraction of the sheet induces the formation of wrinkles, particularly when the length of the retracting sheet becomes less than its original length. The tip flutter and wrinkle wavelengths increase with the bending rigidity and original length of the sheet, while they decrease with the initial strain of the sheet. A scaling relation between the experimental parameters and wavelengths is also established, using the balance between the dominant forces for each of the retraction and tip flutter/wrinkling processes.",

CTNNA1 loss promotes cell invasion and migration, and BCL2L13 loss promotes anchorage-independent survival and non-cell-autonomous changes to macrophage polarization.

By exploring three key quantum hopping perspectives-connectivity, hopping interactions, and on-site potentials-we establish a unique design framework for mechanical systems. This framework enables the realization of similar connectivity topology in both ordered and disordered systems, anisotropic Dirac cones with confined modes, and near-zero topological modes.

          "abstract": "Understanding how the cellular and molecular composition of neural circuits evolves to generate species-specific behaviors remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology and neuroscience. The remarkable diversity of male sexual behaviors among Drosophila species, despite their recent divergence, offers an excellent model for addressing this question. Here, by harnessing single-cell transcriptomics of the sexual circuits labeled by the sex determination gene doublesex ( dsx ) at high resolution, we delineated 84 molecularly distinct dsx + cell types, each mapped to anatomically and functionally defined dsx + neural populations. Our findings revealed a largely conserved cellular architecture, with minimal evolutionary gain or loss of cell types across four Drosophila species. A detailed comparison between Drosophila melanogaster ( D. melanogaster ) and D. yakuba uncovered pervasive heterogeneity in transcriptomic divergence among dsx + cell types. While core cell type identities—defined by the sex determination gene fruitless ( fru ), neurotransmitters, monoamines, and transcription factors—remain highly conserved, we observed striking evolutionary turnover in neuropeptide signaling pathways in a highly cell-type-specific manner, underscoring the role of functional reconfiguration of conserved circuits in behavioral evolution. Further investigation of sex differences in dsx + neurons revealed that male-specific cell types are not more evolutionarily divergent than sex-unbiased ones. Finally, we developed an interactive web resource for data access and characterized marker gene combinations enabling cell-type-specific labeling. Overall, our study provides insights into how neural circuits evolve to encode behavioral diversity and establishes a high-resolution framework for understanding the cellular basis of behavioral adaptation.",

          "abstract": "The thalamus is pivotal for the development and function of neural circuits in the cerebral cortex. However, how thalamus–cortex interactions influence human cortical development remains unknown primarily because of the inaccessibility of the human embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate thalamus-dependent gene expression, circuit organization, and neural activity during corticogenesis using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs). Human cortical (hCOs) and thalamic organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited region-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal activity. Upon the fusion of these organoids, hThCAs reconstructed reciprocal thalamus–cortex axonal projections and synaptic connections. Transcriptomic analysis revealed thalamus-dependent acceleration of cortical maturation, with upregulation of programs linked to axon development, subplate/cortical plate identity, and activity-regulated genes. Histological analysis showed expanded progenitor pools and increased deep-layer neurons within hThCAs. Wide-field Ca 2+ imaging demonstrated that wave-like activity originated in the thalamic region and propagated to the cortical region. Furthermore, two-photon Ca 2+ imaging of cortical neurons revealed that synchronous activity emerged exclusively in pyramidal tract neurons and corticothalamic neurons, whereas intratelencephalic neurons remain asynchronous, highlighting cell type–specific circuit integration within hThCAs. These synchronized events were absent in isolated hCOs or in cortico–cortical assembloids, underscoring the specificity of thalamic input. Our findings suggest that diffusible thalamic cues broadly enhance progenitor expansion, while long-range thalamic input organizes cell type–specific synchronous activity. This study demonstrates the thalamus-dependent acquisition of mature cortical phenotypes in a cell type–specific manner in hThCAs, establishing developmental mechanisms linking regional interactions and cell type–specific circuit specification.",

          "abstract": "The contribution of Thwaites Glacier, Antarctica, to sea level rise is influenced by how quickly warm salty seawater of Circumpolar Deep Water origin melts basal ice near its grounding line. Satellite observations reveal tidally forced kilometer-scale seawater intrusions beneath grounded ice that form an “Ice Grounding Zone” (IGZ) where ice melts vigorously. Although melt rates have been measured at selected sites using Automated phase-sensitive Radar Echo Sounders (ApRES) and Automated Underwater Vehicle (AUV) instruments, their spatial distribution and total magnitude within the IGZ remain uncertain. Here, we present 2D high-resolution simulations of the melt regime of Thwaites Glacier using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology global circulation model ocean model. The model predicts high melt at the entrance of the IGZ, with a quadratic decay inside the IGZ, a linear increase with ocean thermal forcing and a sublinear increase with cavity length. On the slow-moving Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf, the modeled melt rate is low (10 m/y) due to a flat, shallow ice base, in agreement with in situ observations from AUV and ApRES instruments. On the Thwaites Glacier Tongue (TGT), the modeled melt rate is high (50 m/y) due to a steeper and deeper ice base. The modeled melt rates are consistent with the estimates derived from the satellite. Hence, multiple lines of evidence indicate high melt in the IGZ of TGT, which controls 80% of the glacier mass balance. An updated representation of grounding zones in ice sheet models including seawater intrusions will increase their sensitivity to ocean warming and will revise sea-level projections upward.",

Repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation at expanded GGGGCC repeats in the C9orf72 gene produces dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins that are implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). However, the mechanisms promoting this noncanonical translation remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) as a key eIF2α kinase that enhances RAN translation under proteotoxic stress. We show that MARK2-eIF2α signaling, activated by misfolded proteins including DPRs and TDP-43, is upregulated in C9-ALS patient tissues. Loss of MARK2 significantly suppresses RAN translation in reporter cells, patient-derived neurons, and a mouse model and confers neuroprotection under proteotoxic conditions. These findings position MARK2 as a critical stress-sensing cytosolic regulator that promotes repeat-associated noncanonical translation and associated toxicity.",

Acute mortality, due to obstruction, perforation, or torsion of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, has been confirmed via necropsy in all three taxa; however, quantitative risk assessment for macroplastic ingestion poses unique challenges, with risk more dependent on probability of discrete events involving diverse plastic types rather than cumulative exposure models (e.g., LC 50 ). We model mortality risk associated with macroplastic ingestion in seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles, using data from more than 10,000 necropsies reported in the academic literature and stranding network databases. Employing an adapted Weibull Accelerated Failure Time model, we assess the relationship between the GI load (pieces and volume/animal length) of different plastic types—hard, soft, rubber, or fishing debris—and likelihood of plastic-induced mortality. Overall, 35% of seabirds, 12% of marine mammals, and 47% of sea turtles ingested plastic, and 1.6%, 0.7%, and 4.4% died from plastic, respectively. When modeling plastic together, a 90% chance of mortality was associated with 23 pieces (0.098 cm 3 /cm) in seabirds, 29 pieces (39.89 cm 3 /cm) in marine mammals, and 405 pieces (5.52 cm 3 /cm) in sea turtles (377 for juveniles). The plastic types that posed the greatest risks were rubber for seabirds, soft plastics and fishing debris for marine mammals, and hard and soft plastics for sea turtles. This research furthers scientific understanding of the likelihood of mortality from plastic ingestion and can inform monitoring, risk assessments, and management frameworks.",

Here, we present and describe the complete inner nasal structures of the early Neanderthal skeleton from Altamura, southern Italy. It represents evidence hitherto unavailable, both for this species and the human fossil record in general, and sheds light on the possible influence of respiratory adaptations on the characteristic Neanderthal facial morphology. Part of the debate has revolved around inner nasal traits proposed as unique adaptations (autapomorphies) of the species Homo neanderthalensis in relation to cold climate, specifically: a vertically oriented medial projection and a medial swelling on the nasal cavity wall alongside the lack of an ossified roof over the lacrimal groove. The lack of complete anatomy in the Neanderthal fossil record further livened the discussion regarding their occurrence. With the description and analysis of this unique finding, we can rule out the existence of such features. In addition, our observations corroborate the hypothesis that the characteristic midfacial morphology of H. neanderthalensis (i.e., the midfacial prognathism) is the result of a combination of factors and not a direct result of respiratory adaptations in the upper airways. Finally, our data provide an enhanced perspective for modeling Neanderthal respiratory performances.",

          "abstract": "Abnormal blood vessels limit the delivery and function of endogenous T cells as well as adoptively transferred Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells in tumor microenvironment (TME). We recently showed that vascular normalization using anti-VEGF therapy can overcome these challenges and improve the outcome of CAR-T therapy in glioblastoma models in mice. Here, we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to simulate the dynamics of both adoptively transferred CAR-T cells and endogenous immune cells in solid tumors following vascular normalization. Similar to our data, our model simulations show that vascular normalization reprograms the TME from immunosuppressive to immunosupportive by enhancing infiltration of endogenous CD8 + T cells and CAR-T cells, increasing M1 macrophages, and reducing M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells, thereby improving efficacy. Strikingly, vascular normalization reduces the number of infused CAR-T cells needed for tumor control by approximately fivefold. Moreover, synchronizing a second CAR-T infusion at their peak proliferative phase maximizes antitumor function. Furthermore, the efficacy of CAR-T cells engineered to secrete anti-VEGF antibody depends on the ability of CAR-T cells to induce vascular normalization. Additionally, combining vascular and stromal normalization can improve the efficacy of anti-VEGF antibody-producing Fibroblast Activated Protein-CAR-T cells for the treatment of desmoplastic tumors such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Finally, the model predicts that local CAR-T delivery can sustain high concentrations within the TME and induce recruitment of other antitumor immune cells, improving outcomes. Our model provides a versatile framework to optimize dosing strategies, treatment sequencing, and delivery routes for improving CAR-T therapies for solid tumors.",

          "abstract": "The unique, hypnotic pulsation behavior of certain soft corals of the Xeniidae family, the result of rhythmic opening and closing of their tentacles, has fascinated scientists since the 18th century. Repetitive motion is regulated by autonomous neural circuits known as pacemakers or central pattern generators. However, little is known about such circuits in nonbilaterian organisms like corals. In this report, Xenia umbellata , a fast-growing octocoral, served as a model organism to study the muscular and neural mechanisms of pulsation. Leveraging this coral’s rapid regeneration ability, we tested somatic regrowth and pulsation recovery following oral disc amputation. Transcriptomic analysis upon transitioning from nonpulsation to intermediate and synchronized pulsation during regeneration demonstrated shared pulsation-related genes in X. umbellata and bilaterians, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved rhythmic machinery. Pharmacological interference experiments supported transcriptomic findings, showing that acetylcholine regulates pulsation and anoctamin channels affect pacemaker rhythm. Interestingly, in the intermediate pulsation phase tentacles could pulsate individually without synchronization, suggesting the development of separate pacemakers. At the synchronized pulsation phase a dense nerve net developed around the mouth opening and overlapping muscle fibers between tentacles, providing the mechanisms for tentacle synchronization. However, when polyp tentacles were cut into small pieces, the fragments remained alive and each retained independent pulsation, revealing a unique pacemaker system driven by a diffuse nerve network lacking any centralized control. This finding uncovers a mechanism of rhythmic behavior generation in nonbilaterian animals, which could represent either a lineage-specific innovation or an ancient origin for more centralized control.",

          "authors": "Christophe F. D. Coste",
          "abstract": "Structured population projection models are fundamental to many fields of science. They enable abundance forecasting for populations categorized by various traits such as age (for demography), patch (for spatial ecology), genotype (for genetics), infectious stage (for epidemiology), or capital (economics). The demography of a structured population, determined by the transition rates (e.g., survival, fertility) between its various classes, also shapes its relatedness—or kinship—structure. This structure (a probabilistic genealogy) is crucial for understanding how individuals are related to the rest of the population and affects effective population size, inclusive fitness, inbreeding, pedigrees, relatedness, familial structures, etc. Due to its significance, Kinship Demography, the study of the relationship between transition rates and kinship structure, is currently among the most actively growing areas of demography. In this manuscript, by incorporating the generation number as a trait into the population structure, we derive the Kinship Formula, yielding the expected number of any kin for any structured population. This formula is simple to implement and fast to compute, even for complex models and distant kin relationships. Most importantly, it promises significant theoretical advances. From the Kinship Formula, one can, for instance, assess the impact of embedded processes (e.g., dispersal, inheritance, growth) on kinship, compute mean population relatedness and the eventual number of kin (including kin already dead or not born yet). The Kinship Formula derived here stems from a one-sex constant environment framework. Its simplicity should allow for extensions to include environmental and demographic stochasticity as well as two-sex models.",

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Aβ) undergoes posttranslational glycation to produce glycated Aβ (gAβ), yet its pathological role remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that gAβ promotes neuronal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) efflux via a VDAC1-dependent mechanism, activating the innate immune cGAS-STING pathway. Using aged AD mice and human AD brain samples, we observed cGAS-mtDNA binding and cGAS-STING activation in the neuronal cytoplasm. Knockdown of RAGE, cGAS, or STING, as well as pharmacological inhibition of VDAC1, protected APP mice from mitochondrial dysfunction and Alzheimer’s-like pathology. Neuron-specific cGAS knockdown confirmed its pivotal role in driving neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. Treatment with ALT-711, an AGE cross-link breaker, alleviated gAβ-associated pathology. Furthermore, RAGE inhibition in APP knock-in mice suppressed innate immune activation and disease-associated gene expression, as revealed by spatially resolved transcriptomics. Collectively, our findings establish a mechanistic link between gAβ and innate immune activation, identifying VDAC1, the AGE-RAGE axis, and the cGAS-STING pathway as promising therapeutic targets in AD.",

          "abstract": "Epithelia are intricate tissues whose function is intimately linked to mechanics. While mechanobiology has primarily focused on factors such as cell-generated contractility and mechanical properties of extracellular matrix, a interesting mechanobiological paradigm highlights the role of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping epithelial tissues. In our study, we developed an in vitro model of cell-coated microsized hydrogel spheres (MHSs) which allows to decipher the interplay between cellular activities and tissue mechanics. Drastic, isotropic MHS compressions were observed once the epithelia reached confluence. Further studies revealed that the compression was a process independent of cell contractility but rather regulated by active transepithelial fluid flow. Compressive stresses of about 7 kPa are generated by such an active hydraulic mechanism. Tissue homeostasis is then maintained by a fine balance between cell proliferation and extrusion. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of fluid transport in generating mechanical forces within epithelial tissues. Supported by a theoretical mechanohydraulic model, a mechanistic framework for understanding the intricate interplay between cellular processes and tissue mechanics was established. These results challenge traditional views of epithelial tissue mechanics, emphasizing the pivotal influence of osmotic and mechanical pressures in shaping tissues. We anticipate that this study will advance the understanding of epithelial tissue development, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the mechanisms underlying pathological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Covert visual attention allows the brain to select different regions of the visual world without eye movements. Predictive cues of a target location orient covert attention and improve perceptual performance. In most computational models, researchers explicitly incorporate an attentional mechanism that alters processing at the attended location (gain, noise reduction, divisive normalization, biased competition, Bayesian priors). Here, we assess the emergent neuronal mechanisms of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that exhibit behavioral signatures of covert attention, despite lacking a built-in attention mechanism. We use neuroscience-inspired approaches to analyze 1.8 M units of CNNs trained on the cueing paradigm. Consistent with neurophysiology, we show early layers with retinotopic neurons separately tuned to the target or cue, and later layers with neurons with joint tuning and increased cue influence on target responses. CNN computational stages mirror a Bayesian ideal observer (BIO), but with more gradual transitions. The cue influences the target sensitivity through four mechanisms. A BIO-like cue-weighted location summation, and three mechanisms absent in the BIO: an opponency across locations, a summation/opponency location combination, and interaction with the thresholding Rectified Linear Unit. Reanalyses of mice’s superior colliculus neuronal activity during a cueing task show CNN-predicted but previously unreported cue-inhibitory, location-summation, and location-opponent cells in addition to the commonly reported cue (attention) excitatory cells. The single-unit CNN analysis approach establishes a likely system-wide characterization mediating covert attention and a framework to identify new neuron types and emergent computational mechanisms contributing to perceptual behavior.",

Limited treatment options lead to renal failure in the vast majority of affected individuals. Novel therapeutic approaches are needed. Recent evidence has identified inflammation as an important driver of ADPKD. We analyzed transcriptional profiles in an orthologous Pkd1 mouse model and found a strong upregulation of the inflammasome pathway. To investigate the role of inflammasomes on cyst formation and kidney function, we modulated inflammasome activity through genetic targeting of the essential inflammasome component Pycard/Asc or treatment with the inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. Genetic deletion of Pycard/Asc in Pkd1 mutant mice significantly reduced cyst formation, and kidney function was improved. Reductions were seen in inflammation, fibrosis, and urinary excretion of IL-18. Analogous results were obtained through tubule-specific inactivation of Pycard/Asc or treatment of Pkd1 mutant mice with the inflammasome inhibitor MCC950. These findings demonstrate that inflammasomes act as drivers of disease severity in an orthologous mouse model of ADPKD. We pinpoint a separate, epithelial pool of inflammasomes in the diseased kidney and identify inflammasome inhibition as a promising strategy for the treatment of ADPKD.",

Despite its critical role, the mechanisms that govern RF2 function and regulation remain elusive.

We also show how further interactions with the ribosomal complex are necessary to properly position RF2 for polypeptide release. This work investigates not only the dynamics RF2 undergoes while in complex with the ribosome, but also identifies a potential mechanism by which the regulation of these dynamics may be disrupted, which may be exploited for future development of broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

This relationship holds across major phylogenetic groups, suggesting a general biogeographical rule for range size variation. Our findings indicate that latitudinal and elevational gradients in range size arise from selective pressures and species sorting based on climatic tolerance. Additionally, we show that species with larger range sizes tend to be ecologically dominant, supporting a long-suspected connection between range size, niche breadth, and local and regional abundance. Our results suggest a spectrum of dominance, where species with extensive geographic ranges and broader climatic tolerances tend to be more abundant. We posit that the relationship between range size, niche breadth, and ecological dominance is an emergent macroecological pattern that can be used for understanding and predicting the impacts of climate change on species distributions.",

In mfd− cells, most mutations are in the TS, caused by RNA polymerase stalled at template strand damage inhibiting repair.

This pivotal enzyme has long been observed to be kinetically constrained. Yet, this impression is based on kinetic measurements heavily focused on eukaryotic rubiscos, a rather conserved group of low genetic diversity. Moreover, the fastest rubiscos that we know of so far were found among the sparsely sampled prokaryotes. Could there be yet faster rubiscos among the uncharted regions of rubisco’s phylogenetic diversity? Here, we perform a characterization of more than 250 rubiscos from a wide range of bacteria and archaea, thereby doubling the coverage of the diversity of this key enzyme. We assess the distribution of the carboxylation rates at saturating levels of CO 2 , and establish that rubisco is a relatively slow enzyme across the tree of life, never exceeding ≈30 reactions per second at 30 °C. We show that relatively faster subclades share similar evolutionary contexts, involving micro-oxygenic environments or a CO 2 concentrating mechanism. Leveraging a simple machine learning model trained on this dataset, we predict the carboxylation rate for all ≈68,000 sequenced rubisco variants found in nature to date. This study provides the largest and most diverse dataset of natural variants for an enzyme and their associated rates, establishing a solid benchmark for future efforts to predict catalytic rates from sequence data.",

Using a combination of mouse genetics, single cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics, we found that Dpf2 loss in macrophage modulates inflammatory polarization, thus protecting against intestinal injury. Mechanistically, Dpf2 deficiency leads to loss of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks at Cacna1d enhancer, impairing Cacna1d messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and reducing intracellular calcium. Consequently, loss of Dpf2 attenuates mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling activity, promoting an anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Finally, through analysis of clinical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) single cell RNA and spatial transcriptome data, patient-derived organoids and clinical samples, we validated a positive correlation between DPF2, CACNA1D, and intestinal inflammation.

Here, we present structures of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) in absence of sliding clamp or supplemented nucleotide. Our structures indicate that RFC holds onto ADP tightly in at least two of its four ATPase active sites, suggesting that nucleotide exchange is regulated. Our molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical data indicate that binding of the sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) causes rapid exchange of tightly bound ADP. Our data suggest that PCNA acts as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) by prying apart adjacent subunits, providing a pathway for ADP release.

          "abstract": "Electrokinetic transport of nanoparticles in porous media is crucial for separation technologies, but the boundary-field coupling effects in three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous spaces remain challenging to understand. Using superresolution 3D tracking of nanoparticles in interconnected cavities, we observed an unexpected disconnect between cavity escape time and directional bias as a function of electric field strength. The cavity escape times of individual nanoparticles decreased dramatically even with weak fields (2 V/cm), enhancing effective diffusion. However, directional bias was negligible at low field strengths, and became significant only for stronger fields (~7 V/cm). Simulations revealed that at low field strengths, when Brownian motion dominated the nanoparticle dynamics [Péclet number (Pe) &lt; 0.005], the transport was stochastic with accelerated random exploration and cavity escape without directional preference, facilitated by the coordination of weak electrophoresis and electroosmotic (EO) recirculating flow. The combined effect creates localized vortices that position particles closer to internal boundaries, increasing exit encounter probability. At larger Pe values, electrophoretic forces start to overcome the apparently random motion, and establish a preferred migration direction through the porous network. These findings demonstrate the delicate balance between Brownian fluctuations, electrophoretic force, and EO flow in interface-confined and interconnected environments, providing mechanistic insights for optimizing electrokinetic separation in chromatographic columns, separation membranes, and nanocargo delivery systems.",

In this study, we developed a statistical framework that links raw histological images and their derived features to the genotype, transcriptome, and chronological age of the samples. We first demonstrated an association between image features and genotypes, identifying 906 image quantitative trait loci (imageQTLs) significantly associated with image features. Next, we identified differentially expressed (DE) genes by stratifying samples into image-similar groups based on image features and performing DE comparisons between groups. Additionally, we developed a deep-learning model that accurately predicts gene expression in specific tissues from raw images and their features, highlighting gene sets associated with observed morphological changes. Finally, we constructed another deep-learning model to predict chronological age directly from raw images and their features, revealing relationships between age and tissue morphology, especially aspects derived from nucleus features. Both models are supported by a computational approach that greatly compresses gigapixel whole-slide images and extracts interpretable nucleus features, integrating both large-scale tissue morphology and smaller local structures. We have made all interpretable nucleus features, imageQTLs, DE genes, and deep-learning models available as online resources for further research.",

          "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system enables the encoding, storing, and integrating new information. AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate most fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, and plasticity of AMPARs signaling underlies the long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy and strength important for learning and memory. Recent work has indicated that the enigmatic N-terminal domain (NTD) of AMPARs may be a critical regulator of synaptic targeting and plasticity of AMPARs. However, few synaptic proteins have been identified that regulate AMPAR plasticity through interactions with AMPAR NTDs. Moreover, the scope of AMPAR NTD interactors that are important for synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here, we present the dynamic, extracellular interactome for AMPARs during synaptic plasticity. Using surface-restricted proximity labeling and BioSITe-based proteomics, we identified 70 proteins that were differentially labeled by APEX2-tagged AMPARs after induction of chemical long-term potentiation of synapses in cultured neurons. Included in this list, were four members of the IgLON family of GPI-anchored proteins (Ntm, OBCAM/Opcml, Negr1, Lsamp). We show OBCAM and NTM directly interact with the extracellular domains of AMPARs. Moreover, overexpression of NTM significantly attenuates the mobility of surface AMPARs in dendritic spines. These data represent a significant step at uncovering the unexplored extracellular regulation of AMPARs, with broad implications for synapse function and synaptic plasticity.",

In this paper, we present a unified framework, the Mixture of Mixed Models (MMM), designed to directly model RNA count data and identify cell-type-specific SVGs while accounting for cell type composition and correcting for platform effects. Through a comprehensive simulation study and the analyses of eight publicly available ST datasets from various tissues and technologies with different resolutions, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of MMM in identifying cell-type-specific SVGs. Notably, our integrative analysis with genome-wide association studies reveals that the cell-type-specific SVGs identified by MMM in a mouse brain study exhibit significant heritability enrichment in brain-related phenotypes. This finding suggests that cell-type-specific SVGs play a vital role in elucidating the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. When applying MMM to analyze a high-resolution Xenium human breast cancer dataset by accounting for the uncertainties in cell segmentation, we find that certain cell-type-specific SVGs may contribute to cell–cell communications, thereby regulating the tissue microenvironment. Furthermore, we show the versatility of MMM by applying it to the 3D tissue models constructed from multiple ST slices, highlighting its utility in analyzing the 3D ST data.",

While bone marrow injury, such as by bone fracture, disrupts marrow vasculature, the consequences for local oxygen tension remain unclear. Here, we show in mice that while the tissue oxygen tension in bone marrow is low (25 mmHg, ~4% O 2 ), intracellular oxygenation is heterogeneous, and erythroid cells are high in oxygen. Bone fracture elevates oxygen tension in the injured bone marrow (&gt;55 mmHg, ~8%), which persists for over a week postinjury. This oxygen elevation results not from angiogenesis, but rather from localized expansion of erythroid precursor cells in the injured bone marrow. Injury-activated erythroid precursors synthesize hemoglobin and concentrate oxygen at the injury site; however, blocking transferrin receptor 1 (CD71)-mediated iron uptake impairs hemoglobin synthesis, reduces local oxygen levels, and enhances bone regeneration through increased angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Together, these findings identify erythroid precursors as active regulators of local oxygen availability in the bone marrow niche, which may be targetable to enhance tissue regeneration.",

          "abstract": "Hurricanes can be a source of strong, episodic natural selection, especially for coastal and island populations. In Anolis lizards, selection favors morphological traits that enhance clinging performance under hurricane-force winds. However, we know little about the longer-term persistence of morphological and genomic responses to these pulse-like events. To address this limitation, we capitalized on the well-documented history of hurricanes and spread of the invasive brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei , over the past 130 y in the southeastern United States. We used 30 sites with estimates of the number of hurricanes experienced since population establishment. We found that hurricane frequency is consistently related to morphological trait values that increase clinging performance—longer limbs and larger toepads. In contrast, traits with no known connection to clinging ability were not related to hurricane frequency. Our genomic results show that despite a complex genetic architecture for most traits, populations retain a signature of hurricane-mediated selection, with several loci being strongly associated with both hurricane frequency and longer limbs. Further, we found that hurricanes are a more persistent driver of among-population genomic differentiation than other environmental variables. These results solidify hurricanes as a major force shaping morphological and genomic variation in Anolis lizards. They also highlight how the evolutionary trajectories of populations will likely be altered as climate change modifies historical patterns of natural selection, such as those involving extreme weather events.",

Its interpretation however is unclear, as Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments in the Andreev and tunneling regimes show two distinct energy scales whose origin is mysterious. We show using a Green’s function formulation that the two energy scales cannot be understood as a SC gap in the Andreev spectra and a pseudogap in tunneling. We also show that the ballistic Andreev regime can never be realized in moire SCs as the large mismatch in the Fermi velocity v F of the flat-band SC and the STM tip renormalizes a transparent interface toward the tunneling regime. We discuss self-energy corrections to v F that determines the conductance. Finally, we model the Andreev experiment as a circular metallic disc embedded in an unconventional SC. With strong v F mismatch the low bias conductance is dominated by tip-induced Andreev bound states, responsible for the low energy scale distinct from the SC gap seen in tunneling.",

While its effects on neurons are well studied, its consequences on astrocytes and astrocytic contribution to PD pathology are understudied. Here, we differentiated patient-derived p.A53T-αSyn induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) to ventral midbrain astrocytes and characterized them via comprehensive molecular, functional, and proteomic analyses. Gene-corrected and healthy iPSC-derived astrocytes served as controls. To assess the effects of p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes on dopamine neurons, we established neuron–astrocyte cocultures of iPSC-derived control and mutant cells at all combinations. Our analyses uncovered cell-intrinsic pathologies in p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes, such as calcium dyshomeostasis, and accumulation of protein aggregates including those of phosphorylated αSyn. Proteomic and mechanistic studies demonstrated perturbed protein catabolic processes, with associated disturbances in lysosomal function and mTOR signaling. These deficits reduced the endocytic clearance capacity of p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes and their ability to process exogenous αSyn cargo. p.A53T-αSyn dopamine neurons cocultured with p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes displayed Lewy-like pathologies, mirroring the histopathological hallmarks identified in postmortem PD brains and exacerbated neurodegeneration, in anatomical and functional aspects. Control astrocytes mitigated these pathologies, highlighting their neuroprotective role. Additionally, p.A53T-αSyn astrocytes induced PD-relevant pathology ιn control neurons. Our findings, validated using an isogenic pair, demonstrate a critical impact of p.A53T-αSyn in disrupting astrocytic protein quality control mechanisms and establish astrocytes as active contributors to PD neuropathology. Our two-dimensional coculture model reflects key aspects of PD pathology, offering a relevant platform for mechanistic and drug discovery studies.",

PT cells are exquisitely sensitive to ischemia due to their high metabolic rate. The small GTPase Rac1 regulates epithelial function by promoting polarity through its effects on the actin cytoskeleton. We show that Rac1, in the setting of the recovery of the PT from ischemic injury, plays a critical role in reconstituting cellular bioenergetics by promoting actin cytoskeleton formation around damaged mitochondria. This mechanism removes damaged mitochondria through mitophagy and preserves PT metabolic capacity and reabsorption function. Loss of Rac1 causes intracellular lipid accumulation, energy depletion, and PT cell atrophy. Thus, Rac1 promotes the repair of PT cells by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics, rather than by regulating cell polarity via a mechanism that links the actin cytoskeleton to metabolic demands and cell morphology.",

In this work, we demonstrate that thick-electrode fast charging is constrained by solvent withdrawal within porous electrodes and the resulting electro-osmotic drag polarization, which is driven by cation-induced electro-osmotic drag. To reduce electro-osmotic drag polarization, we designed electrolytes with weak cation solvation and strong anion solvation, where a difluorinated solvent weakens lithium-cation solvation and its difluoromethyl hydrogen atoms enhance anion solvation through hydrogen bonding. This electrolyte enables thick-electrode, energy-dense batteries to achieve 80% charge within 13 minutes.",

We screened for cellular factors that influence site-specific transgene synthesis into the human genome by an R2 retrotransposon protein.

How tumor antigens are processed to activate CD8 + T cell immunity is not well understood. In this work, we show that Ms4a7 is up-regulated in cDC1s after tumor antigen uptake or exposure to exogenous stimuli and is required for their cross-priming ability. Although Ms4a7 −/− mice showed normal cDC1 development and turnover, they failed to prime antigen-specific CD8 + T cells following infection or tumor development. In human cancers, MS4A7 was expressed in a subset of cDC1s, preferentially enriched in dLNs, and correlated with patient survival. Our findings suggest a critical role for Ms4a7 in cDC1-mediated cross-presentation and antitumor CD8 + T cell responses.",

Among secondary metabolites that contain α-tropolones, the pseudodimeric isolate (–)-gukulenin A ( 7 ) stands out for its complexity and has shown promise in treating murine models of ovarian cancer. Here we describe an enantioselective synthesis of (–)-gukulenin A ( 7 ).

We identified genes encoding a predicted nuclease paired with a trypsin-like protease repeatedly acquired by multiple, otherwise unrelated antiviral immune systems in bacteria. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed the nuclease is a proenzyme that cleaves DNA only after activation by its partner protease. Two distinct immune systems, Hachiman and AVAST (antiviral adenosine triphosphatase/nucleoside triphosphatase of the STAND superfamily, Avs), use the same mechanism of proteolytic activation despite their independent evolutionary origins. Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease ( canu ) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation. These results uncover the coordinated activities of pro-nucleases and their activating proteases within different immune systems and show how coevolution enables defense system innovation.",

Here, we examined support for these competing hypotheses by constructing large and highly informative data matrices containing sequences from sponges, ctenophores, cnidarians, bilaterians, and diverse animal relatives. The new data matrices and 10 published datasets were analyzed in 785 topology tests conducted using integrative phylogenomics, a method that unifies concatenation and coalescence to identify genes with a consistent phylogenetic signal. All 490 statistically significant tests supported the sponge-sister hypothesis and none supported the ctenophore-sister hypothesis; the remaining 295 tests were inconclusive. These results provide compelling evidence for the sponge-sister hypothesis and suggest that integrative phylogenomics provides a robust and powerful approach for disentangling branches in the tree of life.",

Patients with loss-of-function mutations in the ARPC5 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex develop inflammation and immunodeficiency after birth, leading to early mortality. The basis for these phenotypes remains obscure. We found that loss of ARPC5, but not the ARPC5L isoform, in the mouse hematopoietic system caused early-onset intestinal inflammation after weaning. This condition was initiated by microbiota breaching the ileal mucosa and led to systemic inflammation. ARPC5-deficient macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated the ileum but failed to restrict microbial invasion. Specifically, macrophages that lack ARPC5 struggled to phagocytose and kill intracellular bacteria.

Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects whereas combined loss markedly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing indicated that loss of PIEZO function reduced expression of connexin43 ( Gja1 ), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction.

The integrated stress response (ISR) is elicited by phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2, which traps and inhibits rate-limiting translation factor eIF2B thereby attenuating translation initiation. Termination of this pathway thus requires relieving eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition. Here, we found that eIF2 phosphatase subunits PPP1R15A and PPP1R15B (R15B) bound P-eIF2 in complex with eIF2B. Biochemical investigations guided by cryo-EM structures of native eIF2-eIF2B and P-eIF2-eIF2B complexes bound to R15B demonstrated that R15B enabled dephosphorylation of otherwise dephosphorylation-incompetent P-eIF2 on eIF2B. This sheds light on ISR termination, revealing that R15B rescues eIF2B from P-eIF2 inhibition, thereby safeguarding translation and cell fitness.",

Using MetaEdit, we achieved in vivo genetic capture of native murine Bacteroides by integrating a metabolic payload that enables tunable growth control in the mammalian gut with dietary inulin. We further show in vivo editing of segmented filamentous bacteria, an immunomodulatory small-intestinal microbial species recalcitrant to cultivation.

Angstrom-level thickness control and subangstrom smooth layers enable quantum-confined photoluminescence of CsPbBr 3 from monolayer, bilayer, and through to bulk. The interfacial structure controls the electronic structure from a Cs‒PEA-terminated interface (type II heterojunction) to a PEA‒PEA-terminated interface (type I heterojunction), with a layer-tunable band offset shift exceeding 0.5 electron volts. Electron transfer from CsPbBr 3 to PEA 2 PbBr 4 for a type II Cs‒PEA heterojunction results in delayed electron-hole recombination beyond 10 microseconds.

Most natural epivariants that we tested can be inherited without DNA sequence changes and are therefore bona fide epialleles, although genetic factors modulate their recurrence or persistence.

          "abstract": "Health polarization has emerged as a critical factor shaping public health attitudes and behaviors, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides a systematic review of the key determinants driving health polarization, highlighting the complex interplay of political, social, economic, and psychological factors. By synthesizing findings from 90 studies, we identify six primary drivers: political ideology and partisanship, misinformation and disinformation, social media structures and dynamics, trust in health institutions and professionals, risk and public health perceptions, and socioeconomic factors. Our analysis reveals how these determinants reinforce societal divisions, exacerbate health inequalities, and influence adherence to public health measures. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for designing effective interventions that address the root causes of health polarization. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these divisions is essential for mitigating their negative impact on public health and fostering more cohesive, evidence-based health communication strategies.",

Here, we test whether mass shootings increase electoral participation using the most granular dataset to date. We draw information on mass shootings from the Gun Violence Archive and estimate national block group-level turnout using four snapshots of the national voter file. Using a regression discontinuity in time design, we find that mass shootings mobilize local voters (especially in heavily Democratic areas) but do not shift presidential vote choices. Furthermore, we show that pre-election mass shootings were associated with increased support for a 2016 Californian gun reform ballot initiative. Our results show the (geographically bounded) salience of mass shootings for local political engagement and ballot reform efforts.",

          "abstract": "Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems because of their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000°C per second, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO 3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with subgrain boundary fractions of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kilovolts per centimeter) and large polarization (70 coulombs per square centimeter). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 joules per cubic meter and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250°C. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48 )O 3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.",

Here, we identify two insecticidal proteins in Paeniclostridium ghonii , designated PG-toxin 1 (PG1) and PG-toxin 2 (PG2), which are homologs of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs). Unlike BoNTs, PG1 and PG2 contain two separate proteins: One is the protease light chain (LC), and the other is the heavy chain containing the translocation domain and the receptor binding domain. Crystal and cryo–electron microscopy structures show a conserved BoNT-like architecture but without an interchain disulfide bond. Functional characterizations establish that the LCs of PG1 and PG2 cleave insect synaptosomal–associated protein 25 (SNAP25), but not human or rat SNAP25, and microinjection of PG1 and PG2 caused paralysis and death in Drosophila and Aedes mosquitoes. These findings identified unique two-component BoNT-like insecticidal proteins, revealing insights into the evolution of the BoNT family of toxins, and broadening our understanding of bacteria that can be used for biopest controls.",

          "abstract": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have drawn substantial scientific attention due to their profound biological and economic impacts, especially in the context of climate change. This study highlights the crucial role of tropical cyclones (TCs) in disrupting MHWs by altering ocean temperatures. As demonstrated by Tropical Cyclone Bavi, intense sea surface temperature (SST) cooling, reaching up to 7°C, immediately terminated a mature MHW and suppressed subsequent MHW development for up to 8 months. More generally, on the basis of post-TC MHW cases (reoccurring within 1 month) during 2014 to 2023, we found that MHW disruption duration is proportional to the magnitude of TC-induced SST cooling, ~5 to 7 days per degree of cooling. At a broader scale, a 20-year (2004 to 2023) analysis revealed 99% significant inverse relationships between seasonal MHW and TC activity. These findings suggest that TCs can act as natural regulators, effectively mitigating heat stress from MHWs and potentially serving as a lifeline for marine ecosystems.",

Capturing these conformations and their transitions within native cellular membranes presents a notable challenge. Herein, we used in situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to resolve the 1.5-Å outward-open and 2.5-Å occluded structures of Bj SemiSWEET within its native cellular membranes. Our findings reveal that these two conformations exchange within transmembrane helix TM1 and Loop L2-3 on a millisecond to second timescale, with the exchange rate corresponding to the sucrose transport rate. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed that these conformations represent functional states during sucrose transport. In contrast, we observed different conformational dynamics of Bj SemiSWEET in DMPC/DMPG synthetic bilayers compared to cellular membranes. This study highlights the potential of in situ solid-state NMR to provide previously unknown dynamic structural insights into cellular molecular processes, representing a substantial advancement in dynamic cellular structural biology.",

          "abstract": "Hotspot swells have typically been associated with mantle plume upwelling, yet the origins of much broader but lower superswells remain unclear. This study first reveals that swell width increases while height decreases at younger seafloor ages; it is possible for a single hot spot swell size to approach that of a superswell. Compressible numerical models replicate the observed trend. Modeling results suggest that both hot spot swells and superswells can form from interactions between mantle plumes and oceanic plates. Beneath young seafloors, the lateral redistribution of restitic, hence buoyant and relatively low-viscosity, lower lithospheric mantle due to plume impingement explains the formation of superswell-like morphology. These models effectively demonstrate lithospheric lid effects on mantle melting and support a reassessment of conventional methods for estimating core heat flux.",

          "abstract": "Mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance differs fundamentally from nuclear inheritance owing to exclusive maternal transmission, high mutation rate, and lack of recombination. Two key mechanisms shape this inheritance: the bottleneck, which drives stochastic transmission of maternal mtDNA variants, and purifying selection, which actively removes mutant mtDNA. Whether these mechanisms interact has been unresolved. To address this question, we generated a series of mouse models with random mtDNA mutations alongside alleles altering mtDNA copy number or decreasing autophagy. We demonstrate that tightening the mtDNA bottleneck increases heteroplasmic variance between individuals, causing lower mutational burden and nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratios. In contrast, reduced autophagy weakens purifying selection, leading to decreased interoffspring heteroplasmic variance and increased mutational burden with higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous ratios. These findings provide experimental evidence that the mtDNA bottleneck size modulates the efficacy of purifying selection. Our findings yield fundamental insights into the processes governing mammalian mtDNA transmission with direct implications for the origin and propagation of mtDNA mutations causing human disease.",

          "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitors have proven invaluable for monitoring blood glucose levels for diabetics, but they are of limited use for observing glucose dynamics at the cellular (or subcellular) level. We have developed a second generation, genetically encoded intensity-based glucose sensing fluorescent reporter (iGlucoSnFR2). We show that when it is targeted to the cytosol, it reports intracellular glucose consumption and gluconeogenesis in cell culture, along with efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum. It outperforms the original iGlucoSnFR in vivo when observed by fiber photometry in mouse brain and reports transient increase in glucose concentration when stimulated by noradrenaline or electrical stimulation. Last, we demonstrate that membrane localized iGlucoSnFR2 can be calibrated in vivo to indicate absolute changes in extracellular glucose concentration in awake mice. We anticipate iGlucoSnFR2 facilitating previously unobservable measurements of glucose dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution in living mammals and other experimental organisms.",

However, achieving a balance between lightweight design, strength, and energy absorption remains challenging. Here, we develop a material-structure-function integrated strategy to additively manufacture lightweight metamaterials. Specifically, strong yet ductile aluminum (Al) alloy with heterogeneous grain was developed to print hero shrew–inspired damage-resistant metamaterials. The synergistic interplay between microscale strengthening and mesoscale architectural stress regulation leads to a cross-scale coordination mechanism, which effectively bridges material heterogeneities and structural hierarchy for multilevel energy dissipation. Such a strategy enables our metamaterials to maintain a stable stress platform during deformation. Hence, our metamaterials display an excellent combination of ultralightweight (0.91 ± 0.01 g/cm 3 ), high relative yield strength (17.0 ± 0.7%), and unprecedented specific energy absorption (39.1 ± 0.7 J/g), surpassing most metallic metamaterials. This facile concept expands the design space for lightweight metamaterials and demonstrates scalable strategies to realize the cross-scale coordination mechanism required by multifunction, showing transformative potential in mass production for sustainable engineering solutions.",

          "abstract": "Changes in heat storage within the different components of the climate system alter physical and biogeochemical phenomena relevant for human societies and ecosystems. Among such processes, permafrost thawing, soil carbon storage, and surface energy exchanges depend on the persistent heat gain by the continental subsurface. Nevertheless, there are not enough data to estimate ground heat storage at the global scale after the year 2000. We solve this problem by expanding the database of geothermal data with remote sensing observations from satellite platforms. Estimates from satellite data show a heat gain between 16.4 ± 3.4 and 21.78 ± 0.62 zettajoules during the past six decades. The global ground heat storage presents a positive acceleration between 0.16 ± 0.15 and 0.624 ± 0.032 zettajoules per square decade, similarly to the rest of components of the Earth heat inventory. The planned satellite missions ensure the monitoring of the land component of the Earth heat inventory in the future.",

To gain further insight into the genetic history of this island from a matrilineal viewpoint, we investigated 15 millennia of human mitogenome evolution. A unique Sicilian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) dataset, represented by 116 ancient mitogenomes (including two newly sequenced) collected from 16 archeological sites dating from 14,700 to 545 years ago, was compared with a collection of 236 modern mitogenomes covering all districts of the island. By integrating demographic modeling with phylogeographic analyses, we identified a statistically supported genetic discontinuity between the Paleolithic/Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods and two mtDNA lineages (U5b and U8b/K) that specifically mark this transition. The extensive variation and lack of genetic structure among modern mitogenomes suggest the presence of a continuous, maternally inherited gene flow from different regions of Western Eurasia (since the Paleolithic) and Africa (since the Bronze Age).",

Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) exhibited HP-induced damage exclusively on stiff matrices, recapitulating cirrhotic degeneration phenotypes and genotypes.

Genetic silencing of GPR116 protected endothelial cells from HP-induced damage both in vitro and in cirrhotic murine models.

Under a modest AC electric field at 1 Hz, large electrostriction of 120 ppm is observed in pristine sample. Yet, after resting in ambient environment, electrostriction decreases by one order of magnitude without any electrochemical decomposition and phase transition. The oxygen vacancies are found to decrease in the degraded SDC as well, and the degradation does not occur at frequency of 500 Hz and higher, which exhibits electrostriction one order of magnitude smaller in the first place.

Herein, we introduce an architecture that enables convolution and reinforcement learning by leveraging the unique configuration of vertically stacked 3D flash memory.

Results show average terrestrial and aquatic carbon sinks of +110 ± 37 and +19 ± 0.5 teragrams of carbon per year, respectively.

HE-O-MIEC exhibits an electronic conductivity of 1150 siemens per centimeter and a Li + conductivity of 2.3 × 10 −4  siemens per centimeter at room temperature. The enhanced Li + conductivity is attributed to the large configurational entropy, promoting multicomponent solubility and increased Li + concentration.

Comprehensive tests—including centrifugal, vibrational, and real-world transport scenarios—demonstrated a spill rate of approaching 0%, as well as robust resistance to water sloshing. Notably, a four-tier tower of dual-biomimetic cups mounted on a car retained nearly 100% of their liquid after traversing 50 alternating speed bumps, whereas conventional cups lost more than 40%.

The nanorobot uses gold nanoparticles to bridge palladium (Pd) nanozymes and Lactobacillus crispatus –derived outer membrane vesicles (CMVs). Pd nanozymes catalyze H 2 O 2 into O 2 , facilitating deep tumor penetration, whereas the acidic tumor microenvironment activates Pd nanozymes to produce hydroxyl radicals (·OH), inducing immunogenic cell death.

Here, inspired by modular origami, we propose a set of single-degree of freedom (DOF) reconfigurable modules with rich symmetry configurations through the inherent kinematic bifurcation. Subsequently, all 17 space groups in the Euclidean plane can be achieved with only two sets of module tessellations, which can be reversibly tuned by a simple binary pressurization strategy for air pouches. Furthermore, the selection rules of multipole quasibound states in the continuum via symmetry group tuning in metasurface are established by combining electromagnetic antennas.

          "abstract": "Mitochondria are pivotal regulators of cellular homeostasis, integrating energy metabolism, biosynthesis, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). During apoptosis, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by BCL-2-associated X protein/BCL-2 Homolog Antagonist Killer (BAX/BAK) pores facilitates release of apoptotic factors, while the role of inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) remodeling remains less understood. Here, we identify serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB), a filament-forming serine protease and tumor suppressor, as a regulator of IMM dynamics during apoptosis. LACTB suppression reduces cytochrome c release and apoptosis, whereas its overexpression promotes these effects. LACTB does not affect BAX or Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria. Rather, LACTB is required for apoptosis-induced mitochondrial remodeling, independent of OPA1 processing. Intriguingly, LACTB knockdown does not affect mitochondrial shape changes induced by CCCP treatment, suggesting that LACTB action is apoptosis-specific. Purified LACTB binds and remodels cardiolipin-enriched membrane nanotubes preferentially over planar lipid membranes, suggesting a direct effect in apoptotic membrane remodeling. Collectively, our findings suggest LACTB to be a mediator of apoptosis-induced IMM remodeling, a possible mechanism for tumor suppression in cancer.",

However, a microscopic understanding of the role of phonons is still lacking, particularly regarding their influence on the crossover from the ballistic to the diffusive polariton transport regime. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal polariton dynamics in MoSe 2 monolayers at moderate to high temperatures, explicitly including the phonon-mediated coupling to the intervalley exciton reservoir. We identify three distinct transport regimes: (i) an initial subpicosecond ballistic-like regime characterized by a phonon-induced velocity renormalization, (ii) a transient, few-picosecond superdiffusive regime characterized by strongly enhanced diffusion, and (iii) a slower, exciton-limited diffusion following thermalization.

Direct precipitation from anoxic seawater is unlikely because of its prohibitively slow nucleation rate even in supersaturated solutions. However, recent modeling suggests that siderite may have precipitated at higher temperatures during hydrothermal fluid–seawater mixing in ancient anoxic oceans. Here, we report the presence of iron-rich siderite microparticles (&lt;1.0 micrometers) in 3.49- to 3.25-Ga exhalative iron cherts from the Pilbara Craton, Australia, which we interpret to have formed during venting of iron(II)-rich hydrothermal fluids into anoxic water columns. Geochemical modeling suggests that coexisting magnesium-rich siderite formed in solutions dominated by seawater. The lack of hydrothermal iron siderite and predominance of magnesium siderite in younger analogs indicate that the bulk of siderite in iron formations is diagenetic and formed from marine pore fluids.",

Here, we report two variants modulating these effects, comprising intronic and long-distance–acting regulatory variants of the MITF and KIT genes. We confirm causality through “Holsteinized” mouse models edited for these alleles and show that these variants are likely responsible for spotting traits in other bovine breeds. These effects include epistatic impacts on other bovine coat patterns, such as fine-scale speckling, “black socks,” and reversal of the otherwise dominant, “white-face” trait characteristic of Hereford cattle.",

However, most experiments and theories have studied photosynthetic light harvesting driven by strong coherent laser sources. The quantum states of light are characterized by their photon statistics, in addition to classical properties such as intensity and frequency spectrum. Here, we report experiments that investigate how photon statistics affect a natural photosynthetic system and vice versa. We directly compare how single photons and pseudothermal light from spontaneous parametric down-conversion drive light harvesting in the light-harvesting 2 complex from a purple bacterium. We find that the fluorescence lifetime and quantum efficiency are unchanged while the fluorescence photon statistics are markedly different, resembling that of the incident light, implying that the dynamics do not fundamentally modify the photon statistics. This represents a step toward clarification of the similarities and differences between photosynthetic light harvesting in laboratory and in natural sunlight conditions.",

          "abstract": "Telomerase, crucial for maintaining telomere integrity and genomic stability, is typically silenced in somatic cells with advancing age. In this study, we identify circHERC1 as a regulator of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) transcription. Specifically, circHERC1 binds to the TERT promoter, facilitating the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and c-Fos, thereby activating TERT expression. Notably, circHERC1 expression exhibits a decline with age, which correlates with reduced telomerase activity. Restoration of circHERC1 expression enhances telomerase activity, promotes telomere elongation, and reverses aging-associated phenotypes. Furthermore, delivery of circHERC1 using adeno-associated virus vectors or extracellular vesicles effectively restores telomerase activity, preserves telomere integrity, and mitigates senescence. This intervention leads to improvements in cognitive function, physical performance, and a reduction in inflammation. These findings highlight the important role of circHERC1 in telomerase regulation and the aging process, positioning it as a potential therapeutic target for antiaging interventions.",

We found that hyperoside increases pigeon pea seed set by promoting pollen tube growth, a process that benefits from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Two lncRNAs, lnc187 and lnc999 , are regulated by hyperoside and synergize to regulate target genes. Among them, lnc187 is the key effector; its loss may abolish downstream function. These lncRNAs up-regulate CcGPP (GRAS phosphorylase) kinase expression by binding to its promoter and acting as a scaffold to connect MRP23 and RNA polymerase while simultaneously inhibiting CcGDP (GRAS dephosphorylase) phosphatase activity by binding to key protein sites. Genetic evidence also confirms the relationship between lnc187 / lnc999 , MRP23, and the downstream CcGPP/CcGDP. This study clarifies the flavonoid hyperoside triggered regulatory axis where lnc187 / lnc999 promotes hyperphosphorylated CcGRAS to regulate pollen tube growth and seed set in pigeon pea, offering insights into reproductive development research for high-value woody species.",

Considering rice growth stages, using a flood dynamics model and difference-in-differences, we assessed the causal impact of rice crop submergence on yield losses from 1980 to 2015. Globally, these floods reduce annual rice yield by 4.3%, with China’s East Coast experiencing 14% losses. Since 2000, yield losses have increased due to more frequent extreme floods, a trend anticipated to continue. Our findings highlight the need for flood-resistant rice cultivars to mitigate risks and support global food security, and implement adaptation strategies against both flood and drought rice yield losses.",

Here, we combine single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to map pancreatic cell populations across space and time, from embryonic development to adult homeostasis in mice. Using these maps, we resolve spatial heterogeneity among pancreatic cell types and uncover epithelial-mesenchymal units as basic tissue niches, which we functionally characterize in both mouse and human models. We also demonstrate that the mesenchymal lineage diversifies into various specialized subtypes during development, but this complexity diminishes over time, ultimately converging into a few fibroblast subtypes in adulthood. Together, our findings reveal how different progenitor lineages codevelop and organize into structured communities that establish a functional pancreas, providing a framework to guide in vitro organogenesis and tissue engineering for pancreatic diseases.",

By combining a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice with a globally curved 1D perovskite grating, we fabricated gradient moiré photonic superlattices with continuously variable twist angles. We revealed how the moiré interlayer coupling at the high-symmetry points on the Brillouin zone boundaries can produce additional cavity modes with twist angle–controlled wave vectors. We showed that the moiré-induced band-edge modes can support lasing with low thresholds. By sweeping the pump area to access different twist angles, we achieved tuning of laser emission angles in a continuous and wide range (&gt;30°) from a single device. Our work provides a highly tunable platform for moiré-induced light-matter interactions, which opens prospects for programmable and intelligent photonic technologies.",

In a departure from multiple regression, our algebraic analysis uses minimal measurements to fully characterize the network parameters without a priori parameter estimates or iterative computation. We apply this suite of techniques to single-resonator and coupled-pair clusters and find excellent agreement with expected parameter values and broader spectral response. Our approach provides a nonregressive framework for accurately characterizing a range of classical and quantum resonator systems, offering a versatile modeling tool applicable across multiple disciplines and advancing the development of programmable NEMS networks.",

While the mTE of codons is canonically associated with their corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA) isoacceptors, its regulation by amino acids in mammalian cells remains unexplored. We found that ELAC2, a 3′ tRNA maturation endonuclease, decreases the mTE of UC[C/U] serine (Ser) codons in response to Ser limitation. Ablation of ELAC2 restored UC[C/U] mTE but reduced the mTE of AG[U/C] Ser codons. Among the tRNA Ser isoacceptors, tRNA Ser(GCU) decreased the most in ELAC2 -deficient cells. Unexpectedly, tRNA Ser(GCU) delivery restored AG[U/C] mTE and reduced UC[C/U] mTE in ELAC2 -deficient cells. Last, we deciphered the effects of Ser-sensitive codons on mRNA translation and the human proteome.

          "abstract": "There is currently no effective treatment for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), half of which result from malignant progression of neurofibromas (NFs) in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NFs are due to biallelic loss-of-function of NF1, which negatively regulates the RAS pathway, in the Schwann cell lineage. We generated a conditional Nf1-mutant mouse model where NFs spontaneously transform into MPNSTs, faithfully recapitulating the human situation. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling demonstrated progression of NFs into MPNSTs, with a glial-to-mesenchymal transition. Sox9 was identified as a marker of this transition and key player in tumor growth. The transition is followed by a loss of the tumor suppressor gene (TSG) Cdkn2a and acquisition of pathogenic variants of other TSGs. Finally, a proof-of-concept drug screen aimed at reducing Sox9 expression in tumor cells identified 12 FDA-approved drugs. Notably, several of these agents target the RAS signaling cascade, suggesting that multi-targeted inhibition of this pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy against MPNSTs.",

The probe achieves synergistic fluorescence activation through covalent binding with exposed thiols and subsequent stabilization within the local hydrophobic microenvironment of unfolded proteins. This dual-activation property allows for precise differentiation between folded and unfolded proteins in foam cells, facilitating spatiotemporal mapping of protein disorder at various stages of atherosclerosis. Notably, the probe detects early-stage unknown or tiny plaques within 4 to 8 weeks by identifying protein unfolding events before conventional Oil Red O staining and clinical ultrasonography, demonstrating unprecedented sensitivity for subclinical plaque prediction.

We report measurement of the geometry of the shock breakout through unprecedentedly early spectropolarimetry of the nearby type II supernova 2024ggi starting ~1.2 days after the explosion. The measurement indicates a well-defined symmetry axis of the shock breakout, which is also shared by the hydrogen-rich envelope that emerged after the circumstellar matter was engulfed by the ejecta, revealing a persisting and prominent symmetry axis throughout the explosion.

Integrating platelet transcriptomic data, we identified the C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) as significantly up-regulated in MI platelets and a key mediator of EC mitochondrial dysfunction.

By developing a mathematical model, we provide a mechanistic explanation: An oncogenic variant that elicits higher cancer mortality in older and less-reproductive individuals is detrimental to cooperative mammalian societies but can lead to a counterintuitive overcompensation in population size and fitness within competitive contexts.

CA1 pyramidal neurons (CA1PNs) exhibit spatially tuned activity during navigation, but how their context-dependent tuning evolves during learning and upon context change is incompletely understood. We monitored Ca 2+ activity of dorsal CA1PNs in mice in a virtual go/no-go task series that required both spatial navigation and rule learning based on nonspatial environmental features. Spatial and context-dependent activity of CA1PNs developed sequentially during learning, parallel with behavioral performance. Upon switching to a new task condition involving familiar and novel environments, neuronal activity disorganized rapidly and extensively even in the unchanged environment. In contrast, reward reversal in unchanged environments induced more gradual activity changes, associated with behavioral adaptation. Our results indicate that, during learning a spatial-contextual task, CA1PNs initially generalize between environments coding primarily spatial position, but, with experience, their activity gradually reorganizes to form partially distinct representations within a shared contextual framework.",

Postneonatal fibroblasts exhibited impaired activation of cardiac gene programs and persistent expression of fibrotic and inflammatory signatures. A loss-of-function screen identified Nr4a3 as a central repressor. Nr4a3 overexpression promoted senescence and suppressed iCM induction, whereas knockdown enhanced reprogramming in murine and human senescent CFs. Mechanistically, Nr4a3 depletion remodeled the chromatin landscape from a fibrotic and inflammatory state to a regenerative cardiac program. Blocking downstream Cxcl14 restored reprogramming in refractory fibroblasts. In vivo, Nr4a3 knockdown improved heart function following myocardial infarction.

Knockdown of Rbm20 at male-producing temperature induces male-to-female sex reversal, whereas Rbm20 overexpression at female-producing temperature triggers male development. RBM20 represses the splicing of Wilms tumor suppressor WT1 at KTS sites, thereby governing the balance of +KTS and −KTS isoforms between different temperatures. In addition, functional analysis reveals that the Wt1  +KTS variant is both necessary and sufficient to drive male development in T. scripta . This study demonstrates that RBM20 activates the male pathway by repressing the Wt1 KTS splicing in T. scripta , thus establishing causality and a direct genetic link between alternative splicing mechanism and vertebrate sex determination.",

However, this versatility also renders them susceptible to unintended deformations under fluctuating magnetic fields. The challenge is further compounded by medical imaging limitations that hinder accurate estimation of device pose and shape and by anatomical boundaries that enforce misalignment with the field. Collectively, these factors can cause uncontrolled shape change and functional failure. Here, we focus on slender magnetic soft structures to investigate their stability under misaligned fields. Our anisotropic design, achieved through flexural joints, yields ~52-fold higher bending stiffness in the preferred direction and ~18-fold higher torsional stiffness than isotropic beams. This structure serves as a building block for stable spiral tentacles, helices, planar sheets, expandable devices, cubes, and three-dimensional tessellation. We validate robustness through wormlike self-propulsion, guidewire navigation with 30-fold lower insertion force, and capsule peristaltic locomotion, advancing safer, more controllable devices.",

We realize a PCF with guided modes produced by photonic band structure topology rather than conventional mode-trapping mechanisms. The design, which is compatible with the stack-and-draw fabrication process, consists of a cross-sectional photonic topological crystalline insulator with a disclination. A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localizer that makes minimal assumptions about the band structure. Our experiments on the fabricated fiber show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10 to 20 decibels per kilometer, which do not increase substantially when the fiber is bent. A comparable solid-core PCF of conventional design exhibits substantially higher bending losses. Optical fibers based on topological modes hold promise for improved performance and versatile functionalities.",

Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE, the partitioning of metabolized carbon for microbial growth) is crucial to the fate of soil carbon, but how it changes with warming remains unknown. Here, in contrast to the often hypothesized negative temperature dependence of microbial CUE, we observed a positive microbial CUE-temperature relationship after a decade of modest ecosystem-level warming (+1.0° and +2.1°C) in subtropical China. The warmed microbial community shifted toward more K -strategists, and the increased network stability drove metabolic thermal adjustments. These thermal adjustments resulted in homeostasis, such that warmed soils did not differ from unwarmed (+0°C) soils in microbial respiration and growth, weakening the initially stimulated carbon decomposition. These results suggest that warming-induced soil-plant system imbalance can recover to a prewarming steady state within a few seasons, mitigating predicted increases in soil carbon losses.",

In the Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-X, we perform experiments where meltwater fluxes representing plausible tipping trajectories of the GIS and WAIS are applied. We find that WAIS meltwater input can increase or decrease the AMOC resilience to GIS meltwater. Also, we find that it can completely prevent an AMOC collapse, confirming in a comprehensive model what was previously found in conceptual frameworks. Moreover, we find this stabilization to occur for ice sheet tipping trajectories that are relevant under high future greenhouse gas emission scenarios.",

Acute heart failure complicated with severe myocardial iron deposition was identified in the 31-year-old male proband of PIEZO1 D669Y variant. However, PIEZO1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutation D674Y mice and cardiomyocyte-specific Piezo1 overexpression disrupted cardiac function besides iron overload. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we observed suppression of lipid metabolism pathways in cardiomyocytes with the PIEZO1 GOF mutation, with forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) as a key mediator in lipid metabolism pathways. Specifically, the PIEZO1 GOF mutation increased Ca 2+ levels, leading to calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation and subsequent FOXO3 down-regulation. Together, we demonstrate that PIEZO1 GOF mutation contributes to cardiomyopathy by disrupting myocardial lipid metabolism.

In yeast, Osh6 transfers phosphatidylserine (PS) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane (PM) by exchange with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. We investigated why its activity depends on Ist2, an ER-resident lipid scramblase that connects the ER to the PM via an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We found that Osh6, in a lipid-loaded state, binds the Ist2 IDR with micromolar affinity and functions at ER-PM contact sites only if its binding site within the IDR is sufficiently distant from the ER membrane. We determined, in reconstituted contact sites, that the association of Osh6 with the Ist2 IDR enables rapid, directed PS transfer. We identified the Ist2-binding site in Osh6 by molecular modeling and functional analyses. Last, we established that Ist2’s scramblase activity sustains Osh6-mediated PS transfer between membranes. Identifying these functional partnerships highlights why lipid transport processes are organized in membrane contact sites.",

We observed pronounced mitochondrial disruption in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, including distorted ultrastructure and CHCHD2 aggregation, as well as disrupted mitochondrial protein-protein interactions in brain lysates. These abnormalities were associated with a whole-body metabolic shift toward glycolysis, elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), and progressive accumulation of aggregated α-synuclein. In idiopathic PD, CHCHD2 gene expression also correlated with α-synuclein levels in vulnerable dopaminergic neurons, and CHCHD2 protein accumulated in early Lewy aggregates.

          "abstract": "Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a highly lethal malignancy with a 5-year survival rate of only 18.8%, largely due to late-stage diagnosis in the absence of effective population-wide screening. Survival improves to 42.9% when detected at a localized stage (I/II). More than 90% of esophageal adenocarcinoma cases are diagnosed without prior identification of Barrett’s esophagus, its only known precursor. We present a swallowable, string-tethered capsule that expands in the stomach to enable atraumatic retrieval of esophageal epithelial cells without sedation or endoscopic guidance, completing the procedure in under 3 minutes. Capsules are fabricated via gas-foamed expansion of nanofiber mats or hybrid aerogel formation, enabling rapid in situ reexpansion upon gastric fluid exposure and safe retrieval. In swine studies, capsules dissolved within 2 minutes, reexpanded within seconds, required minimal retrieval force, and consistently captured intact epithelial layers without injury. This platform could enable low-cost, high-throughput esophageal sampling in primary care and resource-limited settings.",
