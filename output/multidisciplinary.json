          "abstract": "Honeybees are important crop pollinators, but they increasingly face pollen starvation as a result of agricultural intensification and climate change 1 . Frequent flowering dearth periods and high-density rearing conditions weaken colonies, which often leads to their demise 2 . Beekeepers provide colonies with pollen substitutes, but these feeds do not sustain brood production because they lack essential sterols found in pollen 3,4 . Here we describe a technological advance in honeybee nutrition with wide-reaching impacts on global food security. We first measured the quantity and proportion of sterols present in honeybee tissues. Using this information, we genetically engineered a strain of the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica to produce a mixture of essential sterols for bees and incorporated this yeast strain into an otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Colonies exclusively fed with this diet reared brood for significantly longer than those fed diets without suitable sterols. The use of this method to incorporate sterol supplements into pollen substitutes will enable honeybee colonies to produce brood in the absence of floral pollen. Optimized diets created using this yeast strain could also reduce competition between bee species for access to natural floral resources and stem the decline in wild bee populations.",

          "abstract": "Nuclear fusion research for energy applications aims to create conditions that release more energy than required to initiate the fusion process1. To generate meaningful amounts of energy, fuels such as deuterium need to be spatially confined to increase the collision probability of particles2,3,4. We therefore set out to investigate whether electrochemically loading a metal lattice with deuterium fuel could increase the probability of nuclear fusion events. Here we report a benchtop fusion reactor that enabled us to bombard a palladium metal target with deuterium ions. These deuterium ions undergo deuterium–deuterium fusion reactions within the palladium metal. We showed that the in situ electrochemical loading of deuterium into the palladium target resulted in a 15(2)% increase in deuterium–deuterium fusion rates. This experiment shows how the electrochemical loading of a metal target at the electronvolt energy scale can affect nuclear reactions at the megaelectronvolt energy scale.",

          "abstract": "Doping an antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors1,2. To describe the competition between tunnelling t of hole dopants and AFM spin interactions J, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic t–J model3 and the direct analogue quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought4,5. Here we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest-neighbour (NNN) tunnellings t′ (refs. 6,7,8,9,10) and hard-core bosonic holes11 using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We use coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes12, to implement a tunable bosonic t–J–V model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for |t/J| ≪ 1 and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnellings t′ and perturbative pair tunnelling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of t. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models13 to a larger class of t–J and spin-1 models14,15.",

          "abstract": "Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-established factor of poor prognosis in multiple cancer types1, yet its mechanism remains unclear. Here we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into the role of PNI and cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our study demonstrates that PNI and CINI of tumour-associated nerves are associated with poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy among patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and gastric cancer. Electron microscopy and electrical conduction analyses reveal that cancer cells degrade the nerve fibre myelin sheets. The injured neurons respond by autonomously initiating IL-6- and type I interferon-mediated inflammation to promote nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumour grows, the CINI burden increases, and its associated inflammation becomes chronic and skews the general immune tone within the tumour microenvironment into a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signalling process: denervating the tumour, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (Atf3), knockout of interferon-α receptor signalling (Ifnar1−/−) or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade. Our findings demonstrate the direct immunoregulatory roles of CINI and its therapeutic potential.",

          "abstract": "Polyamines are regulatory metabolites with key roles in transcription, translation, cell signalling and autophagy 1 . They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration, and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels 2 . Polyamines have been linked to pain, showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models 3 . However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. Here, undertaking a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK Biobank (UKB), we found a significant association between pain intensity and variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system, Slc45a4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron subtypes within the dorsal root ganglion, including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure reveals a regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat- and algogen-induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of C-polymodal nociceptors. Our findings therefore establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol-use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are major causes of death and liver transplantation1. The gut–liver axis has a crucial yet poorly understood role in ALD pathogenesis, which depends on microbial translocation. Intestinal goblet cells (GCs) educate the immune system by forming GC-associated antigen passages (GAPs) on activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (mAChR4, also known as M4), enabling sampling of luminal antigens by lamina propria antigen-presenting cells. Here we show that chronic alcohol use in humans and mice downregulates small intestinal mAChR4 and reduces GAP formation, disrupting antimicrobial immunity. This is reversed on activation of intestinal IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST, also known as glycoprotein 130; gp130), which restores mAChR4 expression and GAP formation, enabling induction of downstream type-3 innate lymphoid cell-derived IL-22 and antimicrobial REG3 proteins. This blunts translocation of enteric bacteria to the liver, thereby conferring ALD resistance. GAP induction by GC-specific mAChR4 activation was essential and sufficient for prevention of ethanol-induced steatohepatitis. These results lay the foundation for a therapeutic approach using mAChR4 or IL6ST agonists to promote GAP formation and prevent ALD by inhibiting microbial translocation.",

          "abstract": "The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10 8 and 10 6 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , respectively 1–10 . Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower 11–17 . Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10 7 cm −2 and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 10 7 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record 9,10 . This quality enables Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaux below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron–electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3–5 compared with unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.",

          "abstract": "Tight control of intracellular Ca 2+ levels is fundamental as they are used to control numerous signal transduction pathways 1 . Plasma membrane Ca 2+ -ATPases (PMCAs) have a crucial role in this process by extruding Ca 2+ against a steep concentration gradient from the cytosol to the extracellular space 2 . Although new details of PMCA biology are constantly being uncovered, the structural basis of the most distinguishing features of these pumps, namely, transport rates in the kilohertz range and regulation of activity by the plasma membrane phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , has so far remained elusive. Here we present the structures of mouse PMCA2 in the presence and absence of its accessory subunit neuroplastin in eight different stages of its transport cycle. Combined with whole-cell recordings that accurately track PMCA-mediated Ca 2+ extrusion in intact cells, these structures enable us to establish the first comprehensive transport model for a PMCA, reveal the role of disease-causing mutations and uncover the structural underpinnings of regulatory PMCA–phospholipid interaction. The transport cycle-dependent dynamics of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 are fundamental for its role as a ‘latch’ promoting the fast release of Ca 2+ and opening a passageway for counter-ions. These actions are required for maintaining the ultra-fast transport cycle. Moreover, we identify the PtdIns(4,5)P 2 -binding site as an unanticipated target for drug-mediated manipulation of intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Our work provides detailed structural insights into the uniquely fast operation of native PMCA-type Ca 2+ pumps and its control by membrane lipids and drugs.",

          "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) contain near-universal loss-of-function mutations in RB1 and TP53, compromising the G1–S checkpoint and leading to dysregulated E2F activity1. Other cancers similarly disrupt the G1–S checkpoint through loss of CDKN2A or amplification of cyclin D or cyclin E, also resulting in excessive E2F activity2,3. Although E2F activation is essential for cell cycle progression, hyperactivation promotes apoptosis4,5,6,7,8,9, presenting a therapeutic vulnerability. Cyclin proteins use a conserved hydrophobic patch to bind to substrates bearing short linear RxL motifs10,11,12,13. Cyclin A represses E2F through an RxL-dependent interaction10,14, which, when disrupted, hyperactivates E2F15. However, this substrate interface has remained difficult to target. Here we developed cell-permeable, orally bioavailable macrocyclic peptides that inhibit RxL-mediated interactions of cyclins with their substrates. Dual inhibitors of cyclin A and cyclin B RxL motifs (cyclin A/Bi) selectively kill SCLC cells and other cancer cells with high E2F activity. Genetic screens revealed that cyclin A/Bi induces apoptosis through cyclin B- and CDK2-dependent spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Mechanistically, cyclin A/Bi hyperactivates E2F and cyclin B by blocking cyclin A–E2F and cyclin B–MYT1 RxL interactions. Notably, cyclin A/Bi promoted the formation of neomorphic cyclin B–CDK2 complexes, which drive spindle assembly checkpoint activation and mitotic cell death. Finally, orally administered cyclin A/Bi showed robust anti-tumour activity in chemotherapy-resistant SCLC patient-derived xenografts. These findings reveal gain-of-function mechanisms through which cyclin A/Bi triggers apoptosis and support their development for E2F-driven cancers.",

Current N2O sources outpace N2O sinks, emphasizing the need for comprehensive understanding of processes that consume N2O. Microbes that express the enzyme N2O reductase (N2OR) convert N2O to climate change-neutral dinitrogen (N2). Known N2ORs belong to the canonical clade I and clade II NosZ reductases and are considered key enzymes for N2O reduction2,3,4. Here we report a previously unrecognized protein family with a role in N2O reduction, clade III lactonase-type N2OR (L-N2OR), which diverges in sequence from canonical NosZ but conserves three-dimensional protein structural features. Integrated physiological, metagenomic, proteomic and structural modelling studies demonstrate that L-N2ORs catalyse N2O reduction. L-N2OR genes occur in several phyla, predominantly in uncultured taxa with broad geographic distribution. Our findings expand the known diversity of N2ORs and implicate previously unrecognized taxa (for example, Nitrospinota) in N2O consumption. The expansion of N2OR diversity and the identification of a novel type of catalyst for N2O reduction advances the understanding of N2O sinks, has implications for greenhouse gas emission and climate change modelling, and expands opportunities for innovative biotechnologies aimed at curbing N2O emissions5,6.",

Here we identify and characterize the N-acyl-cyclolysine (ACL) system—a cell-density-dependent chemical signalling system specific to and widespread in the phylum Bacteroidota (formerly Bacteroidetes)—and show that it regulates the expression of co-localized operons encoding diverse secreted molecules. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, combined with structural studies of a key biosynthetic enzyme, AclA, we elucidate the molecular structure of various ACLs and their complete biosynthetic pathway involving l-lysine acylation and ATP-dependent cyclization. Furthermore, we find that secreted ACLs are sensed by a dedicated transcription factor, AclR, resulting in the expression of associated operons and the autoinduction of ACL biosynthesis. Moreover, we show that different Bacteroidota strains produce structurally diverse ACLs and encode transcription factors with varying ligand specificities. Finally, we find that the acl circuit is widely distributed and transcribed in human gut and oral microbiome samples, with clear evidence for an active role in regulating associated operons under host colonization conditions. Understanding the function of the ACL system in different contexts has the potential to reveal details about the biology, ecology and chemistry of the Bacteroidota and how members of this phylum interact with their environments and hosts.",

          "abstract": "Living cells depend on an intricate network of chemical reactions catalysed by enzymes, which sometimes make mistakes that lead to their inactivation. Here we report a metabolite-based mechanism for preserving enzyme function in an unfavourable environment. We found that the enzyme TGDS produces UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, a mimic of the reaction intermediate of the enzyme UXS1, which regenerates the essential cofactor NAD + within the catalytic pocket of UXS1 by completing its catalytic cycle. Thus, the production of an ‘enzyme-rescue metabolite’ by TGDS represents a mechanism for maintaining the activity of an enzyme in a subcellular compartment where NAD + is scarce. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that the inability to produce sufficient amounts of this enzyme-rescue metabolite leads to the inactivation of UXS1, impairing the synthesis of specific glycans that are crucial for skeletal development. This provides an explanation for the development of the hereditary skeletal disorder Catel–Manzke syndrome in individuals with TGDS deficiency. Defects in similar protective layers might contribute to metabolic changes in other diseases that cannot be explained with common concepts in metabolic biochemistry.",

          "abstract": "Human-caused climate change worsens with every increment of additional warming, although some impacts can develop abruptly. The potential for abrupt changes is far less understood in the Antarctic compared with the Arctic, but evidence is emerging for rapid, interacting and sometimes self-perpetuating changes in the Antarctic environment. A regime shift has reduced Antarctic sea-ice extent far below its natural variability of past centuries, and in some respects is more abrupt, non-linear and potentially irreversible than Arctic sea-ice loss. A marked slowdown in Antarctic Overturning Circulation is expected to intensify this century and may be faster than the anticipated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown. The tipping point for unstoppable ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be exceeded even under best-case CO2 emission reduction pathways, potentially initiating global tipping cascades. Regime shifts are occurring in Antarctic and Southern Ocean biological systems through habitat transformation or exceedance of physiological thresholds, and compounding breeding failures are increasing extinction risk. Amplifying feedbacks are common between these abrupt changes in the Antarctic environment, and stabilizing Earth’s climate with minimal overshoot of 1.5 °C will be imperative alongside global adaptation measures to minimise and prepare for the far-reaching impacts of Antarctic and Southern Ocean abrupt changes.",

However, the mechanisms that regulate the stability of somatic cell fates remain unclear. Here, we use the somatic plasticity of thymic epithelial cells, which facilitates the selection of a self-discriminating T cell repertoire3, as a physiological model system to show that fluctuations in background chromatin accessibility in nucleosome-dense regions are amplified during thymic epithelial maturation for the ectopic expression of genes restricted to other specialized cell types. This chromatin destabilization was not dependent on AIRE-induced transcription but was preceded by repression of the tumour suppressor p53. Augmenting p53 activity indirectly stabilized chromatin, inhibited ectopic transcription, limited cellular plasticity and caused multi-organ autoimmunity. Genomic regions with heightened chromatin accessibility noise were selectively enriched for nucleosome-destabilizing polymeric AT tracts and were associated with elevated baseline DNA damage and transcriptional initiation. Taken together, our findings define molecular levers that modulate cell fate integrity and are used by thymic epithelial cells for immunological tolerance.",

          "abstract": "Stars are initially powered by the fusion of hydrogen to helium. These ashes serve as fuel in a series of stages1,2,3, transforming massive stars into a structure of shells. These are composed of natal hydrogen on the outside and consecutively heavier compositions inside, predicted to be dominated by He, C/O, O/Ne/Mg and O/Si/S (refs. 4,5). Silicon and sulfur are fused into iron, leading to the collapse of the core and either a supernova explosion or the formation of a black hole6,7,8,9. Stripped stars, in which the outer hydrogen layer has been removed and the internal He-rich or even the C/O layer below it is exposed10, provide evidence for this shell structure and the cosmic element production mechanism it reflects. The supernova types that arise from stripped stars embedded in shells of circumstellar material (CSM) confirm this scenario11,12,13,14,15. However, direct evidence for the most interior shells, which are responsible for producing elements heavier than oxygen, is lacking. Here we report the discovery of the supernova (SN) 2021yfj resulting from a star stripped to its O/Si/S-rich layer. We directly observe a thick, massive Si/S-rich shell, expelled by the progenitor shortly before the supernova explosion. Exposing such an inner stellar layer is theoretically challenging and probably requires a rarely observed mass-loss mechanism. This rare supernova event reveals advanced stages of stellar evolution, forming heavier elements, including silicon, sulfur and argon, than those detected on the surface of any known class of massive stars.",

The CD5 + B-1a subset expresses anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and CTLA4 and can be immunoregulatory 4–6 . Unlike conventional B cells that are continuously replenished, B-1a cells are produced early in life and maintained through self-renewal 7 . Here we show that the transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1 are critical regulators of B-1a cells. LEF1 expression is highest in fetal and bone marrow B-1 progenitors, whereas the levels of TCF1 are higher in splenic and peritoneal B-1 cells than in B-1 progenitors. TCF1–LEF1 double deficient mice have reduced B-1a cells and defective B-1a cell maintenance. These transcription factors promote MYC-dependent metabolic pathways and induce a stem-like population upon activation, partly via IL-10 production. In the absence of TCF1 and LEF1, B-1 cells proliferate excessively and acquire an exhausted phenotype with reduced IL-10 and PDL1 expression. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of B-1 cells lacking TCF1 and LEF1 fails to suppress brain inflammation. These transcription factors are also expressed in human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B cells and in a B-1-like population that is abundant in pleural fluid and circulation of some patients with pleural infection. Our findings define a TCF1–LEF1-driven transcriptional program that integrates stemness and regulatory function in B-1a cells.",

However, it is unclear how brain states arise that are able to dissociate an animal from its external world, enabling quiescent behaviours, while retaining vigilance to salient sensory cues2. Here we describe a neural mechanism in Drosophila that creates neural filters that engender a brain state that enables quiescent behaviour by generating coherent slow-wave activity (SWA)3 between sleep-need4 (R5)- and locomotion-promoting neural networks5. The coherence of SWA is subject to circadian and homeostatic control and can be modulated by sensory experience. Mimicry of coherent SWA reveals that R5 oscillations reduce responsiveness to visual stimuli by rhythmically associating neural activity of locomotion-promoting cells, effectively overruling their output. These networks can regulate behavioural responsiveness by providing antagonistic inputs to downstream head-direction cells6,7. Thus, coherent oscillations provide the mechanistic basis for a neural filter by temporally associating opposing signals, resulting in reduced functional connectivity between locomotion-gating and navigational networks. We propose that the temporal pattern of SWA provides the structure to create a ‘breakable’ filter, permitting the animal to enter a quiescent state, while providing the architecture for strong or salient stimuli to ‘break’ the neural interaction, consequently allowing the animal to react.",

          "abstract": "Conditional deletion of Caspase-8 in epidermal keratinocytes (Casp8E-KO) causes necroptosis-driven lethal dermatitis1-7. Here, we discover that Casp8 loss leads to accumulation of cytosolic DNA responsible for the activation of a cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon (IFN) gene (STING)-mediated transcriptional program. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicate that STING upregulates both Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP1), and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Combined Casp8-deficiency- and STING-activation-driven accumulation of Z-nuclei acids, activates ZBP1 and triggers formation of a ZBP1–RIPK1–RIPK3 complex independently of FADD-RIPK1-RIPK3 complex enabling necroptosis execution. Genetically, we reveal a functional overlap between STING and ZBP1 as drivers of lethal dermatitis independently of TNFR1, uncovering a novel aetiology of necroptotic inflammation. Since gain-of-function mutations in human STING cause STING-Associated Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI), we assessed the role of STING-induced necroptosis in SAVI’s aetiology. Chronic activation of STING in patients orchestrates a necroptotic transcriptional program which is confirmed in the N153S-SAVI preclinical mouse model where immune cell–driven pathology and lethality are remarkably rescued by RIPK3 co-deletion. These findings establish STING-driven ZBP1-mediated necroptosis as a central pathogenic mechanism in both Casp8-deficient inflammation and SAVI and suggest that targeting the ZBP1-RIPK3-MLKL axis holds therapeutic potential for interferonopathies characterised by excessive necroptosis.",

How lipid species are selectively sorted between organelles to maintain specific membrane identities is largely unclear, owing to the difficulty of imaging lipid transport in cells 3 . Here we measured the retrograde transport and metabolism of individual lipid species in mammalian cells using time-resolved fluorescence imaging of bifunctional lipid probes in combination with ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry and mathematical modelling. Quantification of lipid flux between organelles revealed that directional, non-vesicular lipid transport is responsible for fast, species-selective lipid sorting, in contrast to the slow, unspecific vesicular membrane trafficking. Using genetic perturbations, we found that coupling between energy-dependent lipid flipping and non-vesicular transport is a mechanism for directional lipid transport. Comparison of metabolic conversion and transport rates showed that non-vesicular transport dominates the organelle distribution of lipids, while species-specific phospholipid metabolism controls neutral lipid accumulation. Our results provide the first quantitative map of retrograde lipid flux in cells 4 . We anticipate that our pipeline for mapping of lipid flux through physical and chemical space in cells will boost our understanding of lipids in cell biology and disease.",

FlowER also enables downstream estimation of thermodynamic or kinetic feasibility and manifests a degree of chemical intuition in reaction prediction tasks.

Mechanistically, axonal injury promotes gliomagenesis by triggering Wallerian degeneration, a targetable active programme of axonal death 3 , which we show increases neuroinflammation and tumour proliferation. Inactivation of SARM1, the key enzyme activated in response to injury that mediates Wallerian degeneration 4 , was sufficient to break this tumour-promoting feedforward loop, leading to the development of less advanced terminal tumours and prolonged survival in mice.

Although carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) are widely used reductants, the mechanisms by which they work are often presumed to be similar, both involving lattice oxygen removal6,7,8,9. However, because of growing interest in replacing CO with H2 to lower CO2 emissions, distinguishing gas-specific reduction pathways is critical. Yet, capturing these atomic-scale processes under reactive gas and high-temperature conditions remains challenging. Here we use environmental transmission electron microscopy, which is capable of real-time, atomic-resolution imaging of gas–solid redox reactions10,11,12,13,14,15,16, to directly visualize the gas-dependent oxide reduction dynamics in NiO. We show that CO drives surface nucleation and the growth of metallic Ni islands, leading to self-limiting surface metallization. Conversely, H2 activates a coupled surface-to-bulk transformation, where protons from dissociated H2 infiltrate the oxide lattice to promote the inward migration of surface-generated oxygen vacancies and enabling bulk metallization. By contrast, oxygen vacancies formed by CO remain confined near the surface, where they rapidly form a metallic Ni layer that inhibits further reduction. These results reveal distinct atomistic pathways for CO and H2 and provide insights that may guide metallurgical processes and catalyst design.",

Amino acids activate mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases, which are regulated by GATOR, a supercomplex consisting of GATOR1, KICSTOR and the nutrient-sensing hub GATOR2 (refs. 6,7,8,9). GATOR2 forms an octagonal cage, with its distinct WD40 domain β-propellers interacting with GATOR1 and the leucine sensors Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 (SESN1 and SESN2) and the arginine sensor CASTOR1 (ref. 10). The mechanisms through which these sensors regulate GATOR2 and how they detach from it upon binding their cognate amino acids remain unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of a stabilized GATOR2 bound to either Sestrin2 or CASTOR1. The sensors occupy distinct and non-overlapping binding sites, disruption of which selectively impairs the ability of mTORC1 to sense individual amino acids. We also resolved the apo (leucine-free) structure of Sestrin2 and characterized the amino acid-induced structural rearrangements within Sestrin2 and CASTOR1 that trigger their dissociation from GATOR2. Binding of either sensor restricts the dynamic WDR24 β-propeller of GATOR2, a domain essential for nutrient-dependent mTORC1 activation. These findings reveal the allosteric mechanisms that convey amino acid sufficiency to GATOR2 and the ensuing structural changes that lead to mTORC1 activation.",

Chrononauts aren’t part of the past. Locals can kill us without affecting anything. The people I’m observing are tolerant of strangers and travellers, rarely killing them out of hand the way some communities do, but there are exceptions. So, I’m well disguised.\n\nMy camera and recording gear are invisible even to a close examination. My poorly tanned leather clothing reeks so badly I was thrown off public transport on my way to get to the transmission station and had to ride in a taxi with the windows open, paying double fare, to get to my slot in time. After I applied a last-minute dash of odorant, the technicians at the transmission station were breathing through cupped hands. At least it stopped them bitching about payment. They don’t like us travelling on credit. If we get killed, they might not get paid.\n\nI’m stiff and cold from a night on the ground under a thin blanket, but looking forward to my third and final day down Arrow. I’ve got easily enough video to fill my contract for a half-hour feature, which means I can pay off the transmission cost and cover my rent for another two months. With a bit more material, I can make a freelance piece and market it independently, showcasing my skills and giving me a chance to get off the Arrow and into production.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nI drape my shoulder bag and set off for the morning market, a collection of flat boulders and improvised tables on the edge of a cluster of low, single-room huts made of bush wood and clay. Even after two days down Arrow, the smells of rancid fat and rotten food in the market are overwhelming. A nearby open latrine adds to the mix.\n\nThe footing is treacherous. There are holes and mounds of earth everywhere. Why haven’t the locals eaten these burrowing rodents? Superstition? Religion? I take establishing shots showing the burrows’ proximity to structures and close-ups of the holes. Academics pay for this sort of stuff, especially if it disproves someone else’s long-held theory.\n\nInto the market, and I pan the hidden camera to take in filthy dry-stone walls and clouds of flies swarming around raw meat. I’ve been living on food bars and water surreptitiously micro filtered in what looks like a leather water pouch.\n\nA rat scampers by. Someone throws a rock at it. All good stuff. The yuck factor sells.\n\nI turn the corner and come face-to-face with a couple. The woman steps behind the man, as is the custom, and gawks at me. The man could be my down-on-his-luck twin. His worn leather is greasy, his arms thin, his cheeks sunken and hollow but his skin is the same light brown as mine. The face framed in roughly chopped hair is mine, too. It’s like looking into a mirror but we are thousands of years down Arrow from mirrors.\n\nIt’s pure cinematic gold. This could make a cameo. But how will I talk to him? In my role as a traveller, I know just enough basic pidgin to get by. An interview is beyond me.\n\n“Greetings,” I say and extend both hands at waist height and open in the ‘no weapons’ gesture. He stares at my face without even glancing at my hands. He looks as shocked as if I were lunging at him and takes a step backwards. One foot goes into a burrow, the other comes down on a loose round stone and he goes over backwards, arms flailing, incredulous eyes still locked on my face. His head hits a protruding rock with a sound like a pumpkin dropped on concrete.\n\nHis body convulses for seconds then goes still. He stops breathing.\n\nSo much for my cameo. People are rushing in from all sides, encircling me. Time to leave. The woman glances down at the corpse then steps forward and speaks softly. I pick out the words ‘mine’ and ‘you’. Does she want me to be his replacement? No, thank you. I go to press the button for emergency recall. They’ll see me vanish, of course, but that story will merge with all their other stories of ghosts and miracles. Nothing will resonate down history to the future. It’s been done dozens of times.",

          "authors": " Ananya",
          "abstract": "Amphibious Anthropologies: Living in Wet Environments Edited by Alejandro Camargo, Luisa Cortesi and Franz Krause Univ. Washington Press (2025)\n\nCoastal zones, river basins, marshes and other amphibious environments — where the boundaries between land and water are constantly redrawn —have always been places of shifting wetness. Climate change has deepened this instability, making the borders between wet and dry regions more erratic and unpredictable.\n\nIn Amphibious Anthropologies, nine essays explore these watery, in-between landscapes, offering insights from people who have long lived in the nebulous zones between land and water. These communities have learnt to adapt, to build sustainable futures in places where permanence is an illusion and where the ebb and flow of water is not a threat to be conquered, but a force to live with. The book is a guide for navigating a world in flux — taught by those who have always known that solid ground is not always solid.\n\nWhy farmers are beginning to take their government to court over climate change\n\nTake the people living on the floodplains of northern Bihar, India. Accustomed to frequent flooding, they build circular embankments around their homes. The shapes of these embankments work with the flow of the water, encouraging it to go around them, rather than create sharp barriers that oppose the water. By contrast, the straight embankments introduced during British colonial rule in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries — and later replicated by democratically elected Indian governments — seek to confine and control the river. Such rigid structures often backfired: by presenting an unyielding barrier, they increase water pressure during floods, leading to dangerous breaches and widespread inundation.\n\nThe settings of the book’s essays — the floodplains in central India, the Fogliano wetlands in Italy, Jordan’s Dead Sea coastline, the Soomaa bogs in Estonia, the river valleys in the western United States, France’s alpine wetlands, the Colombian marshes, the tidal plains in the Bahamas and the Salton Sea in California — are wet environments that have been inhabited for centuries. These are places where wetness is an essential condition of life, and where human living is a process of “adaptation and respectful adjustment”.\n\nLand and water\n\nOn the basis of insights from field studies and conversations with local inhabitants, 12 leading specialists in sociology, ecology and anthropology explore how governance, management and infrastructure decisions often fall short when guided by rigid binaries — such as wet and dry, alive and dead, beneficial and nuisance or natural and unnatural. These categories fail to capture the complexity of amphibious environments.\n\nThis is the case with the Salton Sea, California’s largest lake. Formed in the 1900s by flooding from the Colorado River, the lake has since been sustained by agricultural run-off from nearby farms irrigated by the river. But in the past few decades, water-transfer agreements to supply urban California have caused the lake to shrink year by year.\n\nWind blows toxic dust from the exposed lake bed towards the surrounding neighbourhoods, where asthma and other respiratory issues are prevalent at alarming rates. The shores are now strewn with the remains of dead birds and fish. This May, water finally began flowing into ponds in the southern region of the lake, part of the long-delayed Species Conservation Habitat Project, a ten-year effort to restore the habitat and improve its air quality. Although the project was announced in 2017, it stalled for years amid debates between local, state and federal officials over who should manage and restore the Salton Sea — and how.\n\nA spring flood in Soomaa National Park in Estonia.Credit: Focus/Toomas Tuul/UIG/ Getty\n\nHistorically, the lake has dried and filled up again over centuries. For some, this history means that the lake should be allowed to die because it is an artificial system. Others rightly point out the detrimental effects of such a move on the people, fish and migratory birds whose lives are enmeshed with the lake’s ecosystem.\n\n“Over time, different understandings and interpretations of the Salton Sea’s identity — as wet or dry, natural or artificial, dead or alive — have played into the difficult management challenges that the lake faces,” writes political ecologist Alida Cantor in the opening essay of Amphibious Anthropologies. Focusing on what the lake does, not what it is, she says, can help to reframe debates about the lake’s management.",

          "title": "What counts as plagiarism? AI-generated papers pose new risks",
          "authors": " Ananya",
          "abstract": "This January, Byeongjun Park, a researcher in artificial intelligence (AI), received a surprising e-mail. Two researchers from India told him that an AI-generated manuscript had used methods from one of his papers, without credit.\n\nPark looked up the manuscript. It wasn’t formally published, but had been posted online (see go.nature.com/45pdgqb) as one of a number of papers generated by a tool called The AI Scientist — announced in 2024 by researchers at Sakana AI, a company in Tokyo1.\n\nThe AI Scientist is an example of fully automated research in computer science. The tool uses a large language model (LLM) to generate ideas, writes and runs the code by itself, and then writes up the results as a research paper — clearly marked as AI-generated. It’s the start of an effort to have AI systems make their own research discoveries, says the team behind it.\n\nThe AI-generated work wasn’t copying his paper directly, Park saw. It proposed a new architecture for diffusion models, the sorts of model behind image-generating tools. Park’s paper dealt with improving how those models are trained2. But to his eyes, the two did share similar methods. “I was surprised by how closely the core methodology resembled that of my paper,” says Park, who works at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea.\n\nResearchers built an ‘AI Scientist’ — what can it do?\n\nThe researchers who e-mailed Park, Tarun Gupta and Danish Pruthi, are computer scientists at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru. They say that the issue is bigger than just his paper.\n\nIn February, Gupta and Pruthi reported3 that they’d found multiple examples of AI-generated manuscripts that, according to external experts they consulted, used others’ ideas without attribution, although without directly copying words and sentences.\n\nGupta and Pruthi say that this amounts to the software tools plagiarizing other ideas — albeit with no ill intention on the part of their creators. “A significant portion of LLM-generated research ideas appear novel on the surface but are actually skillfully plagiarized in ways that make their originality difficult to verify,” they write.\n\nIn July, their work won an ‘outstanding paper’ award at the Association for Computational Linguistics conference in Vienna.\n\nBut some of their findings are disputed. The team behind The AI Scientist told Nature that it strongly disagrees with Gupta and Pruthi’s findings, and doesn’t accept that any plagiarism occurred in The AI Scientist case studies that the paper examines. In Park’s specific case, one independent specialist told Nature that he thought the AI manuscript’s methods didn’t overlap enough with Park’s paper to be termed plagiarism. Park himself also demurred at using ‘plagiarism’ to describe what he saw as a strong methodological overlap.\n\nBeyond the specific debate about The AI Scientist lies a broader concern. So many papers are published each year — especially in computer science — that researchers already struggle to keep track of whether their ideas are really innovative, says Joeran Beel, a specialist in machine-learning and information science at the University of Siegen, Germany.\n\nAnd if more LLM-based tools are used to generate ideas, this could deepen the erosion of intellectual credit in science. Because LLMs work in part by remixing and interpolating the text they’re trained on, it would be natural for them to borrow from earlier work, says Parshin Shojaee, a computer scientist at the Virginia Tech Research Center — Arlington.\n\nThe issue of ‘idea plagiarism’, although little discussed, is already a problem with human-authored papers, says Debora Weber-Wulff, a plagiarism researcher at the University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, and she expects that it will get worse with work created by AI. But, unlike the more familiar forms of plagiarism — involving copied or subtly rewritten sentences — it’s hard to prove the reuse of ideas, she says.\n\nThat makes it difficult to see how to automate the task of checking for true novelty or originality, to match the pace at which AIs are going to be able to synthesize manuscripts.\n\n“There’s no one way to prove idea plagiarism,” Weber-Wulff says.\n\nOverlapping methods\n\nBad actors can, of course, already use AI to deliberately plagiarize others or rewrite others’ work to pass it off as their own (see Nature https://doi.org/gt5rjz; 2025). But Gupta and Pruthi wondered if well-intentioned AI approaches might be using others’ methods or ideas too.\n\nGupta and Pruthi were first alerted to the issue when they read a 2024 study led by Chenglei Si, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California4. Si’s team asked both people and LLMs to generate “novel research ideas” on topics in computer science. Although Si’s protocol included a novelty check and asked human reviewers to assess the ideas, Gupta and Pruthi argue that some of the AI-generated ideas produced by the protocol nevertheless lifted from existing works — and so weren’t ‘novel’ at all.\n\nThey picked out one of the AI-generated ideas in Si’s paper, which they say borrowed from a paper first posted as a preprint5 in 2023. Si tells Nature that he agrees that the ‘high-level’ idea was similar to material in the preprint, but that “whether the low-level implementation differences count as novelty is probably a subjective judgement”. Shubhendu Trivedi, a machine-learning researcher who co-authored that 2023 preprint, and was until recently at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that “the LLM-generated paper was basically very similar to our paper, despite some superficial-level differences”.\n\nAI is complicating plagiarism. How should scientists respond?\n\nGupta and Pruthi further tested their concern by taking the four AI-generated research proposals publicly released by Si’s team and the ten AI manuscripts released by Sakana AI, and generated 36 fresh proposals themselves, using Si’s methodology. They then asked 13 specialists to try to find overlaps in methods between the AI-made works and existing papers, using a 5-point scale, on which 5 corresponded to a ‘one-to-one mapping in methods’ and 4 to ‘mix-and-match from two-to-three prior works’; 3 and 2 represented more-modest overlaps and 1 indicated no overlap. “It’s essentially about copying of the idea or crux of the paper,” says Gupta.\n\nThe researchers also asked the authors of original papers identified by the specialists to give their own views on the overlaps.\n\nIncluding this step, Gupta and Pruthi report that 12 papers in their sample of AI-generated works reached levels 4 and 5, implying, they said, a plagiarism proportion of 24%; the figure rises to 18 (36%) if cases in which the original authors didn’t reply are included. Some were from Sakana’s and Si’s work, although Gupta and Pruthi discuss in detail only the examples reported in this story.\n\nThey also said they’d found a similar kind of overlap in an AI-generated manuscript (see go.nature.com/4oym4ru) that, Sakana announced this March, had passed through a stage of peer review for a workshop at a prestigious machine-learning conference, the International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nAt the time, the firm said that this was the first fully-AI-generated paper to pass human peer review. It also explained that it had agreed with workshop organizers to trial putting AI-generated papers into peer review and to withdraw them if they were accepted, because the community hadn’t yet decided whether AI-generated papers should be published in conference proceedings. (The workshop organizers declined Nature’s request for comment.)\n\nGupta and Pruthi say that this paper borrowed its core contribution from a 2015 work6, without citing it. Their report quotes the authors of that paper, computer scientists David Krueger and Roland Memisevic, as saying that the Sakana work is “definitively not novel”, and identifying a second uncited manuscript7 that the paper borrowed from.\n\nAnother computer scientist, Radu Ionescu at the University of Bucharest, told Nature he rated the similarity between the AI-generated work and Krueger and Memisevic’s paper as a 5.\n\nKrueger, who is at the University of Montreal in Canada, told Nature that the related works should have been cited, but that he “wouldn’t be surprised to see human researchers reinvent this and miss previous work” too. “I think this AI system and others are not capable of achieving academic standards for referencing related work,” he said, adding that the AI paper was “extremely low quality overall”. But he wasn’t sure whether the word plagiarism should be applied, because he feels that term implies that the person (or AI tool) reusing methods was aware of earlier work, but chose not to cite it.\n\nPushback\n\nThe team behind The AI Scientist, which includes researchers at the University of Oxford, UK, and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, pushed back strongly against Gupta and Pruthi’s work when asked by Nature. “The plagiarism claims are false,” the team wrote in an e-mailed point-by-point critique, adding that they were “unfounded, inaccurate, extreme, and should be ignored”.\n\nOn two AI Scientist manuscripts discussed in Gupta and Pruthi’s paper, for instance, the team says that these works have different hypotheses from those in the earlier papers and apply them to different domains, even if some elements of the methods are related.\n\nIs it OK for AI to write science papers? Nature survey shows researchers are split\n\nThe references found by the specialists for Gupta and Pruthi’s analysis are work that the AI-generated papers could have cited, but nothing more, the AI Scientist team says, adding: “What they should have reported is some related work that went uncited (a daily occurrence by human authors).” The team says it would be “appropriate” to have cited Park’s paper. In the case of Krueger’s paper and the second uncited manuscript, the AI Scientist team says, “these two papers are related, so, while it is an everyday occurrence by humans not to include works like this, it would have been good for The AI Scientist to cite them”.\n\nBen Hoover, a machine-learning researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who specializes in diffusion models, told Nature that he’d score the overlap with Park’s paper as a ‘3’ on Gupta’s scale. He said the AI-generated paper is of much lower quality and less thorough than Park’s work, and should have cited it, but “I would not go so far as to say plagiarism.” Gupta and Pruthi’s analysis relies on ‘superficial similarities’ between generic statements in the AI-generated work that, when read in detail, don’t meaningfully map to Park’s paper, he adds. Ionescu told Nature he would give the AI-generated paper a rating of 2 or 3.\n\nPark judges the overlap with his paper to be much stronger than Hoover’s and Ionescu’s ratings. He says he would give it a score of 5 on Gupta’s scale, and adds that it “reflects a strong methodological resemblance that I consider noteworthy.” Even so, this does not necessarily align with what he sees as the legal or ethical definition of plagiarism, he told Nature.\n\nWhat counts as plagiarism\n\nPart of the disagreement could stem from different operational understandings of what ‘plagiarism’ means, especially when it comes to overlap in ideas or methods. Researchers who study plagiarism hold different views on the term from those of some of the computer scientists in the current debate, says Weber-Wulff.\n\n“Plagiarism is a word we should and do reserve for extreme cases of intentional fraudulent cheating,” the AI Scientist team wrote, adding that Gupta and Pruthi “are wildly out of line with established conventions regarding what counts as plagiarism in academia”. But Weber-Wulff disagrees: she says that intent shouldn’t be a factor. “The machine has no intent,” she says. “We don’t have a good mechanism for explaining why the system is saying something and where it got it from, because these systems are not built to give references.”\n\nWeber-Wulff’s own favoured definition of plagiarism is that it occurs when a manuscript “uses words, ideas, or work products attributable to another identifiable person or source without properly attributing the work to the source from which it was obtained in a situation in which there is a legitimate expectation of original authorship”. That definition was produced by Teddi Fishman, the former director of a US non-profit consortium of universities called the International Center for Academic Integrity.",

Researchers have captured real-time footage of an embryo pulling on a high-fidelity replica of the lining to bury itself inside, effectively remodelling its new home.\n\nThe team reports its findings today in Science Advances1.\n\nHidden figures\n\nThe authors were inspired to simulate the implantation process because the actual events are so difficult to capture. “It’s very inaccessible because it’s all happening inside the mother,” says co-author Samuel Ojosnegros, a bioengineer at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) in Barcelona, Spain. “It’s such an important process for human reproduction, but at the same time, we don’t have the technology to study it.”\n\nA human embryo contracts itself to minimize its exposure to the outside environment.Credit: Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)\n\nAlthough previous studies have investigated how human embryos interact with glass, the embryo can’t penetrate this material as it does real human tissue. So the team set out to create a more lifelike mock-up, devising a faux uterine lining from a gel rich in collagen and proteins that are crucial for embryonic development.\n\nTo shoot their stop-motion film, researchers placed human embryos donated by a local hospital near the gel. As the embryo attached to the ‘uterus’, the team used a microscope to capture an image about every 20 minutes for 16–24 hours, and then stitched the stills together.\n\nCo-author Amélie Godeau, a biomechanics researcher at IBEC, was shocked to see how quickly the embryo burrowed down into the gel. “My first reflex was to think my experiment had gone wrong and there was some drift in the microscope,” Godeau says. By contrast, the team found that mouse embryos adhere to the surface of the uterus rather than embedding themselves inside.\n\nA human embryo plunges into a synthetic uterine lining tissue by applying force to pull the tissue apart.Credit: Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC)",

I travelled with a group of other undergraduates and professional researchers to Râmnicu Vâlcea, a small city in southern Romania, as part of a research programme funded partly by the US National Science Foundation (NSF), where I watched the skies grow dark, saw a solar corona light up behind the Moon and listened to the ticking of our equipment tracking the Sun for the 140 seconds of darkness.\n\nMy school was part of a consortium of eight small colleges in the northeastern United States — most with only one or two astronomy professors — that had banded together to provide summer research opportunities for their students. Funded originally by the W. M. Keck Foundation, and recently by the NSF, the small initiative, called the Keck Northeast Astronomy Consortium, has supported 350 students such as myself over 35 years.\n\nThis experience made me realize that I could actually pursue a career in astronomy research, altering the course of my life fundamentally. After I graduated, the time I gained calibrating and analysing solar observations was enough to land me a job at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, supporting the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer mission. This led to me doing a PhD on the processes that convert magnetic energy in the corona to heat and radiation during solar flares.\n\nI now study the dynamics of the corona that produce both explosive flares and comparatively gentle outflows that become solar wind. I led a project using an extreme-ultraviolet solar telescope for the European Space Agency, helped to build the first data products from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Solar Ultraviolet Imager and have pioneered methods to observe the previously obscure middle corona, where the transition from the magnetically dominated solar atmosphere to the pressure-dominated solar wind and heliosphere begins.\n\nSince 1987, thousands of students across the United States have shared similar experiences to mine, thanks to the NSF’s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programme. REU provides grants of around US$100,000–155,000 to universities and other institutions to embed students in laboratories and research facilities, giving them an introduction to professional scientific research.\n\nNow, this programme, which costs around $80 million a year, is under threat of being eliminated under the proposed federal budget, as the administration of US President Donald Trump plans sweeping cuts to science funding and major changes in the NSF’s mandate.\n\nResearchers on the 1999 Râmnicu Vâlcea expedition that Dan Seaton partook in.Credit: Williams College Eclipse Expedition 1999\n\nUndergraduate research programmes are powerful incubators for nascent talent, especially for students who might not otherwise get to engage in authentic research at their home university. Many support community-college students with no access to research at all and students from small universities that lack either the resources to provide research or the breadth to match students’ interest. REU students are mentored by professional scientists, who gain as much as the students do. Students bring ingenuity and enthusiasm to the labs and research groups they join, and many go on to become trusted colleagues and close collaborators.\n\nIn February 2025, the US administration directed the NSF to begin withholding funding. REU sites across the country have had to cancel this year owing to uncertainty about upcoming funding. Several have had their already granted funding rescinded and have had to inform accepted students that they will need to make other summer plans. In the proposed NSF budget for the 2026 financial year, REU programmes are zeroed out completely.\n\nThe United States has been a global leader in science and technology for nearly a century, a position that has fostered great economic and societal benefits. And although the threats to US scientific enterprise across the board are myriad, few single investments pay the dividends that the REU programme does. Although it represents less than 1% of the total NSF budget — which itself is less than 0.15% of total federal spending — it is a proven pathway for developing the scientific talent that powers the United States’ worldwide supremacy in science.",

          "abstract": "Quantum computing qubits are arranged in a grid in this artist’s illustration.Credit: Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly helping scientists to write papers, conduct literature reviews and even design laboratory experiments. Now researchers can add optimizing quantum computing to the list.\n\nA team has used an AI model to calculate the best way to rapidly assemble a grid of atoms that might one day serve as the ‘brain’ of a quantum computer. To show just how quickly the model can re-shuffle the atoms, the team also used the system to create a tiny animation of Schrödinger’s cat. The work was reported last week in Physical Review Letters1.\n\nStudy co-author Jian-Wei Pan, a physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, says the team became interested in using AI to speed up the building these ‘neutral atom arrays’ after one of his former students got a job in an AI laboratory. “AI for science is emerging as a powerful paradigm for addressing complex scientific problems,” he says. One of the big challenges in using arrays of atoms for quantum computing is working out how to rearrange them in an “efficient, fast and scalable manner”, Pan says. AI solved that problem for the team — and did it quickly.\n\nPlaying with atoms\n\nClassical computers carry out operations using binary digits, or bits, encoded as a 1 or 0. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be put into a ‘superposition’, in which the two states — 1 and 0 — exist simultaneously. Calculations involve entangling qubits, which means that their states become linked.\n\nGoogle uncovers how quantum computers can beat today’s best supercomputers\n\nResearchers have been creating qubits with materials such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions and grids of neutral atoms, which are prized for their ability to maintain their quantum states over a relatively long time. To use the atoms as qubits, scientists trap them with laser light and then store quantum information in the energy levels of their electrons.\n\nThe hope is that if you use enough atoms, a quantum computer will one day overcome the errors that often plague these systems — and eventually perform calculations that aren’t feasible for classical computers.\n\nPan and his colleagues trained their AI model by showing it how various distributions of rubidium atoms could be nudged into a range of grid configurations using different patterns of laser light. Depending on the atoms’ starting locations, the model could then quickly work out the correct pattern of light needed to rearrange them into a selection of 2D and 3D shapes.\n\nAn animation created with an AI-guided laser pattern depicts Schrödinger’s cat (version here slowed by a factor of 33).Credit: R. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\nThe researchers used their model to assemble an array of up to 2,024 rubidium atoms in just 60 milliseconds. By contrast, another group assembled about 800 neutral atoms last year2, but without the use of AI, it took an entire second. For the video of Schrödinger’s cat, the AI system directed laser light to move atoms to create the desired patterns. The atoms became visible when they emitted light in response to laser pulses.\n\nScaling up\n\nCreating the right pattern of light, or hologram, that dictates how to arrange neutral atom arrays usually involves a slew of painstaking calculations. “And doing those calculations as you make the arrays bigger and bigger can take up a fair amount of time,” says Mark Saffman, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. That’s why many of his colleagues “were really impressed by this work, as was I”.",

          "authors": "Sasha Woods",
          "abstract": "We are living through a global freshwater crisis: in 2014, humanity used five times as much water as it did in 1914 and supplies are dwindling fast in many countries (see go.nature.com/4mg4dnt).\n\nWater contamination only makes the problem worse. In the past two years alone, swathes of the United States, Europe and Africa have been hit by a combination of catastrophic floods and severe droughts, both of which worsen water quality. Floods wash chemicals and pathogens into rivers and lakes, and droughts concentrate these contaminants, making bathing waters unsafe to swim in and necessitating intensive treatment of drinking water.\n\nCitizen scientists can be chemists: give them a chance\n\nAs director of science and policy at Earthwatch Europe, a non-profit environmental organization, I’ve witnessed at first hand how difficult it is to reliably monitor water quality and measure progress towards universal access to safe water and sanitation (Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6).\n\nAs a scientist, my approach for addressing any challenge is to research it. I gather and analyse data, and try to understand the problem and design solutions. But the global freshwater crisis feels overwhelming: how can we monitor freshwater bodies globally and identify pollution hotspots so that we can hold polluters accountable?\n\nThe answer, I think, is citizen science — the public’s active involvement in research. By enabling communities to monitor their local waters using simple test kits, we can better understand the threats to our freshwater systems and collectively advocate for action. This two-way exchange educates and empowers individuals and simultaneously generates data on a scale scientists can’t achieve alone.\n\nCitizen scientists have already demonstrated their ability to provide extensive, accurate and timely information on water quality at a national level. In the United Kingdom, Earthwatch Europe’s Great UK WaterBlitz events — four-day campaigns in which volunteers assess nitrate and phosphate nutrient pollution in their local rivers, lakes and ponds — have mobilized thousands of people. In one weekend in April 2025, nearly 8,000 citizen scientists collected 4,000 surveys. Given that the UK Environment Agency seeks to increase the number of water-industry inspections from 10,000 in 2025–26 to 11,500 in 2026–27, it’s easy to see how reliable data from citizen scientists could be used to help uncover regulatory non-compliance, improve the performance of water companies and identify pollution sources.\n\nData on SDGs are riddled with gaps. Citizens can help\n\nIn Sierra Leone, Earthwatch Europe and the United Nations Environment Programme’s GEMS/Water initiative — through the World Water Quality Alliance — has equipped citizen scientists with the tools needed to collect data on the proportion of rivers and lakes with good water quality. By integrating citizen-science data into official monitoring efforts, Sierra Leone’s National Water Resources Management Agency has almost doubled the number of water bodies it can assess (see go.nature.com/3v2f6cd), contributing to SDG indicator 6.3.2.",

The series often highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nSonia Guimarães’s life is full of firsts. In the 1970s, as a physics student at the Federal University of São Carlos in Brazil, she was the first in her family to attain a university degree. In 1989, she finished her doctorate in electronic materials at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, UK, becoming the first Afro-Brazilian woman to earn a doctoral degree in physics. And in 1993, she became the first Black woman to join the faculty at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology in São José dos Campos, Brazil — a military higher-education institution, where she is still affiliated.\n\nSince early in her career, Guimarães has worked with semiconductors: from using these devices to build solar cells to developing the thinnest internal electrical layers possible so as to miniaturize the devices.\n\nIn 2020, she obtained a patent for the development of a ballistic sensor, which detects infrared radiation produced by airborne plane engines. The technology, she says, is unique in Brazil and was supposed to aid the country’s air force. As a Black woman, Guimarães has faced several hurdles throughout her career and has become one of the most outspoken champions of gender and racial equality in Brazilian science.\n\nI help to build support systems for Latina researchers\n\nGuimarães is an advocate for Black scientists on many fronts. Besides being a member of the Brazilian Association of Black Researchers, she is a founding councillor for the Afro-Brazilian Society for Socio-Cultural Development — a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting visibility and improving the socioeconomic status of Black people in Brazil — and presides over the Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Commission of the Brazilian Physics Society.\n\nShe also mentors girls in science, working with programmes including Investiga Menina! (Research, Girl!), a project in Goiás state aimed at getting Black girls involved in science; Futuras Cientistas (Future Female Scientists), a nationwide project focused on secondary-school students; and Pesquisa para Elas (Research for Them), a free online programme of science immersion for teenage girls. Last year, Guimarães started working with Sementes Afrodescendentes (AfroDescendant Seeds), a project focused on anti-racist education in schools in São José dos Campos. She tells Nature’s Careers team why anti-racism work leads to better scientific solutions for society.\n\nWhat is your great passion as a scientist?\n\nThe creation of new and fantastic things. When I started, millions of years ago (giggles), semiconductors were the beginning of everything. There were no mobile phones. There was one computer in the entire university, and it was the size of a huge room. So, as a second-year undergraduate in physics, my professor, physicist Jorge Swieca, introduced me and some of my peers to semiconductors. He told us that these materials could conduct electricity, or resist it – and depending on how they’re made, they can conduct currents precisely when and how you want. I remember him saying that semiconductors were going to be the basis of all technological development that would exist in the future. Bingo! I never looked back.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nProfessor Swieca gave me the idea of what I was going to do when I grew up. But the person who gave me all the encouragement to overcome the hardships I faced was my mother. When I was about ten years old, my father, an upholsterer, died of tuberculosis. My mother was left with four children to feed and no husband’s salary to count on. But she was ingenious.\n\nOnce, a neighbour’s daughter was getting married, and her baker bailed on her a week before the wedding. The neighbour knew my mother had made a cake here and a snack there, and asked for her help with the catering for 100 guests. My mother took it head on: she gathered all my sisters and everyone she knew to make it happen. This is where my mother’s catering business started. It still exists, run by one of my sisters. With money from this business, my mother sent me to university. She paid for my living costs so that I didn’t have to work.\n\nI must have picked up this ‘can do’ attitude from my mother. I can’t drop the ball, otherwise she gets very angry!\n\nWhy is anti-racism work important to science?\n\nThe world needs solutions for everyone, not just for men, and for people with white skin. And we’re running out of time for answers. When science excludes certain groups, we’re faced with uncomfortable, bizarre situations. For example, some oximeters don’t read blood oxygen levels accurately for dark-skinned people — who then can’t know for certain whether they have COVID-19, say, because the equipment was designed for light-skinned people. That’s stupid.\n\nCollection: Changemakers in science\n\nScientific progress stalls if only one type of person is looking for solutions. Many groups need to be involved — not just in physics, but in chemistry, mathematics, medicine, engineering, automobile science and everything else. Women are more likely to die in car accidents, even if the accident isn’t very serious. Why? Because test dummies are mostly based on male body size and shape. Women’s breasts are completely overlooked in car safety design.\n\nWhat is the biggest racial stereotype that you would like to dispel?",

          "abstract": "Tools that turn speech into text not only save time, Zhicheng Lin finds, but also allow him to multitask and to participate fully in meetings.Credit: Zhicheng Lin\n\nFor most academics, the sound of typing is the sound of progress. But it’s also the sound of a bottleneck — a slow, physically taxing process that stands between our ideas and the page. We accept this as a necessary part of the job, but should we?\n\nLast year, persistent wrist pain from hours spent hunched over a keyboard forced me to question that necessity. The solution, I found, was to reclaim my voice. Modern dictation tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI) allowed me to compose text at a conversational speed, easily outpacing even the most proficient typists (who achieve a maximum of around 80 words per minute) with my natural speaking cadence of 130 words per minute or more. The ergonomic benefits were immediate.\n\nAlthough voice-to-text software now boasts remarkable accuracy, these tools remain largely untapped in academic workflows. They are often perceived as accessibility aids or tools for quick voice memos rather than instruments for scholarly production. This is a missed opportunity. A strategic voice-based workflow can transform how we capture ideas, draft manuscripts and engage with research.\n\nTranscription\n\nAcademic work thrives on fleeting insights. Ideas emerge on walks between buildings, in the shower and in the middle of the night. They surface during interviews with research participants, emerge from seminar discussions and crystallize during informal conversations with colleagues. Conventional note-taking forces us to choose between participating fully in the moment and scrambling to jot down what’s happening. Transcription eliminates this compromise.\n\nTranscription converts existing audio recordings into text: the audio exists first, the text follows. Recording a meeting allows you to engage completely, avoiding the distraction of manual note-taking. The resulting transcript becomes a searchable archive of decisions, insights and action points. For researchers conducting interviews, automated transcription transforms hours of playback and typing into minutes of review and annotation.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, transcription makes it easy to capture ideas when it would be difficult to write them down. Mulling over a research problem while walking to campus? Recording thoughts on your phone takes seconds. Lying in bed when a solution to a methodological challenge suddenly becomes clear? Voice memos preserve the insight without requiring you to reach for paper or a laptop.\n\nThere are psychological benefits, too. Speaking our thoughts aloud allows us to bypass the internal editor that often stalls written expression. A blank page can be intimidating, but a voice recorder simply listens.\n\nDictation\n\nDictation, by contrast, produces text as you speak. In this instance, speech replaces the keyboard. Dictation is compositional rather than retrospective, demanding focused attention, but at the speed of thought rather than of fingers. For first drafts, e-mail responses or reviewer comments, this acceleration compounds quickly.\n\nBut viewing it simply as a means of increasing speed undersells dictation’s value. Physical relief from keyboard work addresses an occupational hazard. Academic careers span decades; repetitive strain injuries accumulate silently until they become debilitating. Dictation offers not just efficiency, but also sustainability.\n\nMoreover, the technology enables us to truly multitask. Dictating while walking transforms commutes into writing sessions. Simple physical activities — folding laundry, organizing shelves or taking light exercise — can accompany composition without compromising either task. This reclaims otherwise dead time for productive work.\n\nBuilding your voice workflow\n\nEffective voice integration requires the matching of tools to tasks and the development of new routines around both transcription and dictation. Start with low-stakes applications to build comfort before tackling important work.\n\nFor basic recording, you might already have all you need. Apple’s Voice Memos, for example, can handle most academic recording needs adequately.\n\nFor sensitive material requiring offline processing, MacWhisper transcribes entirely on your device — a capability crucial for sensitive interviews and confidential discussions. The software can also handle batch processing and accepts various audio formats, and offers a one-time licence purchase rather than a recurring fee. (SpeechPulse is another option, for both Mac and PC users.)\n\nIf cloud-based options appeal, Google AI Studio provides free transcription through multimodal large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini 2.5 Pro, although it does also use your data for training purposes. ChatGPT record mode (currently available for paid subscribers on macOS) records, transcribes and automatically generates structured summaries in an editable workspace. Users can also request the original transcript or edit it by giving the AI conversational commands, or prompts. Otter and Granola excel at meeting transcription with automatic speaker identification and summary generation, and ElevenLabs’ Scribe provides high-accuracy transcription.\n\nOn the dictation front, computers and phones include basic features, but specialized tools often perform better. For maximum accuracy, I prefer Aqua Voice (for which free, paid and group tiers are available). Its Deep Context feature uses on-screen context — such as the active application and visible text — to improve recognition of domain-specific terms and to apply context-appropriate formatting. It also supports a dictionary of custom words.\n\nFor cross-platform work, consider Wispr Flow, which is available for macOS, Windows and iPhone, and has both free and paid tiers. Users of Apple devices might also consider MacWhisper, SuperWhisper or Spokenly, which offer both local and cloud-based processing.\n\nPractical implementation",

          "abstract": "On 30 July, one of the biggest earthquakes ever recorded struck eastern Russia, triggering tsunami alerts across Japan and the Pacific. It is a timely reminder that Japan faces such seismic threats every day.\n\nJapan has one of the world’s best earthquake and tsunami preparedness systems, including advanced technologies for earthquake-proofing buildings and an early-warning system. But as head of the International Research Institute of Disaster Science at Tohoku University, I can still see room for improvement.\n\nEven in Japan, people don’t necessarily follow all the steps they should to protect themselves. These include reinforcing buildings against earthquakes, implementing measures to prevent furniture from falling over, installing earthquake-sensitive electrical circuit breakers, and evacuating quickly. Burning, crushing and drowning were the main causes of death in Japan’s last three major earthquakes, in 1923, 1995 and 2011.\n\nYet only 90% of Japan’s housing stock is earthquake resistant — short of the government’s target of almost 100% by 2025 — with large disparities between municipalities. Measures for preventing furniture from toppling, such as attaching heavy shelves to walls, have been taken by less than 40% of the population, and just 5% have installed earthquake-sensitive circuit breakers. In Kochi Prefecture, a region especially prone to earthquakes (the Nankai Trough subduction zone lies just off its coast), only 68% of people say they would evacuate immediately after shaking stopped.\n\nMany disaster risk-reduction measures aim to change people’s behaviour by raising individuals’ awarenesses of the risks. These actions need to be made more effective — which could be done by following the approach taken by public-health professionals to communicating risks. With my background in medical science, I have seen how successful such approaches have been for public health.\n\nFor example, people know they should stop smoking and reduce salt intake to stay healthy, thanks to decades of campaigns. Since 1986, the World Health Organization (WHO) has championed the concept of ‘health promotion’ to encourage everyone in society to take control of their health and take steps to improve it.\n\nA similar approach is needed to reduce the number of deaths and injuries sustained in natural disasters. At my institute, we call such methods ‘bosai’ communication science, after the Japanese term for disaster prevention.\n\nGoals must be set, indicators established and measures to achieve them clearly defined. People need to confront their fears of natural disasters and be shown steps they can take to lessen the effects. Risk-reduction advisers can show realistic images and testimonies of earthquake and tsunami damage, direct people to services for making buildings earthquake-resistant and explain how to perform evacuation drills. Gift certificates or points can be awarded for participating in drills. Disaster preparedness needs to become a social norm.\n\nTo implement these measures, platforms need to be established through which disaster-management and health officials can collaborate. The success of these efforts can be judged by indicators such as seismic retrofitting rates and evacuation-drill participation rates, as well as reductions in the number of deaths caused by disasters.\n\nTo roll out such a system globally, further collaboration between the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the WHO will be necessary. The UNDRR is the lead agency promoting the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.\n\nThree steps would move a global public-health approach to disaster risks forwards.\n\nFirst, disaster risk-reduction personnel and health-care professionals should meet regularly to exchange information. I would be happy to help build the required network.",

          "authors": "Ida Kubiszewski, Robert Costanza, Elizabeth A. Fulton, Matt A. King, Elizabeth Leane, Natalie Stoeckl",
          "abstract": "Far from being a remote, isolated continent, Antarctica is integral to Earth’s climate and life-support systems. Its vast ice sheet stores more than 90% of the planet’s surface fresh water and influences sea levels, circulation of the atmosphere and how much sunlight the planet reflects. Around Antarctica, the Southern Ocean acts as the lungs of the deep sea, accounting for roughly 40% of the global ocean’s uptake of carbon dioxide emissions generated by human activities, shaping how seawater mixes and distributes nutrients to support marine life around the globe1.\n\nYet, many of these stabilizing features are showing signs of degradation. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is retreating, with widespread thinning of glaciers and ice shelves. Changes there are accelerating, as damage in one area exacerbates melting and stresses in others. And now, parts of the more stable East Antarctic Ice Sheet seem to be thinning, too2. Pooling melt water on its surface would eat away at the ice further3, possibly triggering the break-up of more ice shelves4. Meanwhile, Antarctic waters seem to have entered a new regime, with record-low sea ice, greater salinity and less stratification of upper ocean layers5,6 (see ‘Antarctica under threat’).\n\nSources: Temp.: https://go.nature.com/3JFQNKP; Ice sheet: https://go.nature.com/4JPPG5G; Sea ice: https://go.nature.com/45GDTPW; Salinity: Ref. 5.\n\nRunaway melting in the Antarctic will be grave for the world. Loss of ice could contribute more than 60 centimetres to sea-level rise by the end of this century and will disrupt the Southern Ocean’s freshwater balance, circulation and mixing7 — signs of which are already evident in some areas8. Less general ocean mixing means that less oxygen and fewer nutrients are transferred to the deep ocean, making it harder for marine organisms there to survive and reproduce, as well as lowering the ability of the seas to take up carbon.\n\nBefore this crucial reservoir of ice is lost, transforming the planet forever, it is essential that policymakers and others recognize Antarctica’s extraordinary economic value and seek to protect it. Environmental services, fisheries and tourism in Antarctica contribute more than US$180 billion to the global economy each year9. Yet, governments and businesses continue to undervalue these services, prioritizing political aims and short-term financial objectives (such as maximizing profit or gross domestic product) over sustaining the stability of the planet, which supports people’s lives and underpins all economies.\n\nStrategies are needed to broaden society’s goals beyond financial gains and to account for long-term risks and benefits. Here, we set out what’s at stake and propose economic goals and governance changes to guide policy responses towards long-term planetary stability.\n\nContinent under threat\n\nAs the ice melts and oceans change, ecological stresses are intensifying across the Antarctic. Populations of krill — key prey for penguins, whales and seals — are declining as oceans acidify10, affecting the whole region’s food web. Shrinking sea ice exacerbates these threats11. For example, if seals and penguins find it harder to obtain krill, especially at crucial times such as breeding periods, populations will be more vulnerable to more frequent and extreme disturbances, such as heatwaves or algal blooms.\n\nOn the Antarctic Peninsula and sub-Antarctic islands, warming is driving changes in vegetation and species distributions. For example, fast-spreading grasses are crowding out native vegetation, disrupting nesting habitats for seabirds and altering nutrient cycles. Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases and might awaken dormant microorganisms, with unpredictable consequences12.\n\nWhy we should protect the high seas from all extraction, forever\n\nHuman activities compound these pressures. Invasive species, including grasses, insects and microbes, transported by visitors and cargo, are beginning to colonize ice-free areas13. Pollution, too, is on the rise: persistent organic pollutants, hydrocarbons and microplastics have been detected across the region, including in seabirds and marine sediments14. These substances accumulate in food webs and impair reproductive and immune systems in native fauna.\n\nAll of these changes are linked and interact in ways that are often non-linear and self-reinforcing. For example, ice-sheet retreat adds fresh water to the seas, which weakens ocean circulation and accelerates warming and acidification, destabilizing marine ecosystems. Humans can increasingly reach regions that were once isolated, spreading pollution and invasive species and disturbing habitats. These cascading dynamics raise the possibility of ‘runaway’ change, in which the breach of one threshold makes others more likely, eventually overwhelming the capacity for intervention.\n\nLack of oversight\n\nMeanwhile, monitoring systems in the Antarctic remain inadequate. Environmental assessments often focus on linear trends and single variables, underestimating how multiple pressures converge and reinforce each other. This limits scientists’ abilities to detect early warning signs and precludes coordinated preventive actions.\n\nFragile governance is also increasingly a problem. The Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) has maintained peace and scientific cooperation in the region for more than six decades. It includes the 1959 treaty and subsequent agreements on wildlife, marine conservation and environmental protection. However, its consensus-based structure and slow pace of reform are struggling under the pressures of the twenty-first century.\n\nRising numbers of human visitors risk disrupting nesting sites for seabirds.Credit: Ida Kubiszewski\n\nDiplomatic stalemates about issues such as new marine protected areas and the approval of further consultative parties to the treaty are straining the system. Expanding national scientific programmes and rising commercial activities, including fishing and tourism, test the system’s resilience.\n\nShould the ATS lose legitimacy or fail to enforce protections, it could open the door to unregulated exploitation and even geopolitical conflict. Weakening of Antarctic governance could further erode environmental stewardship and fracture international collaboration on climate and biodiversity15.\n\nSolutions for a stable future\n\nPreventing irreversible change in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean requires urgent, system-wide transformation — across governance, science, economics and public engagement — as well as the rapid reduction of global emissions to curb climate change.\n\nAntarctic governance must evolve to be fit for the Anthropocene — the age of significant and lasting human impacts on the planet. The ATS requires stronger enforcement mechanisms, faster institutional responsiveness and more-efficient ratification processes. Reforms could include capping tourist numbers and re-evaluating the ‘use’ principle, which allows any tourism activity that national authorities approve, except those that are explicitly prohibited.\n\nDoes US science have a future in Antarctica?

          "title": "Battery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?",
          "authors": "Lucas Woodley, Chung Yi See, Ashley Nunes",
          "abstract": "Around the world, countries are pushing to electrify transport, which accounts for around 20% of global emissions each year. Electrifying half of the world’s light-duty vehicles could save 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon emissions annually, equivalent to the emissions of Russia1. Doing so would also improve air quality, reducing the rate of asthma attacks, infant mortality and acute bronchitis (see go.nature.com/4onyqhh).\n\nBut electric vehicles (EVs) remain unaffordable for most people. Many consumers cite the price of EVs as a barrier to ownership (see go.nature.com/45ffjgj).\n\nEV prices need to fall if they are to be adopted widely enough to curb global emissions. In the European Union, for example, electric cars currently make up just over 1% of the fleet. That figure needs to climb to 20% by 2030 and 43% by 2035 to deliver on the EU’s emissions-reduction targets (see go.nature.com/4ftfnmf).\n\nWe need to prepare our transport systems for heatwaves — here’s how\n\nMany governments are increasingly adopting measures to do this. Supply-side policies, which target manufacturers, include tightening emissions standards for petrol and diesel vehicles to make EVs more appealing (a move proposed by the United States in 2023, see go.nature.com/4mj1tq6) and banning the sale of combustion-engine vehicles altogether (as proposed by the EU).\n\nDemand-side policies, targeted at consumers, include exempting EVs from purchase taxes (as Norway implemented in the 1990s) and offering generous incentives for electric-car buyers (enacted by Australia, Canada, the United States and others). Such policies are coming under scrutiny, however, for their high financial cost. For example, under the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act, taxpayers incur a cost of US$23,000–32,000 per extra EV sold because of the policy2.\n\nAll these measures presume that increased demand will stimulate supply, and lead to a virtuous circle in which producers gain technological learning, driving down production costs and therefore EV prices until EVs dominate the market.\n\nInvestigating whether this is happening in the United States, we observe that, despite rapid declines in the cost of batteries — the most expensive component of an EV — overall, EV prices have remained stubbornly high. This reality necessitates rethinking policies that see battery costs as the primary impediment to widespread EV adoption. Instead, the identification of other contributors to EV prices is warranted, as are policies that help to lower these prices.\n\nSix roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them\n\nThe main reason often given for why EVs are more expensive than fossil-fuel-powered cars is the cost of the large battery needed to power them, which itself can weigh half a tonne3. Batteries are made using expensive ‘critical minerals’, such as lithium (which costs $15,000 per tonne) and cobalt ($30,000 per tonne). By comparison, steel, the main cost factor for combustion-engine cars, sells for roughly $1,000 per tonne.\n\nHowever, over the past few decades, global battery prices have fallen drastically. In 2011, the inflation-adjusted price of an average EV battery was more than $1,000 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). By 2023, that figure had dropped to $139 per kWh. This precipitous decline reflects advancements in battery technology and improvements in battery-cell production, all of which have driven down per-unit production costs.\n\nLower production costs for firms should mean lower purchasing prices for consumers. However, pricing data from one key market, the United States, over the past few decades suggests otherwise (see ‘US electric-vehicle capacities and costs’). Instead of falling, average EV prices have risen by more than 50%: from $43,872 in 2011, to $71,501 in 2023, although prices fluctuate from year to year.\n\nSources: Pack-level battery cost: BloombergNEF; Automotive: Cox Automotive, Edmunds, US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThat’s happened even as the number of sales has increased: between 2011 and 2023, EV sales grew at an average annual rate of 47%. Thus, in the United States, there’s no evidence that cost reductions — realized through battery price falls or production scale-up and technological learning — have been passed down from manufacturers to consumers.\n\nBusiness and policy environments elsewhere have led to cheaper EVs coming onto the market, notably in China, thanks to government subsidies, lower production costs and fierce competition. The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV, for example, costs $4,700, more than five times cheaper than the cheapest US EV. But it comes with a much smaller battery — just 9.2 kWh compared with the US average of 83.4 kWh. Similarly, in Europe, the Chinese-made Dacia Spring is available for roughly $23,000 with a 27-kWh battery.\n\nNo easy answers\n\nLarger battery size is one explanation for why US EV prices are higher4. Bigger batteries allow the car to be driven further, and consumers value greater range5. But larger batteries increase costs, because they require more critical minerals.\n\nHowever, battery costs alone don’t account for the price differential seen in the US market. Between 2011 and 2023, average battery capacity increased by about 11% annually, while per-kilowatt-hour battery cost declined by 15% annually (see ‘US electric-vehicle capacities and costs’). In other words, the rate of battery-cost declines outpaced efforts by EV manufacturers to increase battery size.\n\nMoreover, battery costs have accounted for a decreasing share of EV prices over time. Whereas in 2011, the battery accounted for, on average, 58% of an EV’s price, by 2017, that had fallen to 21%. In 2023, battery costs accounted for just 16% of an EV’s price.\n\nAerial view of a lithium mine at Silver Peak, Nevada. Electric-vehicle batteries rely on lithium and other ‘critical minerals’. Credit: Getty\n\nHigh EV prices could reflect manufacturers’ understanding of their consumer base. EVs are often seen as luxury cars for the rich, so manufacturers can charge more, knowing that those customers are not bothered by the price. However, price gouging is an unlikely culprit for high EV prices. EVs largely remain a loss-making venture. In 2023, Ford Motor lost $4.7 billion on sales of 116,000 ‘Model e’ cars, or an average of $40,525 per vehicle (see go.nature.com/4lcqjkj).\n\nGeopolitical and supply-chain factors are also insufficient to explain the trend. In 2022, for example, Jiten Behl, chief growth officer of Rivian — a US electric-truck maker — blamed rising prices on “inflationary pressure, increasing component costs and unprecedented supply-chain shortages and delays for parts (including semiconductor chips)” (see go.nature.com/40unqt8). Although such extra expenses might explain price increases for a single year, they do not explain EV price rises over decades.\n\nPolicy implications",

Credit: Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nMajor dengue outbreaks in the Americas tend to occur about five months after an El Niño event — the periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean that can disrupt global weather — a study1 has found. Meanwhile, local outbreaks tend to happen about three months after summer temperatures peak and roughly one month after peak rainfall.\n\nThe study, published today in Science Translational Medicine, paints a clearer picture of the relationship between the mosquito-borne disease and climatic conditions in the Americas, a region that saw a record-breaking 13 million cases in 2024.\n\nDengue is caused by four closely related viruses and spread by the Aedes species mosquitoes. There is no specific treatment, and the disease can lead to fever, bone pain and even death.\n\nThe research relied on roughly three decades of surveillance data from 14 countries. Cases in the region tended to rise and fall in sync, on average six months apart, even in places as far as 10,000 kilometres apart.\n\nThe findings are “useful to anticipate when a region might expect to see an epidemic, which can help inform planning and preparedness”, says Talia Quandelacy, a co-author and an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora. She notes that, although the link between dengue and climate is well known, what stands out in the findings is how this association plays out across the entire continent, “especially given that it’s such a climatically diverse region”.\n\nToasty mosquitoes",

          "authors": "Traci Watson",
          "abstract": "Preprint servers such as PsyArxiv are contending with suspicious content written by AI systems.Credit: Nature\n\nThe preprint’s title — ‘Self-Experimental Report: Emergence of Generative AI Interfaces in Dream States’ — roused psychologist Olivia Kirtley’s suspicions.\n\nWhen she clicked, her wariness grew. The manuscript, posted in July on PsyArXiv, a site for non-peer-reviewed research in the psychological sciences, was only a few pages long and listed just one author, whose affiliation was not included. And the artificial intelligence (AI) experiment described in the text “was pretty out there”, says Kirtley, at Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium.\n\nSo she flagged that preprint and similar ones to PsyArXiv’s managers, who removed them. The dream-states manuscript used AI in its methods but didn’t clearly declare how AI was used or whether it was used in other elements of the work, which means that it violated the site’s terms of use, says Dermot Lynott, the head of PsyArXiv’s scientific advisory board and a psychologist at Maynooth University in Ireland.\n\nIn response to questions from Nature, a message from the e-mail address of the listed author, Jiazheng Liu, said that AI played a limited part in the preprint’s generation.\n\nThe fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science\n\nPsyArXiv is just one of the many preprint servers — and journals — that are grappling with suspicious submissions. Some papers bear the fingerprints of paper mills, which are services that produce scientific papers on demand. Others show evidence of content written by AI systems, such as fake references, which can be a sign of an AI ‘hallucination’.\n\nSuch content poses a conundrum for preprint services. Many are non-profit organizations devoted to making it easier for scientists to publish their work, and screening for low-quality content demands resources and can slow processing of submissions. Such screening also raises questions about which manuscripts to allow. And this influx of dodgy content has its own risks.\n\n“How do you do quality assurance while keeping things relatively light touch so the system doesn’t collapse on itself?” says Katie Corker, liaison from the executive committee of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Sciences to PsyArXiv’s scientific advisory board. “No one wants a world where the individual reader has to figure out whether something is legitimate scholarship.”\n\nAI growth spurt\n\nThe preprint services approached by Nature said that a relatively small proportion of their submissions bear signs of being generated by a large language model (LLM) such as the one that drives OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The operators of the preprint server arXiv, for example, estimate that roughly 2% of their submissions are rejected for being products of AI, paper mills or both.\n\nRichard Sever, head of openRxiv, which operates life-sciences preprint server bioRxiv and biomedical server medRxiv, based in New York City, says that the two combined turn away more than ten manuscripts per day that seem formulaic, and might have been AI-generated. The services receive roughly 7,000 submissions per month.\n\nAI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers\n\nBut some say that the situation seems to be getting worse. The moderators of arXiv noticed an uptick in AI-written content soon after the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but “we really started thinking there was a crisis sometime in the last three months”, says Steinn Sigurðsson, scientific director at arXiv and an astrophysicist at Penn State University in University Park.\n\nIn a statement posted on 25 July, the Center for Open Science, a non-profit organization in Washington DC that hosts PsyArXiv, said that it was “seeing a noticeable rise in submitted papers that appear to be generated or heavily assisted by AI tools”. Lynott confirms that there has been a “small rise” on the site and that the server is working to minimize such content.\n\nThe challenges of moderating preprints were shown by the dream-states manuscript flagged by Kirtley: shortly after the preprint was removed, a preprint with a nearly identical title and abstract was posted on the site. An e-mail from the address associated with the author said that “AI’s role was limited to mathematical derivations, symbolic computations, assembling and applying existing mathematical tools, formula verification” and eight more tasks. The e-mail’s writer described themselves as an “independent researcher based in China” with no higher-education degree and whose “only tool is a secondhand smartphone”. The second version of the preprint has also been taken down.\n\nChatbot helpers\n\nA study1 published last week in Nature Human Behaviour estimates that in September 2024, almost two years after the rollout of ChatGPT, LLMs produced 22% of the content in computer-science abstracts posted on arXiv and roughly 10% of the text in biology abstracts posted on bioRxiv (See ‘Rise of the chatbot’). By comparison, an analysis2 of biomedical abstracts published in journals in 2024 found that 14% had LLM-generated text in their abstracts .\n\nSource: Ref 1.\n\nSome of the AI text reported in the study could have been generated by scientists who would otherwise struggle to write a manuscript in English, says James Zou, a computer scientist at Stanford University in California and co-author of the Nature Human Behaviour paper.",

          "title": "Beyond AlphaFold: how AI is decoding the grammar of the genome",
          "authors": "Jeffrey M. Perkel",
          "abstract": "In 1862, Victor Hugo reportedly wrote to his publisher to ask how his newly published novel Les Misérables was selling, with a single character query: “?” The response: “!”\n\nThis story of one of the world’s most concise correspondences is apocryphal. But some genome-focused artificial intelligence (AI) systems can, like the French writer’s publisher, respond meaningfully to equally short prompts.\n\nInstead of the detailed queries required to use the chatbot ChatGPT effectively, Evo, an AI model trained on some 300 billion nucleotide bases, including 80,000 microbial whole-genome sequences, will — prompted with ‘#’ — dream up a new sequence of mobile DNA. It does so on the basis of other such biological systems that the model has been exposed to (see go.nature.com/3jvp922). Given a prompt such as ‘030’, an AI tool called regLM can spit out 200-base sequences that are predicted to exhibit regulatory activity in any of three human cell lines (go.nature.com/4jpttm8).\n\nEvo and regLM are part of a fast-growing suite of tools that aim to internalize, decode, interpret and build on the grammar of the genome — especially the vast portion that does not code for proteins. Think AlphaFold, but for regulatory DNA, which are sequences that control gene expression.\n\nDeepMind’s new AlphaGenome AI tackles the ‘dark matter’ in our DNA\n\nWhen Google DeepMind released AlphaFold in 2020, the company claimed it had solved a decades-old ‘grand challenge’ in biology — predicting a protein’s 3D shape from its sequence alone. But the non-coding fraction of the genome could prove to be an even grander challenge.\n\nA given sequence of amino acids will generally fold into the same shape, whatever the cellular context. That predictability is not true of the genome, in which short, functional sequence motifs — gene promoters and enhancers, transcription start and stop sites and so on — can be scattered across long stretches of seemingly purposeless DNA. These motifs might overlap, interact over long distances, bind to competing protein factors or respond to signals that are only present in specific cells or at certain times in development. They are also tightly wrapped within chromatin, a complex of DNA and protein, which might be more or less accessible to external proteins depending on what the cell is doing.\n\n“How proteins are encoded in the genome, the code of how genes are expressed, when and where, how much — is one of the most fascinating problems in biology,” says Stein Aerts, a computational biologist at the VIB Center for AI & Computational Biology and the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. But with training, AI tools can detect subtle differences between sequences and predict what they do and how they behave, identifying crucial motifs and even estimating the impact of altering them. From there, AI models can attempt to predict the physiological impact of genetic variants and even guide the design of new sequences with specified functions.\n\nThese tools are not perfect, and researchers cannot even agree on how best to assess their performance. But that makes the field exciting. “It’s so clear that it’s a solvable problem,” says Julia Zeitlinger, a developmental and computational biologist at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, who developed an AI model called BPNet and uses it to decode the mechanistic sequence rules of gene regulation, “but it’s not clear how”.\n\nOf puppies and puffins\n\nDeepSEA, one of the first genomic AI tools, was published1 ten years ago this month by computational biologists Jian Zhou and Olga Troyanskaya at Princeton University in New Jersey.\n\nDeepSEA is a convolutional neural network (CNN) — the same kind of deep-learning architecture used to teach computers to classify images as, say, a cat or a dog. Zhou and Troyanskaya trained a model on epigenetics data, including transcription-factor binding, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications, from a public research project called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). The model learnt to predict the presence of such features in 1,000-base segments of DNA it had never encountered.\n\nDeepSEA’s training enabled it to tease apart the biological consequence and severity of sequence variants associated with human disease. For instance, one breast-cancer-associated sequence variant called rs4784227 seems to strengthen the binding of a DNA-binding protein called FOXA1, whereas a variant associated with the blood condition α-thalassemia creates a possible binding site for GATA1, a transcription factor involved in blood-cell development.\n\nBiggest-ever AI biology model writes DNA on demand\n\nSince then, the field has exploded. David Kelley, a principal investigator at the biotechnology company Calico Life Sciences in South San Francisco, California, has created or co-created multiple AI models, many with canine-inspired names. These include Akita2 (for predicting 3D genome folding), Basset3 and Basenji4 (for regulatory-sequence prediction) and Borzoi5, which predicts gene expression across the length of a gene.\n\nThese models raised a litter of variants: Basset begat Malinois, and Borzoi begat Scooby. Other researchers have built their own (non-canine) models including Puffin, ChromBPNet and more.\n\nNot all are CNNs. Enformer — a model that predicts both gene expression and epigenetic data over long distances — and Borzoi, for instance, “use both convolution blocks and transformer blocks”, says Kelley, whose laboratory developed both models. “The convolution blocks are great for capturing the local sequence patterns, and then the transformer blocks help look around a larger region to consider the local patterns in a broader context before predicting the data.” But whatever the architecture, they come in two basic forms, says Anshul Kundaje, who researches computational genomics at Stanford University in California. Supervised and sequence-to-function models are trained on functional genomic data — gene expression or chromatin accessibility, for instance — and learn to predict the function of DNA sequences they have never encountered. Often working at or near single-nucleotide resolution, these models can identify key motifs, such as functionally important protein-binding sites, and predict the significance of altering them. DeepSEA is one; Kundaje’s ChromBPNet, which predicts regions of chromatin accessibility, another.\n\nThe other class is unsupervised or self-supervised ‘genomic language models’ (gLMs). Like ChatGPT, they are trained on vast quantities of text — in this case, genomic sequence data — and are tasked with either predicting the next base (or ‘token’) in a sequence or filling in missing bases on the basis of surrounding context. These models “are not trying to predict the activity of a sequence, they’re trying to predict the composition of a sequence”, says Avantika Lal, a machine-learning scientist at biotechnology firm Genentech in South San Francisco.\n\nWith machine-learning scientist Gökçen Eraslan and their colleagues at Genentech, Lal co-developed regLM, a language model that they trained by labelling regulatory sequences with succinct markers of activity6 — for instance, ‘04<sequence>’ to indicate strong expression in one cell line and low activity in another. The model is therefore not strictly unsupervised, says Eraslan — he calls it a ‘function-to-sequence’ model. But those same labels can then be used to prompt regLM to create new sequences with predicted behaviours.\n\nEvo 2, announced in February7, was trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs — “a representative snapshot of genomes spanning all observed evolution”, as the resulting bioRxiv preprint paper puts it. It could then identify intron–exon boundaries, predict the impacts of mutations and generate ‘realistic’ gene and genomic sequences, among other things.\n\nModels made simple\n\nGenomic AI models can also be distinguished by the type of regulatory interactions they predict, Kundaje says. Sequence-to-function models mostly identify important DNA motifs (which, because their function depends on their proximity to the regulated gene, are said to act in cis) without regard to the biology that occurs there.\n\nTrans models, by contrast, aim to identify which genes regulate which other genes, for instance, to tease apart networks of gene regulation. (They are called trans because the factors that mediate this regulation act at a distance.) But this, says Kundaje, “is still very fraught and very problematic” because trans models — which are generally trained on data such as RNA expression — must infer causal relationships without data that can reveal causality. There’s no guarantee that two genes are directly linked just because their expression rises and falls in tandem. Even if they are, it’s not necessarily obvious in which direction the relationship works: does A regulate B or vice versa? If these models are then asked to predict the impact of a perturbation — for example, what happens if a given gene is knocked out — the models often fail.\n\nModels can include both cis and trans elements, says Sushmita Roy, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, for instance by building regulatory networks on the basis of chromatin accessibility data and weighting those predictions by gene expression. But perhaps the first model to truly bridge the divide, Kundaje says, is Scooby — a single-cell version of Borzoi (go.nature.com/3upffnp). By leveraging both chromatin accessibility and transcriptional data from the same cells, Scooby predicts genome features and cell state simultaneously. “It is one of the first cis–trans models,” he says.\n\n‘ChatGPT for CRISPR’ creates new gene-editing tools\n\nSequence-to-function models can also probe other aspects of gene regulation. In 2024, teams led by Zhou (who is now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas), Kundaje and Charles Danko, a computational biologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, independently described sequence-to-function models capable of predicting sites of transcription initiation8–10.\n\nZhou used his team’s model, Puffin, to identify the common features and placement of key regulatory elements around sites of transcription initiation, including binding sites for the transcription factors YY1, SP1, CREB and Initiator. Danko’s team trained its AI model on matched genome sequences and transcription initiation data from 58 individuals, creating a suite of models that were, he says, “for the first time aware of how differences between individuals in their genome sequence influence the pattern” of transcription initiation.\n\nCollectively, says Zhou, these studies begin to tease apart the motifs that regulate the positioning and strength of transcription initiation, including that of the transcription factor TFIID. TFIID is an essential protein complex that binds to the promoter element known as a TATA box — despite the fact that most eukaryotic promoters don’t seem to contain a TATA box. “One mechanistic interpretation is that TFIID is binding the best available of the ‘bad options’ when it picks a site” in a TATA-less promoter, Danko explains.\n\nMost genomic models make these predictions from relatively small inputs — anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand bases. But gene regulation can occur over much longer tracts of genome space, and some models are able to make predictions at or near those scales. Borzoi, for instance, accepts 524 kilobases of input DNA, and Evo 2 and Google DeepMind’s newly announced AlphaGenome can work with a megabase.\n\nThese models can transform those sequences into vast collections of estimated data. Given an input sequence of 196,608 bases of human DNA, for instance, Enformer outputs 2,131 predictions of transcription factor binding, 1,860 of histone modifications, 684 of chromatin accessibility and 638 of gene expression, at 128-base resolution (go.nature.com/4mbe42h).\n\nA finite genome\n\nYet despite these models’ extensive ‘receptive fields’, they can still miss things, says Jacob Schreiber, a computational biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, because enhancers might exert effects that are biologically meaningful but invisible to the AI tool. “We have not cracked long-range regulation,” he says.\n\nAnother challenge is that, as vast as it is, the human genome is finite — there are only about 20,000–25,000 genes, for instance, and only a fraction of those are regulated in a cell-type-specific manner. That means that for all those billions of bases, there are relatively few examples of regulatory strategies from which a model can learn.\n\nCarl de Boer is a biomedical engineer at the University of British Columbia in Canada.Credit: Paul Joseph\n\n“There’s just so many different biochemical mechanisms that could happen on DNA that there are probably a very large number of them that only occur once or even zero times in our genome sequence,” says biomedical engineer Carl de Boer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nOne approach to broadening an AI model’s knowledge base is to feed it more than just reference genomes. Some model builders, for instance, train their tools on data from multiple individuals or from across the phylogenetic tree to give the models a sense of genetic diversity.\n\nAnother approach, advanced by de Boer and Jussi Taipale, a systems biologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, is to look beyond natural genomes to fully artificial DNAs11.\n\nAs a postdoc at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, de Boer and his colleagues tested some 100 million random sequences, each of which were 80 nucleotides in length — “about a human genome’s worth” — for their ability to drive expression of a fluorescent protein in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)12. (The yeast genome is made up of about 12 million bases, compared with roughly 3 billion in the human genome.) This approach, de Boer says, “is actually much better” for understanding the grammar of the genome than using genomic DNA, “because all of the signals you see in the random DNA are causal”. If you see fluorescence, the sequence is active. The genome, by contrast, is a product of evolution, meaning elements might be positioned owing to selective pressures as well as function.\n\nAccording to de Boer, the yeast exercise yielded two key insights. First, it reinforced that “there are probably widespread biophysical interactions happening in regulatory regions”. Functional motifs were not randomly arranged in active sequences; they were positioned in specific configurations — for instance, to conform to the helical spacing of the DNA double helix.\n\nThe second insight involved the importance of low-affinity transcription-factor–DNA interactions. Even weak interactions, the team found, could exert a large influence on gene regulation, just as relatively weak chemical interactions can hold two proteins together.",

          "abstract": "Safe and snug: frogs kept warm in brick ‘saunas’ are able to ward off a deadly fungal infection.Credit: Anthony Waddle\nWorking scientist profiles\n\nThis article is part of an occasional series in which Nature profiles scientists with unusual career histories or outside interests.\n\nOn warm, muggy evenings, conservation biologist Anthony Waddle and his students, along with local frog enthusiasts, venture into the wild and wet suburbs of Sydney, Australia, head torches on, searching for green and golden bell frogs (Litoria aurea). Then they frogmarch the captured amphibians into a small greenhouse made from nothing more than a stack of masonry bricks for a “luxury treatment” sauna — which might ultimately save their lives, he explains.\n\nFor many, the idea of a ‘frog sauna’ might sound bizarre. But when Waddle’s team published a study (A. W. Waddle et al. Nature 631, 344–349; 2024) showing that a simple sit in a warm enclosure could treat the deadly chytrid fungal infection plaguing the green and golden bell frog, it made waves — and resulted in him winning the 2025 Future for Nature award. Now, as a postdoctoral researcher at Macquarie University in Sydney, he’s collaborating with partners, training local communities and helping Australia to save its declining population of these glossy green-and-golden-streaked frogs that fit in your palm and croak with a muffled, motorcycle-like revving sound.\n\nChytrid fungus infections are a huge threat to the global frog population and have contributed to declines in more than 500 frog species and the extinction of more than 90 others.\n\nThe good news is that infections can be cleared easily in some frogs under the right conditions, because the fungus is sensitive to heat. “Around 28 °C is enough to really limit chytrid growth,” Waddle says. And the sauna treatment can pay off really fast: a few hours a day for a week or less is all that’s needed. Saving one female frog can markedly change the trajectory of a population, because a single adult can produce thousands of offspring in one season.\n\nWaddle stacks bricks inside a mini greenhouse, where they function as saunas for frogs.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty\n\nHow the treatment came about was serendipitous. In 2013, researchers studying tree frogs in Queensland, Australia, noticed a pattern: in areas where chytrid fungus had spread, frog populations survived near large granite boulders and crevices, but disappeared from shaded, forested areas. The researchers hypothesized that the boulders acted as natural refuges that absorbed heat during the day and slowly released it at night. The process created warmer microhabitats that protected the frogs from the fungus.\n\nHowever, not all habitats had these heating boulders. So Waddle and his colleagues wanted to finally “test this idea that people had been hemming and hawing about forever”, but that no one had tested by experiment.\n\nTrying a new approach meant there was no standard blueprint. Waddle and his team had to test and adjust various sauna designs as they went. Their simple set-up consists of a small garden-greenhouse frame wrapped with translucent plastic and placed over a stack of masonry bricks, each with a series of openings for frog entry and exit. Their experiments found that the frogs readily find and enter saunas on their own.\n\nSo far, the researchers have placed about 70 frog saunas in three sites in greater Sydney and plan to use three more sites there in the next Southern Hemisphere winter, in 2026. They have also created how-to guides, educational videos and workshops to teach community members how to build the saunas (see ‘Quick-fire Q&A’). Several greenhouse suppliers have even listed the set-up on their websites as useful for creating frog saunas, as well as for growing plants.\n\nQuick-fire Q&A\nAnthony Waddle with an amphibian friend.Credit: Saeed Khan/AFP via Getty\nHow do you capture the frogs for the treatment?\n\nCapturing frogs is the fun part. You just go out at night with head torches and pick them up. We capture them by hand and bring them into a temperature- and environment-controlled facility. We either give them antifungal baths or increase their temperature for treatment, and then eventually release them. My students and I like capturing frogs the most, but it’s also the start of a lot of work, because the frogs are usually quite ill and need close attention.\n\nWhat has been the main challenge of this project?\n\nIt’s mostly been about getting people on board with solution-driven research. I’ve worked on chytrid fungal infections for nearly 12 years — starting with an undergraduate project, then a master’s on chytrid and vaccines, a PhD focused on ‘vaccination’ in frog saunas, and now a postdoctoral position investigating synthetic-biology solutions for chytrid resistance.\n\nWe’re in a position to make a big impact, even with a small team. But sometimes it’s been hard to get the exposure and support we need to grow and to secure major funding — especially when we don’t have the CVs of more-senior researchers to back us up.\n\nWhen someone develops a patent, or something for use during their PhD, it’s the responsibility of that person to make sure that the technology is used. So, I’m adopting an unconventional entrepreneurial spirit, doing citizen-science work, trying to secure partnerships with industry and going out to places where people don’t think to look for funding or support, to drive my research forwards. It’s been the secret to my success.\n\nWhat’s a surprising question that you are asked about your job?\n\nPeople often ask us to justify why we do our work or explain its broader benefit to society. I often retort with: “No one asks an accountant, or someone making money from money, what their greater purpose is.” Yet, someone like me working to conserve frogs is treated as if that’s not a real job. I’m not tired of justifying that what I do is important, because we are saving species from the face of extinction. But I do enjoy making people laugh with that joke, because it’s true.\n\nThe saunas are a low-cost garden habitat for the endangered frogs that live throughout southeastern Australia. Waddle has worked with other frog conservationists, encouraging local people to use apps such as FrogID. This lets users make audio recordings of frog calls and upload them to an online database, togeher with GPS data. Experts then identify the frogs and notify the users.\n\nJodi Rowley, a herpetologist at the Australian Museum Research Institute in Sydney and lead scientist for FrogID, says that tens of thousands of people across Australia use the app, and have put more than 1.3 million frog records on the map. The app has contributed to the discovery of 13 frog species and is actively used by communities to monitor local frog populations. Now, regular FrogID users can get frog-sauna information and updates. “We are hoping that communities are using the app to record their local frogs and potentially determine whether the frogs do better after the installation of frog saunas,” Rowley adds.\n\nBeyond black and white: an ecologist applies racial-justice principles to predators and their ecosystems",

In fact, they had just lost a ten-year legal battle.\n\nIn 2015, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a mountain guide from the alpine town of Huaraz in Peru, sued German multinational energy giant RWE for its contribution to global warming, which threatened Lliuya’s home with flooding from a nearby glacial lake. The case had numerous setbacks over the ensuing decade, but the final blow came on 28 May. The court dismissed the latest appeal, saying the likelihood of a flooding event reaching Lliuya’s home and causing serious damage was too low to justify legal intervention.\n\nYet, outside the courtroom on that fateful day, Lliuya’s lawyer Roda Verheyen declared jubilantly to waiting reporters, “I’m so happy”. The reason for her celebration was that the court decision created a bombshell precedent: major greenhouse-gas emitters could be held liable for costs of damage in the future, on the basis of their proportional contribution to global emissions. “This ruling shows that the big polluters driving the climate can finally be held legally responsible for the harm they have caused,” Lliuya said in a statement.\n\nNature Spotlight: Climate change\n\nNoah Walker-Crawford, a social anthropologist at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment in London, who was initially involved in the Lliuya v. RWE case, says that those involved never thought it would get as far as it did, especially on scientific grounds. “When we started the case, the science wasn’t that far along yet, so on attribution we only had broad insight,” he says.\n\nIn 2015, climate-attribution science was still in its infancy. The field investigates the extent to which human-induced climate change alters the likelihood or intensity of a particular climate-related event. For example, a flood triggered by a melting glacier, a heatwave that kills thousands of people, sea-level rise that destroys coastal properties or a forest fire that razes a town. Ultimately, it also provides a way to apportion blame for discrete climate events to individual entities, such as a company or government.\n\nAs the Lliuya v. RWE case progressed, so too did the attribution science. “The case ended up taking so long that the science caught up,” Walker-Crawford says. In particular, a study1 published in 2021 found that the melting and retreat of the Palcaraju glacier and the increased risk of a glacial lake outburst flooding nearby Huaraz — Lliuya’s home — was “entirely attributable” to human-induced global warming.\n\nThat flipped both the science and the law. Many of those working in attribution science and applying it in the courtroom see the Lliuya v. RWE decision as a landmark one that gives the field legal weight, opening the door for the science to have its day in court.\n\nCause and effect\n\nAugust 2003 was the hottest European summer in around 500 years. Heatwaves broke temperature records across the continent, rivers dried up, forest fires raged, glaciers melted and an estimated 20,000 people died from heat-related illness.\n\nOne year later, a study concluded with extremely high confidence that human-induced climate change had at least doubled the risk of such an extreme heatwave occurring2. The paper is considered the first peer-reviewed, published climate-attribution study of an extreme weather event.\n\nLawyer Roda Verheyen (centre) was happy with the decision in the Lliuya v. RWE lawsuit.Credit: Christopher Neundorf/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n“The overarching question we always try to answer is whether and to what extent human-induced climate change altered the likelihood and intensity of the event,” says Friederike Otto, a physicist at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment in London.\n\nQuantifying how much of the blame for extreme weather events and the damage caused can be attributed to human-generated greenhouse-gas emissions is complex. It starts with modelling what the climate would be like without the estimated 50% increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide that has occurred since pre-industrial times (see go.nature.com/3jeqwae), then comparing the difference with data from current climate models.\n\nClimate models are therefore at the core of attribution science. These are computational simulations of Earth’s climate, applying mathematical equations that represent the laws of physics — the conservation of mass, energy and momentum — to real climate data. Models allow scientists to study the complex processes and interactions that shape climate and weather at various points in time and space, and the effects of changes, such as increasing atmospheric CO2.\n\nIn climate models, one particular equation is key: the Navier–Stokes equation, which describes the forces acting on a fluid particle. “So you have the Coriolis force, you have gravity, you have friction, and that equation is the basis of every single climate model,” Otto says.\n\nBut no two climate models are alike. “At the core they’re all the same, but they might have a different spatial resolution,” says Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the Australian National University in Canberra. That resolution can make a world of difference, especially when it comes to small-scale meteorological processes. We can’t resolve clouds, for example, unless we’re using climate models that are less than four cubic kilometres in resolution, Perkins-Kirkpatrick says. “The finer the resolution, the better we can represent those processes, which are important.”\n\nClimate models are technically global but each one is refined in its own way to most accurately represent a particular region or climate process, Otto says. “The UK Met Office one, for example, they adjust the parameters so that the model does give a very good representation of the climate in the UK, and that is usually to the detriment of somewhere else in the world,” she says. For example, until a few years ago, the climate model used for the United Kingdom didn’t describe the monsoon over India. “The models are getting better, and they are not quite so shocking any more, these trade-offs,” Otto says, although low- and middle-income countries are still under-represented in climate models3.\n\nClimate of change\n\nClimate models have improved with more data and more computing power, and the methods have also evolved over time. But Otto says the biggest advance that has happened during her career has been in policy, not technology.\n\nWhen she started as a researcher, most climate-modelling centres made it difficult for external researchers to use their climate-model data. But that soon changed when climate models and data were made centrally available, and “you suddenly had all the climate models in the world at your disposal”, she says. “When we started, we used one or two models that we could get, but now we sometimes use up to 70 different models, and that makes a huge difference.”\n\nIn 2023, wildfires spread rapidly through the village of Kraps near Fier, Albania. Credit: Adnan Beci/AFP via Getty\n\nInequity also affects the accuracy of climate models, because they rely on weather data — both historical and contemporary — and some regions are better resourced with meteorological infrastructure than are others, says Delta Merner, an environmental scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Baltimore, Maryland. “There also are methodological gaps, particularly in under-resourced regions, where there’s not high-quality baseline data,” she says. “Without that baseline data, you’re not able to do the attribution science, or you’re not able to do it at the scale that the legal questions might require.”\n\nMerner is currently working on a research project using machine learning to create synthetic data sets for under-resourced regions that lack consistent historical data, which could then aid the application of attribution science in those areas.\n\nAttributing accountability\n\nSince its emergence, climate-attribution science has broadened and diversified into multiple subfields.\n\nThe oldest of those is trend attribution, which looks for the signal of human influence over long-term climate trends, such as the link between rising global average surface temperatures and increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations. Event attribution analyses whether climate change made a particular extreme event — a flood, storm or heatwave, for example — more likely to happen or more intense.\n\nClimate models vary in their ability to model various extreme events, which can make it easier or harder to detect evidence of human-induced global warming. “Temperatures are easy,” says retired atmospheric scientist David Karoly at the University of Melbourne, Australia. “Particularly increases in extreme temperatures and the frequency of extreme temperatures; there’s been so much attribution of that that it’s actually quite difficult to get a paper published on that now.” Other extreme events such as storms, cyclones and fire weather are more challenging, either because those processes are not as well-represented in regional-scale climate models or because there are so many variables involved.\n\nSource attribution aims to pin the responsibility for an impact to a source, such as a major emitter or nation. Lliuya chose to sue RWE because, at the time of the case, the company was Europe’s single largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and estimated to have contributed 0.47% of global industrial greenhouse-gas emissions since the start of the industrial age (see go.nature.com/3jb9apw). Although 0.47% seems like a small fraction, it’s highly significant — something that the court decision also recognized, Walker-Crawford says.\n\nThe frequency of wildfires in Greece is increasing.

          "abstract": "A team including researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen have published a substantial correction to a 2020 paper reporting evidence for exotic quasiparticles called Majoranas.Credit: Philip Davali/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty\n\nA key study1 claiming to provide evidence of Majorana quasiparticles has received an extensive correction five years after it was published in the journal Science. Two researchers who flagged the paper as problematic say that the correction isn’t sufficient — triggering the latest dispute in a field dogged by controversy.\n\nMicrosoft quantum-computing claim still lacks evidence: physicists are dubious\n\nFor decades, physicists have been compelled by the idea that ultracold electrons in microscopic devices could behave collectively to form quasiparticles resistant to noise — both environmental perturbations and the inherent atomic jostling that plagues all quantum systems. The resilience of these Majoranas could make them ideal candidates for forming qubits, the informational units in quantum computers that are analogous to bits in classical machines. Studies to prove their existence have come up short, although recent bold claims by technology giant Microsoft have drawn considerable scrutiny.\n\nIn September 2018, a team led by Charlie Marcus, a physicist at the University of Copenhagen, who also worked for Microsoft at the time, posted a manuscript to the preprint server arXiv that described a fresh approach to generate Majoranas. The researchers made nanowires of indium arsenide surrounded by a shell of aluminium. Applying a small magnetic field, they then measured electrical signals “consistent” with pairs of Majoranas, one at either end of each wire. A year and a half later, they included theoretical simulations to justify their results, and the study was published in Science1.\n\nTwo physicists — Sergey Frolov, at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, and Vincent Mourik, now at the Research Centre Jülich in Germany — raised questions about the validity of the data, and in July 2021, Science applied an editorial expression of concern to the paper to warn readers of potential problems. Now, Science is lifting that warning, and the authors are issuing a 20-page correction to the paper’s supplementary material. News of the correction was first reported on 31 July by the technology news site The Register.\n\nThe Copenhagen group looked for Majoranas with devices made of indium arsenide wires (green) wrapped with aluminium (blue), as shown in this coloured electron microscope image. Credit: Reprinted with permission from Ref. 1.\n\nThe authors say they are relieved by the outcome. “It’s not really correcting any errors,” says co-author Saulius Vaitiekėnas, a physicist at the University of Copenhagen. “We are summarizing and providing additional information.” Frolov, on the other hand, argues that the data in the paper do not give a full picture of electron behaviour in the team’s devices and calls for retraction. “I do not trust this data,” he says.\n\nJake Yeston, an editor at Science who oversees physical-sciences submissions, says that the journal decided not to retract the paper because there was not a “clear, community-grounded view that it’s obviously wrong”. But, Yeston says, the lack of information in the original paper was a problem, and it has now been fixed. “It shouldn’t be that a reader who wants to know what your protocol was has to go to your lab and talk to you,” he says. “That should be in the paper.”\n\nQuestioning the data\n\nThirteen years ago, Frolov and Mourik were authors on a different study in Science2 that reported evidence for Majoranas. But excitement around the result faded after researchers discovered that other mundane phenomena could mimic the quasiparticles.\n\nWhen the Copenhagen team’s manuscript was posted to arXiv in 2018, Frolov and Mourik were dubious so they requested to see all of the data. E-mails reviewed by Nature show that the Copenhagen group released more data in November 2020. The pair of critics analysed the information provided and concluded that the data were incomplete and contradicted the study’s central claims. An internal inquiry by the university’s physics institute, however, found “no problems with the paper”, and that the Copenhagen team had turned over all of its data. Unsatisfied, editors at Science applied an expression of concern to the paper, and in October 2021, Yeston filed a complaint with the university to request an “independent, transparent investigation by experts”.\n\nEvidence of elusive Majorana particle dies — but computing hope lives on\n\nIn June 2022, the university assembled a panel of independent physicists to undertake the effort: Sophie Guéron, at the University of Paris-Saclay; Allan MacDonald, at the University of Texas at Austin; and Pertti Hakonen, at Aalto University in Finland. They travelled to Copenhagen, conducted interviews and examined data from 60 microscopic devices (the original paper included data from 4). Their year-long investigation3 found no misconduct, but stated that the team’s selection of data led to “conclusions that did not adequately capture the variability of outcomes”. The excluded data, however, did not undermine the paper’s main conclusions, they said.\n\nOne sticking point for Frolov and Mourik continues to be the Copenhagen team’s choice of ‘tunnelling regime’ — the range of low electrical conductivities over which the devices were scanned. The Copenhagen researchers said they saw signs of Majoranas persisting “throughout” their chosen tunnelling regime. But Frolov and Mourik said that the extra data they received showed that the tunnelling regime was much wider, and that the telltale Majorana signs were limited to the smaller tunnelling window.",

          "abstract": "This year’s Northern Hemisphere summer brought back-to-back heatwaves in several countries.Credit: Antonio Denti/Reuters\n\nThe summer of 2025 is already shaping up to be a record-breaker. Two intense heatwaves have swept across Europe, causing hundreds of heat-related deaths, fuelling wildfires and pushing power systems to their limit — and more are on the way.\n\nFrom mid-June to early July, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades, and the hottest June on record (see ‘Warmest June ever’). Temperatures soared above 40°C, and up to 46°C in Spain and Portugal, as a result of ‘heat domes’ — caps of high pressure that trap hot air in the atmosphere over an area, causing it to stay hotter for longer.\n\nSource: European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts/Copernicus\n\nResearch suggests that heatwaves in the region are becoming much more frequent — London can now expect events such as this every 6 years instead of every 60, according to a report published last month by Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute. “We’ll see more dramatic consequences for populations,” says Roman Hoffmann, a social scientist studying climate-related risks at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria. “And more stress that will affect health, well-being, livelihoods and human security more broadly.”\n\nDeadly conditions\n\nAcross 12 major European cities this year, about 1,500 of 2,300 estimated heat-related deaths — 65% — were driven by the extra heat resulting from fossil-fuel emissions, according to the Grantham Institute’s report (see ‘Lethal heatwaves’). The researchers compared real temperatures during the late-June 2025 heatwave with estimates of what temperatures would have been without human-caused climate change, then used health models to calculate the resulting heat-related deaths. The high temperatures were especially lethal for older adults, with people aged 65 and over making up nearly 90% of those who died.\n\nSource: Grantham Institute report Climate change tripled heat-related deaths in early summer European heatwave\n\nAnother study, which looked at the health effects of hot weather in Austria between 2015 and 20221, found that districts with older populations saw around 50% more deaths on very hot days than areas with younger populations did. The true toll could be even higher, because heat-related deaths are often undercounted, typically being recorded as the result of pre-existing conditions such as heart disease, says Hannah Schuster, a data analyst at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, who led the study. By 2050, many areas in Austria are expected to have twice as many hot days and many more older people — making heat-related deaths likely to rise unless action is taken to protect people from the heat, she adds.\n\nThe cool technologies that could protect cities from dangerous heat\n\nAlthough countries with mild climates have long had systems in place to manage cold weather, they’re much less prepared for the growing challenge of extreme heat, Schuster says. This lack of readiness makes the first heatwave of the year especially dangerous, says Peter Klimek, a medical data scientist at the Complexity Science Hub in Vienna. In his own, unpublished, analysis of ten years of hospital and ambulance data from Austria, he found a 30% spike in diagnoses of circulatory, respiratory and mental-health conditions during heatwaves.\n\nKlimek calls for better heatwave warning systems — particularly in hospitals and care homes — and long-term changes to cities, such as the creation of more cooling green spaces and modification of buildings to better dissipate heat.\n\nThousands displaced\n\nAlthough it’s hard to track how many people are forced to leave their homes owing to extreme heat alone, data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), a non-governmental organization in Geneva, Switzerland, show that thousands of people have been temporarily evacuated or displaced as a result of wildfires that occurred during this year’s heatwaves in Europe.\n\n“This year is already record-breaking when it comes to wildfires,” says Ivana Hajžmanová, the global monitoring manager at the IDMC. Not all wildfires are directly caused by climate change, but increasingly hot and dry conditions help fires to spread faster and burn for longer. In June and July, wildfires swept across southern Europe, disrupting a hospital and airport in Sardinia, and Turkey saw 50,000 evacuations as a result of fires in Izmir, the country’s largest-ever wildfire displacement event. Similarly, the region near Athens recorded 14,000 displacements in early June, IDMC figures show (see ‘Fleeing from fire’).\n\nSource: IDMCSource: IDMC\n\nIn 2024, weather-related disasters such as floods, wildfires and droughts forced about 45 million internal displacements — people leaving their homes within their countries — IDMC data suggest. The Institute for Economics & Peace, a think-tank based in Sydney, Australia, projects that by 2050, 3.4 billion people will live in countries facing severe ecological threats (in 2022, it was 2 billion). The ability to relocate from hotter to cooler locations on a more permanent basis is often limited to those with more resources, education and opportunities, Hoffmann says.\n\nUsing data from 72 countries, Hoffmann and his colleagues found that drought and dry conditions cause more people — especially in rural farming areas — to move long-term within their own countries2. Working-age people mainly leave poorer regions, whereas in wealthier countries, older adults are most likely to move — often for retirement.\n\nReduced productivity",

          "abstract": "In 1970, a woman in Mexico might have expected to have seven children, on average. By 2014, that figure had fallen to around two. As of 2023, it was just 1.6. That means that the population is no longer making enough babies to maintain itself.\n\nMexico is not alone: countries around the world are witnessing falling fertility rates1. Exceptions are few. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle estimates that, by 2050, more than three-quarters of countries will be in a comparable situation.\n\n“There has been an absolutely incredible drop in fertility — much faster than anyone had anticipated,” says Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “And it is happening in a lot of countries you would have never guessed.”\n\nHow to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes\n\nThe numbers are clear. What’s uncertain is how problematic this global ‘baby bust’ will be, and how nations should respond. In economies that have been built around the prospect of steady population growth, the concern is over future slumps in innovation and productivity, as well as having too few working-age citizens to support a growing number of older people. Researchers warn of ripple effects, from weakened military power and less political influence for countries with lower fertility rates, to fewer investments in green technology. It is imperative that countries address population decline and its impacts now, says Austin Schumacher, a health metrics researcher at the IHME.\n\nMany countries have been trying to take action, and the data suggest that some strategies are helpful — if politically fraught. But to scientists familiar with the data, even the most effective efforts are unlikely to bring a full rebound in fertility rates. That’s why many researchers are recommending a shift in focus from reversal to resilience. They see room for optimism. Even if countries can only slow the decline, that should buy them time to prepare for future demographic shifts. Ultimately, scientists say, fertility rates that are low, but not too low, could have some benefits.\n\n“We’re not not making babies,” says Barbara Katz Rothman, a sociologist at the City University of New York. “The human race is not folding in on itself.”\n\nWhat the data say\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the world’s total fertility rate — generally defined as the average number of children a woman would have during her reproductive years — was five. (Nature recognizes that transgender men and non-binary people might become pregnant. We use ‘woman’ and ‘women’ in this story to reflect language used in the field.) Some dubbed this mid-twentieth surge the baby boom. Ecologist Paul Ehrlich and conservation biologist Anne Ehrlich saw it differently, warning in their 1968 book The Population Bomb that overpopulation would lead to famine and environmental devastation. But they failed to anticipate advances in agricultural and health technology that would enable the population to double to eight billion in a little more than five decades.\n\nHumanity’s impact on the environment has intensified, owing to that growth and to increased consumption in many parts of the world. But concerns about overpopulation have flipped. Population growth has been slowing down over the past 50 years, and the average total fertility rate stands at 2.2. In about half of countries, it has fallen below 2.1, the threshold generally needed to maintain a steady population (see ‘Declining fertility’). Small changes in these numbers can have strong effects. A fertility rate of 1.7 could reduce a population to half its original size several generations sooner than a rate of 1.9, for example.\n\nSource: Our World in Data (https://go.nature.com/45RWYFJ)\n\nThe case of South Korea is under close scrutiny. Its fertility rate fell from 4.5 in 1970 to 0.75 in 2024, and its population peaked at just under 52 million in 2020. That figure is now declining at a pace that is expected to accelerate.\n\nForecasts for the world vary. The United Nations and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria, project gentler declines than the IHME does (see, for example, go.nature.com/4mtkj8b). But demographers generally expect that the global population will peak in the next 30 to 60 years and then contract. If it does, that will be the first such decline since the Black Death in the 1300s.\n\nAccording to the UN, China’s population might already have peaked in around 2022, at 1.4 billion. India’s could do the same in the early 2060s, topping out at 1.7 billion people. And, assuming the most likely immigration scenario, the US Census Bureau predicts that the US population will peak in 2080 at around 370 million. Meanwhile, many of the steepest near-term crashes are anticipated in middle-income countries: Cuba is expected to lose more than 15% of its population by 2050.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa is the notable exception. By 2100, more than half of the world’s babies are likely to be born there1, despite it having some of the world’s lowest incomes, weakest health-care systems and most fragile food and water supplies. Nigeria’s fertility rate remains above four, and its population is projected to grow by another 76% by 2050, which will make it the world’s third-most-populous country.\n\nStill, fertility-rate trends are hard to predict. Data gaps persist, and many models rely on the expectation that rates will rebound as they’ve done before. And as the Ehrlichs’ failed forecasts show, the past isn’t always indicative of the future. “We are groping in the dark,” says demographer Anne Goujon, programme director for population and just societies at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.\n\nWhat’s driving the decline?\n\nThe factors behind fertility collapse are numerous. They range from expanded access to contraception and education, to shifting norms around relationships and parenting. Debate continues over which factors matter most, and how they vary across regions.\n\nSome drivers reflect positive societal changes. In the United States, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that fertility has declined in part because of fewer unplanned pregnancies and teenage births. A long-term drop in domestic violence might also have contributed. Research in 2018 by Jennifer Barber, a sociologist now at Indiana University in Bloomington, and her colleagues showed that women in violent relationships have children at around twice the rate as do those in non-violent ones2.\n\n154 million lives and counting: 5 charts reveal the power of vaccines\n\nGlobally, access to contraception has helped to decouple sex from reproduction. In Iran, a national family-planning campaign that started in the 1980s contributed to the largest and fastest fall in fertility rates ever recorded: from nearly seven to under two in less than two decades3. The country reversed course around 2006, and is once again promoting policies to increase fertility rates.\n\nYoung people in wealthy countries are also forming fewer partnerships and having less sex. Alice Evans, a sociologist at King’s College London, has suggested that online entertainment is outcompeting real-world interactions and eroding social confidence. As women worldwide have gained education and career opportunities, many have grown more selective. Women want independence, while many men expect a “servant at home”, says Fernández-Villaverde. “Women are asking, ‘Why would I marry this person?’ A lot of men are undateable. Truly undateable.”\n\nThis disconnect fuels trends such as South Korea’s Four Nos feminist movement — in which many young women are rejecting dating, marriage, sex and childbirth — and a similar ‘boy sober’ movement among US women.\n\nMexico is one of several countries that has a fertility rate below replacement level.Credit: Bernd Vogel/Getty\n\nMany young people are also pursuing more education so as to gain jobs that might come with high stress and little stability early on. As a result, even people who pair up might postpone having children or have trouble conceiving because they are older. Those who do have kids face pressure to prepare them for the same high-stakes race for university and career, says Matthias Doepke, an economist at the London School of Economics and Political Science. “It’s not like we have withdrawn from parenting. It’s just that we concentrate all this investment, all these hours, on fewer children.”\n\nRising costs create further pressures. A UN survey of more than 14,000 people in 14 countries found that 39% cited financial limitations as a reason not to have children (see www.unfpa.org/swp2025). In US cities, births have fallen most sharply where housing prices have risen most rapidly (see go.nature.com/4tqqzsg).\n\nUltra-low fertility rates tend to emerge where these pressures converge, says Doepke. In South Korea, he says, housing is expensive, the parenting culture is intense and the working culture rewards long hours.\n\nOther contributors include declining sperm counts, potentially linked to environmental toxins. Many prospective parents also have growing anxiety about political and environmental instability, as highlighted in the UN survey. It’s not clear which of these many factors are most important in individual countries. But ultimately, low fertility rates “reflect broken systems and broken institutions that prevent people from having the number of children they want”, says Stuart Gietel-Basten, a sociologist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “That is the real crisis.”\n\nCountering the crash\n\nThe fallout will play out differently around the world. Middle-income countries, such as Cuba, Colombia and Turkey, could be the hardest hit, with falling fertility compounded by rising emigration to wealthier nations.\n\nUrban–rural divides will also deepen. As young people leave small towns, infrastructure such as schools, supermarkets and hospitals shuts down — prompting more to move away. Often, it’s older people who remain.\n\nGlobally, ageing is the core issue with population decline. In countries that have shrinking fertility rates, the proportion of people aged 65 or older is projected to nearly double, from 17% to 31% in the next 25 years (see go.nature.com/4fspvh5). As life expectancy rises, the demand for physical and fiscal support grows, yet there is a lag in supply. For the majority of countries hoping to break the fertility fall, tools exist. These include financial incentives, such as US President Donald Trump’s proposal to give each newborn baby US$1,000 in an investment fund.",

          "abstract": "Microplastics can degrade in the environment to form plastic dust.Credit: pcess609/Getty\n\nResearcher Karin Kvale first became interested in plastic pollution when she was living in Kiel, Germany, where her young children spent part of their school days on Falckenstein beach. “Every day they would come back with their pockets full of plastic fragments,” she says.\n\nThat was about five years ago, and, as an Earth-systems modeller, Kvale was intrigued by the idea that shards of degrading plastic might have become prevalent enough in nature to begin altering Earth systems. At the time, this concept was understudied, particularly in the oceans, on which Kvale focused her efforts.\n\nNature Spotlight: Climate change\n\nIn 2021, Kvale relocated to New Zealand and launched a consultancy called Aotearoa Blue Ocean Research, in Lower Hutt. She is now part of a community of scientists who study the plastic cycle — how plastic enters Earth systems, moves through the environment and affects its surroundings.\n\nAs fossil-fuel derivatives, plastics are made of refined carbon. By 2015, about 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste had been generated, with around 79% of this accumulating in landfills or the natural environment, where it breaks into ever smaller pieces1. Each year, plastic production increases exponentially: the total weight of carbon in plastic has surpassed the mass of all animals combined, and is likely to equal the mass of all bacteria by 2095 (see ‘Litter legacy’)2.\n\nSource: Adapted from Fig. 3 of ref. 2\n\nBy some estimates, plastic production contributes at least 4% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. However, once plastic enters the environment, it’s less well known how it affects Earth’s carbon cycle — the process that moves carbon between living organisms and the soil, oceans and atmosphere. As plastic degrades, it seeps into these environments, where studies suggest it interferes with crucial systems that regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide and stabilize global temperatures3–5. After environmental exposure, plastic can break down into dust, which extends its reach, according to environmental biogeochemist Janice Brahney at Utah State University in Logan. “Once in the atmosphere, it can get anywhere,” she says.\n\nIn circulation\n\nEach year, the world’s oceans pull around 10 billion tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere down towards the sea floor, through a process called the biological carbon pump6. The pump is facilitated, in part, by phytoplankton — tiny photosynthetic organisms that build their bodies out of atmospheric CO2 dissolved in the sea’s surface. When phytoplankton die, their bodies drift to the bottom of the ocean as a blizzard of organic particles that researchers call marine snow. Once this carbon is buried in sediment on the sea floor, it is stored away and no longer contributes to atmospheric warming.\n\nMoored fishing boats in Madura island, Indonesia, near a beach full of plastic waste.Credit: Suryanto Putramudji/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nThe past five years have seen a flurry of papers investigating how ocean plastic might slow down this biological carbon pump. Phytoplankton have been shown to stick to buoyant waste plastic, which reduces the speed at which marine snow sinks7. At the same time, the carbon found in plastic provides a food source for marine bacteria. As these bacteria feed on plastic and proliferate, they use up key nutrients from the ocean that are then unavailable to phytoplankton. This could reduce phytoplankton populations and limit the fall of marine snow. However, the question remains: can plastic weaken the biological carbon pump enough to reduce the amount of carbon that is stored and make a difference to global warming?\n\nKvale thinks the answer is ‘no’. The biological carbon pump is not a one-way street, she explains. Rather, ocean circulation brings some of the carbon back up to surface waters, where it can re-enter the atmosphere. As the climate warms, this ocean circulation is expected to weaken, meaning that less carbon will be carried back to the surface. But by Kvale’s calculations8, weakening circulation actually makes the carbon pump much more effective, outweighing any decrease in effectiveness caused by plastic. Over the next 100 years, “plastic pollution is really going to have a minor or negligible influence on how carbon is stored in the ocean”, she says.\n\nBut that assessment depends on how much the circulation changes. According to biogeochemist Aron Stubbins at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, “ocean circulation is really hard to predict”. Storms are expected to increase with climate change, so this could also compensate for weakening circulation, he points out — because stormy surface waters can force biological material downwards.\n\nStubbins says that, by his estimates, plastic could slow down the biological carbon pump by up to 25% by the end of the century, in the absence of other large changes. This, he says, “is why we got concerned and wrote a proposal to say we should figure out if this is real”. He is now gearing up to test how ocean plastic affects dissolved carbon and the biological carbon pump, having received a grant in April to apply climate models to real-world observations of plastic concentrations in the ocean. “It’s one of those proposals you get funded and you hope you’re wrong,” he says.\n\nHydrologist and geomorphologist Anne Jefferson collects beach sand that she will analyse for microplastics.Credit: Maddie Cross\n\nThere’s good evidence that plastic slows down the sinking of marine snow, says environmental scientist Xia (Alice) Zhu at the Memorial University of Newfoundland in St John’s, Canada, who has co-authored a systematic review on how the plastic cycle affects climate change9. But sorting out how slower marine snow will affect carbon storage in different oceans, and whether circulation patterns will play a part, requires more work. “We need more research into this before we write [plastic] off as insignificant,” she says.\n\nGlobal spread\n\nAlthough the impact of plastic on the oceans is still up for debate, plastic is having tangible effects on land, where it forms dust on the ground and in the air. Collectively, about 1,000 tonnes of plastic fall each year from the atmosphere onto lands in the western United States that are protected and relatively uninhabited, such as the Grand Canyon. That is equivalent to between 120 million and 300 million plastic water bottles, Brahney and her colleagues estimate10.\n\nStudies suggest that all this plastic dust alters the path of sunlight on its way to and from Earth’s surface, changing the amount of energy that’s available to heat the planet2,9. But whether the net effect will be that atmospheric plastic warms or cools Earth is still under investigation. In some of the most comprehensive work on the subject so far, scientists incorporated the effects of plastic dust into a climate model and found that warming or cooling depends on how high into the atmosphere the plastic has spread4. Although that study was based on non-pigmented plastics, most real-world plastic comes in many different colours, some of which reflect sunlight and some of which absorb it, Brahney says. This makes the net effect tough to sort out, but she and her collaborators are working on it.\n\nAirborne plastic also carries other risks. It has been found in natural environments such as forests, where it is trapped by the broad surfaces of leaves. When leaves fall to the ground in the autumn, they might be delivering plastic to the soil ecosystem, turning forest floors into plastic hot spots, suggests soil chemist Collin Weber at the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany.\n\nView of a beech-tree leaf under a high-resolution microscope, showing red microplastic particles (inset) on the surface.Credit: Collin Weber",

Credit: Say-Cheese/iStock via Getty\n\nWhen you bite into a piece of chocolate, you can taste its distinct fruity, nutty and earthy flavours.\n\nNow, scientists have gained fresh insights into how the fermentation of cocoa beans can affect that flavour profile.\n\nIn a study published today in Nature Microbiology1, researchers found that, during the fermentation process, the pH, temperature and microbial species all influence how the resulting chocolate tastes. They also replicated the flavour attributes of a high-quality chocolate in the laboratory by creating the ideal environment for fermentation.\n\nThe researchers hope that using these techniques will “create novelty and exciting new flavours for consumers in the future”, says study co-author David Gopaulchan, a plant geneticist at the University of Nottingham, UK.\n\n“I think this definitely has promise for people to start to play with and look at in terms of designer chocolates”, says Heather Hallen-Adams, a food scientist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.\n\nFermented flavours\n\nFermentation is a flavour-enhancing step in the production of some foods and drinks. Making wine, cheese or beer involves adding yeast or other microorganisms. To make chocolate, cocoa beans are removed from their pods, put together and left to ferment, after which they are dried and roasted. But unlike production of wine, beer and cheese, cacao fermentation is a natural process that usually involves microbial communities found in the environment, without the addition of specific strains. As a result, little is known about how different conditions or microbe species might influence the flavour of chocolate.\n\n“Ultimately, what we are trying to do is increase the quality of chocolates,” says Gopaulchan. His team took samples of cocoa beans from a farm in the Santander district of Colombia and measured changes in the pH and temperature of the fermenting beans. The scientists suspected that these conditions would affect the chocolate’s flavour, because of how they influenced interactions between bacteria and fungi.\n\nRaw cocoa beans must undergo fermentation before they can be made into chocolate.Credit: Ute Grabowsky/Photothek via Getty\n\nThe researchers then compared Santander cocoa samples with those from farms in the Huila and Antioquia regions of Colombia. They prepared cocoa ‘liquors’ from the fermented beans from the three farms to test their flavour profiles. This process involves drying, roasting and breaking down the beans to produce cocoa nibs, which are ground into a paste.\n\nA panel of trained food tasters sampling the liquors reported that those from Santander and Huila shared flavour attributes, with notes of roasted nuts, ripe berries and coffee. By comparison, cocoa liqour from Antioquia had a simpler, more bitter flavour. The cocoa from all three farms had similar genetic backgrounds, which allowed the researchers to exclude genotype as a factor influencing flavour.\n\nAnalysis of the fermentation conditions from the three farms found that unique microbial communities influenced the flavour profiles of the three cocoa liquors. For example, the fungal genera Torulaspora and Saccharomyces were strongly associated with flavour attributes of finer chocolate.\n\nDesigner chocolate",

          "abstract": "A mobile plant-phenotyping device screens lettuce varieties in the Netherlands.Credit: The Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Centre\n\nHumans’ collective prospects as a species don’t look great. By 2050, the global population will hit an estimated 9.7 billion, meaning there will be 1.5 billion more mouths to feed than today. Demand for animal-derived protein, with its high environmental price tag, is predicted to rise faster still. Global temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations are still increasing, tree cover is shrinking, oceans are acidifying, agricultural land is being lost to salinization, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent.\n\nNature Spotlight: Climate change\n\nBut where some see threats, others see opportunities. In May, researchers and small businesses with a range of ideas for producing food more sustainably gathered at F&A Next, a meeting on the future of food and agriculture held at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands. From climate-smart cultivation to breakthrough protein alternatives, a wave of innovations were revealed at the event.\n\nGlobally, protein demand is projected to grow more rapidly than the population, because of rising incomes, urbanization and changing dietary preferences. Farming animals for food contributes to deforestation, biodiversity loss and around 57% of the global greenhouse-gas emissions associated with food production1. As a result, many researchers think that the only way forward is to shift to alternative protein sources.\n\nSome popular plant-based proteins come with their own environmental issues. Soya-bean production, in particular, has been linked to deforestation, biodiversity loss and increased greenhouse-gas emissions, leading researchers and entrepreneurs to investigate alternatives.\n\nGreen, green grass\n\nGrassa, a start-up company based in Wageningen, is developing grass-based protein extracts for inclusion in pet food, livestock feed and, ultimately, products for human consumption, such as burgers, snack bars and dairy-free milk. “Compared to soy, grass protein has a better amino-acid profile, comparable digestibility, a lower carbon footprint and, once scaled up, can be priced competitively,” Rieks Smook, the firm’s chief executive, told the meeting.\n\nAt Grassa, freshly cut grass is fed into an extruder, producing a liquid that is then heated and filtered to denature the proteins. These coagulate into a green paste containing half of the grass’s protein. Organic solvents remove fats and chlorophyll from this paste, and membrane filtration removes sugars and minerals, leaving a neutral-tasting, off-white powder that is around 70% protein.\n\nA bee collects pollen from the flower in a rapeseed field.Credit: Ying Tang/NurPhoto via Getty\n\nCrushed grass is also left over from the extrusion process. According to Grassa, cows that are given a 50:50 mix of this by-product and their standard feed produce milk with a similar nutritional profile to that from animals on a normal diet. However, their manure contains less nitrogen — potentially reducing the run-off of polluting nutrients into waterways.\n\nSmook says that the carbon dioxide footprint of grass protein is significantly lower than that of imported soya, according to a life-cycle assessment by the company. Starting next year, Grassa is planning a two-year demonstration project involving 50 farmers, and is aiming to open a full-scale production plant in 2028, initially producing protein for pet food. The company wants to launch a grass-protein extract for human consumption by 2029, but will need the approval of the European Food Safety Authority to market it as a food ingredient in the European Union.\n\nFermented future\n\nHumans have used fermentation to preserve and transform foods for thousands of years, but now a new generation of start-up firms is using precision fermentation to make proteins with the same functional and nutritional properties as those produced by farm animals. “To a certain extent, we consider ourselves farmers,” Stephan van Sint Fiet, chief executive of Vivici, based in Leiden, the Netherlands, told the meeting. “We use crops from the land and then we make milk proteins -- but our ‘animals’ are just a little bit smaller.”\n\nVivici uses yeast that has been genetically modified to produce β-lactoglobulin (BLG), a whey protein found in cow’s milk that is prized for its functional properties, including gelling, binding, emulsification, solubility and ability to form foams. The yeast-made BLG is an ingredient in protein drinks and snacks, and Vivici is planning to launch another product based on lactoferrin, a protein found in the milk of humans and other mammals that supports the functioning of the immune system.\n\nBut there are questions over whether it is commercially viable to produce dairy proteins through precision fermentation. One estimate of the cost of scaling up such production for large-scale commercial applications puts the price tag at US$100 million at least2, depending on the volumes involved. Vivici says it is working on ways to bring costs down and that it is confident it can reach price parity with dairy-based equivalents.\n\nIf production can be scaled up economically, fermentation-derived protein could have environmental benefits. Researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany estimate that replacing 20% of the protein consumed in the form of meat from ruminants, such as cattle and sheep, with microbial protein by 2050 could halve deforestation and related CO2 emissions, while also lowering methane emissions3.\n\nProbiotics for plants\n\nBeyond alternative sources of protein, another way to feed Earth’s growing population sustainably is to increase crop yields, leading to lower carbon emissions by reducing the need to clear forests for agriculture. This approach has merit even when cultivation is soilless, or hydroponic.\n\nThe market for ‘controlled-environment agriculture’ — which includes the production of crops in hydroponic greenhouse systems — was valued at nearly $100 billion in 2024. But, just as the microorganisms in the human gut influence health, plants have evolved to rely on bacteria and fungi in soil to thrive, using these microbes to maximize nutrient uptake and build disease resistance. This means that the crops in soilless systems develop without the support of their natural microbial partners. “There’s an enormous amount of untapped potential to improve the growth, taste and disease resistance of these crops by putting those microbes back in,” said Paul Rutten, founder and chief executive of London-based start-up Concert Bio, at F&A Next.\n\nIn 2022, Rutten, who has a PhD in plant–microbe interactions from the University of Oxford, UK, began a three-year project with growers to identify the microbiomes of crops using DNA sequencing, as well as recording their growing conditions and yields. Using a machine-learning model, he highlighted correlations between the presence of specific microbes and higher yields in conditions of varying temperature, sunlight and humidity, for example.\n\nLast November, Concert Bio launched Overture A and B, two ‘biostimulant’ bacterial products made through fermentation, on the UK market for use in soilless agriculture. Rutten says that across 14 trials, lettuce growers achieved yield increases of 9.9%, on average. Trials of several candidate probiotics for tomatoes and cucumbers are under way.\n\nBring on the bees\n\nAnother way to reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture is to address insufficient pollination. Insect pollinators are crucial for the successful production of three-quarters of crop varieties. In 2022, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, estimated that pollinator deficits reduce global yields of fruit, vegetables and nuts by 3–5%4.\n\nAgriSound, a start-up firm based in York, UK, has developed a mobile-phone-sized device that can detect low bee numbers in fields and greenhouses on the basis of the sound of their wingbeats, enabling growers to bring in more bees when needed. The technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect the combinations of frequencies made by honeybees and bumblebees, and to cancel out noise (although this does not work in noisy environments, such as near major roads).\n\nThe AgriSound system uses artificial intelligence to identify the sound of honeybees’ and bumblebees’ wingbeats, and thereby determine bee numbers.Credit: Robin Wilson\n\nCasey Woodward, AgriSound’s founder, took inspiration from the acoustic systems already used to identify respiratory disease on pig farms and injurious pecking in poultry farms. Woodward told F&A Next attendees that, in trials at sites where the AgriSound system identified low bee numbers, strawberry growers increased the fruit’s weight by 8.5%, sweetness by 5% and the proportion of high-quality produce by 10% by introducing extra bees, when compared with neighbouring control locations where bee numbers were left low.\n\n“We also have evidence to show that precision pollination can extend the shelf life of strawberries by about 12 hours, which reduces waste and carbon emissions as a result,” Woodward added. The company is seeking to adapt its technology to identify other pollinators and pests.\n\nBreeding better",

          "authors": "Raihan Alam, Tage S. Rai",
          "abstract": "Third-party punishment is theorized by some scholars to be essential to the evolution of large-scale cooperation, but empirically, it often fails to bring about its desired effects. Here, we suggest that third-party punishment destabilizes cooperation when third parties have profit motives to punish. Across nine economic games and judgment experiments (including four preregistered studies), we find that when third-party punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately and remain lower even when punishment outcomes are optimized to support cooperative behavior. Profitable third-party punishment causes targets of punishment to anticipate antisocial punishment and perceive social norms in terms of self-interest, suggesting that the introduction of payment degrades the communicative signals that punishment is meant to convey about punishers’ intentions and social norms. Critically, participants who would benefit from increased cooperation inadvertently reduce their own monetary compensation by opting in to experimental conditions that pay punishers, suggesting that they intuitively fail to consider the signaling consequences of profit motives to punish. Implications for systems of punishment and cooperation in real-world contexts are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Interest in bringing Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and Western Science together to enhance climate and landscape resilience is growing rapidly, particularly for engagement with pyrogenic communities around the world. For these systems, Indigenous Knowledge offers unique insights that reflect millennia of intimate engagement with local landscapes, while Western Science can offer additional understanding of the emergence of climates and ecological conditions that are novel at evolutionary timescales. Here, we weave Indigenous Knowledge together with a multicentury history of fire, landuse, and forest development derived from tree rings to retell a more complete history of human engagement with the places commonly referred to as Wisconsin and Minnesota Points at the head of Lake Superior in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Our aim in this work is to create mutual reciprocal benefits for those involved in this work to disrupt a long history of extractive research and to honor the knowledge shared with us by reducing barriers to the revitalization of traditional cultural and landuse practices. This intensely local study, contextualized by substantial bodies of Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science, illustrates the importance of place-based and community-based research for understanding the role of Indigenous fire stewardship in shaping pine barrens sites and demonstrates how these fine-scale relationships are linked to regional landscape diversity yet may be invisible to other proxy-based studies. These results help (re)center Indigenous Knowledge and traditional fire-use practices in the process of ecocultural fire restoration for the creation of diverse, resilient, and just socioecological systems that continue to transition toward a warmer future.",

          "abstract": "The KRAS oncogene has been associated with many types of cancer, including pancreatic, lung, and colorectal. For decades, its gene products were thought to be undruggable. However, during the last decade, a large battery of KRAS inhibitors selective against specific mutations (KRAS G12C and KRAS G12D ), panKRAS inhibitors active against all KRAS isoforms, or even panRAS inhibitors, capable of inhibiting the three members of the RAS family, have been developed. In mice, the Kras locus is essential for embryonic development and can sustain adult homeostasis in the absence of Hras and Nras expression. Thus, we considered of interest to interrogate the role of the Kras locus in an experimental system to generate potentially relevant information regarding the use of panKRAS or panRAS inhibitors in the clinic. Here, we report that systemic ablation of Kras expression in adult mice does not induce significant changes in overall survival, body weight, glucose levels, metabolic profile, or heart function. In contrast, flow cytometry and histopathological analyses of organs such as blood, bone marrow, and spleen showed a significant increase of the myeloid lineage leading to myelomonocytic metaplasia. In this context, replacement of the KRAS isoforms by HRAS is sufficient to maintain adult homeostasis, suggesting that the unique properties of the Kras locus are primarily due to its pattern of expression rather than to the activity of its gene products.",

          "abstract": "Vertebrate locomotion is due to the interplay of neural oscillators and sensory feedback loops in the spinal cord that interact with the body and the environment. Here, we study these circuits with a focus on undulatory locomotion as produced by elongated fish such as eels and lampreys. We address three questions: i) How do proprioception (stretch feedback) and exteroception (pressure on skin) interact with local oscillators to generate stable swimming patterns? ii) Can these feedback loops also contribute to dry ground locomotion? iii) Can they explain the remarkable robustness of eels against spinal cord transections? To address these questions, we developed abstract models of the locomotion circuits based on coupled phase oscillators, local stretch and pressure feedback loops, and simulated muscle models that were tested both in simulation and with a real undulatory robot. We also performed swimming experiments with eels before and after spinal cord transections. We found that stretch and pressure feedback work well together in swimming, as they contribute to rapid pattern generation and can, in principle, both replace direct couplings between oscillators. Interestingly, the swimming controllers could generate good ground locomotion when placed in an arena with pegs. For ground locomotion, the stretch feedback is more beneficial than pressure feedback. Finally, our models could replicate the remarkable ability of eels to keep swimming shortly after a full spinal cord transection. We found that stretch feedback and the ability of oscillators to spontaneously oscillate are likely explanations for keeping the neural oscillators active and coordinated below the transection.",

          "abstract": "Sympatric speciation is considered rare, but oceanic Howea palms, crater lake cichlids, and parasitic indigobirds provide compelling evidence that it occurs. Still, the frequency of sympatric speciation and its relationship to morphological divergence in plants remains poorly understood, especially in plants. Here, we analyze the geographic distributions, traits, and divergence times of palm and conifer sister species (740 species from 108 genera) to determine the dominant geographic mode and role of morphological divergence in plant speciation. We show that allopatric speciation is dominant, and while frequent sympatric speciation cannot be discounted, the most likely scenario is that zero (conifers) or 10% (palms) of speciation events occur in sympatry. Our models show that the incidence of sympatry among sister pairs rises rapidly within the first million years after speciation and then declines, suggesting that species failing to attain sympatry early tend to remain allopatric. Finally, we find no evidence for morphological divergence in allopatric or sympatric palms. Our findings question the link between speciation and morphological divergence and suggest that while plants and animals share similar modes of speciation, plants exhibit a complex spatiotemporal dynamic, challenging the typical vertebrate pattern of steadily increasing sympatry.",

          "abstract": "Rates of phenotypic evolution vary across traits, and these evolutionary patterns themselves evolve. Understanding how development contributes to such patterns remains a challenge because it requires large-scale measurement of phenotypic variation resulting from random mutations across multiple species. Using the experimentally tractable system of nematode vulval development, we quantified the evolution and mutational sensitivity of six cell fates across two clades. First, we find that the cell whose fate evolves fastest is distinct for each clade: P3.p in Caenorhabditis and P4.p in Oscheius . Second, we show that this evolutionary pattern matches the pattern of variation within species of each clade. Third, we find that within each clade, the differential effect on each cell of random mutation, quantified as their mutational phenotypic variance, is sufficient to explain the observed phenotypic evolution. Finally, we propose that the difference between clades is explained by a simple spatial shift across cells of the sensitive region in a Wnt dose–response curve. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the evolving structure of the genotype–phenotype map and measures of developmental sensitivity into the understanding of phenotypic change at both micro- and macroevolutionary scales.",

ZNF93 depletion impairs DNA synthesis, activates replication and DNA damage checkpoints, and triggers proinflammatory phenotypes. Conversely, its overexpression enhances resistance to exogenous genotoxic stress, mirroring the effects observed with APOBEC3B depletion. ZNF93 expression correlates with cell proliferation rates and is overexpressed in many cancer types. These findings suggest that ZNF93 serves as a critical guardian of genome integrity, co-opted by cancer cells to counterbalance APOBEC3B-induced and L1-derived genomic instability and inflammation.",

          "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum pathology is driven by the accumulation of parasite-infected erythrocytes in blood capillaries. This sequestration process is mediated by the parasite’s P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesins, which bind select endothelial cell receptors. A subset of PfEMP1 binding human endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through their cysteine-rich interdomain region alpha 1 (CIDRα1) domains drives the pathogenesis to severe malaria. Despite high sequence diversity among CIDRα1 domains, individuals living in malaria-endemic regions become immune to severe disease in part through acquisition of antibodies inhibiting the PfEMP1–EPCR interaction. Here, we demonstrate an approach to identify pathogen-specific human monoclonal antibodies from plasma, combining mass spectrometry analysis of antigen-purified polyclonal plasma IgG and Ig transcript sequencing. We identified a clonal family of broadly reactive and EPCR binding-inhibitory human monoclonal antibodies against CIDRα1. The antibodies, isolated from a 9-y-old child, exhibited potent inhibition of EPCR binding broadly across CIDRα1 domains as well as binding of infected erythrocytes to EPCR. Structural analysis of one antibody variant complexed with CIDRα1 revealed a shared epitope of the clonal antibody family overlapping the EPCR binding site and the epitopes of two previously identified monoclonal antibodies, C7 and C74, with similar functional patterns. However, although C7, C74, and 110-3 antibodies all depend on the same few residues conserved in CIDRα1 to retain EPCR binding, the 110-3 antibodies contact additional variable residues, reducing their breadth of reactivity across the CIDRα1 family. These data bolster the hypothesis that broadly inhibitory antibodies against severe malaria-associated PfEMP1 target similar epitopes and are commonly developed in malaria-exposed individuals.",

          "abstract": "A record-breaking melt season affected the Arctic glaciers of Svalbard in summer 2024 by a substantial margin. Across the entire archipelago, glacier melting corresponded to an anomaly of up to four SD and exceeded any previous observation. The pan-Svalbard mass loss in summer 2024 amounts to ~61.7 ± 11.1 Gt and corresponds to 1% of the total ice volume on Svalbard and is comparable to that of the Greenland ice sheet (55 ± 35 Gt), which occupies an area about 50 times larger. Altogether, Svalbard and other glacier regions surrounding the Barents Sea lost 102.1 ± 22.9 Gt of ice in a single year and contributed 0.27 ± 0.06 mm (of which 0.16 mm alone is due to Svalbard) to global sea-level, putting the circum-Barents region among the strongest contributors to global sea-level rise in 2024. Most of the 2024 glacier melt occurred during a 6-wk period of persistent atmospheric circulation pattern causing record-high air temperatures, an event with an extremely low recurrence interval under current climate conditions. However, future climate projections suggest that such temperature levels will become increasingly commonplace by the end of the 21st century, potentially even surpassing those of 2024. Svalbard’s summer of 2024 serves as a forecast for future glacier meltdown in the Arctic, offering a glimpse into conditions 70 y ahead.",

          "abstract": "Hybridization is a double-edged sword: While it can erode distinct evolutionary lineages, it can also introduce genetic diversity and adaptive potential into dwindling populations. In the Critically Endangered Balearic shearwater ( Puffinus mauretanicus ), this dilemma is exacerbated by a limited understanding of the extent and consequences of hybridization with the Yelkouan shearwater ( Puffinus yelkouan ). This knowledge gap has limited the scope of science-based conservation strategies to avoid the Balearic shearwater’s imminent extinction. Here, we investigate shearwater hybridization dynamics and their effect on genome-wide diversity in the Balearic shearwater. Divergence dating, demographic modeling, and admixture analyses suggest that these two poorly differentiated shearwater lineages have experienced recurrent episodes of divergence and widespread hybridization during glacial cycles. Selection scans reveal a 500 kb region hosting an adaptive haplotype that potentially underpins interspecific differences in migratory behavior and which has been repeatedly introgressed between the two taxa. Moreover, we show that interspecific gene flow has prevented increases in homozygosity and genetic load, and through forward simulations, we illustrate how it can buffer the negative effects of future population bottlenecks in the Balearic shearwater. Our findings illustrate how introgression can be crucial for maintaining genetic diversity in threatened taxa and highlight the need for considering the protection of hybridization in conservation plans.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is shifting species distributions, leading to changes in community composition and novel species assemblages worldwide. However, the responses of tropical forests to climate change across large-scale environmental gradients remain largely unexplored. Using long-term data over 66,000 trees of more than 2,500 species occurring over 3,500 m elevation along the hyperdiverse Amazon-to-Andes elevational gradients in Peru and Bolivia, we assessed community-level shifts in species composition over a 40+ y time span. We tested the thermophilization hypothesis, which predicts an increase in the relative abundances of species from warmer climates through time. Additionally, we examined the relative contributions of tree mortality, recruitment, and growth to the observed compositional changes. Mean thermophilization rates (TR) across the Amazon-to-Andes gradient were slow relative to regional temperature change. TR were positive and more variable among Andean forest plots compared to Amazonian plots but were highest at midelevations around the cloud base. Across all elevations, TR were driven primarily by tree mortality and decreased growth of highland (cool-adapted) species rather than an influx of lowland species with higher thermal optima. Given the high variability of community-level responses to warming along the elevational gradients, the high tree mortality, and the slower-than-warming rates of compositional change, we conclude that most tropical tree species, and especially lowland Amazonian tree species, will not be able to escape current or future climate change through upward range shifts, causing fundamental changes to composition and function in Earth’s highest diversity forests.",

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has shown poor efficacy in PDAC, partly due to the desmoplastic stroma and low immunogenicity. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) promotes both fibrosis and immune evasion, making it a compelling target for TME remodeling. Here, we develop a dual-action, programmable immunoprobiotic delivery system (EcN@Nbs-NP@API-1) that combines Pin1 inhibition with PD-L1 blockade to enhance immunotherapy. This system uses Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to selectively deliver nanoparticles encapsulating the Pin1 inhibitor API-1 to PDAC, enabling sustained release to degrade the fibrotic stroma and upregulate PD-L1 on tumor cells, promoting immune infiltration. Engineered EcN also produces anti-PD-L1 nanobodies in situ, synergizing with API-1 to boost CD8 + T cell–mediated immunity. In orthotopic PDAC mouse models, this strategy remodels the TME, enhances immune cell infiltration, and improves antitumor response while minimizing systemic toxicity. Moreover, it shows efficacy in other ECM-rich tumors, such as triple-negative breast cancer, highlighting its broader potential. This work presents a promising platform to overcome immunotherapy resistance in solid tumors.",

          "abstract": "In cardiac muscle, myosin molecules exist in multiple structural states as they transit through their ATPase cycle, including an off-cycle resting or OFF-state with their catalytic heads in a folded structure known as the interacting-heads motif (IHM). The blocked head configuration (BHC) of the IHM is unusual because its light chain binding region is held in an exaggerated prestroke angle stabilized by interactions with its own S2 tail. An additional partial OFF-state, where the second head of the IHM is not folded back onto the blocked head, has been proposed, which still has the blocked head interacting with S2. Many mutations in the human β-cardiac myosin gene that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are thought to destabilize (decrease the population of) the OFF-states. The effects of pathogenic mutations on the folded back structural states are often studied using indirect assays, including a single-ATP turnover assay that detects the biochemical state of myosin functionally. Here, we use a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based sensor for direct quantification in solution of the myosin BHC state. Using the FRET sensor, we provide evidence that the myosin tail acts as an activator of the recovery stroke transition after ATP binding to poststroke state apomyosin and that BHC formation is rapid after ATP binding and depends on formation of the prestroke state. We propose that the positively charged loop 2 of the prestroke state head interacts with the Ring 2 cluster of negatively charged residues on the S2 tail to form a preBHC state that facilitates BHC state formation.",

Danicamtiv is one of these molecules; however, its direct effects on myosin’s single molecule mechanics and kinetics are not well understood. Using optical trapping techniques, stopped flow transient kinetics, and in vitro reconstitution assays, we found that danicamtiv reduces the size of cardiac myosin’s working stroke without affecting actomyosin detachment kinetics at the level of individual crossbridges. We demonstrate that danicamtiv accelerates actomyosin association kinetics, leading to increased recruitment of myosin crossbridges and subsequent thin filament activation at physiologically relevant calcium concentrations. We demonstrate important mechanistic differences with another cardiac myosin binding myotrope, omecamtiv mecarbil. Finally, we computationally model how the observed changes in mechanics and kinetics at the level of single crossbridges can contribute to increased cardiac contraction. Taken together, our results have important implications for the design of sarcomeric-targeting compounds for heart failure.",

          "authors": "Alejandro V. Cano, Olaf P. Jensen, Vasilis Dakos",
          "abstract": "Fish population biomass fluctuates through time in ways that may be either gradual or abrupt. While abrupt shifts in fish population productivity have been shown to be common, they are rarely integrated into stock assessment or fishery management, in part because of the difficulty of predicting when abrupt shifts may occur and which stocks are prone to such shifts. In this study, we address the latter challenge by designing a mechanism-agnostic context-specific approach that is based on exploiting the dynamical properties of fish population fluctuations for detecting potential abrupt shifts. We use time series of fish population biomass from three global datasets, first, to classify their shapes into abrupt and nonabrupt (linear, quadratic, or no change) classes, and, second, to predict classified shapes based only on their dynamical footprint (a set of metrics such as variance, autocorrelation, etc, of the time series). We find that populations prone to abrupt shifts can be detected with moderate accuracy in the three datasets in spite of data limitations. In total, we identified 50 populations at risk of future abrupt shifts across 11 different Large Marine Ecosystem regions. Our context-specific approach offers critical insights into population stability and enables the identification of stocks whose dynamical properties suggest that they would benefit from more precautionary management.",

In up to a quarter of individuals with BWSp, the epigenetic alterations are not confined to 11p15.5 imprinting control regions but also involve other imprinted gene clusters (multilocus imprinting disturbance; MLID). In a consanguineous family with two children diagnosed with BWSp and MLID, the affected individuals were homozygous for a missense variant in UHRF1 , a gene previously implicated in the maintenance of DNA methylation. To investigate whether the UHRF1 c. 2001G&gt;C, p.(Lys667Asn) missense substitution predisposes to abnormal establishment/maintenance of genomic imprinting patterns, a genetically engineered mouse model with a Uhrf1 p.(Lys661Asn) variant was developed. Mice homozygous for the variant born to heterozygous mothers did not display an abnormal phenotype, but homozygotes born to healthy homozygous mothers displayed a range of phenotypes including prenatal lethality. Also, MLID was observed in affected mouse embryos. These findings are consistent with biallelic UHRF1 variants in affected individuals resulting in an autosomal recessively inherited cause of MLID in humans and expand the range of epigenetic disorders associated with UHRF1.",

While the extent of terminal Messinian drawdown and abruptness of reconnection are debated, recent work inferred that an anomalously long-lasting eastern Mediterranean organic-rich “mystery sapropel” layer was deposited due to salinity-stratification and anoxia following catastrophic flooding that refilled the basin. However, independent evidence is required to test this hypothesis. Here, we present extensive proxy data and numerical model results to show that irrespective of the largely hypersaline or oligohaline conditions proposed for the terminal Messinian, the eastern Mediterranean became oxygenated due to the ~1.5-km-high, turbulent and aerated cascade that refilled the basin, which created a salinity-stratified but oxygenated water column that allowed preservation of only the most recalcitrant organic components. Next, oxygen was gradually depleted over a period of up to 12,000 y due to remineralization of sinking organic matter, culminating in a stratified, anoxic basin. It took 33,000 y after flooding (7,000 y longer than suggested previously) for turbulent diffusion to weaken the stratification and allow resumption of convective deep-water renewal, which marked the final return of normal oxygenated marine conditions throughout the Mediterranean.",

          "abstract": "Phytophthora soja e-induced root rot poses a major threat to soybean production. While the molecular mechanisms underlying soybean– P. sojae interactions have been extensively studied, their biochemical basis remains largely unexplored. Previous research has identified key metabolic modules involved in pathogen defense, but structural diversity has largely been constrained by studies on single soybean accessions. Here, we broadened the chemical search space to a diverse soybean germplasm collection using high-throughput metabolomics as a powerful tool for comprehensive metabolic profiling. Chemical classes of lipids and phenylpropanoids again retrieved the most pronounced responses upon P. sojae infection in general. A two-layer analytical strategy further finely resolved metabolites into pathogenesis-, resistance-, and tolerance-type accumulation patterns, leading to the identification of cinnamaldehyde and coumestrol as potent defense metabolites. Bioassays validated cinnamaldehyde directly and strongly inhibited cyst germination and mycelial growth, and coumestrol, a benzofuran-type metabolite, exhibited broad-spectrum activity against spore germination as an identified phytoalexin. Multiomics analyses nailed down the candidate of coumestrol biosynthesis genes, and genetically overexpression of regulatory genes ( Dir2a/4a/4b ) in hairy root systems increased coumestrol accumulation thus positively correlating with improved host resistance. Interestingly, tolerance-type compounds may serve distinct ecological roles, as exemplified by daidzein, which, despite being classified as a tolerance-type metabolite, recruits more zoospores facilitating secondary infection in fact. This study highlights a systematic approach for population-level investigations and emphasizes the necessity of integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation to accurately predict metabolite or gene ecological functions.",

          "abstract": "The D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) is subject to light-induced damage. In plants, D1 photodamage activates translation of chloroplast psbA mRNA encoding D1, providing D1 for PSII repair. Three D1 assembly factors have been implicated in the regulatory mechanism: HCF244 and RBD1 activate psbA translation, whereas HCF136 represses psbA translation in the dark. To clarify the regulatory circuit, we analyzed psbA ribosome occupancy in dark-adapted and illuminated rbd1 and rbd1;hcf136 double mutants in Arabidopsis and in Zm- hcf244 and Zm- hcf244; Zm- hcf136 double mutants in maize. The results show that RBD1 is required for light-induced psbA translation but has only a small effect on psbA ribosome occupancy in the dark. RBD1 is not required for psbA translation when HCF136 is absent, indicating that RBD1 activates psbA translation in the light by inhibiting HCF136’s repressive effect. By contrast, HCF244 is required to recruit ribosomes to psbA mRNA in light, dark, and in the absence of HCF136. We demonstrate further that HCF244 is not required for the translational activator HCF173 to bind the psbA 5’UTR. These results show that RBD1 is central to the perception of the D1 photodamage that triggers D1 synthesis and that it activates psbA translation by relieving repression by an HCF136-dependent assembly intermediate. HCF244 activates downstream of those events without impacting HCF173’s binding to psbA mRNA. The results implicate a feature of nascent D1 that is affected by both HCF136 and RBD1 as the signal that reports D1 photodamage to regulate psbA translation rate as needed for PSII repair.",

In this study, we used neural network models trained on natural speech input to examine how these efficient representations emerge. Our models show that multiple phonological systems can be organized through parallel representations, preserving the unique aspects of each language while maintaining shared articulatory features. This parallel structure scaled effectively from two to three languages without needing additional neural architecture, highlighting the inherent efficiency in multilingual processing. Furthermore, the development of phonological representations varied based on the timing of language exposure, showing how earlier-learned languages shape the acquisition of subsequent ones. These findings imply that the human ability to speak multiple languages may arise from general principles of neural organization that optimize shared resources while maintaining essential distinctions between languages.

Although the sensorimotor system is broadly organized somatotopically, higher-level sensorimotor areas encode action-type information for reaching and grasping actions—regardless of the acting body part. Does the brain similarly support generalization across acting body parts for more evolutionarily recent actions, such as tool-use? We tested whether there is a body-part-independent action-type organization in sensorimotor areas by examining fMRI responses for tool-use actions that participants performed with their hands or feet. We additionally included individuals born without hands to test whether hand sensorimotor experience is necessary for the development of this action-type organization. Across analyses, we found a consistent dissociation in the motor system. The primary sensorimotor cortices encoded concrete, body-part specific information in both groups. In contrast, higher-level motor areas within the tool-use network represent abstract, action-type information independent of the body part for both groups. Together, our results suggest that the hierarchical organization of the motor system is not dependent on a long evolutionary history of an action. Further, this organization is not dependent on an individual’s manual sensorimotor experience. Our results also show that the functional reorganization in congenital handlessness follows the hierarchical organization of the intact cortex, revealing the limitations of brain plasticity. Finally, the results support using a readout of a more abstract code for hierarchical brain–computer interfaces.",

We explore analytically when this early warning signal applies to varied systems with discrete, symbolic dynamics.

We leveraged spatially explicit tree inventory data from the 16-ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP) in Puerto Rico to validate soil eDNA as a spatially explicit indicator of tree diversity/composition. Using a comprehensive local chloroplast trnL -P6 reference library, we analyzed soil samples at multiple scales through eDNA trnL -P6 metabarcoding. We compared eDNA taxonomic diversity/composition, considering several bioinformatic thresholds, with inventory data across a range of spatial scales, as well as random points to compare observed correlations with random expectations. Despite considerable fine-scale heterogeneity in soil plant eDNA composition, we detected 53 tree Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) across the LFDP, corresponding to 68% of tree OTUs from the census data. Encouragingly, this equated to 98% of the total basal area (and 98% of the total stems). An initial confusion matrix evaluation suggested a highly localized eDNA signal (within 5 m of the sampled locations). However, comparison with random expectations revealed a lack of support for a fine-scale spatial signal due to misclassification (i.e., eDNA false presence or/and false absence) of relatively common taxa. Our study shows that “universal” PCR primer metabarcoding of tree eDNA in tropical soils may be useful for assessing dominant taxa at landscape scales, but not for spatially explicit characterization of rare species and community composition at local scales.",

However, efforts to address the homochirality problem have often focused on a single compound, a single molecular class, or invoke an extraterrestrial origin. Here, we emphasize the importance of achieving homochirality across an entire prebiotic chemical network and explore a terrestrial pathway for its emergence. This pathway is supported by recent experimental results from several independent studies, as well as analyses of pristine asteroid materials. Our analysis identifies the genome as a key site for achieving network-scale homochirality on early Earth and addresses the opposite handedness of D -nucleic acids and L -peptides in biology through nonenzymatic, stereoselective coded peptide synthesis.",

Global aboveground biomass is projected to decline by 4 to 16% under a 2 °C increase in climate warming.

Simple measures of dependence, such as Pearson correlation, are fast to compute, but limited in that they are designed to detect linear relationships between variables. Complex measures are known with the ability to detect any kind of dependence, but they do not readily scale to many modern datasets of interest. We introduce the InterDependence Score (IDS), a scalable measure of dependence that captures linear and various nonlinear dependencies between random variables. Our IDS algorithm is motivated by a dependence measure defined in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, capable of capturing any type of dependence, and a fast (linear time) algorithm that neural networks natively implement to compute dependencies between random variables. We apply IDS to identify 1) relevant variables for predictive modeling tasks, 2) sets of words forming topics from millions of documents, and 3) sets of genes related to “gene-expression programs” in tens of millions of cells. We provide an efficient implementation that computes IDS between billions of pairs of variables across millions of samples in several hours on a single GPU.

However, the roles of this and other strains in disease progression remain to be investigated. Herein, we assess the contribution of C. concisus secondary metabolites to inflammation. Through untargeted metabolomics, we identified a diverse array of nineteen indole-containing metabolites produced by C. concisus , including trisindoline, previously isolated from a marine bacterium. Collectively, these metabolites modulate inflammatory responses by significantly inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. The metabolites act through the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor arylhydrocarbon receptor and in vivo intravital imaging revealed a marked increase in the recruitment and activation of immune cells, specifically neutrophils and macrophages, following the administration of trisindoline. Several indole metabolites also exhibited antimicrobial activity against commensal strains that facilitate a proper immune response. Our study provides a possible rationale for the association of C. concisus with IBD and underscores the complex interplay between gut bacteria and host immunity. The identification of indole-derived secondary metabolites as key modulators of inflammation offers new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Selected proteins containing an N-terminal cysteine (Nt-Cys) are subjected to rapid, O 2 -dependent proteolysis via the Cys/Arg-branch of the N-degron pathway. Cysteine dioxygenation is catalyzed in mammalian cells by 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO), an enzyme that manifests extreme O 2 sensitivity. The canonical substrates of this pathway in mammalia are the regulators of G-protein signaling 4, 5, and 16, as well as interleukin-32. In addition to operating as an O 2 -sensing mechanism, this pathway has previously been described as a sensor of nitric oxide (NO), with robust effects on substrate stability upon modulation of NO bioavailability being widely demonstrated. Despite this, no mechanism to describe the action of NO on the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway has yet been substantiated. We demonstrate that NO can regulate the stability of Cys N-degron substrates indirectly via the regulation of ADO cosubstrate availability. Through competitive, O 2 -dependent inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, NO can substantially modify cellular O 2 consumption rate and, in doing so, alter the availability of O 2 for Nt-Cys dioxygenation.

          "abstract": "Understanding how electric fields influence water dissociation at heterogeneous interfaces is crucial for controlling interfacial chemical reactions and advancing next-generation energy technologies. Herein, ab initio–based machine learning simulations show that even small electric field changes can significantly alter the water dissociation fraction at planar TiO 2 –electrolyte interfaces. The resulting free energy difference between undissociated and dissociated interfacial water exhibits a linear dependence on the field change with a slope of 1.97 e Å, which far exceeds the dissociation-induced dipole change of a water molecule. Employing a machine-learned collective variable to investigate the reaction statistics of thousands of water dissociation/recombination events, we find that small electric field changes exert minor effects on individual reaction energy barriers but significantly influence the populations of local configurations associated with initial states that are most favorable for reactions. These findings elucidate the pronounced impact of electric fields on interfacial water dissociation and reveal a mechanism for electric-field-controlled chemical reactions.",

Yet there is still limited understanding of the impacts of climate change and human water withdrawal on river connectivity. Here, we assess the river flow connectivity of 217,001 river reaches in mainland China from 1961 to 2020 and the impact of different climate warming trends and water withdrawals for different sectors. We estimate that naturally intermittent rivers represent about 13% of all river reaches, with a large contrast between northern and southern China (12% vs. 1%, respectively). Although river intermittency decreased slightly during this period (i.e., river connectivity lengthened due to increasing precipitation), warming temperatures offset this decrease by reducing surface water persistence, causing the decrease (−476 vs. −233 km/y) to double when removing the long-term temperature trend. Critically, the length of intermittent rivers increased remarkably from 13 to 50% when considering human water withdrawal by agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors, in addition to environmental flow requirements. Our findings highlight the urgent need to maintain sustainable water resources in a warming climate in which unregulated water abstractions increasingly threaten river flow connectivity, particularly in drying regions.",

          "abstract": "Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a severely painful condition that profoundly impacts patients’ quality of life. However, the neuroimmune mechanisms underlying CIBP remain largely elusive. Substance P (SP), which is known to play a pivotal role in pain perception, became the focal point of our study. To this end, we adopted a comprehensive approach combining behavioral and physiological methods to investigate its role in neuroimmune interactions in CIBP. The results showed that SP released by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via exocytosis initiates CIBP, with its release peaking on the 14th day and correlating with pain behavior. Macrophages were found to infiltrate the DRGs and the sciatic nerves. Notably, in mice with CIBP, the population of macrophage type I was significantly augmented. Significantly, we found that the deletion of macrophages led to a notable alleviation of CIBP, while the blockade of the SP-neurokinin 1 receptor pathway effectively mitigated the infiltration of macrophages and alleviated CIBP. In the advanced phase, DRGs released C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 3 and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 to recruit macrophages. A two-phase model for CIBP progression in mice was proposed, with SP-induced macrophage infiltration in the primary phase and chemokine-mediated macrophage recruitment in the advanced phase. Our investigation has unearthed a previously unrecognized mechanism governing the neuroimmune interaction in CIBP, which highlights a critical target for impeding the progression of this debilitating pain, potentially opening up broad avenues for the development of effective therapeutic interventions at different stages of CIBP with cancer development.",

          "abstract": "Sialic acids (Sias) are a diverse family of nine-carbon backbone monosaccharides occupying terminal positions on cell surface and secreted glycans and are abundant at mucosal surfaces. Sias can be modified with O -acetyl esters on the side chain (C7 to C9) hydroxyls. Structural analysis and functional studies of these modifications are challenging due to chemical lability and variable resistance to sialidases. For in-depth analysis of the expression and functions of O -acetyl Sia modifications, we used a unique set of sialoglycan-recognizing probes, HPLC analysis of DMB-derivatized Sias and mice lacking the first known sialate O -acetyltransferase, CASD1. C7/C9- O -acetylated Sias are most abundant in the colon, with lower levels in the heart, brain, and spleen, and minimal levels in other digestive organs of wild-type mice. CASD1 deficiency led to a marked loss of C9/C7- O -acetylated Sias in the colon and other tissues. No differences were observed in colonic O -acetylated Sias from conventional and germ-free wild-type mice, indicating that Sia O -acetylation is independent of the commensal microbiota. Nonetheless, CASD1 deficiency caused subtle changes in microbial gene repertoire consistent with potential exploitation of Sias by subsets of intestinal microbes. Furthermore, CASD1-deficient mice exhibited more severe inflammation and ulceration upon colitis induction compared to controls. Reduced Sia O -acetylation was observed in mice during acute colitis and in colon biopsies from patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Together, our findings suggest CASD1 is the primary physiologically relevant enzyme to add C7/C8/C9- O -acetyl ester groups to Sias and that these Sia modifications exert important gut-protective functions, perhaps by preventing microbial Sia release and metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Neuromodulators control mood, arousal, and behavior by inducing synaptic plasticity via G-protein-coupled receptors. While long-term presynaptic potentiation requires structural changes, mechanisms enabling potentiation within minutes remain unclear. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, we show that octopamine, the invertebrate analog of norepinephrine, potentiates evoked neurotransmitter release on the timescale of one minute via a G-protein-coupled pathway involving presynaptic OAMB receptors and phospholipase C. This fast potentiation correlates with elevated signals of the release factor Unc13A and the scaffolding protein Bruchpilot. Live, single-molecule imaging of endogenously tagged Unc13 revealed its instantly reduced motility and increased concentration in synaptic nanoclusters with potentiation. Presynaptic knockdown of Unc13A fully blocked fast potentiation. Moreover, deleting its N-terminal localization sequence mislocalized the protein fragment to the cytosol, but still allowed for rapid plasma membrane recruitment by diacylglycerol (DAG) analog phorbol esters and octopamine, implicating a role of more C-terminal domains. A point mutation of endogenous Unc13 in its DAG-binding C1 domain blocked plasticity-induced nanoscopic enrichment and synaptic potentiation. The mutation increased basal neurotransmission but reduced Unc13 levels, revealing a gain of function and potential homeostatic compensation. The mutation also blocked phorbol ester–induced potentiation, decreased the calcium sensitivity of neurotransmission, and caused short-term synaptic depression. Homeostatic potentiation induced by postsynaptic receptor block mirrored octopamine-induced Unc13 recruitment and required presynaptic OAMB receptors, indicating overlapping machinery. Thus, rapid Unc13 immobilization and nanoscale compaction are salient features of fast presynaptic potentiation.",

          "abstract": "Functional connectivity (FC), a statistical correlation of pair-wise brain signals from resting-state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI), is a widely used concept for mapping large-scale functional networks in both humans and animals. However, its underlying causal mechanism remains poorly understood, particularly for strong interhemispheric connectivity (e.g., homotopic connections) consistently observed in FC. In this study, we investigated the neural basis of RS FC in mice using fMRI with anatomically defined patterned optogenetic activation and inhibition of excitatory neurons in six cortical regions. Unlike commonly used optogenetic activation, optogenetic silencing suppresses spontaneous neural activity in a localized region, reducing RS synaptic inputs to downstream networked areas. Consequently, fMRI can track spontaneous functional connections without the neural perturbations associated with excitation. While conventional optogenetic activation of excitatory neurons in the targeted cortical areas predominantly elicited their ipsilateral functional responses in both cortical and subcortical regions, optogenetic silencing induced both intra- and interhemispheric cortical responses, which were stronger than cortical-subcortical connections. These effects more closely resembled statistically defined RS FC patterns, providing insight into the underlying mechanisms of intrinsic FC. By modeling synaptic path length-dependent connectivity patterns based on structural connectivity (SC), we found that spontaneous functional connections can be explained by polysynaptic propagation, whereas evoked activity is largely restricted to monosynaptic pathways. These findings highlight the critical role of polysynaptic pathways in shaping spontaneous connectivity, suggesting that RS FC arises from causal interactions of spontaneous ongoing neural activity.",

Here, we identify TANK-binding kinase (TBK1) as a critical signaling molecule enriched and activated in TAMs of BCBM tumors, playing an indispensable role in BCBM development and metastatic outgrowth in the brain. Mechanistically, BCBM cell-secreted matrix metalloproteinase 1 binds to protease-activated receptor 1 and integrin αVβ5 on macrophages, leading to TBK1 activation mediated by the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway. Reciprocally, TBK1-regulated TAMs produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to drive breast cancer cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition, migration, and invasion, ultimately contributing to BCBM development and brain metastatic outgrowth. Inhibition of TBK1 signaling in TAMs or GM-CSF receptor in cancer cells impedes BCBM development and brain metastatic outgrowth. Correspondingly, the TBK1–GM-CSF signaling axis correlates with lower overall survival in patients with BCBM. Thus, TBK1-mediated tumor-TAM symbiotic interaction provides a promising therapeutic target for patients with BCBM.",

However, there have been few studies that investigate various types of cfDNA fragmentomics patterns in individuals with other diseases. We therefore developed a comprehensive statistic, called fragmentation signatures, that integrates the distributions of fragment positioning, fragment length, and fragment end-motifs in cfDNA. We found that individuals with venous thromboembolism, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, or scleroderma have cfDNA fragmentation signatures that closely resemble those found in individuals with advanced cancers. Furthermore, these signatures were highly correlated with increases in inflammatory markers in the blood. We demonstrate that these similarities in fragmentation signatures lead to high rates of false positives in individuals with autoimmune or vascular disease when evaluated using conventional binary classification approaches for multicancer earlier detection (MCED). To address this issue, we introduced a multiclass approach for MCED that integrates fragmentation signatures with protein biomarkers and achieves improved specificity in individuals with autoimmune or vascular disease while maintaining high sensitivity. Though these data put substantial limitations on the specificity of fragmentomics-based tests for cancer diagnostics, they also offer ways to improve the interpretability of such tests.

The supramarginal gyrus (SMG) is a structure within the inferior parietal lobule that specifically processes object-directed patterns of manipulation during functional object use. Here, we demonstrate that neural representations of complex object-directed actions in the SMG can be predicted by a linear encoding model that componentially builds complex actions from an empirically defined set of kinematic synergies. Each kinematic synergy represents a unique combination of finger, hand, wrist, and arm postures and movements. Control analyses demonstrate that models based on image-computable similarity (AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16) robustly predict variance in visual areas, but not in the SMG. We also show that SMG activity is specifically modulated by kinematic (as opposed to visual) properties of object-directed actions. The action-relevant, as opposed to visually relevant, nature of the representations supported by the SMG aligns with findings from neuropsychological studies of upper limb apraxia. These findings support a model in which kinematic synergies are the basic unit of representation, out of which the SMG componentially builds object-directed actions. In combination with other findings [Q. Chen et al., Cereb. Cortex 28 , 2162–2174 (2018)], we suggest that kinematic synergies are related to complex object-directed actions in a similar way to how articulatory and voicing features combine to form phonological segments in spoken language production.",

We investigated these mechanisms in the context of breast cancer where tumors are composed of diverse populations of cancer cells that differ in their ferroptosis sensitivity. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we determined that cancer cell populations with luminal differentiation are more resistant to ferroptosis than other cells within a heterogeneous tumor. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis and experimentation revealed that GATA3, a transcription factor that promotes luminal differentiation, has a causal role in ferroptosis resistance in luminal breast cancer cells. In pursuit of the mechanism involved, we found that GATA3 represses the expression of integrin β1 and its downstream signaling cascade. This observation led us to demonstrate that integrin β1 signaling is necessary for sensitivity to ferroptosis in basal breast cancer cells because it regulates a FAK/ROCK pathway that sustains the expression of ACSL4, a lipid-modifying enzyme that is essential for ferroptosis. The repression of integrin β1 by GATA3 inhibits this signaling pathway, rendering cells ferroptosis resistant. Together, these data provide insight into mechanisms of ferroptosis sensitivity and resistance that are linked to the cell biology and signaling pathways of the diverse types of cells present in breast tumors.",

It is initially synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), undergoes N-linked glycosylation, and is subsequently transported to the Golgi before ultimately reaching the plasma membrane. However, the mechanisms underlying the processing and maturation of TLR4 in the ER remain elusive. Through whole genome-wide CRISPR screening, CCDC134 was identified as a critical and essential factor for TLR4-dependent inflammatory response. Localization of CCDC134 in the ER lumen rather than its exosome-mediated secretion is required for its role in TLR4 signaling. Loss of CCDC134 results in the retention of TLR4 in the ER for subsequent ER-associated degradation, and thus blockade of TLR4 maturation and plasma membrane trafficking. Defects in TLR4 processing and maturation in the ER in CCDC134-depleted cells are caused by aberrant hyperglycosylation and destabilization of glycoprotein 96 (gp96), a key chaperone of TLR4. These results suggest that CCDC134 controls gp96 glycosylation to facilitate TLR4 maturation in the ER.",

Through microbiome analysis, we identified a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) encoding biosynthetic gene cluster that correlates with dental caries and is widely represented in oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans . This gene cluster produces two major mutanoclumpin metabolites, MC-584 and MC-586, which feature molecular scaffolds differing in a C–C macrocyclic linkage. Both metabolites synergistically promote robust biofilm formation of S. mutans through a rare dual-metabolite mode of action. Further, each metabolite binds uniquely to the S. mutans cell surface, resulting in distinct multicellular morphologies. The biosynthesis of mutanoclumpins employs a unique chemical logic that produces two major products, rare within PKS-NRPS assembly lines.

          "abstract": "Foundation models in biology—particularly protein language models (PLMs)—have enabled ground-breaking predictions in protein structure, function, and beyond. However, the “black-box” nature of these representations limits transparency and explainability, posing challenges for human–AI collaboration and leaving open questions about their human-interpretable features. Here, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a variant, transcoders, from natural language processing to extract, in a completely unsupervised fashion, interpretable sparse features present in both protein-level and amino acid (AA)-level representations from ESM2, a popular PLM. Unlike other approaches such as training probes for features, the extraction of features by the SAE is performed without any supervision. We find that many sparse features extracted from SAEs trained on protein-level representations are tightly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms across all levels of the GO hierarchy. We also use Anthropic’s Claude to automate the interpretation of sparse features for both protein-level and AA-level representations and find that many of these features correspond to specific protein families and functions such as the NAD Kinase, IUNH, and the PTH family, as well as proteins involved in methyltransferase activity and in olfactory and gustatory sensory perception. We show that sparse features are more interpretable than ESM2 neurons across all our trained SAEs and transcoders. These findings demonstrate that SAEs offer a promising unsupervised approach for disentangling biologically relevant information present in PLM representations, thus aiding interpretability. This work opens the door to safety, trust, and explainability of PLMs and their applications, and paves the way to extracting meaningful biological insights across increasingly powerful models in the life sciences.",

          "abstract": "AI is now a cornerstone of modern dataset analysis. In many real world applications, practitioners are concerned with controlling specific kinds of errors, rather than minimizing the overall number of errors. For example, biomedical screening assays may primarily be concerned with mitigating the number of false positives rather than false negatives. Quantifying uncertainty in AI-based predictions, and in particular those controlling specific kinds of errors, remains theoretically and practically challenging. We develop a strategy called multidimensional informed generalized hypothesis testing (MIGHT) which we prove accurately quantifies uncertainty and confidence given sufficient data, and concomitantly controls for particular error types. Our key insight was that it is possible to integrate canonical cross-validation and parametric calibration procedures within a nonparametric ensemble method. Simulations demonstrate that while typical AI based-approaches cannot be trusted to obtain the truth, MIGHT can be. We apply MIGHT to answer an open question in liquid biopsies using circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in individuals with or without cancer: Which biomarkers, or combinations thereof, can we trust? Performance estimates produced by MIGHT on ccfDNA data have coefficients of variation that are often orders of magnitude lower than other state of the art algorithms such as support vector machines, random forests, and Transformers, while often also achieving higher sensitivity. We find that combinations of variable sets often decrease rather than increase sensitivity over the optimal single variable set because some variable sets add more noise than signal. This work demonstrates the importance of quantifying uncertainty and confidence—with theoretical guarantees—for the interpretation of real-world data.",

Uncertainty in the future climate arises from three sources—differences in emissions scenarios, structural uncertainty across climate models, and internal climate variability (ICV)—but ICV is rarely considered in climate-VBD studies. Here, we demonstrate that ICV is a key source of uncertainty in climate suitability for VBD transmission, even decades into the future. Because of ICV, suitable climate conditions for transmission may arise in many locations sooner than expected under climate change alone.",

However, emerging evidence suggests that these number–space connections may reflect our evolutionary history and emerge even in the absence of cultural tools. We examined how task-naïve monkeys learn spatial and numerical concepts over time. Monkeys’ learning trajectories revealed successful learning of both numerical and geometric concepts. Discriminability effects showed that abstract quantitative features were stronger predictors of accuracy on both tasks than low-level visual similarity, reflecting abstract processing of both tasks. Cross-lagged analyses revealed that learning in the geometry task significantly predicted future gains in numerosity performance, even after controlling session-level trends, within-task stability, and general performance factors. Together, these findings provide evidence that spatial and numerical learning in primates rely on mutual cognitive processes. Such representations could form the evolutionary foundation for the well-documented “cognitive bridge” between numerical and spatial reasoning in human development.",

          "abstract": "Both DNA methylation and homologous recombination (HR) are extensively studied. In bacteria, Dam methylation is the most studied DNA modification, while RecA-mediated HR is a primary mechanism to repair DNA damages including double-stranded breaks, single-stranded gaps, and stalled replication forks. While HR regulation by proteins is extensively studied, whether methylation of DNA itself directly affects the functions of RecA and HR remains unclear. Mainly by single-molecule experiments, we report that Dam methylation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) promotes RecA assembly, partially by reducing the effective charge of ssDNA under counterion screening. Furthermore, Dam methylation of double-stranded DNA promotes homologous pairing, joint molecule growth, and strand exchange. In cellular experiments, dam deletion impairs HR, whereas hypermethylation of the adenines in the genome enhances HR in P1 transduction assays and DNA-damage sensitivity tests without significantly upregulated HR-related genes. In addition, the preference of RecA for Dam-methylated DNA in RecA assembly and homologous pairing is conserved across divergent species covering a gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae , a gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and a flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Dam methylation of ssDNA increases the ATPase activity of molecular motors such as RecQ helicase that containing RecA-like domains. These findings reveal effects of DNA methylation and mechanisms regulating RecA-mediated HR and molecular motors.",

          "abstract": "An understanding of the CO 2 + H 2 O hydration reaction is crucial for modeling the effects of ocean acidification, for enabling novel carbon storage solutions, and as a model process in the geosciences. While the mechanism of this reaction has been investigated extensively in the condensed phase, its mechanism at the air–water interface remains elusive, leaving uncertain the contribution that surface-adsorbed CO 2 makes to the overall acidification reaction. In this study, we employ machine-learned potentials trained to various levels of theory to provide a molecular-level understanding of CO 2 hydration at the air–water interface. We show that reaction at the interface follows a surface-mediated “in-and-out” mechanism: CO 2 diffuses into the aqueous surface layer, reacts to form carbonic acid, and is subsequently expelled from solution. We show that this surface layer provides a bulk-like solvation environment, engendering similar modes of reactivity and near-identical free energy profiles for the bulk and interfacial processes. Our study unveils an unconventional reaction mechanism that underscores the dynamic nature of the molecular reaction site at the air–water interface. The similarity between bulk and interfacial profiles shows that CO 2 hydration is equally as feasible under these two solvation environments and that acidification rates are likely enhanced by this additional surface contribution.",

          "abstract": "It is well established that stress generally suppresses immunity. However, under certain conditions, acute stress has been shown to stimulate the immune system, particularly those at barrier surfaces like the skin. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. In the present study, we have identified an immune-enhancing effect of stress using zebrafish larvae. The use of this animal model allowed us to visualize the redistribution of macrophages to the skin upon exposure to an acute stressor, which appeared to be dependent on the increased levels of cortisol. Through real-time imaging of fluorescently labeled leukocytes, we observed that this cortisol-driven redistribution was mediated by both the mineralocorticoid and the glucocorticoid receptor, which upregulated the chemokine receptor Cxcr4. Strikingly, this stress-induced macrophage migration required the presence of melanocytes in the skin, which increased the expression of the gene encoding Cxcl12, the ligand for Cxcr4. This result indicates a pivotal role for pigment cells in immune regulation under stress. Functional assays further revealed that the redistributed macrophages actively increased antigen uptake from the external environment, suggesting an elevated state of immune readiness. Together, we demonstrate that acute stress triggers a coordinated, cortisol-mediated response that enhances immune surveillance at the skin barrier. This stress-induced enhancement of barrier immunity potentially prepares the organism for increased pathogen exposure under challenging conditions.",

X-ray crystal structures of a functionally promiscuous flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)–bound oxidase, MaDS1, with and without an oxidative dehydrogenation product were determined at 2.03 Å and 2.21 Å resolution, respectively. Structure-guided mutagenesis and sequence analysis have identified a conserved aspartic acid that directs the reaction toward the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. A combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has revealed that aspartic acid acts as the catalytic base to deprotonate the carbon-cation intermediate to generate the dehydrogenated product, which otherwise undergoes a spontaneous 6π electrocyclization in the oxidative cyclization pathway to furnish the 2H-benzopyran product.",

Defects in processing G4 structures are associated with replication stress, a common property of both B cell cancers and hyperproliferative premalignant cells. Genome instability arising from replication stress is a hallmark of cancer and strongly contributes to the chromosome rearrangements in B cell cancers. Here, we define the impact of G4-stabilizing ligands on generating genome instability in primary and malignant B cells. Treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin (PDS) causes breaks and chromosome rearrangements at ribosomal DNA and pericentromeric major satellite regions in both mouse primary B cell culture and CH12 lymphoma cells. PDS also causes extensive pericentromeric DNA damage in immortalized human B cell lines. Remarkably, PDS causes high level of tetraploid metaphase cells correlated with high level of dicentric chromosomes specifically in primary but not in CH12 B cells. Unlike primary B cells, CH12 cells undergo checkpoint activation and strong G2/M arrest in response to PDS treatment thus preventing tetraploid appearance. Altogether, these results highlight the difference between primary and malignant B cells in response to PDS, revealing the therapeutic potential of G4-stabilizing drugs to selectively suppress tumor cell growth and proliferation.",

In this paper, we employ a computationally driven matching technique to examine quantitative trends in the use of various forms of diversity and population terminology in a sample of nearly two million biomedical abstracts spanning a 30-y period. The curated dictionaries we leverage to detect these trends were formalized into open-source software that are publicly available for other researchers to use. Our analyses demonstrate marked growth in diversity, sex, gender, life course, and socioeconomic terms while terms relating to race and ethnicity largely plateaued or declined in usage, beginning in the mid-2000s. In addition, the use of national, continental, and subcontinental population labels increased dramatically over the same period. We also present logistic regression analyses to investigate what may be fueling the rise in use of diversity terminology. We argue that the use of diversity has grown to encompass concepts beyond its historical origins in race-based programs as it has in fields like higher education and employment. Despite some critics’ claims regarding the role of diversity in research, we do not find evidence that its use signals retreat from or commitment to equity and inclusion efforts.",

Here, we report that the Drosophila melanogaster female’s pair of spermathecae, which appear similar and have the common role of sperm storage, derive from different developmental compartments defined by expression of lineage-tracing markers corresponding, respectively, to the key patterning genes engrailed and wingless . We further find that the two spermathecae show significant differences in size, secretory activity, and calcium levels and, perhaps as a consequence, sperm retention dynamics.

          "abstract": "The FliPQR complex constitutes a channel for export of the flagellar proteins involved in axial structure assembly. It also serves as a template for the assembly of the rod structure, which consists of FliE, FlgB, FlgC, FlgF, and FlgG. FliP, FliQ, and FliR assemble into a right-handed helical structure within the central pore of the flagellar basal body MS-ring, and the complex has two gates on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides. The periplasmic gate, formed by the N-terminal α-helices of FliP and FliR, remains closed until six FliE subunits assemble onto FliP and FliR to form the first layer of the rod, but it has remained unclear how each FliE subunit opens the gate and assembles in the absence of the rod cap required for efficient assembly of other rod proteins. Here, we present a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the FliPQR complex in closed form at 3.0 Å resolution. A β-cap, formed by the N-terminal β-strands of FliP and FliR, is located at the top of the FliPQR complex and tightly seals the closed gate. The β-cap has a narrow pore that efficiently and accurately leads the first FliE subunit to its assembly site. Interactions of FliE with FliP and FliR induce a conformational change in FliP and FliR, with their N-terminal α-helices move up and outward to open the gate. Consequently, each of the N-terminal β-strands of FliP and FliR detaches from the β-cap one after another, thereby creating a docking site for the next FliE subunit to efficiently assemble.",

          "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) persistently threaten wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, and public health. The East Asian–Australasian Flyway plays a crucial role in HPAIV dynamics due to its large populations of migratory waterfowl and poultry. Over recent decades, this flyway has undergone substantial landscape changes, including both losses and gains of waterfowl habitats. These changes can affect waterfowl distributions, increase contact with poultry, and consequently alter ecological conditions that favor avian influenza virus (AIV) evolution. However, limited research has assessed these likely impacts. Here, we integrated empirical data and an individual-based model to simulate AIV transmission in migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry, including wild-to-poultry spillover and reassortment dynamics in poultry, across landscapes representing the years 2000 and 2015. We used the reassortment incidence as a proxy for ecological and transmission conditions that support viral diversification and the emergence of novel subtypes. Our simulations show that landscape change reshaped the waterfowl distribution, facilitated bird aggregation at improved habitats, increased coinfection, and raised reassortment rate by 1,593%, indicating a substantially higher potential for viral diversification and emergence. Model-generated risk maps show expanded and increased reassortment risk in southeastern China, the Yellow River Basin, and northeastern China. These findings suggest the importance of landscape change as a driver of potential AIV diversification and subtype emergence. This underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate landscape dynamics, host movement, and viral evolution to better assess and mitigate future risk.",

This trajectory of vocal development in humans is radically different from those of our close phylogenetic relatives, cercopithecoid monkeys and apes. In these primates, social feedback seems to play no significant role in their vocal development. Oddly,marmoset monkeys, a more distantly related primate species, do exhibit socially guided vocal learning. How can this be? We hypothesized that the evolution of human and marmoset vocal learning in early infancy is facilitated by their neurally altricial births (relative to other primates) and their cooperative breeding social environment. Our analysis found that, indeed, both human and marmoset brains are growing faster at birth when compared with chimpanzees and rhesus macaques, making humans and marmoset monkeys altricial relative to these other primates. The time interval of this faster brain growth overlaps with important vocal learning milestones. We formalized our hypothesis using a simple model showing that if vocal learning is influenced by the timing of brain growth and social stimuli, it benefits from an altricial brain and a cooperative breeding environment. Our data support the idea that the evolution of socially guided vocal learning during early infancy in humans and marmosets was afforded by infants with an altricial brain embedded in a vocally rich environment.",

A major conservation priority is to identify the mechanisms and extent of inbreeding depression in small populations. The eastern massasauga ( Sistrurus catenatus ) rattlesnake is listed as Federally Threatened in the United States, having experienced significant habitat fragmentation and concomitant population declines over the past 200 years. Here, we use long-term monitoring of two wild populations of eastern massasaugas in Michigan to estimate the extent of inbreeding in each population, identify mechanisms that generate inbreeding, and test for the impact of inbreeding on fitness. Using targeted genomic data and spatial coordinates of capture locations from over 1000 individuals, we find evidence of inbreeding and link inbreeding to spatial kinship structure within populations, possibly driven by limited dispersal. We reconstruct multigenerational pedigrees for each population to measure reproductive output and use long-term capture–recapture data to estimate individual survival (i.e., the two major components of fitness). We find evidence of inbreeding depression in both fitness metrics. The 5% most inbred individuals are 13.5% less likely to have any surviving offspring and have 11.6% lower annual survival compared to all less inbred individuals. By combining genomics and long-term monitoring data, we are able to link the life history of eastern massasaugas to inbreeding and detect relationships between fitness and inbreeding. These insights provide important conservation context for future management and for understanding how spatial structure can generate inbreeding depression even at fine spatial scales.",

We address this issue by introducing PARSE (Protein Annotation by Residue-Specific Enrichment), a knowledge-based method which combines pretrained embeddings of local structural environments with traditional statistical techniques to simultaneously predict function and provide residue-level annotations. For the task of predicting the catalytic function of enzymes, PARSE achieves comparable or superior global performance to state-of-the-art machine learning methods (F1 score &gt; 85%) while simultaneously annotating the specific residues involved in each function with much greater precision. Since it does not require supervised training, our method can make one-shot predictions for very rare functions and is not limited to a particular type of functional label (e.g. Enzyme Commission numbers or Gene Ontology codes). Finally, we leverage the AlphaFold Structure Database to perform functional annotation at a proteome scale. By applying PARSE to the dark proteome—predicted structures which cannot be classified into known structural families—we predict several bacterial metalloproteases. Each of these proteins shares a strongly conserved catalytic site despite highly divergent sequences and global folds, illustrating the value of local structure representations for new function discovery.",

          "abstract": "Expanding gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) populations in Europe and North America contribute to increased risks of livestock predation, which can threaten human livelihoods and lead government agencies to target wolves for lethal removal. Public wolf hunting is a highly contentious strategy for mitigating these risks, yet few empirical studies examine its effectiveness in doing so. Using difference-in-differences and structural equation modeling of data from the northwestern US between 2005 and 2021, we analyzed impacts of wolf hunting on livestock predation by wolves and government removal of wolves in the same year and with a 1-year time lag while controlling for social and environmental variables. We found that public wolf hunting had a small negative effect on livestock predation but had no effect on government lethal removal of wolves in the same or subsequent years. Our findings challenge the assumption that wolf hunting is an effective management strategy for reducing livestock predation and lethal removal.",

We analyzed Inka khipu, KH0631, whose primary cord is composed of human hair. Historically, human hair on a khipu served as a “signature” to indicate the khipu’s creator. Recent advances in elemental analysis–isotope ratio mass spectrometry allowed us to undertake simultaneous carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur measurements from a single KH0631 hair sample, revealing that this individual consumed a diet characteristic of low-ranking commoners. This finding suggests that commoners participated in Inka khipu production.",

Nevertheless, implementing DNA circuits for such functions generally relies on the use of dual-rail expression that doubles the number of required gates, constraining the achievable complexity in a single solution. A fundamental limitation is that conventional single-rail circuits cannot support nonfirst-layer NOT operations. Here, we introduce the design of a DNA synchronizer (DSN), a temporal regulation module that enables time-dependent NOT function, to circumvent the fundamental limitation of conventional single-rail designs. Tuning the binding affinity between the DSN strand and an inverter strand allows for regulating the execution time of NOT gates at varying cascade depths. Single-rail NAND and NOR gates are implemented using DSNs, which are Boolean complete. We further demonstrate a 4-bit square root circuit using a minimal set of only five gates. This single-rail architecture holds promise for developing compact yet scalable DNA computing circuits while advancing applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Eukaryotes have evolved defense systems to protect their genomes from invasive genetic elements. We report a fungal defense mechanism, tandem repeat–induced sexual silencing (TRISS), active during sexual stages. TRISS is a unique RNA interference (RNAi) pathway distinct from known mechanisms like quelling and meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). Triggered by tandem repeats, it involves RNAi components similar to quelling but uniquely includes the MSUD-specific Argonaute Sms2. TRISS operates independently of recombination. We identified small interfering RNA sassociated with TRISS (trasiRNAs) in tandem repeats. Sms2, guided by trasiRNAs, mediates translational repression of target mRNAs and is crucial for trasiRNA biogenesis. TRISS requires the DNA methyltransferase Rid but not Rid-mediated repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Both Sms2 and Rid interact with replication protein A (RPA) to recruit the RPA-Qde1/RdRP complex, dependent on the helicase Qde3. This study reveals a potentially conserved strategy linking RIP and RNAi to silence tandem repeats during fungal sexual stages, offering insights into fungal genome defense.",

Central uplift is uniquely observed in craters on amorphous polymers, with the degree of complexity directly linked to the polymer thermal properties and homogeneity. We demonstrate that the complex crater volume scales with the ratio of the specific kinetic energy of the impacting object to the specific energy required to raise the impacted substrate to its glass transition temperature (the Eckert number). Our results also confirm that complex crater formation can occur not only for macroscopic celestial collisions but also during sufficiently high velocity collisions at the micrometer scale.",

However, the mechanisms that safeguard genome integrity during this process remain poorly understood. Using early limb development as a model, we identify that DNA damage response factors are up-regulated in proliferating mesenchymal stem cells. Conditional knockout of Rpa1 , a representative DNA damage response factor, in early limb bud mesenchyme results in the near-total absence of forelimbs and severely underdeveloped hindlimbs. Mechanistically, Rpa1 deletion leads to extensive DNA damage and activates the cGAS-STING pathway, driving transcription of Zbp1 . Rpa1 deletion also leads to accumulation of Z-DNA bound by ZBP1, triggering the full activation of ZBP1 and subsequent mesenchymal stem cell death through PANoptosis. Our study reveals RPA1 as a vital protector of genomic stability during limb development and underscores ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis as a key pathway for eliminating cells with excessive DNA damage during embryonic development.",

Despite decades of investigation, there is still no consensus on what causes Pol I transcription termination. Here, we show that efficient termination by Pol I, paused by termination roadblock protein, is caused by RNA hairpin of the nascent pre-rRNA. Hairpin-dependent termination takes place at a physiological rate and does not require trans-acting factors. The function of the roadblock protein and the T-rich sequence is to synergistically cause deep backtracking of Pol I toward the termination RNA hairpin. Simultaneously, Pol I is catalytically inactivated, preventing rescue from backtracking through RNA cleavage and thus committing Pol I to termination. Termination RNA hairpins are present in most of Pol I terminators of eukaryotes, suggesting conservation of the RNA hairpin–dependent mechanism of Pol I transcription termination. We propose a simple model that unifies previous findings.",

We identify a direct interaction between RSMV P and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylation factor 1 (OsARF1C), a crucial regulator of the coatomer protein I (COP I) vesicle transport pathway that is vital for viral replication. This interaction indirectly recruits OsARF1C’s partner, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta (OsPI4KB), which drives localized phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate (PI4P) synthesis. Concurrently, the P protein modulates its aggregates and LLPS droplets through PI4P, thereby expanding the replication site and enhancing viral replication.",

In addition, the abundant sodiophilic active sites boost reaction kinetics, decrease Na nucleation barrier, and subsequently manipulate homogeneous Na nucleation. Consequently, the porous Al host exhibits high reversibility of dendrite-free Na plating/stripping behavior. A proof-of-concept 4.3 V-class pouch cell achieves an energy density of up to 420.4 watt-hours per kilogram and stable cycling performance with 84.9% capacity retention over 100 cycles under anode-free conditions, providing a pathway for the design of anode-free Na batteries for practical applications.",

We present a coupled chemical and thermal evolution model tracking Ceres’s interior aqueous environment through time. If the rocky interior reached ≳550 K, then fluids released by rock metamorphism would have promoted conditions favorable for habitability by introducing redox disequilibrium into the ocean, a source of chemical energy for chemotrophs. We find that this period would have been between ~0.5 and 2 billion years after Ceres’s formation.

We used spatially explicit simulations of paleogenomic diversity and high-quality paleogenomic data from 67 prehistoric individuals to assess how population dynamics between Indigenous European hunter-gatherers and incoming farmers varied across space and time. Our results demonstrate that admixture between the two groups increased locally over time at each stage of the Neolithic expansion along the continental route. We estimate that the effective population size of farmers was about five times that of hunter-gatherers.

We show that these two patterns—uniform variation and east-west contrast—are present in instrumental observations and in simulations with constant or time-varying external forcing. Uniform variation is amplified by 20th century external forcing, while a global warming–induced strengthening of the monsoon seeds the east-west contrast. This contrast is deepened by a mid-21st century transition to a North Atlantic cooling relative to the global tropical oceans, which affects the western Sahel most strongly because it is immediately adjacent to the North Atlantic, leading to a divergence in outcomes—between a progressively wetter central and eastern Sahel and an abruptly drier western Sahel—that is unparalleled in instrumental observations.",

We show that the adoption of CW and BB funerary rites is not synchronized with, and often contradicts, the spread of steppe ancestry. Furthermore, we show that these burial traditions spread rapidly and polyfocally among dispersed communities before a brief yet continent-wide consolidation phase around 2600 BCE for CW and 2400 BCE for BB, suggesting broad, simultaneous societal changes among preliterate societies.",

          "abstract": "Skeletons showing multiple instances of unhealed trauma and isolated skeletal segments of severed left upper limbs have been documented in the Neolithic sites of Achenheim and Bergheim (northeastern France, approximately 4300 to 4150 cal BCE), providing tantalizing evidence of war-related practices of overkill, mutilation, and/or trophy taking. Here, we conduct an innovative multi-isotope reconstruction of the biographies of the “victims” and other individuals from the region that were given normative funerary treatments (nonvictims). A total of 82 humans are analyzed, together with 53 animals and 35 modern plants to establish regional isotope baselines. Results show statistically significant isotopic differences between victims and nonvictims and suggest that the former were members of invading groups brutally killed, perhaps exposed and deposited in pits—together with trophies in the form of severed upper limbs—by local groups in what might be one of the earliest well-documented instances of martial victory celebrations in prehistoric Europe.",

It is generally believed that disks are ubiquitous around protostars as a result of angular momentum conservation and are natural places to grow planets. As such, they are proposed to be the last link in the inflow chain from the molecular cloud to the star. However, disks are not the only form that inflows can take. Here, we report on high-resolution observations performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array that reveal inflows in the form of streamers. These streamers persist well within the expected disk radius, indicating that they play a substitute role channeling material from the envelope directly to an unresolved small disk or even directly to the forming high-mass protostar. These flows are massive enough to feed the central unresolved region at a rate suf ficient to quench the feedback effects of the young massive star.",

The self-assembly of multiple-sized reflective ettringites as main hydration products toward the metasurface, coupled with hierarchical pores, guaranteed high solar reflectance (96.2%), whereas raw materials containing alumina- and sulfur-rich function groups leveraged inherent mid-infrared emissivity (96.0%). This photonic-architectured cement achieved a temperature drop of 5.4°C during midday conditions with a solar intensity of 850 watts per square meter. This supercool cement featured intrinsic high strength, armored abrasive resistance, and optical stability, even when exposed to harsh conditions, such as corrosive liquids, ultraviolet radiation, and freeze-thaw cycles.

However, the growth of lithium dendrites is inevitable, driven by the intrinsic properties of SSEs. Hence, guiding the growth of lithium dendrites in a controllable way is more feasible instead of completely preventing their growth. Here, we present a strategically designed structural layer composed of graded lithium nitride particles, which guides the growth of lithium dendrites within confined spaces. Meanwhile, this layer is paired with a less lithium-stable electrolyte and enables the guided lithium dendrites to self-limit within localized regions at the interface. The comprehensive analysis further reveals that the designed bilayer SSE effectively harnesses the interface-generated pressure during battery cycling, achieving dynamic control of lithium dendrite growth. This interfacial structure design of SSE holds broad applicability for regulating lithium dendrites in all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.",

Here, we describe a mechanism by which tubulin tyrosine ligase–like 11 (TTLL11) expands and diversifies the code. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed a unique bipartite MT recognition strategy wherein TTLL11 binding and catalytic domains engage adjacent MT protofilaments. Biochemical and cellular assays identified previously uncharacterized polyglutamylation patterns, showing that TTLL11 directly extends the primary polypeptide chains of α- and β-tubulin in vitro, challenging the prevailing paradigms emphasizing lateral branching. Moreover, cell-based and in vivo data suggest a cross-talk between polyglutamylation and the detyrosination/tyrosination cycle likely linked to the TTLL11-mediated elongation of the primary α-tubulin chain. These findings unveil an unrecognized layer of complexity within the tubulin code and offer mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of functional specialization of MT cytoskeleton.",

However, the malignant phenotype is simple, characterized by unrestricted cell growth, invasion, and often metastasis. One possible hypothesis explaining this dichotomy is that cancer genes regulate common targets, which then function as master regulators of essential cancer phenotypes. To identify mechanisms that drive the most fundamental feature shared by all tumors—unrestricted cell proliferation—we used a multiomic approach, which identified translation and ribosome biogenesis as common targets of major oncogenic pathways across cancer types. Proteomic analysis of tumors and functional studies of cell cultures established nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 as a key node, whose convergent regulation, both transcriptionally and posttranslationally, is critical for tumor cell proliferation. Our results indicate that lineage-specific oncogenic pathways regulate the same set of targets for growth control, revealing key downstream nodes that could be targeted for therapy or chemoprevention.",

However, the mechanisms linking this pathway with membrane dynamics and signaling remain elusive. Here, we used cryo–focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional tomography to identified GDSVs as a distinct vesicle population at the pollen tube tip. We further demonstrated that tobacco LORELEI-like glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein 4 (NtLLG4), a key signaling molecule controlling membrane dynamics and integrity, functions as a receptor for NtPPME1, regulating its polar exocytosis via GDSVs to control cell wall stiffness.

To address this, we developed a multistage air-gap membrane distillation (MAMD) system that efficiently recovered DMF from waste solutions using industrial waste heat. Our MAMD system achieved a DMF enrichment factor up to 314 (increasing the concentration from 0.3 to 94.2 weight %) and stable operation over 60 hours.

Large, inland cities can receive 10% more summer afternoon rainfall, and the pattern varies with urban heat islands and wind conditions. Coastal cities, under the influence of sea-land breeze, experience three times amplified daily urban precipitation enhancements than inland cities.

Through genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches, we demonstrated that PFT-α mimics ethylene by deactivating the ethylene receptor 1 (ETR1). Accumulated ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) influences the expression of phytochrome-interacting factors ( PIF4 and PIF7 ) and subsequently inhibits shade-induced hypocotyl elongation.

Convergent, multiomic analyses revealed that CDKN2A -deleted MPNSTs are especially dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and NADPH metabolism for growth and viability. Disruption of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the PPP rate-limiting enzyme, slowed CDKN2A -deleted MPNST growth and sensitized MPNSTs to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Knockdown of the redox-regulated transcription factor NRF2 slowed MPNST growth and decreased G6PD transcription. Analysis of patient MPNSTs identified a NRF2 gene signature correlating with tumor transformation. Furthermore, G6PD and NRF2 expression in PanCancer TCGA samples correlates with patient survival. This work identifies NRF2-PPP dependency as a targetable vulnerability in these difficult-to-treat MPNSTs, particularly in the NF1/CDKN2A -deleted majority.",

Despite an understanding of contributions of oceanic moisture to terrestrial hydroclimatic extremes, whether surpluses of terrestrial water availability migrate directly and contiguously from the ocean and the influence of climate change on this process remain unclear. Here, we use a coherent feature-tracking method to identify ocean-to-land water availability surpluses (OWASs), characterized by spatiotemporally contiguous migration of excess atmospheric freshwater (precipitation-minus-evapotranspiration) from ocean to land. Over the past several decades, especially in northern mid-high latitudes (NMHL; above 48°N), OWASs have exhibited longer persistence, wider areal extent, and greater intensity than those developed solely over land. These landward migrations are associated with seasonal Atlantic teleconnection and Pacific circulation shift. Under the business-as-usual scenario, these two processes are projected to be enhanced, markedly increasing OWAS characteristics in NMHL driven by thermodynamic atmospheric responses to future warming. Intensified OWASs may not only help alleviate long-term droughts but also have the potential to accentuate pluvial risks.",

Complementarily, a soft gripper with a linear pressure-to-force response was engineered to enable stable and predictable force modulation. The flexible slip sensors were conformally integrated onto the grippers, forming a fully perceptive soft robotic system capable of detecting early-stage slippage and investigating interfacial frictional properties. This integration establishes a closed-loop sensorimotor framework that notably improves the reliability and adaptability of soft robotic grasping across a wide range of real-world applications.",

However, ranges of species in these regions are also distinctly more patchy and elongated than those found in adjacent lowlands. Our global analysis of mainland birds demonstrates that these range shapes augment the spatial variation in species richness. Both the linearity and patchiness of species ranges are most pronounced in aseasonal and topographically complex regions, most notably in the tropical Andes, where these range shapes contribute more to the pattern of species richness than broad-scale variations in range size. Consequently, niche-based processes that govern the spatial configuration of habitats contribute to patterns of species richness in global hotspots over and above the processes that affect species richness through range sizes.",

Here, we establish a framework for the topological classification of driven-dissipative nonlinear systems by defining a graph index for their Floquet semiclassical equations of motion. Our index builds upon the topology of vector flows and encodes the particle-hole nature of excitations around all out-of-equilibrium stationary states. Thus, we uncover the topology of nonlinear resonator’s dynamics under external and parametric forcing. Our framework sheds light on the topology of driven-dissipative phases, including under- to overdamped responses and symmetry-broken phases linked to population inversion. We therefore expose the pervasive link between topology and nonlinear dynamics, with broad implications for interacting topological insulators, topological solitons, neuromorphic networks, and bosonic codes.",

Structural modeling, molecular dynamics, and site-directed mutagenesis identify mutations enabling the catalytic switch from FLS to DAH.

Using custom-made, low-cost rain collectors, we sampled rainwash eDNA in a mature Amazonian forest and a nearby tree plantation. We successfully detected eDNA from tropical woody and epiphyte plants, vertebrates (mammals, birds, and amphibians), and insects (e.g., mosquitoes, ants, and beetles). The taxonomic composition and diversity reflected disturbance, with significantly lower diversity in the plantation. Crucially, rainwash eDNA integrated biodiversity over a 10-day period in passive collectors and provided a local signature.

          "abstract": "Accurate modeling of ocean dynamics is crucial for enhancing our understanding of complex ocean circulation processes, predicting climate variability, and tackling challenges posed by climate change. Although great efforts have been made to improve traditional numerical models, predicting global ocean variability over multiyear scales remains challenging. Here, we propose ORCA-DL (Oceanic Reliable foreCAst via Deep Learning), a data-driven three-dimensional ocean model for seasonal to decadal prediction of global ocean dynamics. ORCA-DL accurately simulates the three-dimensional structure of global ocean dynamics with high physical consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art numerical models in capturing extreme events, including El Niño–Southern Oscillation and upper ocean heat waves. Moreover, ORCA-DL stably emulates ocean dynamics at decadal timescales, demonstrating its potential even for skillful decadal predictions and climate projections. Our results demonstrate the high potential of data-driven models for providing efficient and accurate global ocean modeling and prediction.",

          "authors": "Miaoxing Wang, Xujun Han, Yunfei Lee, Rie Takayama, Makoto Sato",
          "abstract": "Columns are the morphological and functional units containing multiple neurons in the brain. The molecular mechanisms of column formation are largely unknown. Ephrin/Eph signaling mediates a variety of developmental processes. Ephrin acts as a ligand for Eph to regulate forward signaling, whereas Eph acts as a ligand for Ephrin to regulate reverse signaling. However, whether and how the uni- or bidirectional Ephrin/Eph signaling is involved in column formation remains elusive. In this study, we show that Ephrin and Eph regulate the morphology and location of columnar neurons through bidirectional repulsive signaling. Furthermore, Eph ligand triggers cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphorylation of Ephrin under the control of Src kinases and Fasciclin 2 (Fas2), forming the Ephrin/Src/Fas2 complex to promote reverse signaling through a downstream regulator, Rac1. This study provides the detailed analysis of the molecular interactions involved in column formation using the fly brain as a model.",

          "abstract": "Cellular signaling relies on the activity of transmembrane receptors and their presentation on the cellular surface. Their continuous insertion in the plasma membrane is balanced by constitutive and activity-dependent internalization, which is orchestrated by adaptor proteins recognizing semispecific motifs within the receptors’ intracellular regions. Here, we describe a complementary trafficking mechanism for G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that is evolutionary conserved and refined. This mechanism relies on the insertion of their amphipathic helix 8 into the inner leaflet of lipid membranes, orthogonal to the transmembrane helices. These amphipathic helices dictate subcellular localization of the receptors and autonomously drive their endocytosis by cooperative assembly and association with areas of high membrane curvature. The strength of helix 8 membrane insertion propensity quantitatively predicts the rate of constitutive internalization of GPCRs. This discovery advances our understanding of membrane protein trafficking and highlights a principle of receptor-lipid interactions that may have broad implications for cellular signaling and therapeutic targeting.",

Yet, its mechanism of action remains poorly understood. In a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model, we previously showed that DMT reduces infarct volume. Here, we demonstrate that this effect is accompanied by reduction of cerebral edema, attenuated astrocyte dysfunction, and a shift in serum protein composition toward an anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective state. DMT restored tight junction integrity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in vitro and in vivo. DMT suppressed the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells and reduced microglial activation via the sigma-1 receptor. Our findings prove that DMT mitigates a poststroke effect by stabilizing the BBB and reducing neuroinflammation. Such interactions of DMT with the vascular and immune systems can be leveraged to complement current, insufficient, stroke therapy.",

The mechanisms by which these distributed synaptic alterations produce the heterogenous symptoms of psychosis remain poorly understood. Using magnetoencephalographical source imaging, we mapped psychosis-related alterations of various features of intrinsic neural population dynamics across the human cortex. The cortex-wide patterns of these features were highly reproducible and related to the anatomical hierarchy of cortical areas. We found similar changes in these patterns for individuals with a first episode of psychosis and those at clinical high risk for psychosis. Maps of psychosis-induced changes in dynamics resembled the maps of GABA-A receptor densities and of pharmacological GABA-A or NMDA manipulation effects on cortical dynamics in healthy participants. The level of pattern similarity to GABA-A manipulation effects in individual patients correlated with positive symptoms, while the pattern similarity to NMDA effects correlated with negative symptoms. Our results open up a window on the distributed mechanisms of psychotic symptoms.",

To address these critical issues, we present a theranostic platform that seamlessly integrates armored core–gold nanostar (AC-GNS)–mediated PTT with full-view photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), enabling nanoparticle tracking and real-time imaging-guided PTT in deep tissues. The AC-GNS platform delivered exceptional photostability and thermal resilience beyond those of conventional nanoparticles while serving as a high-performance contrast agent for PACT and a photothermal transducer for PTT. Integrating AC-GNS–mediated PTT with noninvasive PACT enabled whole-body nanoparticle tracking, PTT treatment monitoring via thermal imaging, and thermal dose determination, culminating in a 100% survival rate in a murine bladder cancer model without long-term treatment-related toxicity. This theranostic platform lays the foundation for broader research applications and provides opportunities for advancing solid tumor treatment and response assessment research.",

          "abstract": "Rangifer tarandus (caribou or reindeer) survived periods of abrupt climatic warming during the last deglaciation but are currently in global decline. Using process-explicit models of likely climate-human- Rangifer interactions and inferences of demographic change from radiocarbon-dated fossils and ancient DNA, we reconstruct and decipher 21,000 years of Rangifer population dynamics. These high-resolution population reconstructions pinpoint ecological characteristics and life-history traits that most likely enabled Rangifer to survive rapid warming events following the Last Glacial Maximum. Projecting these process-driven models into the future reveals that these attributes are unlikely to buffer Rangifer against wide-scale population declines from expected 21st Century climatic warming. Our findings highlight a need to boost investments in the management and conservation of Rangifer , particularly in North America, where projected losses are expected to exceed 80%. This will not only support the survival of the species and the vital services it renders in Arctic ecosystems, but also help sustain the socioeconomic, cultural, and emotional well-being of many Rangifer -dependent communities.",

We use relocated aftershocks, geodetic measurements, and seismic waveform data to distinguish contributions from closely separated fault structures of the 2024 M w 7.5 Noto earthquake. We find that the initial rupture triggered slip on a complex fault of a preceding swarm and led to bilateral slow rupture there. The earthquake ruptured two fault segments with contrasting dip angles along the eastern and western segments. Aftershocks continued to rupture the preexisting swarm faults. A delayed rupture occurred southwest of the hypocenter, implying that substantial resistance caused by a barrier temporally hindered rupture propagation. Additional stress from surrounding slip eventually overcame the strength of the barrier fault section, leading to a compound rupture. The mainshock triggered a small earthquake swarm, in which the relatively larger events were not followed by abundant aftershocks. Our findings demonstrate the influence of strong asperities and complex geometry in the progression of cascading ruptures.",

          "abstract": "The genetic changes driving the evolution of humans since the human-chimpanzee split have been elusive. Here, we report a promising candidate in a chromosomal region linked with neurological defects—17p13.3. We show that this 442-nucleotide sequence—human-accelerated region (HAR) 123—is a conserved neural enhancer that promotes neural progenitor cell (NPC) formation. While present in all mammals, HAR123 has rapidly evolved since humans diverged from chimpanzees. The human and chimpanzee HAR123 orthologs exhibit subtle differences in their neural developmental effects, and the human HAR123 ortholog uniquely regulates many genes involved in neural differentiation. We identified direct targets of the HAR123 enhancer and showed that HIC1 acts downstream of HAR123 to promote human NPC formation. HAR123-knockout mice exhibit a defect in cognitive flexibility and a shift in neural-glia ratio in specific regions of the hippocampus. Our study has implications for neurodevelopmental disorders, which are often accompanied by altered neural-glia ratio and have been linked with HARs.",

Although there has been intense interest in experimentally tuning frustration in candidate materials, achieving precise and continuous control has remained a major hurdle—particularly in accessing the properties of the ideally frustrated lattice. Here, we show that large, finely controlled anisotropic strains can effectively tune the degree of geometric frustration in the Mott insulating κ ‐ ( ET ) 2 Cu 2 ( CN ) 3 —a slightly anisotropic triangular-lattice quantum magnet. Using thermodynamic measurements of the elastocaloric effect, we experimentally map out a temperature-strain phase diagram that captures both the ground state of the isotropic lattice and the less frustrated parent state. Our results provide a benchmark for calculations of the triangular-lattice Hubbard model as a function of frustration and highlight the power of lattice engineering as a route to realizing perfectly frustrated quantum materials.",
