          "abstract": "Antigen-induced clustering of cell surface receptors, including T cell receptors and Fc receptors, represents a widespread mechanism in cell signalling activation1,2. However, most naturally occurring antigens, such as tumour-associated antigens, stimulate limited receptor clustering and on-target responses owing to insufficient density3,4,5. Here we repurpose proximity labelling6, a method used to biotinylate and identify spatially proximal proteins, to amplify designed probes as synthetic antigen clusters on the cell surface. We develop an in vivo proximity-labelling technology controlled by either red light or ultrasound to covalently tag fluorescein probes at high density near a target antigen. Using T cell receptors as an example, we demonstrate that the amplified fluorescein effectively clusters and directs a fluorescein-binding bispecific T cell engager to induce enhanced T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Noninvasive, tissue-selective labelling in multiple syngeneic mouse tumour models produces potent immune responses that rapidly eradicate treated tumours. Efficient cell lysis further promotes epitope spreading to induce systemic immunity against untreated distal lesions and immune memory against rechallenge. Thus, proximity-labelling chemistry holds promise as a generalized strategy to manipulate antigen-dependent receptor function and cell states.",

          "abstract": "Smoke from extreme wildfires in Canada adversely affected air quality in many regions in 20231,2. Here we use satellite observations, machine learning and a chemical transport model to quantify global and regional PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter) exposure and human health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. We find that the fires increased annual PM2.5 exposure worldwide by 0.17 μg m–3 (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.26 μg m–3). North America had the largest increase in annual mean exposure (1.08 μg m–3; 0.82–1.34 μg m–3), but there were also increases in Europe (0.41 μg m–3; 0.32–0.50 μg m–3) owing to long-range transport. Annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada increased by 3.82 μg m–3 (3.00–4.64 μg m–3). In the USA, the contribution of the Canadian fires to increased PM2.5 was 1.49 μg m–3 (1.22–1.77 μg m–3), four times as large as the contribution from the 2023 wildfires originating in the USA. We find that 354 million (277–421 million) people in North America and Europe were exposed to daily PM2.5 air pollution caused by Canadian wildfires in 2023. We estimate that 5,400 (3,400–7,400) acute deaths in North America and 64,300 (37,800–90,900) chronic deaths in North America and Europe were attributable to PM2.5 exposure to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Our results highlight the far-reaching PM2.5 pollution and health burden that large wildfires can have in a single year.",

          "abstract": "Bacteriophages are the most abundant entities on earth and exhibit vast genetic and phenotypic diversity. Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterization of genes that act at the phage–host interface. So far, this has been restricted to few model phage–host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, to overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers to silence genes of DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage ΦKZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognized proteins that are essential for phage propagation and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is the RNase H-like protein ΦKZ155 (also known as Nlp2), which acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. This non-genetic antisense oligomer-based gene silencing method promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help to elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage–host pairs, and offers potential for optimizing phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.",

          "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive type of lung cancer, characterized by rapid proliferation, early metastatic spread, frequent early relapse and a high mortality rate 1–3 . Recent evidence has suggested that innervation has an important role in the development and progression of several types of cancer 4,5 . Cancer-to-neuron synapses have been reported in gliomas 6,7 , but whether peripheral tumours can form such structures is unknown. Here we show that SCLC cells can form functional synapses and receive synaptic transmission. Using in vivo insertional mutagenesis screening in conjunction with cross-species genomic and transcriptomic validation, we identified neuronal, synaptic and glutamatergic signalling gene sets in mouse and human SCLC. Further experiments revealed the ability of SCLC cells to form synaptic structures with neurons in vitro and in vivo. Electrophysiology and optogenetic experiments confirmed that cancer cells can receive NMDA receptor- and GABA A receptor-mediated synaptic inputs. Fitting with a potential oncogenic role of neuron–SCLC interactions, we showed that SCLC cells derive a proliferation advantage when co-cultured with vagal sensory or cortical neurons. Moreover, inhibition of glutamate signalling had therapeutic efficacy in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC. Therefore, following malignant transformation, SCLC cells seem to hijack synaptic signalling to promote tumour growth, thereby exposing a new route for therapeutic intervention.",

          "abstract": "Carbonaceous asteroids are the source of the most primitive meteorites1 and represent leftover planetesimals that formed from ice and dust in the outer Solar System and may have delivered volatiles to the terrestrial planets2,3,4,5. Understanding the aqueous activity of asteroids is key to deciphering their thermal, chemical and orbital evolution, with implications for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Analyses of the objects, in particular pristine samples returned from asteroid Ryugu, have provided detailed information on fluid–rock interactions within a few million years after parent-body formation6,7,8,9,10,11. However, the long-term fate of asteroidal water remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence for fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid more than 1 billion years after formation, based on the 176Lu–176Hf decay systematics of Ryugu samples, which reflect late lutetium mobilization. Such late fluid flow was probably triggered by an impact that generated heat for ice melting and opened rock fractures for fluid migration. This contrasts the early aqueous activity powered by short-lived radioactive decay, with limited fluid flow and little elemental fractionation12. Our results imply that carbonaceous planetesimals accreted by the terrestrial planets could have retained not only hydrous minerals but also aqueous water, leading to an upwards revision of the inventory of their water delivery by a factor of two to three.",

Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems 1–5 , which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. 6 , on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.",

Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy.

Here, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of human brain samples, we identified widespread gene expression changes across multiple neural cell types associated with rare ABCA7 loss-of-function variants. Excitatory neurons, which expressed the highest levels of ABCA7, showed disrupted lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, DNA repair and synaptic signalling pathways. Similar transcriptional disruptions occurred in neurons carrying the common Alzheimer’s-associated variant ABCA7 p.Ala1527Gly3, predicted by molecular dynamics simulations to alter the ABCA7 structure. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons with ABCA7 loss-of-function variants recapitulated these transcriptional changes, displaying impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress and disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Supplementation with CDP-choline increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, reversed these abnormalities and normalized amyloid-β secretion and neuronal hyperexcitability—key Alzheimer’s features that are exacerbated by ABCA7 dysfunction. Our results implicate disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism in ABCA7-related Alzheimer’s risk and highlight a possible therapeutic approach.",

          "abstract": "The electrolyte–electrode interface serves as the foundation for a myriad of chemical and physical processes. In battery chemistry, the formation of a well-known solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reversible operations of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)1,2. However, characterizing the precise chemical composition of the low crystallinity and highly sensitive SEI presents a formidable challenge3. Here, taking lithium fluoride (LiF)—a widely studied and considered crucial SEI component4,5,6,7—as an example, we use 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and identify that LiF formed in SEI (LiFSEI) has fruitful spectroscopy features that originated from the formation of limited LiF–LiH solid solutions: H-rich phase (LiH1−yFy) and F-rich phase (LiF1−xHx), which is further validated by 6Li isotope NMR, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). By characterizing SEI formed in various electrolytes, we confirm the dominance of LiH1−yFy in high-coulombic-efficiency electrolyte, which can be rationalized by the fact that LiF–LiH solid solution shows improved ionic conductivity over LiF. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that LiH1−yFy-rich coating layer presents obvious advantages compared with LiF-rich coating layer in lithium-metal batteries. This revised understanding of the heterogeneous nature of SEI components would provide new insights for electrode–electrolyte interface design.",

Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size–luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call ‘globular-cluster-like dwarfs’ (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2–4 ), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.",

          "abstract": "Epithelial cells work collectively to provide a protective barrier, yet they turn over rapidly through cell division and death. If the numbers of dividing and dying cells do not match, the barrier can vanish, or tumours can form. Mechanical forces through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo1 link both of the processes; stretch promotes cell division, whereas crowding triggers live cells to extrude and then die 1,2 . However, it was not clear what selects a given crowded cell for extrusion. Here we show that the crowded cells with the least energy and membrane potential are selected for extrusion. Crowding triggers sodium (Na + ) entry through the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC), which depolarizes cells. While those with sufficient energy repolarize, those with limited ATP remain depolarized, which, in turn, triggers water egress through the voltage-gated potassium (K + ) channels K v 1.1 and K v 1.2 and the chloride (Cl − ) channel SWELL1. Transient water loss causes cell shrinkage, amplifying crowding to activate crowding-induced live cell extrusion. Thus, our findings suggest that ENaC acts as a tension sensor that probes for cells with the least energy to extrude and die, possibly damping inadvertent crowding activation of Piezo1 in background cells. We reveal crowding-sensing mechanisms upstream of Piezo1 that highlight water regulation and ion channels as key regulators of epithelial cell turnover.",

The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3 to hydrotropic4 to specific effects such as stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework that captures this phenomenon and experimentally corroborate several new broad theoretical implications that apply beyond AAs. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the addition of 1 M proline to insulin doubles its bioavailability in blood. Overall, our results indicate that the role of small molecules is as important as that of ionic strength and should always be reported in biophysics experiments.",

Historically, studies on stomach patterning have used animal models to identify the underlying principles3,4,5,6,7. Recently, human pluripotent stem (hPS)-cell-based gastric organoids for modelling domain-specific development of the fundic and antral epithelium are emerging8,9,10. However, recapitulating self-organized fundic–antral patterning in early stomach organogenesis remains challenging, presenting a considerable barrier for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis. Here we report human gastroids—a self-organized multilineage gastric organoid derived from hPS cells—to model gastric fundic–antral patterning in vitro. Through multi-germ-layer co-development, we generate gastroids that feature an epithelial chamber with bipolar fundic–antral patterning, annexed with neural populations near the fundic domain while enveloped by mesenchymal cells, therefore showing molecular, cellular, structural and anatomical similarity to stomach development in vivo. Non-endodermal cells, especially neural populations, function as a critical signalling centre to instruct fundic–antral patterning in gastroids through WNT-mediated crosstalk. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and genetic silencing further reveal NR2F2 as a key mediator of fundic–antral patterning in gastroid development. This study reveals a principle for instructing gastric patterning and provides a higher-fidelity platform for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis and gastric organoid development.",

Here we report on five patients with SLE carrying recessive mutations in phospholipase D family member 4 ( PLD4 ). Deleterious variants in PLD4 resulted in impaired single-stranded nucleic acid exonuclease activity in in vitro and ex vivo assays. PLD4 loss-of-function mutations led to excessive activation of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9. Downstream inflammatory signalling pathways, especially type I interferon signalling, were hyperactivated in patient dendritic cells. Pld4 -deficient mice presented with autoimmunity and cell-intrinsic expansion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and plasma cells. Pld4 -deficient mice responded to the JAK inhibitor baricitinib, suggesting that targeting type I interferon may be a potential therapy for patients with PLD4 deficiency.",

          "abstract": "Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers1. In particular, models based on strongly correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems2, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter3,4. However, owing to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices5. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays6. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev’s model on a honeycomb lattice3, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states7. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement8 and feedforward9, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering10,11 with tunable entangling gates12 interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram13 and verify the non-Abelian spin-liquid phase3 by evaluating an odd Chern number14,15. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study the dynamics of the Fermi–Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry16 and high-energy physics17.",

Despite substantial advances in the field, the transport mechanisms of NCLX remain unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NCLX, revealing its architecture, assembly, major conformational states and a previously undescribed mechanism for alternating access. Functional analyses further reveal an unexpected transport function of NCLX as a H + /Ca 2+ exchanger, rather than as a Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger as widely believed 1 .

Here we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based on natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time4, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that initial tumour growth rate, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe faster initial tumour growth in more aggressive disease subtypes, and that evolutionary histories are strong independent prognostic factors in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Using EVOFLUx for phylogenetic analyses of aggressive Richter-transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples detected that the seed of the transformed clone existed decades before presentation. Orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences is provided using additional genetic data, including long-read nanopore sequencing, and clinical variables. Collectively, we show how widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measure cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.",

A pure spin current has never been measured directly because the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport3,4. Here we report that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons—the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order—in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.",

          "abstract": "Neural activity is increasingly recognized as a crucial regulator of cancer growth. In the brain, neuronal activity robustly influences glioma growth through paracrine mechanisms1 and by electrochemical integration of malignant cells into neural circuitry via neuron-to-glioma synapses2,3. Outside of the central nervous system, innervation of tumours such as prostate, head and neck, breast, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancers by peripheral nerves similarly regulates cancer progression4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. However, the extent to which the nervous system regulates small cell lung cancer (SCLC) progression, either in the lung or when growing within the brain, is less well understood. SCLC is a lethal high-grade neuroendocrine tumour that exhibits a strong propensity to metastasize to the brain. Here we demonstrate that in the lung, vagus nerve transection markedly inhibits primary lung tumour development and progression, highlighting a critical role for innervation in SCLC growth. In the brain, SCLC cells co-opt neuronal activity-regulated mechanisms to stimulate growth and progression. Glutamatergic and GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) cortical neuronal activity each drive proliferation of SCLC in the brain through paracrine and synaptic neuron–cancer interactions. SCLC cells form bona fide neuron-to-SCLC synapses and exhibit depolarizing currents with consequent calcium transients in response to neuronal activity; such SCLC cell membrane depolarization is sufficient to promote the growth of intracranial tumours. Together, these findings illustrate that neuronal activity has a crucial role in dictating SCLC pathogenesis.",

The group includes around 12,000 species of lizards and snakes (Squamata) and one species of Rhynchocephalia, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus from New Zealand 1 . Squamates owe their success to their generally small size, but also to their highly mobile skull that enables them to manipulate large prey. These key features of lizard and snake skulls are not seen in Sphenodon , which makes it important to understand the nature of their common ancestor. Lepidosaurs originated in the Triassic 252–201 million years ago, but confusion has arisen because of incomplete fossils, many of which are generalized lepidosauromorphs, neither squamates nor rhynchocephalians 2–5 . Here we report a reasonably complete skull and skeleton of a definitive rhynchocephalian from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Helsby Sandstone Formation of Devon, UK that is around 3–7 million years older than the oldest currently known lepidosaur. The new species shows, as predicted, a non-mobile skull but an open lower temporal bar and no large palatine teeth, and it seems to have been a specialized feeder on insects. This specimen helps us understand the initial diversification of Lepidosauria as part of the Triassic Revolution, when modern-style terrestrial ecosystems emerged.",

Unbiased analysis of the RNAome (coding and non-coding RNAs) with unsupervised clustering using integrative non-negative matrix factorization3 provides a means of identifying distinct molecular subtypes and was applied here to muscle of patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. Rectus abdominis biopsies from 84 patients were profiled using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Integrative non-negative matrix factorization with stringent quality metrics for clustering identified two highly coherent molecular subtypes within muscle of patients with cancer. Patients with subtype 1 (versus subtype 2) showed clinical manifestations of cachexia: high-grade weight loss, low muscle mass, atrophy of type IIA and type IIX muscle fibres, and reduced survival. On the basis of differential expression between the subtypes, we identified biological processes that may contribute to cancer-associated loss of muscle mass and function, including altered posttranscriptional regulation and perturbation of neuronal systems; cytokine storm and cellular immune response; pathways related to extracellular matrix; and metabolic abnormalities spanning xenobiotic metabolism, haemostasis, signal transduction, embryonic and/or pluripotent stem cells, and amino acid metabolism. Differential expression between subtypes indicated the involvement of multiple intertwined higher-order gene regulatory networks, suggesting that network interactions of (hub) long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and mRNAs could represent targets for future research.",

          "abstract": "Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events 1–4 . Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events 5,6 . Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework 1 . Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes 7,8 .",

          "authors": "Anne Marie Conlon",
          "abstract": "“I’m not looking to go viral,” says Sharon Obasi of her use of LinkedIn. “I’m looking just to be authentic, make connections and see how other people are approaching similar topics.”\n\nObasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney, started using the global professional social-networking site more in the past few years as she took on extra administrative responsibilities in her department. “It was really a chance for me to find people who are in similar roles, in small institutions — a way to find community. But once I started posting and interacting, I realized it was much more than that,” she says. “I call it my 24/7, 365 scientific conference. It’s a really great way to engage in science and scholarship in a much more public way.”\n\nObasi is one of around one billion registered users of LinkedIn, which turned 22 years old in May. The platform is becoming increasingly popular, with some attributing its recent growth to the decline of the social-media platform X, which shed 11 million users in the European Union alone between October 2024 and March 2025.\n\nNature’s Careers team spoke to Obasi and seven other researchers about why they love LinkedIn, and how other scientists can use it to their advantage.\n\nGetting started\n\nTeaching researchers how to use LinkedIn is part of Hannah Roberts’s role as a careers coach in Macclesfield, UK. She specializes in helping women who work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, many of whom have little time to focus on career-development activities, she says. Roberts, who completed a PhD in chemistry in 2011 at the University of Manchester, UK, surveyed 3,000 women about their careers and found that 85% could benefit from using LinkedIn more. To use it to its full potential, Roberts says, people should have more than 1,000 contacts, and to get there, they need to be “intentional about evolving their network”.\n\nTo do so, Roberts recommends that researchers devote an hour per week to career-development activities, and make a special effort on LinkedIn as part of this (see ‘Six LinkedIn lessons from those in the know’). She suggests: “Set a timer for 15 minutes and connect with ten relevant people for your next job step”, whether that be making partnerships, finding collaborators or raising your profile to help secure future roles.\n\nSix LinkedIn lessons from those in the know\n\nSeasoned users offer their top tips for getting the best out of the professional-networking platform.\n\nSelect a short-term aim\n\n“Pick a strategy for the next six months,” advises science-careers coach Hannah Roberts, who is based in Macclesfield, UK. Maybe it’s to get a job or to find collaborators. You don’t have to stick with it forever, just choose what feels right for now.\n\nUpdate your profile\n\nYour personal page on LinkedIn is what potential collaborators and employers will see. “Ensure that all the sections of your LinkedIn profile are complete and up to date,” says Roberts.\n\nCurate your connections\n\nFollow people who are relevant to your line of work, but be judicious about who you connect with, says Ruth Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. Those connections determine what shows up in your feed, she says, “If I’m randomly connecting with people, that’s a problem — because garbage in, garbage out.”\n\nBe consistent\n\nInvesting time on the site will pay dividends. For some, this means scheduling posts to ensure a regular output. For Elena Hoffer, who runs a professional-resources business in Stockholm, it means wading into conversations on her posts. “Don’t post and ghost,” she suggests. “When I post, I always comment in the first hour, just to get the discussion going.”\n\nBe brave\n\n“Putting yourself out there” is key on LinkedIn, says Sharon Obasi, a psychologist at the University of Nebraska at Kearney — although this is something scientists aren’t always trained to do. Remember that your input is valuable, even in discussions with luminaries in your field. “You might have a perspective that is not amplified or not centred — you might have an unusual take.”\n\nConnect thoughtfully\n\nWhen connecting with someone you don’t know, try to build a relationship before asking for anything. “I get a lot of direct messages from people who I have no rapport with. Nothing has been built up, and instantly they will ping me a message about something that’s irrelevant, or ask me for a job,” says Roberts. “It’s a bit like jumping to ‘will you marry me?’ before we’ve even exchanged a word.”\n\nShe also suggests commenting on five posts each week, so that “people see your name, your picture and your LinkedIn headline”, adding: “If you’re employing that strategy every time you go on LinkedIn, you can massively extend that network in a short space of time. Consistency of action makes a big change.”\n\nOnce you’ve built up a strong network of connections, Roberts says that more behind-the-scenes networking can begin, including informal conversations and making yourself known to organizations that interest you the most.\n\nHow I put LinkedIn to work for my career as a scientist and entrepreneur\n\nSome people take a less-formal approach. Elena Hoffer co-founded the firm Alma.Me, in Stockholm, to help early-career researchers to transition out of academia. Hoffer, who has a PhD in medical sciences from the Karolinska Institute in Solna, Sweden, and more than 100,000 LinkedIn followers says: “I always say, ‘do what fits you’. I never plan my content... I just need to feel it, you know?”\n\nRuth Gotian, whose 2022 book The Success Factor investigates how to achieve peak business performance based on her discussions with astronauts and Nobel laureates, doesn’t recommend setting yourself targets for LinkedIn activity. Instead, she suggests fitting it in where you can around your existing work: “I tell people to definitely do it during their non-peak performance hours,” says Gotian, chief learning officer and an educator in anaesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.\n\nHow to network on LinkedIn\n\n“Networking is so weird, because it’s awkward,” says Vanesa Ayala-Núñez, an oncology researcher at the St Gallen branch of Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology. “It’s not so easy to connect with someone who you don’t know.” To get around this, Ayala-Núñez sought common ground. As a Mexican, she says, speaking to other Europe-based Latin American women at science conferences and networking events “opened a lot of doors for me, because immediately you create a connection with this person — we have a lot of things in common. We have gone through a lot of similar experiences”.\n\nShe mirrored this approach on LinkedIn, being guided by people’s names, or where they studied. Writing messages to potential connections in Spanish and highlighting the things they had in common helped Ayala-Núñez to build a strong professional network. “You never know who can eventually help you,” she says.\n\nGotian’s approach is similar. “To me, LinkedIn is like air,” she says. “I use it all the time. If I’m going to meet with someone, I need some background information, and the first place I go to is LinkedIn, because what I want to do immediately is establish a connection with someone.” She might find common ground on the basis of someone’s education, hometown or work history, “and that just kicks the conversation off”.\n\nRuth Gotian is chief learning officer at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.Credit: LinkedIn\n\nGotian emphasizes that developing personal connections is key to professional networking. When approaching people, “you don’t want to sound like a salesperson, and you certainly don’t want to sound transactional. You want to build a relationship. People like to work with those who they know, like and trust”.\n\nGotian recommends the ‘24/7/30 networking model’: “Twenty-four hours after you meet someone, you connect with them, and you do it as a personal connection. ‘It was so great chatting with you. I hope you have a great time on that ski holiday you talked about.’ Seven days later, you connect again with a thoughtful comment.” This could be sending an article about something you discussed when you met, for example.\n\n“Then 30 days later, you’re following up”, sending your new connection an article or a podcast or mentioning a discussion you had that made you think of them. “You’re always circling back to that conversation. You have not asked for a thing. You’re just building up the ‘know, like and trust’ factor, and then obviously engaging with their content in a thoughtful way.”\n\nThis direct approach might make some researchers uncomfortable, but Gotian says it’s just like building a friendship. “Remember you’re not asking for anything. If anything, you’re helping the other person.”\n\nGotian cautions against using an overly serious tone. “Because if you make it too formal and stuffy, transactional and get right to business, it’s a real turn off.”\n\nHow to be authentic\n\nSo now that you’re using LinkedIn regularly, how should you act when you’re there? “You want to come through as authentically as possible,” says Lucy Lawrence, who works in science communication in London. She advises researchers to adopt a confident attitude and not to copy others’ approaches too closely. “Just because it’s working well for someone else on LinkedIn, it doesn’t mean it’s going to translate for you.” For Lawrence, who switched to science communication after completing a biomedical science degree at Nottingham Trent University, UK, in 2015, her authenticity comes from a genuine enthusiasm for the science that she writes about.\n\nA 60-minute guide to landing your next job in science\n\n“I’m a yapper and I just really like speaking to people,” she says. Posting on her blog and on LinkedIn gave her an opportunity to talk publicly about science that she found inspiring.\n\n“I grew my account to about 14,000 followers in three years just by being me and talking about things that I think are really interesting. Almost as if I’m talking to one of my friends: ‘Oh my God, this is really cool. Have you heard about this?’”\n\nBeing passionate about his research area also helped electrochemist Jyotisman Rath to reap benefits on LinkedIn. Rath posted daily for 100 days on topics ranging from a battery trivia challenge to sustainability, climate change, energy and the broader field of electrochemistry during his master’s degree at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Bhubaneswar, India, hoping that the daily target would help him stick to posting.\n\nThe task revealed to him just how many scientists are active on LinkedIn. “Perhaps they don’t post a lot or comment a lot, but they do definitely read people’s posts,” says Rath, who is now doing a PhD at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Daily posting enabled him to initiate conversations in comments and private messages, prompting discussion by asking others their opinions on the things he was posting about.\n\nElectrochemist Jyotisman Rath joined the LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Programme in 2022.Credit: Jyotisman Rath\n\nRath communicated with senior figures in his research field, as well as raising his profile, which resulted in an internship with a start-up company working on innovative battery materials, something he attributes to his frequent posts. “I was able to contact them during my challenge, then they saw what I’m doing and my ideas,” he says.\n\nRath was also selected to join the Indian cohort of the ten-week LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Programme in 2022. It offers a small stipend and training on how to build engaged communities.\n\nFor some, being authentic means being open about your personal life, even on a platform that is considered more professional than, say, X or Instagram.\n\nSiddharth Kankaria, a social-sciences researcher and science communicator in Kolkata, India, says LinkedIn is now his “primary social-media outlet”, making him inclined to share personal content there.",

          "abstract": "Numerous dinosaur eggs have been found in Shiyan, China, but their age has been unknown until now.Credit: Dr. Bi Zhao\n\nScientists in China have calculated the direct age of a fossilized dinosaur egg1 for the first time. The newly dated egg, from a cluster of 28 found in a nesting area in Shiyan, China, is around 85.9 million years old, according to a study published in Frontiers in Earth Science today.\n\nWorking out how old fossilized eggs are typically involves indirectly dating the volcanic ash or rock layers in which the specimens are embedded. But indirect methods can be inaccurate, because the material might not have formed at the same time as when the eggs were laid.\n\nTo determine the age of an egg directly, the researchers fired lasers at eggshell fragments to vaporize the minerals deposited on the surface during fossilization. The resulting vapour contained lead and uranium atoms. Uranium naturally decays into lead. Because the decay happens at a consistent rate, studying the composition of decaying uranium atoms (or isotopes) and stable lead atoms trapped in geological material, such as the dinosaur eggs, reveals the fossil’s age.\n\n“To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that in situ isotopic ages have been reported for dinosaur eggshells both in China and, very likely, worldwide,” says study co-author Xing Cheng, a geologist at the Chinese Academy of Science in Xi’an. The method has previously been used to estimate the ages of fossilized bones and teeth2, as well as those of rocks and minerals3.\n\nGuntupalli Prasad, a palaeontologist at the University of Delhi in New Delhi, says that the direct dating method will have wide ramifications for palaeontology. “This will remove the uncertainties associated with the ages of many fossils,” he says.\n\nBut Susannah Maidment, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, says that the study did not account for the processes that occur between the egg’s burial and fossilization. One such process, called diagenesis, could change the original composition of the studied materials. “Any attempt to direct date fossils must demonstrate that the mineralogy has not been altered by diagenetic processes, as this would result in an incorrect age estimation,” she says.\n\nThe authors say previous research has revealed little to no volcanic activity that would disturb eggs in the area, and the eggshells sampled were well preserved with no shell deformation, which suggests negligible alteration after they were laid. However, they said they intend to conduct further studies to verify their results.",

          "title": "AI chatbots are already biasing research — we must establish guidelines for their use now",
          "authors": "Zhicheng Lin",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are consuming vast amounts of online content yet pointing few users to the articles’ publishers. In early 2025, US-based company OpenAI collected around 250 pages of material for every visitor it directed to a publisher’s website. By mid-2025, that figure had soared to 1,500, according to Matthew Prince, chief executive of US-based Internet-security firm Cloudflare. And the extraction rate of US-based AI start-up company Anthropic climbed even higher over the same period: from 6,000 pages to 60,000. Even tech giant Google, long considered an asset to publishers because of the referral traffic it generated, tripled its ratio from 6 pages to 18 with the launch of its AI Overviews feature. The current information ecosystem is dominated by ‘answer engines’ — AI chatbots that synthesize and deliver information directly, with users trusting the answers now more than ever.\n\nAs a researcher in metascience and psychology, I see this transition as the most important change in knowledge discovery in a generation. Although these tools can answer questions faster and often more accurately than search engines can, this efficiency has a price. In addition to the decimation of web traffic to publishers, there is a more insidious cost. Not AI’s ‘hallucinations’ — fabrications that can be corrected — but the biases and vulnerabilities in the real information that these systems present to users.\n\nWill AI speed up literature reviews or derail them entirely?\n\nConsider what happens when researchers ask an AI tool to recommend peer reviewers in their field. One study focused on physics found that AI systems over-represented scholars with names that the scientists classified as belonging to white people and under-represented those with names they classified as Asian (D. Barolo et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/p46k; 2025). Algorithms can amplify distinct prejudices depending on the field, the context and the wording of the query.\n\nThe distortion extends to the literature itself, something I’ve witnessed at first hand. When AI systems recommend research papers, they consistently exacerbate the Matthew effect — the tendency for highly cited work to accumulate even more citations while lesser-known research remains invisible. More than 60% of AI-generated suggestions fall in the top 1% of most-cited articles, more than twice the number seen in human-curated reference lists (A. Algaba et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/p46m; 2025). AI systems have internalized human citation patterns and have amplified them to an extreme.\n\nDespite the tools’ growing influence, research on AI-assisted information retrieval remains limited. This gap reflects a broader blind spot in how institutions are responding to AI’s growing role in science. Policies have focused on the ethics of AI-assisted article production — establishing principles for responsible use, concerning originality, accountability and transparency, for instance. However, the threat lies not in how we write science, but in how we find it.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science\n\nResearchers are scrutinizing AI-generated sentences while implicitly enabling these systems to choose which scholars are cited, which methods seem relevant and which research directions might be promising. They are accepting the outputs even though the underlying information has been distorted. This imbalance is especially concerning because the prospect of autonomous research agents — AI tools designed to conduct literature reviews, and even experiments, at scale — is moving closer to reality.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "Theoretical chemist Alán Aspuru-Guzik advises committing to the local culture if you move to another country for a science job.Credit: Carlos Osorio\n\nAlán Aspuru-Guzik takes a lot of calls these days from scientists considering an exit from the United States. Aspuru-Guzik, a theoretical chemist, left Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, during Donald Trump’s first term as US president, from 2017 to 2021, to join the University of Toronto in Canada and hasn’t looked back. “I’m the happiest guy here,” he says.\n\nAspuru-Guzik left because he didn’t agree with Trump’s politics and policies. Now, eight months into the president’s second term, with the White House freezing billions of dollars in federal research grants and targeting international scholars and students seeking to work and study in the United States, many US-based researchers are looking abroad for jobs. “What I find is that people who weren’t asking the questions [about moving] before, they’re asking them now,” says Stephen Jones, a biochemist who moved from the University of Texas in Austin to Vilnius University in Lithuania in 2021.\n\nHere, Nature talks to Jones, Aspuru-Guzik and others who left during Trump’s first term about relocating and reshaping their careers. They have plenty of advice.\n\nCommitting to the local culture\n\nAlthough quantitative data are scarce, two Nature analyses earlier this year suggested that, because of the upheaval to US science, a significant proportion of US-based scientists are considering applying for jobs elsewhere — particularly in Europe or Canada.\n\nUS brain drain: the scientists seeking jobs abroad amid Trump’s assault on research\n\nAspuru-Guzik, a citizen of both the United States and Mexico (and soon to be one of Canada), began looking to leave Harvard when Trump was elected in 2016. As a presidential candidate, Trump had repeatedly denigrated immigrants and scientific research, and hinted at dismantling support for education. “Almost everything that’s happening now” is what Aspuru-Guzik feared might happen during Trump’s first term, he says.\n\nWhen you’re trying to identify a place to relocate to for the sake of your career, the theoretical chemist advises fully committing to the local culture and work environment. For instance, when he was considering Canada as a top option, he began reading local newspapers. “If you’re moving to a place, you have to understand the zeitgeist of that place,” he says.\n\nOne common mistake he sees among expatriates is an unwillingness to embrace change, even though change is the ostensible reason for leaving the United States. Be humble, he says — and don’t assume “predetermination of the superiority of the American system”. Respect cultural differences, no matter how alien or familiar the new location might seem. “Canada is another country,” Aspuru-Guzik says. “It’s not the 51st state.”\n\nLearning how to adjust\n\nEcologist Camille Parmesan agrees. Originally from the United States, she was working in the United Kingdom when Trump was elected the first time and decided to stay abroad, moving to France as part of the French government’s ‘Make Our Planet Great Again’ programme to support climate science during Trump 1.0. “You’re the one who is going to have to adjust,” she says. “Europe is not going to adjust to you.”\n\nLearn the local language or expect to work with an interpreter, says Parmesan, who works at the French National Centre for Scientific Research’s Theoretical and Experimental Ecology Station in Moulis. Professional conversations might be held in English, but in many countries, “if you’re going to buy a house, get into the health system, get a work visa — in those areas no one speaks English”, she says.\n\nEcologist Camille Parmesan moved to France during Trump’s first presidency for a programme that supported climate science.Credit: BBVA Foundation\n\nFully committing to a new location means learning how to work within the system. Prepare by talking to a number of potential collaborators at a desired institution to understand the situation, Jones says. For laboratory scientists, he adds, there are basics to consider, such as whether equipment being relocated can function on a different country’s power supply, or where to source lab supplies.\n\nBut these are minor inconveniences that, for him, are far outweighed by a better quality of life in Europe. Jones and his wife decided to relocate to Lithuania towards the end of the first Trump presidency, as they were assessing how their personal values meshed with those of the society around them — or not.",

          "abstract": "Medical researchers at some institutions in Canada, the United States and Italy are using data created by artificial intelligence (AI) from real patient information in their experiments without the need for permission from their institutional ethics boards, Nature has learnt.\n\nTo generate what is called synthetic data, researchers train generative AI models using real human medical information, then ask the models to create data sets with statistical properties that represent, but do not include, human data.\n\nTypically, when research involves human data, an ethics board must review how studies affect participants’ rights, safety, dignity and well-being. However, institutions including the IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital in Milan, Italy, the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa and the Ottawa Hospital, and Washington University School of Medicine (WashU Medicine) in St. Louis, Missouri, have waived these requirements for research involving synthetic data.\n\nThe reasons the institutions use to justify this decision differ. However, the potential benefits of using synthetic data include protecting patient privacy, being more easily able to share data between sites and speeding up research, says Khaled El Emam, a medical AI researcher at the CHEO Research Institute and the University of Ottawa.\n\nWashington University, which began waiving ethical review for such research in 2020, was “among the first US institutions to adopt synthetic data at scale” in medical science, says Philip Payne, who is the university’s vice-chancellor for biomedical informatics and data science, and director of its Institute for Informatics, Data Science and Biostatistics.\n\nPayne says that synthetic data sets are not considered ‘human-subject research’ under the 1991 US federal Common Rule, which governs ethical standards for research involving people. This, he adds, is because the data don’t contain any real or traceable patient information. WashU Medicine’s Institutional Review Board therefore doesn’t consider projects using such data sets to be human-subject research and doesn’t require them to be reviewed.\n\nNational variations\n\nIn Italy, scientists at the Humanitas AI Center have been exploring synthetic data in research since 2021, says Saverio D’Amico, the AI team leader. D’Amico and his colleagues can also avoid seeking consent from ethical review boards if they create data using information gathered from patients who have consented to data analysis for AI purposes, he says.\n\nHumanitas has had more freedom to use synthetic data without ethical review than many other Italian organizations have, D’Amico says, because it is a high-level research hospital. The Italian Ministry of Health grants this status to a small number of institutes, marking them as benchmarks for innovation and quality patient care.\n\nMeanwhile, in Ontario, the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 says that the creation of non-personal information — which conceals individual identities — doesn’t require patient consent.\n\nThe Canadian hospitals decided to waive ethics-board review following legal analyses in 2024, says Cécile Bensimon, chair of the Research Ethics Board at CHEO. The analyses concluded that AI-generated synthetic data might not constitute personal health information. Therefore, like WashU Medicine, the CHEO board concluded that “the use of synthetic data in research does not require oversight by the hospital research ethics board because it does not meet the definition of human research”, Bensimon says.\n\nHowever, studies in which researchers access patient data to create synthetic data sets do need ethics board approval, Bensimon adds. But because they are deemed low-risk, they usually meet the criteria to waive participant consent. The conditions the Ottawa Hospital applies differ slightly. “AI in research more broadly is not inherently problematic,” Bensimon adds. “It just requires the application of existing standards and safeguards.”",

          "title": "These nations are wooing PhD students amid US funding uncertainties",
          "authors": "Rachel Fieldhouse",
          "abstract": "The United States has long been one of the most popular destinations for international students pursuing graduate studies. But pauses to some of the country’s university PhD programmes and the imposition of visa restrictions for students from certain countries have prompted other nations to try to attract those students who have been affected by the changes or who no longer want to study in the United States.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed slashing budgets at some of the country’s top scientific agencies and has frozen funds for grants and contracts for universities.\n\nChris Tisdell, a researcher in education and mathematics at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia, says he has heard reports of international students already shifting away from the United States because of uncertainties surrounding funding. International student arrivals dropped by 30% in June this year compared with June 2024, according to data reported by the US International Trade Administration.\n\nGwilym Croucher, a researcher in higher education at the University of Melbourne, Australia, says he expects talented PhD candidates to look elsewhere. “The beneficiaries of that may be established places like Canada, Australia, the UK, a lot of Europe, but they may also be China and India,” he says.\n\nSo, which countries have stepped up efforts to woo PhD students? And what are they offering?\n\nCanada\n\nSeveral universities in Canada have set up programmes to attract students from the United States.\n\nIn July, Western University in London launched a Doctoral Excellence Award, targeting current and prospective students of US universities, including those who have had an offer rescinded in the past six months, at US universities ranked in the top 100 globally. Initially, 25 students will be supported, receiving a PhD stipend for up to four years of study, as well as “fast-tracked admissions and help finding a supervisor”, says Florentine Strzelczyk, Western University’s provost. PhD stipends increased across Canada, after the government set a blanket rate of Can$40,000 annually last year.\n\nEarlier this year, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver also extended the deadline to allow for late applications from US citizens to be considered for certain graduate programmes starting in January 2026.\n\nAlicia Piazza is in her third year of a PhD at Brock University in St. Catharine’s and recommends Canada for graduate studies, particularly because of the quality of training on offer. “I’m three years in and I’m still learning,” she says. The classes she has attended, including one on grant writing and another on presenting and analysing research papers, have prepared her to work in academia or industry. Students at the university are also encouraged to apply for external funding, and she successfully applied for a scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\n\nPiazza receives a stipend from the university that covers her tuition fees, and was also guaranteed a position as a teaching assistant, which helps to cover living expenses, she says. “The rent is not too bad, so it’s pretty affordable,” she adds.\n\nEurope\n\nFrance, Germany and Spain are among other countries that have introduced new programmes to attract students, particularly those from the United States, alongside initiatives to attract scientists further on in their careers.\n\nThe University of Paris-Saclay in Orsay, France, is offering eight spots for students to pursue a PhD in subjects spanning climate and environmental science, global health, humanities, social sciences and energy transition. Students who have already started a PhD in the United States are also eligible. International students can apply for several scholarships that cover accommodation and living costs, and in some cases health insurance. Students supported by funding from their university, institution or the national research agency receive between €16,800 (US$19,400) and €18,000 per year.\n\nMeanwhile, the Max Planck Society in Germany has launched a Transatlantic Program and encouraged prospective students to apply to programmes at its international research schools and graduate centres. Doctoral students are under contract with the society, with set working hours of 39 hours per week and a minimum pay of €32,400 per year.",

          "abstract": "A US coal-fired power plant. Such plants tend to emit large amounts of greenhouse gases.Credit: Getty\n\nFaced with a lawsuit, the administration of US President Donald Trump has disbanded a panel of five well-known critics of climate science who issued a controversial draft report questioning the evidence underlying global warming. US energy secretary Chris Wright asserted that the group had accomplished its goal in publishing the first draft, which the Department of Energy (DoE) has declined to withdraw. Two of the panel’s members told Nature they plan to continue the work independently.\n\nThe dissolution of the panel could undermine the draft report as well as its potential use in regulatory decisions. In particular, the document serves as the scientific basis of the Trump administration’s efforts to repeal a landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. A repeal of the finding would prevent the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from regulating greenhouse gases, now and potentially into the future.\n\n“The optics are bad,” says Adam Orford, a legal scholar at Fordham University in New York City. “If you are going to base climate policy on something, shouldn’t it be a little bit more credible than a draft report from a committee that was disbanded?”\n\nContentious findings\n\nThe draft report, which was released in July, concluded that global warming is “less damaging economically than commonly believed”. Climate scientists say that it amplifies minor uncertainties about climate change and downplays the harms. It was written by a working group comprising five academic researchers who have a history of disagreeing with consensus opinions on climate science. Before the group was disbanded, the DoE had tasked it with responding to public comments on the draft and then producing a final version of the report.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nWright’s decision to disband the group, first reported by Politico, arrives in the middle of a lawsuit by advocacy groups over how the climate panel was appointed and managed. The lawsuit hinges on whether the DoE followed mandates laid out under the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which requires agencies to ensure that advisory panels represent a diversity of viewpoints. The suit argues that the DoE handpicked its panel to represent a specific viewpoint, which centres on opposition to mainstream climate science. The lawsuit also argues that the DoE violated other FACA requirements, including one requiring that such panels announce their meetings publicly.\n\nThe DoE has requested that the case be dismissed now that the working group has been disbanded, but advocacy groups are pushing for a formal ruling on the legality of the panel. A federal judge declined today to rule on the case; arguments are expected to resume later this month.\n\nThe DoE did not immediately respond to allegations that it acted illegally in appointing and managing the climate panel. It also declined to specify whether it intends to issue a final report that includes responses to public comments.\n\nThe draft report achieved its purpose, “namely to catalyze broader discussion about the certainties and uncertainties of current climate science”, a DoE spokesperson said in a statement to Nature. “We will continue to engage in the debate in favor of a more science-based and less ideological conversation around climate science.”\n\nOutside the mainstream\n\n“The DoE report has turned into a true mess,” says Andrew Dessler, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University in College Station, who helped to coordinate a 450-plus-page response from dozens of scientists in the United States and abroad.",

          "title": "A revolution is sweeping Europe’s farms: can it save agriculture?",
          "authors": "April Reese",
          "abstract": "At first glance, Ruben Jorge’s farm near the village of Penha Garcia in eastern Portugal doesn’t seem all that unusual. But look closer, and signs emerge that Jorge is shedding tradition in the hope of future-proofing his farm.\n\nBetween the rows of chestnut and pistachio saplings, a mix of grasses covers the ground where a stretch of bare dirt would typically be — a deliberate attempt to prevent erosion. To retain water, Jorge has wrapped a blanket of wood chips around the base of each sapling. And among the young trees grow yellow lupin flowers, known as tremocilha in Portuguese, that have a special power: they capture nitrogen and store it underground.\n\n“It’s a natural fertilizer,” Jorge says, looking out over the field of chest-high saplings under an intense springtime Sun. The flowers, mowing and mulch are part of Jorge’s transition to regenerative agriculture, a method of farming that prioritizes soil health, boosts biodiversity, minimizes tilling and uses pesticides sparingly. “Anything that we can do that adds resilience to the land, that preserves this land for the future, is always a better option,” Jorge says, “as long as it’s economically viable, of course.”\n\nWhat humanity should eat to stay healthy and save the planet\n\nThe future is coming hard at Europe — the fastest-warming continent on the planet since the 1980s1. In just the past few years, farmers on the Iberian Peninsula have struggled with shrivelled crops, shrinking water supplies and more-frequent wildfires. Going forwards, the economic hit to the European Union and the United Kingdom from drought alone could reach more than €65 billion (US$76 billion) each year by 2100, in part because of crop damage and lost water supplies2.\n\nWith an estimated 4 °C of warming expected over the next 75 years if no action is taken to curb or adapt to climate change, southern and western Europe could lose 10% of its agricultural economic output2. Meanwhile, widespread erosion continues to sweep away soil, taking with it crucial nutrients and increasing the risk of flooding and landslides. Between 60% and 70% of soils in the EU are degraded, according to the European Commission.\n\nThese mounting risks are leading farmers such as Jorge to bet on regenerative agriculture. Together with climate advocates and scientists, they increasingly see these practices as key to withstanding changing climatic conditions — and to helping farmers stay in business. And Europe is showing how it can be done, they say.\n\n“We believe right now we’re at a point where the grassroots are spreading,” says Simon Krämer, executive director at the European Alliance for Regenerative Agriculture (EARA), a farmer-led advocacy group in Berlin that was founded in 2023. According to Krämer, about 2% of farms in Europe are fully regenerative, and another 5–10% are on the regenerative path.\n\nThis budding regenerative revolution now faces some headwinds, however. After farmer protests across Europe in 2023 and 2024, the EU has backed away from some environmental requirements for the agricultural sector, and farmers say that incentives fall short of what’s needed to help them make the transition.\n\nBut many advocates expect that the momentum behind regenerative agriculture will continue to build, particularly given Europe’s need to meet its commitments to restore ecosystems and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. And farmers and researchers around the world are carefully watching Europe’s attempts to pull off one of the biggest transitions in agriculture in generations. Regenerative agriculture, Krämer says, “is the most important farmer and science movement in the world”.\n\nSaving the soil\n\nIn Portugal and many other parts of the globe, farmers are coming to realize that what worked for their parents and grandparents is no longer viable. To survive increasingly harsh conditions, they need to rethink how they farm – from the soil up.\n\nAbout 180 kilometres south of Jorge’s farm, just outside the tiny cobblestoned hamlet of Assumar, Herberto Brunk is undertaking his own regenerative experiment. As he manoeuvres his black Peugeot truck up his long dirt driveway, he stops between two of his fields. On the left, Brunk has planted mixed grasses as ground cover. On the right is a thriving field dominated by buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) with some millet, pumpkin and sunflowers mixed in. A few months later, after a dry summer, he decided not to harvest the buckwheat and to leave it as a cover crop instead. Kept intact, it has helped to prevent nitrogen from leaching out of the soil.\n\nMuch of the work Brunk is doing is aimed at improving the soil — the foundation for a healthy bottom line. “Our main goal is to actually recover the soil, get our organic matter up, get our nutrients recycled and reduce as much as possible the erosion,” Brunk says. He’s already beginning to see some positive results: “At the moment, we don’t have any erosion at all due to water.”\n\nBrunk is working to increase the amount of carbon stored in his farm’s soil.Credit: Barbora Mrazkova\n\nAnd Brunk says his farm is likely to be more resilient during wildfires. In August, as fires burnt across Portugal, he helped his neighbour, a cattle grower, to put out a fire. If it had reached Brunk’s property, he says, it probably wouldn’t have done much damage because the fields are green and well hydrated.\n\nThis is year three of Brunk’s five-year plan, and he doesn’t expect to see a profit for a while. But both Jorge and Brunk are hopeful that the eventual pay-off will be worth the wait. For them, the regenerative approach is not only a way to restore the soil — it’s also good for business in the long run.\n\nImproving the soil will help to retain water, protecting it from drought, says Brunk. He has also seen the amount of carbon in his soils increase from 1.9% in 2019 to 3.5% in 2024 — more than halfway to his goal of 6%. Under a new partnership with Terra Madre, a company based in Porto, Portugal, that helps farmers transition to regenerative agriculture, he will receive payments for increasing the amount of carbon stored in plants and the soil; companies buy carbon credits based on this sequestered carbon to offset their pollution.\n\nThe practices that Brunk and Jorge are deploying — planting cover crops, rotating crops, reducing tilling, integrating trees — can help to protect their farms against the vagaries of a changing climate, says Thomas Elmqvist, a sustainability scientist at the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University. He co-wrote a 2022 report from the European Academies’ Science Advisory Council on the state of regenerative agriculture in Europe. “There is fairly strong scientific evidence for the practices having an impact,” he says.\n\nFor example, growing different crops on the same field in rotation can boost the number and types of microorganisms in the soil3. And a 2021 meta-analysis4 spanning 85 countries showed that diversifying crops in this way increased the biodiversity of other plants and animals by 24%. Growing a variety of crops brings a host of other benefits: the study also found the practice led to a 51% increase in water quality, a 63% boost in pest and disease control and an 11% spike in soil quality.\n\nHow farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool\n\nA 2022 study5 using soil samples from 1,267 farm sites across Germany found that tripling the area used to grow cover crops could boost the amount of organic carbon added to the soil by 12% within 50 years.\n\nWhen it comes to crop yields, the results are less clear. A 2019 review6, for example, found that using cover crops decreased grain production by 4%, but including legumes such as clover in the cover crop could increase yields by 13%.\n\nOther studies show positive trends in terms of profitability for farmers. In June, Krämer’s group released a multi-year analysis7 that looked at 78 farms across 14 European countries. The results, which have not been published in a scientific journal but were reviewed by agricultural experts across Europe, found that farms that had adopted regenerative practices used 61% less synthetic nitrogen and 75% less pesticides than did their conventional counterparts. Per hectare, regenerative farms also achieved a 20% higher margin (the difference between income and costs).\n\nAnd a 2023 analysis of regenerative farms in Germany by Krämer and his co-authors — written for the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy firm — reported that these operations should be at least 60% more profitable after six to ten years compared with conventional farms using other approaches.\n\nBut what works in one location might not work in another, Elmqvist says. “More long-term studies are needed to fully understand the sustainability and profitability of regenerative practices over multiple growing seasons, in different regions and under different climatic conditions,” he says.\n\nA push for reform\n\nOn paper, at least, the EU has some of the world’s most ambitious commitments to sustainable agriculture, several of which encourage a regenerative approach. But in practice, observers say, the bloc has struggled to deliver on those promises.\n\nIn 2020, after a brutal European heatwave in 2019, the EU committed to building a food system that “works for consumers, producers, climate and the environment”. It had also launched its signature environmental law in 2019, the European Green Deal, which aims to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. And, last year, the bloc adopted a landmark nature-restoration law, which includes a requirement for member states to boost biodiversity on farmlands.\n\nReducing the amount of soil disturbance has helped Brunk to avoid erosion in his fields.Credit: Barbora Mrazkova\n\nThe bloc now funds an initiative to help farmers to scale up regenerative practices and, in February, it unveiled a road map that calls for farmers to be compensated for increasing carbon storage, boosting biodiversity and providing other environmental benefits. If implemented, this should encourage more farmers to make the switch to regenerative agriculture, says Teresa Pinto Correia, a landscape ecologist at the University of Évora in Portugal, who served on a recent EU-funded task force for regenerative agriculture.\n\n“I think it will help,” says Correia. “There’s a strong economic argument.”",

          "abstract": "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz inaugurated the new European supercomputer called JUPITER on 5 September.Credit: Ina Fassbender/AFP via Getty\n\nAs US and Chinese technology firms have competed in the race to be innovators in artificial intelligence (AI), Europe has fallen behind. But on 5 September, a European supercomputer called JUPITER officially reached the exascale threshold, a milestone in computing power. The device could boost European research.\n\nJUPITER is the fourth-fastest computer in the world. Having surpassed one quintillion (1018) operations a second, it joins an exclusive league of exascale supercomputers. According to the European Union, it is also 100% powered by renewable energy, and ranks first in energy efficiency among supercomputers.\n\nJUPITER’s computational speed serves its main purpose — to push the capabilities of research in areas such as AI, weather modelling, astrophysics and biomedical research. It gives researchers in Europe access to their own top-level supercomputer, rather than having to rely on machines in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nThe milestone is “absolutely” a big deal for Europe, says Kirk Cameron, a computer scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, particularly with regards to AI and large language models (LLMs). “There’s this race going on in the world of who will be the innovators in AI,” he says. “It’s taken a little bit to get [Europe] into the race. So it’s really nice to see them making that progress.”\n\nNature examines what JUPITER can actually do, and what it will be used for.\n\nWhat is JUPITER?\n\nJUPITER, which stands for Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research, has been in development since 2018, with the explicit aim of giving Europe a foothold in the supercomputer race taking place around the world. Funded by the European Commission and EU member Germany, it is located at the Jülich science research centre in Germany.\n\nJUPITER booted up and performed its first computations in July, says Thomas Lippert, the project lead on JUPITER at Jülich. Running on some 24,000 NVIDIA chips, JUPITER is capable of exceeding 1,000 petaflops — one exaflop, or one million trillion operations per second — at its peak performance. For comparison, a typical laptop operates at one teraflop, or one trillion calculations per second.\n\nA day in the life of the world’s fastest supercomputer\n\nOfficially, JUPITER is the fourth-fastest supercomputer in the world, with a benchmark performance of about 800 petaflops, after the United States’ El Capitan (1.7 exaflops), Frontier (1.35 exaflops) and Aurora (1 exaflop).\n\nLippert says that having a supercomputer such as JUPITER will enable Europe to develop the talent necessary to build and operate such machines in the future. “Our economy and welfare depend on these technologies,” he says.\n\nThe EU says that JUPITER “runs entirely on renewable energy” to limit its impact on the environment. Lippert says that this is achieved by paying to use only renewable energy from Germany’s national grid.\n\nWhen it is running at full load, JUPITER will use 17 megawatts of power, which is equivalent to powering about 11,000 homes. Cameron says such supercomputers can be extremely power-hungry and cause problems. “You’re competing with cities for power,” he says. “These things start to impact the infrastructure of communities around these areas.”\n\nHow will JUPITER help European research?\n\nResearchers will be able to apply to use the supercomputer up to twice a year, and 30 projects have already been selected. These include research on AI applications, such as foundation models and video generation, climate models, particle physics, energy applications and biomedical research for drug development and disease control.",

Typically founded by scholars at the beginning of their independent research careers, Young Academies give a voice to and represent the interests of young scientists in academia, helping them to be heard by national governments and wider society. There are now more than 60 Young Academies (and similar networks) worldwide.\n\nBut in 2023, a different kind of Young Academy launched in Denmark. YATSI, the Young Academy of Technology, Science and Innovation, aims to give a voice to early-career researchers and professionals in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), with representatives from both academia and industry, and also to strengthen collaboration between the two sectors.\n\nYATSI’s three founders (Sandra Wingaard Thrane, Janus Juul Eriksen Andreas Hougaard Laustsen-Kiel and Kirsten Marie Ørnsbjerg Jensen) felt there was a need for a Young Academy that focused exclusively on STEM. Thrane co-founded Bactolife, a biotechnology start-up in Copenhagen, in 2017 and is now its chief scientific officer. Eriksen is a chemistry researcher at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in Kongens Lyngby. Laustsen-Kiel leads the Center for Antibody Technologies at DTU, and is also the co-founder of eight companies. Jensen is a researcher in nanomaterials at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nCareers advice from scientists in industry\n\nYATSI now has four physical meetings a year and several ad hoc meetings across its three committees. Meetings are hosted by universities and companies, and cover topics that range from career development to STEM education and policy. Fellows are selected on the basis of written applications and in-person interviews. To be eligible, applicants must have completed a PhD (or equivalent) within the past seven years. Membership lasts for five years, and the academy is governed by a five-member council.\n\nWe hope to reach a full capacity of around 40 members by 2027 (the number is capped to optimize communication, networking and teamwork, but also to be representative of early-career STEM professionals in Denmark).\n\nOur current fellows come from six universities and nine companies or start-ups across Denmark, and have a variety of STEM backgrounds. Their specialisms encompass physics, chemistry, engineering, food, biology, information technology, cybersecurity and many more fields. There is a balanced and diverse mix of industry and academic profiles, with both Danish people and researchers from other countries who are working in Denmark. For this reason, the lingua franca of YATSI is English. Speaking as a French researcher based in Denmark, joining YATSI is a great opportunity to network with other scientists at a similar career stage. And as a member of YATSI’s Interact committee, I have helped to collate advice around effective industry–academia interactions.\n\nPolicy, Inspire, Interact\n\nYATSI has three committees. Its Policy committee aims to ensure that the voices of early-career professionals are heard in conversations around university education, research funding and personal development. The committee also highlights career opportunities in Denmark and Europe.\n\nThere is a recognized need for closer collaboration between academic science and industrial commercialization. The Policy committee is gathering support for an academia–industry sabbatical-exchange programme aimed at giving participants a better understanding of the real-world relevance of academic research and helping to ensure that industry practices are informed by state-of-the-art scientific knowledge.\n\nDenmark’s Best Science Meme is one example of how YATSI’s Inspire committee strives to engage the public, to illustrate the breadth and diversity of STEM in Denmark and to disseminate knowledge about STEM research and innovation.",

          "title": "Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies",
          "authors": "Jeff Tollefson",
          "abstract": "Climate scientists have been attributing storms, droughts and heatwaves to global warming for two decades. Now, they are tracing the chain of responsibility all the way back to the producers of fossil fuels. A study published today in Nature shows that around one-quarter of the heatwaves recorded over 2000–23 can be directly linked to greenhouse-gas emissions from individual energy giants1.\n\nDroughts, heatwaves and floods: How to tell when climate change is to blame\n\nThe findings could provide fresh evidence to support lawsuits seeking to hold companies accountable for their impacts on the climate.\n\n“I cannot as a scientist assign legal responsibilities for these events,” says lead author Yann Quilcaille, a climate researcher at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. “What I can say is that each one of these carbon majors is contributing to heatwaves, making them more intense and also making them more likely.”\n\nMore than one-quarter of the 213 events recorded would have been “virtually impossible” without human-induced global warming, the study found. The emissions linked to energy companies and other major carbon emitters increased the likelihood of some 53 heatwaves by a factor of more than 10,000.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nThis is not the first time that climate impacts have been attributed to fossil-fuel producers, but Quilcaille and his team go one step further than their predecessors and link individual companies directly to specific heatwaves. Legal experts say it’s a line of evidence that could feed into climate litigation that focuses on specific events, such as the 2021 heatwave that hammered the US Pacific Northwest in 2021. Already, a county government in Oregon has filed a US$52-billion civil lawsuit against fossil-fuel companies for contributing to that event.\n\n“This study adds to a growing but still small literature showing it’s now possible to draw causal connections between individual emitters and the hazards from climate change,” says Christopher Callahan, an Earth-system scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington, who has linked economic impacts of rising temperatures to fossil-fuel producers2. What to do with that information will be up to judges, juries, courts and politicians, he adds.\n\nMajor emissions\n\nQuilcaille and his colleagues started by assessing the historical greenhouse-gas emissions from 180 ‘carbon majors’, which include many of the largest energy corporations, as well as state-owned entities such as Saudi Arabia’s Saudi Aramco and Russia’s Gazprom (neither company responded to Nature’s requests for comment). They also tallied up the emissions from the production of cement and coal in countries such as India and China. Together, these entities account for nearly 57% of historical emissions around the globe, the study found.\n\nSummer 2025 is roasting hot: these charts show why it matters\n\nThe team used climate models to analyse global temperature trends in a world with and without greenhouse gases. It then assessed the probable impact of human-induced global warming on heatwaves recorded around the planet and attributed these to the greenhouse-gas emissions tied to each of the carbon majors (see ‘Increase in probability of heatwaves‘).\n\n“It’s a systematic approach to attribution which brings us to the next level in creating a chain of causality,” says Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Leipzig in Germany. “We absolutely can allocate blame, and we absolutely should.”",

          "title": "Global geopolitics should not stall science — 5 ways to push back",
          "authors": "James Oliver Scott Hammond, Jean-Christophe Mauduit",
          "abstract": "Pressing challenges, from the climate emergency to pandemic preparedness, demand concerted efforts at the global scale. But the growth in the use of international sanctions since the Second World War1, although mostly targeted at economic growth and military capacity, has also affected science and scientific cooperation (see ‘Science, restricted’ and Supplementary information for raw data). Many nations have suspended publicly funded collaborations with the scientific institutions of several countries, including Iran, North Korea and Russia.\n\nEven when they don’t target science specifically, sanctions hinder cross-border collaborations by increasing bureaucracy, restricting exports of equipment and financial transactions, as well as skewing where research is done2. Sanctions can also evolve rapidly, and changes in international relations can be hard to foresee, making long-term projects — such as the monitoring of changes in climate and ecosystems — difficult to sustain.\n\nAs academics focused on environmental hazards and science diplomacy, we outline five ways to help develop and maintain scientific collaborations in a world that is fragmenting geopolitically. We urge researchers, national academies, funders, universities, governments and intergovernmental agencies to work together to ensure that, when governments decide to deploy sanctions, the impact they might have on science is fully considered.\n\nSource: www.globalsanctionsdatabase.com\nSanctions stymie science\n\nWithin four days of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia more than three years ago, the International Science Council in Paris — although emphasizing that the impacts on Ukrainian scientists were the largest concern — was warning that measures against Russia could have important implications for Arctic research. This turned out to be true.\n\nThese Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertainty\n\nThe sanctions imposed on Russia have led to gaps in data underpinning global climate models3. Russia is the fourth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, and the country includes more than half of the Arctic coastline, making it one of the most important locations for monitoring changes in the climate. Funding and access restrictions mean that many Arctic data sets, such as those on wildfires, permafrost and animal migrations, are not being recorded. And even when data are collected by Russian scientists, they are often not shared with the wider community.\n\nAs a result, many researchers are pivoting to other areas of the Arctic, such as Canada or Greenland. But this change in coverage leads to biases in the data available and limits the ability of scientists to observe environmental change3. For example, the International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT), a European Union-funded project, has lost access to data from 21 Russian monitoring stations (out of a total of 94 in the region).\n\nOther fields are also affected4. In astronomy, for example, eROSITA, a German–Russian satellite observing black holes, was switched off in 2022, and CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, has halted collaboration with most Russian institutions.\n\nLessons from North Korea\n\nNorth Korea is another case in point. One of us (J.O.S.H.) has been working for 14 years with Earth scientists there — and saw at first hand how hard it can be to engage in research amid rapidly changing geopolitics and an evolving sanctions regime.\n\n‘Science saved my life’ — and it must save other at-risk scholars\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, Mount Paektu, a volcano on the border of North Korea and China (where it is known as Mount Changbai) showed signs of activity. It was responsible for one of the largest eruptions in human history5 in ad 946. In 2011, North Korean scientists invited J.O.S.H. and volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer at the University of Cambridge, UK, to visit and discuss the volcano’s unrest. Funds were sourced from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation in Washington DC, which focuses on science diplomacy.\n\nMany hurdles had to be overcome just to start the project. UK universities were reluctant to sign agreements with their North Korean counterparts, and it was hard to find out how to conduct financial transactions with and export equipment to North Korea. Help came from the UK Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, both advocates for science diplomacy (see ‘The different facets of science diplomacy’).\n\nThe different facets of science diplomacy\n\nThe interaction between science and diplomacy has historically encompassed three aspects.\n\nScience for diplomacy is the use of science to improve international relations. Scientific engagement can help to build trust and understanding between countries; for example, work by one of us (J.O.S.H.) in North Korea represents the only active bilateral project between the United Kingdom and North Korea today. Collaboration in health and environmental matters was the focus of science-diplomacy engagement between the United States and Cuba, starting in 2014 (ref. 7).\n\nThen there is diplomacy for science, in which diplomats help to facilitate scientific projects by developing funding schemes, such as Horizon Europe, or by ensuring that scientific projects can be maintained when sanctions are imposed, such as those affecting North Korea.\n\nFinally, there is science in diplomacy, the use of scientific advice to underpin foreign policy. For example, government science advisers in foreign ministries can embed scientific evidence in foreign-policy decisions on topics ranging from climate-change mitigation to protecting access to sensitive research (see go.nature.com/3jcvmrd).\n\nIn practice, none of these is easy8. Science diplomacy is entwined with national interests, and science can, at times, be used ‘transactionally’ as part of wider negotiations9 or as a stick to achieve foreign-policy goals (see go.nature.com/45phmqk). The use of sanctions, in particular those that specifically target science, is one clear example. This led the UK Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science to update their language: the more nuanced ‘diplomacy impacting science’ replaces ‘diplomacy for science’, to recognize that diplomacy can harm as well as help scientific collaboration.\n\nIn 2012, the Royal Society signed agreements with North Korean and Chinese organizations on the researchers’ behalf, and the institutions helped to communicate the importance of the project to the UK and US governments.\n\nUK policy towards North Korea is one of ‘critical engagement’. It condemns North Korea’s weapons-development programme, arms transfers and human-rights record, for example, but seeks to engage with North Korea in areas of mutual interest that can facilitate continued and consistent collaboration. In 2013, the UK and US governments decided that studying Mount Paektu would not violate the spirit of the sanctions. This offered a chance to engage in the science of a potentially large volcanic eruption, of clear interest for all sides.\n\nEven so, the collaboration was challenging to develop. For example, the UK government refused an export licence for induction coils, sensitive magnetometers that could also be used to detect submarines. The decision was a setback for a planned measurement of subsurface electrical conductivity, and the project had to be modified to a purely seismological one. In July 2013, J.O.S.H. was allowed to travel to North Korea with six seismometers and began two years of geological and geophysical fieldwork.\n\nDiplomatic support helped to bring UK volcanologists to Mount Paektu in North Korea.Credit: Clive Oppenheimer\n\nHowever, a difficult situation arose after North Korea’s nuclear test on 9 September 2016. A United Nations Security Council resolution explicitly forbade scientific collaboration with the North Korean state. This was just after the project’s first publication, which was led by North Korean scientists6, and an international conference hosted in Pyongyang designed to develop further studies of the volcano. These more-ambitious projects seemed doomed never to start.\n\nBut the resolution had two caveats: it exempted medical exchanges from the sanctions, and it gave UN member states leeway to review scientific activity with North Korea and contact the Security Council when projects did not violate the sanctions. With the UK government’s support, the second approach allowed the volcanology research to continue — which it does to this day.\n\nProtect science and scientists\n\nThe North Korean example shows that, with careful development, key scientific efforts can be maintained, even in the face of blanket sanctions. Collaborations with Russia continue where legal obligations demand it, when stopping the project would harm national interests, and in areas of science built around large infrastructure. For example, Russia is a founding member of ITER, the organization behind the nuclear-fusion reactor being built in France, and the Russian space agency is one of the operators of the International Space Station. And although CERN has decided to expel most Russian scientists unless they find new affiliations outside Russia, it maintains some collaborations with researchers at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, north of Moscow.",

          "title": "Using biobanks to boost research: a how-to guide",
          "authors": "Jyoti Madhusoodanan",
          "abstract": "Rafaella Rogatto De Faria was nearing the end of her PhD when her adviser proposed a fresh project. The idea was to analyse genetic, imaging and surgical-outcome data, to find biomarkers that could help to identify which people with osteoarthritis would respond best to knee-replacement surgery. De Faria, an athlete and a biomedical engineer at the University of São Paulo, Brazil, knew the profound impact of cartilage and joint injuries on people’s lives, and stayed on to pursue the project after she defended her PhD in July 2024.\n\nShe and her colleagues began by gathering data from people being treated for osteoarthritis at the university. The team has a cohort of 200 individuals so far, with data gathered over the past two years. “We are actually creating our own biobank,” De Faria says. “We don’t have this yet here.”\n\nBut the team also wanted to validate its results against a larger data set. Colleagues suggested looking to the UK Biobank, a collection of images, clinical and genetic data and physical samples from 500,000 individuals in the United Kingdom, some of whom have been studied since 2006. Within a few months of applying for access, De Faria had at her fingertips data from 40,000 people with osteoarthritis, half of whom had undergone total-knee-replacement surgeries. That’s a 200-fold increase over her original cohort. “The data were exactly what we were needing,” De Faria says.\n\nMy moonshot to preserve endangered species\n\nDe Faria’s data needs are not unique. Around the world, researchers studying human health often find themselves in need of more, and more-diverse, samples. They could try to collect them themselves or track down existing samples by contacting researchers in the same field of study. Alternatively, they could reach out to entities that have been specifically created to share these resources: biobanks.\n\nBiobanks range in size from the scale of a single laboratory, such as the collection that De Faria and her adviser started, to that of the UK Biobank, one of the world’s largest such collections. Most contain both data and physical samples that researchers can request for their studies. And although some smaller banks aim to serve researchers at a single institution, large-scale initiatives such as the UK Biobank, the Mexico City Prospective Study and the All of Us initiative by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are designed to meet the needs of the global research community.\n\nFor many researchers, biobanks can mean the difference between a successful project and one that stalls for want of crucial data. Yet most biobanks are underutilized, with some surveys suggesting that less than 10% of banked samples get used, says health-policy researcher Amanda Rush at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nIn planning a biobank-enhanced project, researchers must weigh the pros and cons of creating their own collection of samples and data against the support that larger, existing biobanks can offer. They must also factor in practical considerations such as cost, data security and the legalities of shipping biological materials, Rush says.\n\nAnd then there are the more strategic considerations. Some projects might be best served by having a large number of samples, but others might benefit from a bespoke collection that offers richer metadata for each specimen, Rush says. There are different scenarios for which each of these biobanks “comes to the fore”, she says.\n\nRoots of biobanks\n\nBiobanking as an enterprise stems from technological advances that began in the late 1980s, says Peter Watson, who leads biobanking services at BC Cancer Research, a research institute in Vancouver, Canada. Speedier DNA-sequencing technologies, faster computing and larger, more powerful databases meant that biological data could be collected and reused endlessly. But efforts to create repositories of data and samples were mostly siloed and ad hoc. “It was just sort of individual efforts in different institutions,” he says.\n\nThese genes can have the opposite effects depending on which parent they came from\n\nAs a graduate student studying rare paediatric tumours in the early 1990s, Jennifer Byrne and her adviser relied heavily on tissues that had been surgically removed. The specimens were often large — on one occasion, Byrne remembers rushing to the hospital to receive a grapefruit-sized sample — and patients donated them in the hope that others with the same disease would benefit. “There were no cell lines for those cancer types, so we had to study human material,” says Byrne, who is now a molecular oncologist at the University of Sydney. The result was effectively a biobank, “but we didn’t even really realize that we were doing that”.\n\nAlthough samples gathered in this way are not freely available, because of issues around consent, researchers who can demonstrate funding and ethical approval can approach the custodians for collaborations, Byrne says.\n\nThis pathway for external investigators to tap into a collection is what separates a biobank from a stash in a lab freezer, Byrne says. “Biobanks are designed to be reused for different purposes, by different people.”\n\nA UK Biobank researcher handles frozen samples.Credit: David Guttridge/UK Biobank\n\nUnderstanding the access policies early on is crucial to success, she adds. “Do they provide samples to anybody, or are they largely set up to serve the needs of a single network of researchers?” Finding smaller biobanks, with more-restricted access, can be tricky because they are generally not well advertised. In 2016, Byrne and her colleagues created a biobank registry for the Australian state of New South Wales, allowing researchers to find information about resources in their area and register their own biobanks (https://nsw.biobanking.org).\n\nThe Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) has taken a similar approach, curating several disease-specific collections created by individual RCSI researchers into an institutional biobanking service at its headquarters in Dublin. The biobank streamlines the process of donor consent for samples to be used in research. Researchers who wish to contribute samples can ask to have their own collections added, and would-be collaborators can apply to use the materials or data. But the clinicians who gathered the samples remain closely involved in their use.\n\nIndeed, researchers wanting to access the materials or data should plan on collaborations rather than treating the biobank purely as a vault to extract information, says RCSI geneticist Gianpiero Cavalleri. “We want it to be used as much as possible,” Cavalleri says. “But the typical access model is in collaboration with the investigator.”\n\nScaling up\n\nDespite the intent to share, tapping into a restricted-access biobank can be challenging for many researchers, Rush says. Shipping can be up to US$50 per sample, meaning it could cost thousands of dollars to acquire enough material for a large study. Furthermore, the complex legal and other agreements required to transport biological samples or share data securely can stymie early-career researchers or those without large pots of funding. Turning to larger biobanks can help to surmount these barriers, because they might have systems in place to help with the logistics.\n\nAmbitious survey of human diversity yields millions of undiscovered genetic variants\n\nAnother consideration, says clinical researcher Alex Chaitoff at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, is the breadth of samples available. For his work, Chaitoff often uses large databases, such as the NIH All of Us biobank and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This is the only national US health database that includes health and nutrition information for people of all ages, with roughly 5,000 participants added each year. These data sources “are much more likely to be nationally representative”, Chaitoff says. All of Us is especially valuable, he adds, because it includes groups that have been historically excluded from scientific research, such as Native American communities (The All of Us Research Program Genomics Investigators. Nature 627, 340–346; 2024). “They oversample populations that are generally undersampled in research,” he says.\n\nGaining access\n\nOnce researchers find a biobank with the data that they need, they must navigate issues around access — and payment.\n\nDuniel Delgado Castillo, a biomedical engineer at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, was combing through the research literature on physical changes in the brains of people with long COVID when he stumbled across a trove of brain images that he desperately needed. Castillo had already tried, with little success, to reach out to the authors of various studies to access their image collections. By comparison, the resource he discovered, part of the UK Biobank, was much larger, easier to access and seemed to have exactly what he was looking for.\n\nEstonians gave their DNA to science — now they’re learning their genetic secrets\n\nHe applied for access early in 2024. Although the initial application suggested there would be a fee in the £3,000–£9,000 (US$4,000–$12,000) range for three years of access, the biobank offered him a grant to cover the costs. Within months, he was working with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 1,000 participants, half of whom had long COVID; the other half were matched controls. “If I didn’t have those images, it would be impossible to continue with my investigation,” Castillo says.\n\nData from the UK Biobank can be used only within its own secure cloud-computing service, the Research Analysis Platform. It includes tools to analyse genomic and translational data, perform statistical analyses on images and other data types, as well as providing machine-learning tools that can be accessed using JupyterLab, an open-source data-science system.\n\nTraining to use the biobank’s secure computing space was easy, Castillo and De Faria say. And trying to recreate it on their institutional systems would have been cumbersome and expensive, Castillo adds. “It was a relief for me because all the security of the data is built into the Research Analysis Platform,” he says. “I don’t have to worry about it.”\n\nWorld’s biggest set of human genome sequences opens to scientists",

          "title": "Can a bold ‘social contract’ make data sharing more palatable?",
          "authors": "Nchangwi Syntia Munung, Cornelius Ewuoso, Francis E. Agamah, Emile R. Chimusa",
          "abstract": "The past decade has seen swathes of biomedical data collected across Africa1,2. These include, for example, demographic, health and environmental data from the INDEPTH Network, which is revealing links between climate change and disease; and information about genetic diversity and disease risk factors in African populations from the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative. But the promise that these and other data sets hold for improving health care and scientific innovation is at risk of being squandered, unless the data can be made more accessible.\n\nAs a group of African bioethics and data-science researchers with expertise in bioinformatics, genomics and decolonization of health research, we are well aware of these challenges in African data science. Consider the H3Africa initiative, which between 2010 and 2022 ran 51 projects aiming to improve health in Africa, funded by the US National Institutes of Health and the UK biomedical funder Wellcome. The projects ranged from studying the genomics of schizophrenia in the Xhosa people of South Africa to analysing how microorganisms in the nasal passages affect respiratory disease in African children. The H3Africa initiative overall has generated almost 1,000 whole-genome sequences and information about the traits they encode from at least 50 ethnolinguistic groups3. But in some cases, difficulties with logistics, costs and infrastructure led to delays in data collection, which in turn prevented groups from depositing their data before funding expired.\n\nHow to meet Africa’s grand challenges with African know-how\n\nMany Africa-based researchers seem to prefer sharing data informally with trusted peers or as part of projects or collaborations on grant applications, rather than securing them formally from a repository4–7. For example, data from 23,421 biological samples collected across 16 H3Africa studies can be accessed through requests to a data and biospecimen access committee. But, according to one study4, the committee received just 28 data-access requests between December 2018 and June 2023, of which only 6 came from Africa. Of the remainder, 20 were from the United States, United Kingdom and Europe combined, one came from Asia and one from South America.\n\nHere, we set out how such data hoarding can be combated by developing a ‘social contract’ for responsible data stewardship. This will require building up trust between researchers, commercial partners, governments, funders and the public by providing guarantees that data will be used in the best interests of African researchers, communities and research participants.\n\nHoarding habit\n\nData sharing is not an ingrained habit in most African countries. Many researchers are wary. For example, in a 2019 survey of 129 postgraduate students and researchers at South African universities, roughly three-quarters said that they would be happy to use external data sets for their research, yet only half would consider sharing their data5. Scientists in other African nations show similar attitudes6,7.\n\nAccording to surveys, reasons include fears about research ideas being scooped and about inadequate reward systems for sharers6,8 — as is the case elsewhere. But, in Africa, much of this reluctance can be traced back to historical and structural factors.\n\nAfrican nations too often lack control over what happens to the data they generate. Research into HIV/AIDS, for instance, has been led by teams in a few countries, such as Kenya, Uganda, Cameroon and South Africa, that are supported by institutions in high-income nations. These collaborations, although valuable, expose a deep power imbalance — decisions about data storage, secondary use and long-term access frequently rest with the partners outside Africa.\n\nSimilarly, digital health platforms on mobile devices that aim to improve maternal health care, vaccine tracking and infectious-disease surveillance across Africa — often introduced by international non-governmental organizations and technology companies — typically rely on cloud-based data-storage infrastructure hosted by foreign firms (see go.nature.com/4g2tz2h). There are few safeguards to ensure that governments or communities in Africa retain meaningful oversight of the data.\n\nOpen science, done wrong, will compound inequities\n\nEven flagship programmes that were designed to empower African science can fall short. Consortia such as H3Africa and the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network have built genomics capacities on the continent and have invested in the development of equitable data-sharing policies. But both store data in public repositories outside Africa — leading to the risk that Africa remains a data donor rather than a data power.\n\nTechnical limitations can also encourage data hoarding. Africa holds less than 1% of the global infrastructure capacity for digital data. Much of this infrastructure is concentrated in a few institutions in South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya, with others lacking the means to manage, store and share data in ways that comply with the requirements of research funders, or with evolving national and international regulatory standards. And there is often a lack of staff trained in data management and analytics across African scientific institutions.\n\nThese weaknesses can lead researchers in Africa to conclude that there are limited benefits to sharing data. Added to this are worries about legal compliance if researchers need to deposit data outside their own country, as well as the risks of their research being scooped by other scientists who have more resources — African or international — if the data are made public.\n\nData hoarding might be exacerbated by requirements for informed consent and evolving data-protection laws. In many African countries, such laws emphasize the principles of specifying a purpose for the data, limiting its storage, adhering to data minimization (collecting, processing and storing only those data that are necessary for the defined purpose) and giving participating individuals the right to restrict processing and have autonomy over their health and genetic data9. Although some of the laws include exceptions for scientific research, these are often defined ambiguously. This ethical and legal uncertainty can lead to researchers not sharing data — even if research participants give broad consent for their data to be shared — for fear of breaching legal requirements. This is a particular problem in the absence of clear mechanisms for participants to withdraw consent or to provide consent for secondary uses.\n\nA social contract\n\nThere are signs that attitudes are shifting. A 2022 survey of 160 scientists engaged in data-intensive research in Africa showed that 88% would be willing to share data, provided there were robust governance mechanisms in place7. Respondents also said they would exchange data if there were opportunities for tangible benefits such as co-authorship (87%), shared royalties (53%) and collaboration on projects (78%).\n\nWhat is needed now is a system-wide move towards responsible data stewardship that takes these expectations into account. In our view, trust can best be gained by establishing a ‘social contract’ in which data sharing becomes the collective responsibility of researchers, study communities, funders and research institutions. A social contract frames data sharing not simply as a mandate from funders, but as a moral and social commitment to equity, transparency, shared responsibility and shared benefit. Similar thinking was behind the development of the Bermuda principles for DNA sequence data sharing10 and the Fort Lauderdale Agreement11, which laid the foundations of the importance of open data sharing in genomics.\n\nSaliva samples in a tuberculosis research laboratory in Benin.Credit: Yanick Folly/AFP/Getty\n\nThe social contract we propose involves four strands that together define an ethical and operational framework for using data.\n\nClear commitments to sharing and rewards. All funders should demand plans for data sharing as a part of grant proposals. They should follow up to ensure that researchers can and do share data. When institutional infrastructure is lacking, funders could offer technical support or conditional infrastructure grants to enable compliance. They should also introduce clear accountability measures, including funding restrictions or ineligibility for future grants, for individuals or institutions that consistently fail to share data without adequate justification. Commercial and international partners should also commit to data sharing in collaboration agreements.\n\nUniversities and other research institutions should consider data-sharing practices as part of their promotion criteria, as they do with publication and teaching metrics. This could extend to criteria for world university rankings, such as those generated by Times Higher Education and QS, which could incorporate open-science and data-sharing metrics to encourage institutional leaders to take the practice seriously.\n\nBenefit-sharing agreements. Academic, commercial and community partners in data-science projects should together agree on fair benefit-sharing mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, such agreements are rare in commercial collaborations involving African research data, and formal mechanisms for equitable returns are lacking12. For instance, if academics in Africa collaborate with international partners, they might agree to technology-transfer mechanisms, such as capacity-building programmes or investments in setting up and maintaining secure data infrastructure in Africa.\n\nCollaborations with commercial entities might involve a commitment that any diagnostics, treatments and tools developed using African data are made available to African communities at fair prices. Revenue-sharing agreements could ensure that African researchers (and, where appropriate, communities) receive a share of profits for any commercial products developed using their data. And social-investment clauses, such as contractual commitments that require reinvestment of a percentage of revenue into local scientific infrastructure or public health, could help to build long-term sustainability and public trust in science.\n\nInteroperability. Data-science funders and governments should invest in making data systems interoperable, which would enhance collaboration across borders and between institutions. Some efforts to do this are already under way.\n\nThe Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa initiative, for instance, is working to develop an interoperable open-data science platform called eLwazi. The initiative hosts training workshops and is developing a data catalogue to help ensure that clinical, climate and genomics data sets in research projects in Africa adhere to FAIR data principles (meaning that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).",

          "authors": "Ryan Nolan",
          "abstract": "Becoming Nature Positive: Transitioning to a Safe and Just Future Edited by Peter Vanham, Ross Chainey and Gemma Parkes Routledge (2025)\n\nAs biodiversity loss accelerates alongside the climate crisis, businesses are increasingly recognizing their role in both causing and potentially solving this planetary emergency. The scale of the problem is stark: humans and our livestock now make up around 96% of all land-based mammal biomass, leaving just 4% for the world’s remaining wild species. But progress in combating such losses remains too slow.\n\nBecoming Nature Positive offers an ambitious, timely and comprehensive guide for organizations seeking not only to reduce harms but also to regenerate nature in an active way. With more than two dozen contributors, this volume provides both theoretical grounding and practical strategies. It comes at a crucial time, as the world is working out how to meet the goal of the 2022 Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030.\n\nEnvironmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories\n\nIn the opening sections, Marco Lambertini, convenor of the Nature Positive Initiative and former director-general of WWF, the conservation group headquartered in Gland, Switzerland, traces the story of the ‘nature positive’ movement. This growing global community is committed to doing more than halting and reversing biodiversity loss: its aim is that, by 2030, the world has more nature than it did in 2020 and, by 2050, all ecosystems will have recovered.\n\nLambertini charts the movement’s emergence through early United Nations initiatives, such as the Decade on Biodiversity in the 2010s, through to the pivotal 2019 meetings in Davos, Switzerland, leading to biodiversity loss appearing as a top-ten issue for the first time in the 2020 World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report. The adoption of the 30% goal under the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2022 was a step as groundbreaking for nature as the 2015 Paris climate agreement was for climate.\n\nBut much remains to be done, as global assessments continue to show. The UN Environment Programme’s 2024 Protected Planet Report (see go.nature.com/3hc330h) reveals that 17.6% of land and 8.4% of ocean areas are now protected — an increase since 2020 that is equivalent to twice Colombia’s size. But to meet the target, this still leaves areas the size of Brazil and Australia combined on land, and an area larger than the Indian Ocean at sea, requiring protected designation by 2030.\n\nPragmatic solutions\n\nWhat distinguishes this compilation from many others is its refusal to promise simple solutions, instead acknowledging the complexity and scale of change required across business, finance, policy and society at large.\n\nThe book’s honest assessment of implementation barriers is particularly valuable. The authors acknowledge that, despite increasing corporate commitments, large gaps remain between rhetoric and action. By 2021, only 10% of firms in the Fortune 100 list of top US companies by revenue had specific, measurable, time-bound biodiversity targets. That’s twice as many as in 2016, but progress is much too slow (S. O. S. E. zu Ermgassen et al. J. Clean. Prod. 379, 134798 (2022); see also go.nature.com/47vfnw3).\n\nExamples of what can work are offered in Eva Zabey’s excellent chapter on business engagement. As chief executive of Business for Nature, a business coalition driving nature-positive action on the global stage, Zabey provides an insider’s perspective on the corporate awakening to biodiversity issues. She goes beyond categorizing businesses as either part of the problem or part of the solution, to explore the nuanced reality of different business types.\n\nThe peaks of Cuernos del Paine in the Torres del Paine National Park in Chile.Credit: Marco Bottigelli/Getty\n\nLarge companies, for instance, have the resources, scale and reach through their supply chains to drive significant environmental gains quickly, if they integrate nature-positive practices into their core strategies. Smaller firms can be more agile, piloting innovative approaches and influencing local economies and communities.\n\nPurpose-led businesses often set ambitious standards and lead by example, whereas profit-driven firms can shift entire markets when regulations and incentives align. Some companies will transform their value chains and set global benchmarks. Others will pioneer innovative business models or foster grassroots change. Zabey makes clear that actions from all types of company are needed to move the nature needle in the right direction.\n\nWhy the green-technology race might not save the planet\n\nZabey also demonstrates how language enables, as well as shapes, action. Her discussion of how concepts such as natural capital (the value of everything that comes from the natural world) and ecosystem services (the direct benefits people receive from nature, including fresh air to breathe) have enabled business participation is insightful.\n\nSuch terms translate matters of ecological concern into economic and managerial language that resonates with corporate decision makers. Similarly, framing a wetland as ‘flood protection infrastructure’ recasts the natural world as an asset class or service provider, and thus makes it easier to integrate biodiversity into business models, investment decisions and policy frameworks.\n\nClear thinking\n\nIndeed, competing definitions of nature positive have been a challenge, creating a blind spot in which businesses and policymakers can talk past each other or measure progress differently. Some businesses focus on reducing harms, others on restoration, and yet others consider a more general sustainability agenda. Such confusion elevates the risk of ‘greenwashing’, in which companies portray themselves as acting on sustainability when they are, in fact, doing little. It paints an unclear picture for those setting policy agendas and misses opportunities for collaboration.",

But, over the past decade, those songs have helped scientists to fathom some of the biggest, strangest and most powerful events in the Universe.\n\nAlmost exactly ten years ago, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) became the first detector to ‘hear’ gravitational waves: ripples that waft through the fabric of space-time after being unleashed by the Universe’s most-violent collisions. The first detection, on 14 September 2015, recorded the tune sung by two black holes coalescing into one, and it confirmed Albert Einstein’s prediction that such gravitational waves exist. Now, LIGO, alongside other detectors, has detected some 300 gravitational-wave events, including one announced today that supports a theorem by cosmologist Stephen Hawking in the 1970s.\n\nAt each of LIGO’s twin installations — in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington — laser beams bounce down two arms, arranged in an L shape, that are each 4 kilometres long. A hairsbreadth misalignment of the beams indicates a squeezing and stretching of space-time, which registers as a wave on a computer read-out. When rendered as an audible sound, the wave resembles a bird’s chirp.\n\nTo celebrate LIGO’s first decade of discoveries, Nature asked gravitational-wave researchers about their favourite detections so far. Here are LIGO’s greatest hits, according to specialists.\n\nThe ring tone\n\nReported today in Physical Review Letters1, LIGO’s latest finding stems from the clearest gravitational-wave signal yet.\n\nAs the telltale signs of a gravitational wave on 14 January emerged from the noise of LIGO’s observations, researchers listened to two black holes fusing together. This time, however, they could also detect the vibrations produced by the single black hole spawned by the collision.\n\nA technician inspects one of LIGO’s mirrors.Credit: Caltech/MIT/LIGO Lab/Matt Heintze\n\nTypically, it’s difficult to pick out this ‘ringdown’ from the merger itself. But thanks to the ten years spent fine-tuning LIGO’s instruments, scientists made their most-sensitive measurements so far.\n\nAnalysis of the ringdown showed that the two parent black holes, which had a combined surface area of 240,000 square kilometres, birthed a much larger one, with a surface area of 400,000 square kilometres. The clear increase in size lends more credence to Hawking’s black-hole-area theorem, which posits that the surface areas of these bodies can never decrease. Although Hawking died before he could witness this confirmation, he said in 2016 that he thought LIGO would be capable of such a feat.\n\nThis detection will quickly “become one of my favourites”, says David Reitze, executive director of the LIGO laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “It was the perfect ten-year anniversary gift,” adds his colleague Katerina Chatziioannou, a LIGO physicist.\n\nThe first chirp\n\nLIGO began operations in 2002, but it wasn’t until after an upgrade that wrapped up in 2015 that it picked up the first-ever murmurs of a gravitational-wave event. And it was an event, indeed. After five months of checking repeatedly that the signal wasn’t just background noise or a fake chirp, planted to test the detector, researchers announced their discovery with much jubilation at press conferences around the world. For the first time, scientists had proved that they could “listen to the thundering cosmos”, says Reitze, “even though the thunder was a tiny little blip by the time it got to Earth”.\n\nRainer Weiss (centre) and Kip Thorne (right), who were among the co-founders of LIGO, attend the 2016 news conference when scientists announced that the observatory had become the first to detect a gravitational wave.Credit: Gary Cameron/Reuters\n\nThat blip came from a black-hole merger 1.3 billion years ago2. That was how long it took for the collision’s subsequent ripples in space-time to cascade all the way to Earth. The detection “was the first observational evidence for the existence of binary black-hole systems”, the pairs of black holes that produce these cosmic crashes, says Gabriela González, a physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and LIGO’s spokesperson at the time of the discovery.\n\nThe detection won the 2017 Nobel Prize for confirming the century-old prediction of gravitational waves from Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Einstein got one thing wrong, however: he thought gravitational waves would never actually be detected.\n\nThe light show\n\nMere seconds after LIGO felt the rumble of a gravitational-wave event on 17 August 2017, NASA’s Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope spotted a flash of high-energy photons 40 million parsecs away. The two detections were anything but a coincidence.",

The publishers also found that less than 25% of authors disclosed their use of AI to prepare manuscripts, despite the publisher mandating disclosure for submission.\n\nTo screen manuscripts for signs of AI use, the AACR used an AI tool that was developed by Pangram Labs, based in New York City. When applied to 46,500 abstracts, 46,021 methods sections and 29,544 peer-review comments submitted to 10 AACR journals between 2021 and 2024, the tool flagged a rise in suspected AI-generated text in submissions and review reports since the public release of OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022.\n\n“We were shocked when we saw the Pangram results,” says Daniel Evanko, the AACR’s director of journal operations and systems, who presented the findings at the 10th International Congress on Peer Review and Scientific Publications in Chicago, Illinois, on 3 September.\n\nThe analysis found that AI-generated text in peer-review reports dropped by 50% in late 2023, after the AACR banned peer reviewers from using LLMs. But detections of AI-generated text in peer-review comments more than doubled by early 2024 and continued to climb.\n\nIt “was disconcerting to see people increasing the usage of LLMs for peer review in spite of us prohibiting that usage”, says Evanko. He adds that “our intention is definitely to start screening all incoming manuscripts and all incoming peer review comments”.\n\nThe tool “seems to work exceptionally well”, says Adam Day, founder of Clear Skies, a London-based research-integrity firm. However, “there may be bias that we’re not seeing regarding false positive rate, and we should be mindful of that”, he adds.\n\n99.85% accurate\n\nPangram was trained on 28 million human-written documents from before 2021, including 3 million scientific papers, as well as ‘AI mirrors’ — LLM-generated texts that mimic human-written passages in length, style and tone.\n\nMax Spero, chief executive officer of Pangram Labs, says that adding an active-learning mode to Pangram was “one of the breakthroughs” that enabled it to reduce the false-positive rate — the share of texts incorrectly flagged as being AI-written. He and his team repeatedly retrained the tool, which “reduced our false-positive rate from about one in 100 to about one in 10,000”, he says.\n\n‘AI models are capable of novel research’: OpenAI’s chief scientist on what to expect\n\nIn a preprint posted last year1, Spero and his colleagues showed that Pangram’s accuracy was 99.85%, with error rates 38 times lower than those of other currently available AI-detection tools.\n\nTesting the AI-detection tool on manuscripts before ChatGPT was released in November 2022, it flagged only seven abstracts and no methods or peer-review reports as containing potentially AI-generated text. “From there on, the detections just increased linearly and at what we would think is a very high rate,” says Evanko.\n\nThe tool can also distinguish between different LLMs, including ChatGPT models, DeepSeek, LLaMa and Claude. “We’re only able to do this because we’ve generated our entire training set ourselves, so we know the exact provenance, we know what model the training data came from,” explains Spero.\n\nThe current model of Pangram cannot distinguish between passages that are fully generated by AI and those that are written by humans but edited using AI.\n\nLanguage aid\n\nThe AACR used Pangram to analyse submissions in 2024 that included 11,959 abstracts, 11,875 methods sections and 7,211 peer-review reports.\n\nTheir analysis found that authors at institutions in countries where English is not a native language were more than twice as likely to use LLMs.\n\n“I was personally shocked at just how high the usage was in the methods,” says Evanko. “Asking an LLM to improve the language of the methods section could introduce errors … because those details need to be exact in terms of how you did something and if you rephrase something, it might not be correct any more,” he adds.",

The work is unusual in separating out how hunger and a food’s sensory qualities affect food consumption, he says, and demonstrates that a single brain region integrates a range of signals to drive consumption.\n\nThe bitter with the sweet\n\nFood intake is influenced by roughly a dozen brain regions. These areas gather information on various factors that together drive our appetite for something and how likely we are to consume it. A person with low salt levels might crave a salty snack, for example, but decline something bitter. In 2019, researchers suggested that all of these stimuli might be funnelled into a brain region called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)2, but it remained unclear what exactly was happening inside.\n\nCharles Zuker, a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York City, and his team wanted to trace the brain circuits involved in an animal’s response to tastes. The researchers began by characterizing neurons that become active when a mouse tastes something sweet. In the central amygdala and hypothalamus, they found sweet-detection neurons with branches that link to neurons in the BNST.\n\nHow we taste sweetness: long-sought structure of human receptor mapped at last\n\nWhen the scientists silenced those BNST neurons, the animals lost their interest in sugar even when hungry, and largely ceased to eat. The researchers also activated those BNST neurons in mice that had recently been fed and so shouldn’t seek out food. Nevertheless, the activation prompted the mice to ingest all kinds of things: water (a neutral substance they would typically ignore unless thirsty), salt, fat, bitter substances and even plastic pellets.\n\nCollectively, these and other results “tell us that the BNST is functioning as something of a master ‘dial’ with bidirectional control”, Zuker says. “If we can figure out how to turn that dial, it would give us some influence over things like body weight.”",

          "authors": "Dan Garisto, Max Kozlov, Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "When US President Donald Trump’s administration started slashing science funding in January, Nicole Maphis wasn’t especially worried about her research being affected. She studies the fundamental biology of Alzheimer’s disease, which didn’t strike her as a probable target.\n\nThe change in leadership came at a pivotal time for Maphis: she was finishing her postdoctoral studies at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and seeking a highly competitive grant from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The grant aims to increase diversity in life sciences, and Maphis was eligible as a woman from a family with a low income. The funding, she hoped, would launch her into an independent role as a professor.\n\nThe trouble started in February. First, the funding opportunity to which she had applied disappeared. Then, a staff member at the NIH informed her that her proposal had been pulled from consideration. “I’ve never cried more as a scientist than in the last six months. To hear the NIH staff member say, ‘I’m so sorry but your application has been moved’, to what is essentially the trash, makes it seem that everything you’re doing is worthless,” Maphis says.\n\nUS Supreme Court allows NIH to cut $2 billion in research grant\n\nShe had become ensnared in Trump’s war on anything with a connection to diversity, equity and inclusion. Maphis has been joined by thousands of other scientists who have been forced to halt their work as the administration continues to purge funding for science that doesn’t align with its ideological road map. This includes research on climate change, COVID-19, RNA vaccines, the spread of misinformation and the health of women and people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+).\n\nBut Maphis and other scientists are fighting back against the administration. Some, like her, are suing to reinstate grants. Some are collecting information about the budgetary carnage to keep a record of the administration’s actions and to help in lawsuits. Others are trying to spread the word about the damage that is being done, either publicly or secretly, often risking their own careers in the process.\n\nNature talked to several people who are leading the fight to reinstate funding, retain knowledge and protect institutions such as the NIH and the US National Science Foundation (NSF), two of the largest sources of public funding for basic research in the world. “We’ll have nothing left at the NIH if people don’t speak out about this,” says one staff member at the agency, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nDay in court\n\nMaphis dreamt big as an undergraduate. She wanted to develop a vaccine against Alzheimer’s disease. Although it seemed far-fetched at the time, a decade later, she and her colleagues developed a candidate with promising results in mice and non-human primates. It can clear protein tangles, which are known to be linked to the disease, from the brain and it seems to improve cognitive function in the animals (N. M. Maphis et al. Alzheimers Dement. 21, e70101; 2025).\n\nWatching her grandmother slowly succumb to the illness years ago was a big motivator for her research. “I haven’t been able to move away from it, knowing that there could be these modifiable risk factors that we’re not studying,” she says.\n\nAfter her funding was put on pause, she sprang into action and joined the local chapter of Stand Up for Science, a non-profit organization that aims to combat the Trump administration’s policy and funding changes to the scientific enterprise. With this group, she led a middle-school science outreach programme for girls, wrote an opinion piece in her local newspaper and led a protest.\n\nIn March, Maphis heard word about a brewing lawsuit. She thought she had little to lose: “My career is already ruined, so I might as well do something about it,” she says. She reached out to the attorneys to explain her situation and joined the case when they filed suit in early April.\n\nThe case captured wide attention in June, when judge William Young at the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Boston ordered that hundreds of terminated research projects at the NIH be reinstated. He called the explanations that led to their cancellation “bereft of reasoning — virtually, in their entirety”, and he excoriated the Trump administration for what he saw as clear discrimination against racial, sexual and gender minorities. A spokesperson for the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), said at the time that the agency “stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigour and meaningful outcomes for the American people”.\n\nCan NIH-funded research on racism and health survive Trump’s cuts?\n\nIn late August, the US Supreme Court put a key part of Young’s ruling on hold, allowing the administration to cancel up to US$2 billion in funding that had been on the chopping block.\n\nThis case will continue, along with several others by states, associations and individual scientists. In June, Nell Green Nylen, a specialist in water law and policy at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, filed a class-action lawsuit alongside several of her UC colleagues, alleging that the Trump administration has improperly cut research projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The fact that scientists, and not school administrators, are leading the push is meaningful, Green Nylen says. “It feels really important for us that there was something we could do as researchers to fight back and to make a difference for ourselves.”\n\nGovernment scientists have been involved in these legal battles, too — behind the scenes. They have been exercising their whistle-blower rights by telling congressional officials, attorneys and reporters what is happening inside federal agencies, such as violations of long-standing policies and procedures that were put in place to maintain scientific integrity. Such concerns led one NIH programme official, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, to take action.\n\nThey recall the precise day the NIH began to terminate grants: 28 February. “That was a crystallizing moment,” they say. “We all took an oath to the constitution to protect from enemies foreign or domestic — so I had to get in touch with those who had power to stop some of this.”\n\nData dredgers\n\nOne challenge in raising these cases against the government is that the extent of grant terminations, and the processes used to accomplish them, have been opaque. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), initially led by billionaire Elon Musk, was behind many of the cuts, and the chaotic way in which agencies were responding to its demands have made it difficult to track which funds the government cut and why.\n\nNoam Ross co-founded Grant Witness to collect and collate information on cancelled funding.Credit: Shuran Huang for Nature\n\nNoam Ross was familiar with the struggle to get information from hard-to-access government databases — what he calls “stubborn systems”. Ross, a computational ecologist and the executive director of rOpenSci, a non-profit initiative that aims to improve data accessibility in science, wondered if there was a way he could document which NIH grants were being terminated. He noticed that the few known terminations had all received modifications in an HHS system called TAGGS, short for Tracking Accountability in Government Grants System. Using these modifications as a proxy, Ross started logging terminated grants in a spreadsheet that he created with Anthony Barente, a data scientist at the pharmaceutical company Bristol Myers Squibb in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn March, Scott Delaney, an environmental epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, began crowdsourcing information for a similar spreadsheet of terminated grants. “It was explicitly an effort to organize, to advocate, and then for me personally, to support litigation,” says Delaney, a former lawyer.\n\nLater that month, Ross and Delaney joined forces to create what is now known as Grant Witness, a project to track the termination of grants. By early April, they had a spreadsheet with hundreds of grants listed. The database, and others like it, proved invaluable for reporters, activists and politicians who were trying to understand what was happening at the NIH. Weeks later, the pair expanded their efforts to include NSF grant terminations. Using data-dredging skills and crowdsourced reports, they pieced together a catalogue of cuts including detailed information about spending, down to the congressional district.\n\nWith a detailed database, it has been easier to show that the government disproportionately targeted research that could benefit women, or those from LGBTQ+ and minority ethnic groups. Judge Young mentioned the work of Grant Witness as the case against the Trump administration proceeded.\n\nScott Delaney tracks terminated research grants.Credit: Sophie Park for Nature\n\nGovernment workers, again, have been part of the effort to track cancelled research grants. Shortly after DOGE was established at the NSF, hundreds were slated for termination. It was “scientifically meritorious work that’s being pulled back for partisan political reasons”, says one staff member at that agency. But information was limited. “It wasn’t really being tracked at all,” another NSF worker says. A spokesperson for the NSF declined to comment for this article.\n\nStaff at the NSF banded together, looking for ways to collect data on terminated grants and make them public. Their tracking effort informed Ross and Delaney’s and helped to emphasize who was being targeted at the NSF. Although men receive around 60% of grants provided by the agency, 60% of the terminations were made to grants held by women.\n\nAbout a month after the first terminations, the NSF published its own official list of cut grants. “I’m glad the NSF published the list,” says one staff member. “They should have done that to begin with.”\n\nGetting the word out\n\nLegal battles and data collection might not be enough if the public doesn’t care about the science that is being defunded. Many researchers noticed that the public’s perception of science was shifting well before Trump’s re-election.",

          "title": "Can researchers stop AI making up citations?",
          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "OpenAI says GPT-5 has reduced the frequency of fake citations and other kinds of hallucination.Credit: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP via Getty\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) models are known to confidently conjure up fake citations. When the company OpenAI released GPT-5, a suite of large language models (LLMs), last month, it said it had reduced the frequency of fake citations and other kinds of ‘hallucination’, as well as ‘deceptions’, whereby an AI claims to have performed a task it hasn’t.\n\nWith GPT-5, OpenAI, based in San Francisco, California, is bucking an industry-wide trend, because newer AI models designed to mimic human reasoning tend to generate more hallucinations than do their predecessors. On a benchmark that tests a model’s ability to produce citation-based responses, GPT-5 beat its predecessors. But hallucinations remain inevitable, because of how LLMs function.\n\n“For most cases of hallucination, the rate has dropped to a level” that seems to be “acceptable to users”, says Tianyang Xu, an AI researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. But in particularly technical fields, such as law and mathematics, GPT-5 is still likely to struggle, she says. And despite the improvements in hallucination rate, users quickly found that the model errs in basic tasks, such as creating an illustrated timeline of US presidents.\n\nOpenAI is making “small steps that are good, but I don’t think we’re anywhere near where we need to be”, says Mark Steyvers, a cognitive science and AI researcher at the University of California, Irvine. “It’s not frequent enough that GPT says ‘I don’t know’.”\n\nA feature, not a bug\n\nHallucinations are a result of the fundamental way in which LLMs work. As statistical machines, the models make predictions by generalizing on the basis of learnt associations, leading them to produce answers that are plausible, but sometimes wrong. Another issue is that, similar to a student scoring points for guessing on a multiple choice exam, during training, LLMs get rewarded for having a go rather than acknowledging their uncertainty, according to a preprint published by OpenAI on 4 September.\n\nImprovements have come from scaling up the size of LLMs — in terms of both the richness of their internal associations and the amount of data they are trained on, says Xu. But hallucinations are particularly prevalent in topics for which the model has scant training data or its underlying information is wrong, she says. Hallucinations can also happen when an AI tries to summarize or analyse papers that are too long for that model to process.\n\nEliminating hallucinations entirely is likely to prove impossible, says Mushtaq Bilal, a researcher at Silvi, a Copenhagen-based firm that makes an AI app to aid the creation of systematic reviews in science. “I think if it was possible, AI labs would have done it already.”\n\nBut reducing errors and getting a model to admit that it doesn’t know an answer have been “a pretty heavy focus” for OpenAI, says Saachi Jain, who manages the firm’s AI safety training team. According to technical documents released with GPT-5, OpenAI concentrated on “training our models to browse effectively for up-to-date information”, as well as cutting hallucinations. The firm focused on reducing hallucinations in lengthy, open-ended responses to queries, because this best represents real-life use of ChatGPT, says Jain.\n\nIn one literature-review benchmark known as ScholarQA-CS, GPT-5 “performs well” when it is allowed to access the web, says Akari Asai, an AI researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, based in Seattle, Washington, who ran the tests for Nature. In producing answers to open-ended computer-science questions, for example, the model performed marginally better than human experts did, with a correctness score of 55% (based on measures such as how well its statements are supported by citations) compared with 54% for scientists, but just behind a version of institute’s own LLM-based system for literature review, OpenScholar, which achieved 57%.\n\nHowever, GPT-5 suffered when the model was unable to get online, says Asai. The ability to cross-check with academic databases is a key feature of most AI-powered systems designed to help with literature reviews. Without Internet access, GPT-5 fabricated or muddled half the number of citations that one of its predecessors, GPT-4o, did. But it still got them wrong 39% of the time, she says.\n\nOn the LongFact benchmark, which tests accuracy in long-form responses to prompts, OpenAI reported that GPT-5 hallucinated 0.8% of claims in responses about people or places when it was allowed to browse the web, compared with 5.1% for OpenAI’s reasoning model o3. Performance dropped when browsing was not permitted, with GPT-5’s error rate climbing to 1.4% compared with 7.9% for o3. Both models showed worse performance than did the non-reasoning model GPT-4o, which had an error rate of 1.1% when offline.\n\nOn other independent evaluations — such as the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model, which is run by the AI platform Vectara in Palo Alto, California, and looks at how often an LLM makes false claims when summarizing a document — rival models such as Google’s Gemini 2.0 slightly outperformed GPT-5, although both erred less than 1.5% of the time.\n\nLearning to admit defeat\n\nOpenAI also reported that the model was more honest in its responses than the company’s previous models were. When given a coding task that was impossible to complete — for example, owing to a lack of access to necessary hardware — GPT-5 claimed to have done the task 17% of the time, compared with 47% for o3. Although Jain wouldn’t give details of the firm’s methods, she hinted that, in later stages of the model’s training, OpenAI worked on rewarding it for answering honestly.",

          "authors": "Bruce Allen",
          "abstract": "Credit: M. Scott Brauer/MIT/UPI/Alamy\n\nIn 1972, German-American physicist Rainer ‘Rai’ Weiss showed that laser interferometers — devices that measure tiny changes in distance using beams of light — could, in principle, detect gravitational waves. These ripples in the fabric of space and time were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 as part of his general theory of relativity. Although prototype detectors already existed, most scientists thought the task was hopeless: the waves were so faint that they shifted matter by amounts thousands of times smaller than the nucleus of an atom. Weiss demonstrated that, with extreme precision and technological innovation, they could be detected.\n\nMore than 40 years later, in 2015, gravitational waves were observed directly for the first time. This breakthrough earned Weiss one-half of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics, the other half being shared by his colleagues Kip Thorne and Barry Barish.\n\nEinstein hated entanglement — and five other quantum myths\n\nGravitational waves are produced by violent cosmic events, such as black-hole collisions or star explosions. Einstein had predicted them reluctantly, dismissing them as “of no consequence” because they seemed impossible to detect. Weiss and Thorne disagreed. They campaigned for the US National Science Foundation to fund large-scale detectors, leading to the construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), with twin facilities in Washington and Louisiana; it was completed in 1999.\n\nWeiss was known for his blunt humour. After winning the Nobel Prize “for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves”, he joked to friends: “This is going to screw up my life for a year.” The irreverence was intentional.\n\nBorn in Berlin in 1932, Weiss came from an intellectual but unsettled family. His father, a Jewish communist doctor, and his mother, a Christian actress, fled Nazi Germany when Rai was still a child. The family escaped first to Prague and later to New York City, arriving in 1939. Weiss studied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge but struggled, failing out in his junior year. He was rescued by nuclear physicist Jerrold Zacharias at MIT, who took him on as a laboratory technician and later a PhD student. Weiss never forgot the kindness and spent much of his career mentoring students in the same spirit.\n\nThe breakthrough proof bringing mathematics closer to a grand unified theor\n\nAfter earning his PhD in 1962, Weiss worked briefly at Tufts University in Medford and Princeton University in New Jersey, before returning to MIT in 1964, where he remained for the rest of his career. His early work included weather-balloon experiments to study the faint glow of the Big Bang, the cosmic-microwave background. His interest in gravitational waves began in 1966, while he was teaching a course on general relativity. To explain the effect of these waves to undergraduates, he sketched out the design for a laser interferometer — a device sensitive enough to register space itself stretching and squeezing.\n\nA chance conversation with Kip Thorne further strengthened his conviction. Thorne had assumed that interferometers could measure distances to the scale of only a single wavelength of light. Weiss corrected him: with careful design, the sensitivity could be orders of magnitude greater. That insight laid the groundwork for LIGO.",

This is the longest a pig organ has survived in a living person. Researchers say the outcome is a landmark case of successful xenotransplantation — the process of transplanting organs from animals to humans.\n\nThe recipient, Tim Andrews, had end-stage kidney disease and had been receiving dialysis for more than two years before he underwent the surgery in January. He has been dialysis-free since receiving the kidney. Andrews was one of three patients to receive genetically modified pig kidneys supplied by the biotechnology company eGenesis in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on compassionate grounds.\n\nReaching six months’ survival is an amazing feat, says Wayne Hawthorne, a transplant surgeon at the University of Sydney in Australia. The first six months is the period of “highest risk for the patient and also the transplant”, he adds. Possible complications include anaemia and graft rejection, when the immune system attacks the new organ. “The six-month time point marks that things have gone extremely well,” Hawthorne says. Reaching 12 months would be another milestone and a “fantastic long-term outcome”, he adds.\n\nPreviously, the recipient with longest-surviving genetically modified pig organ was a 53-year-old US woman, Towana Looney, who had a functioning pig kidney for four months and nine days. However, the organ was removed earlier this year because her immune system began to reject it.\n\nGenetically modified\n\nAndrews received a kidney from a pig with three types of genetic modification. One involved the elimination of three antigens to prevent organ rejection; another the addition of seven human genes that reduce inflammation and the risk of bleeding complications.

          "abstract": "Indigenous researcher and author Jessica Hernandez advocates for the integration of Indigenous knowledge into environmental science and stewardship. Credit: Jayne Doucette/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nIn 2020, while writing her PhD dissertation on bringing land-restoration efforts in urban settings in Seattle under the management of Indigenous peoples, the Indigenous scientist Jessica Hernandez noticed that many of the articles and books she wanted to incorporate were not written by Indigenous people. Moreover, those that were were often not written in English.\n\nShe wrote her first book, Fresh Banana Leaves (2022), as a way to help Indigenous peoples feel represented and to integrate Indigenous knowledge into scientific research. The book begins with the story of her father as an Indigenous child who survived the civil war in El Salvador between 1979 and 1992 and highlights Indigenous science, stewardship and land management, and particularly projects led by Indigenous women. “It’s important for more of us to write our own stories and our own books, especially when we’re displaced and not living on our ancestral lands,” she says.\n\nHernandez’s heritage is both Maya Ch’orti’, an Indigenous Maya group, and Binnizá (Zapotec), an Indigenous people from the Mexican state of Oaxaca. She currently teaches environmental studies at South Seattle College in Washington. Her research focuses on integrating Indigenous knowledge systems — such as kincentric ecology, the concept that all life is interconnected as kin — into restoration and conservation frameworks, and on pushing back against colonialism in ecological efforts. Her work also aims to redefine how the topic of energy is taught in secondary-school curricula, going beyond the physics of it by incorporating concepts of equity, justice and Indigenous knowledge as they are applied to energy access, climate change and sustainability.\n\nI help to build support systems for Latina researchers\n\nShe has founded the non-profit organization Earth Daughters, an Indigenous-led mutual-aid collective that supports Indigenous women and young people in Mexico and the United States. Through her work with Earth Daughters, Hernandez has supported the rebuilding of 200 homes in Oaxaca, after they were destroyed by an earthquake in 2020; supplied food to about 200 families whose local food sources were wiped out by floods in Mexico; and raised funds to support medical assistance for those affected by the 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles.\n\nHernandez has another book coming out in November, Growing Papaya Trees, which explores climate displacement through her mother’s journey from Oaxaca to the United States. She tells Nature that, through her writing, she challenges dominant narratives on immigration and elevates Indigenous perspectives that are often left out of mainstream discourse.\n\nWhat inspired you to learn Western science while maintaining the knowledge that has been passed to you?\n\nMy favourite subject was always science, probably because the memories I have of my parents and relatives always revolve around nature. Whether it was walking with my abuelita (grandmother) through the milpas (cornfields) or fishing with my dad, those experiences sparked my curiosity about the natural world. I’d say it also stems from a search for belonging — especially at university, where there aren’t many Indigenous or Latinx students. I tried to find my sense of belonging by connecting with my family’s memories and discovering that same connection in the natural sciences and environmental spaces.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor and why?\n\nMy biggest influence has been my parents. They always tell me, “If you can’t explain what you’re doing to us, you’re not doing your job.” This mindset has shaped how I approach science. It’s easy to get caught up in our fields, explaining things to other scientists, but not necessarily to non-scientists. My parents’ advice has helped me to bridge that gap and to integrate Indigenous knowledge, which often doesn’t align with Western ways of thinking, into my work. If I can explain things to my parents, then I know I can explain them to Indigenous communities or communities of colour.\n\nWhy do you invest time in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) work for Indigenous peoples and women?\n\nI think of myself, the young girl who entered graduate study and felt really alone and far from home. In a way, I’m healing that part of my life, when I was the only Indigenous student, the only student who was reprimanded or held to different standards compared with my peers — not because I wasn’t academically on the same level, but because of unconscious biases or racism that manifested in how I was treated, especially as a student. I want to comfort that girl who almost quit because she felt overwhelmed.\n\n‘Computing is a Black people’s thing’\n\nI want to create a space in which future students see more Indigenous representation and don’t feel as isolated. That’s one of the main reasons why I continue advocating for women and Indigenous peoples through my outreach work, why I founded Earth Daughters and why I collaborated with a non-profit organization known as Landesa to secure land rights for Indigenous communities in both Western and Eastern Africa.\n\nSeeing representation in books and articles, or hearing from others with similar backgrounds, can be empowering, especially in spaces such as academia in which more representation is needed, and that’s what I aimed to achieve with my books. I’ve learnt that change doesn’t always require outside help; often, communities already have the solutions. Seeing how our Indigenous communities are fighting the impacts of climate change, adapting at a rapid rate and still thriving, keeps me passionate. I also recognize the privileges of being able to pursue a master’s degree and PhD, and I know that I can use those letters behind my name to continue discussions on DEI and to challenge dominant narratives while empowering marginalized communities to lead their own change.\n\nIs there anything about your career that you wish you could have done differently?",

          "abstract": "Low-socioeconomic-status (SES) and immigrant households benefit the most from attending high-quality early childcare, but they often access it the least. This study tests whether cognitive and behavioural barriers contribute to these access gaps in the French context, where disparities in early childcare enrolment are large. Through a multi-arm experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of informational interventions and personalized support to enhance early childcare application and access in a sample of 1,849 households. Results revealed that the information-only treatment had minimal impact, while adding personalized support to alleviate administrative burdens significantly bridged the SES and migration gaps in early childcare applications. However, despite substantial increases in application rates, we found limited impacts on access rates for low-SES and immigrant households. Our research underscores the need for integrated strategies to promote equal opportunities in early childhood education by identifying key obstacles to early childcare access for these households.",

This research examines the short- to medium-term effects of private hosting on Ukrainian refugee integration in Germany. Using data from one of the largest non-profit platforms that matches private hosts with refugees, we compare the multidimensional integration outcomes of refugees who were matched with private hosts to those of observably similar refugees who applied for private hosting but were not matched (n = 1,700). Our findings show significant improvements in the social, psychological and navigational integration of privately hosted refugees, with no discernible effects on linguistic, economic or political integration. This study provides causal evidence on the effectiveness of private hosting in enhancing refugee integration, underscoring its potential to complement traditional public asylum reception and housing systems, and to harness civil society engagement for refugee integration during humanitarian crises.",

Here we develop a one-shot learning task to investigate whether humans and LLMs encode tree-structured constituents within sentences. Participants (total N = 372, native Chinese or English speakers, and bilingual in Chinese and English) and LLMs (for example, ChatGPT) were asked to infer which words should be deleted from a sentence. Both groups tend to delete constituents, instead of non-constituent word strings, following rules specific to Chinese and English, respectively. The results cannot be explained by models that rely only on word properties and word positions. Crucially, based on word strings deleted by either humans or LLMs, the underlying constituency tree structure can be successfully reconstructed.

However, detailed characterizations of how population-level behaviors change over time during multiple disease outbreaks and spatial resolutions are still not widely available. We used data from 431,211 survey responses collected in the United States, between April 2020 and June 2022, to provide a description of how human behaviors fluctuated during the first 2 y of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that at the national and state levels, people’s adherence to recommendations to avoid contact with others (a preventive behavior) was highest early in the pandemic but gradually—and linearly—decreased over time. Importantly, during periods of intense COVID-19 mortality, adaption to preventive behaviors increased—despite the overall temporal decrease. These spatial-temporal characterizations help improve our understanding of the bidirectional feedback loop between outbreak severity and human behavior. Our findings should benefit both computational modeling teams developing methodologies to predict the dynamics of future epidemics and policymakers designing strategies to mitigate the effects of future disease outbreaks.",

We developed an agent-based model that simulates sexual pair formation, incorporating both brief and longer-term sexual relationships. The model implements survey data on the sexual behavior of MSM and accounts for the highly heterogeneous nature of the sexual contact network within this community. When simulating the mpox epidemic, the model reproduces the reported numbers of sexual partners of mpox-infected individuals. We find that infection-derived immunity had little impact on ending the European outbreak. Instead, we suggest that the marked decrease in serial interval observed across the epidemic reflects a substantial increase in self-isolating behavior among infected persons and that this is sufficient to explain the early control of the epidemic. Our work highlights the critical interplay between relationship dynamics and adaptive behaviors in shaping mpox epidemic patterns and achieving control in 2022. Despite continued propagation of clade IIb mpox, the European MSM population remains protected by immunity, primarily vaccine-induced.",

In four field experiments over 2 y ( n = 542,804 low-income households), we test whether more proactive communication, varying message framing, and more precise targeting can boost take-up of tax-based benefits in California above and beyond traditional light-touch approaches. Our interventions focused on extremely vulnerable households, most with no prior-year earnings, who were at risk of missing out on two crucial benefits: the 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit and pandemic-relief Economic Impact Payments. Light-touch outreach consistently increased take-up of these benefits by 0.14 to 2 percentage points—a 150% to over 500% relative increase—regardless of message, sample, timing, or modality. These light-touch approaches resulted in over $4 million disbursed, with a highly cost-effective return of $50 to over $8,000 per $1 spent. However, higher-touch proactive outreach, varying messaging, and more precise targeting yielded minimal additional benefits, with proactive outreach even showing negative returns. These findings demonstrate that light-touch outreach can effectively shift behavior among very vulnerable households in contexts with reduced compliance burdens, but also underscore an urgent need to rethink the role of higher-touch strategies in closing take-up gaps in social safety net programs.",

          "abstract": "Major depressive disorder affects millions worldwide, yet current treatments require prolonged administration. In contrast, ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects by blocking spontaneous N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling, which lifts the suppression of protein synthesis and triggers homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Here, we identify a parallel signaling pathway involving metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) that promotes rapid antidepressant-like effects. We show that enhancing the endogenous mGluR5 signaling produces synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus and triggers the rapid antidepressant effect, similar to ketamine. Importantly, blocking mGluR5 prevents ketamine’s effects, revealing a synergy between the two pathways. At the cellular level, spontaneous calcium transients mediated by mGluR5 activate the phosphatase calcineurin and promote eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) dephosphorylation, increasing BDNF translation to drive synaptic plasticity. We show that quantal glutamate release activates two spatially segregated Ca 2+ signals—NMDAR- and mGluR5-driven—which exert opposing effects on protein synthesis. Together, these findings highlight mGluR5 as a promising therapeutic target for rapid antidepressant action, harnessing the complex nanoscale organization of synapses.",

          "abstract": "We model the effect of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) adoption on U.S. power system generator capacity investment, operations, and emissions through 2050 by estimating power systems outcomes under a range of EV adoption trajectory scenarios. Our EV adoption scenarios are informed by 1) an Energy Information Administration scenario with no policy intervention, 2) EV growth expected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 3) a Biden Administration 50% EV sales target by 2030, 4) the Environmental Protection Agency’s projections under vehicle emissions standards, and 5) the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to Net Zero by 2050. We find across these scenarios that increasing EV adoption induces investment in new wind, solar, storage, and natural gas capacity, affecting power generation mix and emissions. The net effect of increasing EV adoption beyond our IRA base case is to increase power sector emissions by about 5 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year in 2026 (comparable to displaced gasoline vehicle combustion emissions), but this effect rapidly drops to annual levels below 1 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year by 2032 and continues below this level through 2050. Consequential effects of EV adoption vary regionally, with most regions primarily increasing wind or solar capacity and some regions primarily increasing natural gas capacity, even in 2050. Our national emissions estimates per EV-year are relatively robust to the level of EV adoption beyond our baseline and to variation in assumptions about power systems, EV behavior, and policy.",

          "abstract": "In eukaryotic systems, three major types of cell junctions have been well characterized. While bacterial adhesion mechanisms also exhibit remarkable diversity, the molecular processes that regulate the dynamic modulation of binding strength between elongated bacterial cells and host cells remain poorly understood. Fusobacterium nucleatum ( F. nucleatum ) utilizes the surface adhesin CbpF to interact with the highly expressed host receptors CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 on cancer cells to facilitate tumor colonization. By elucidating the structural details of CbpF binding to human CEACAM1/CEACAM5 receptors, and through mechanistic investigations, we identified that the prominent EFNGQYQ loop on CbpF and the key Q78 residue of CEACAM1/CEACAM5 constitute the molecular linchpin of this pathogen–host interface. Furthermore, we found a distinct type of binding particle and proposed a Velcro-like adhesion model. In this model, CbpF mediates robust attachment through the simultaneous interaction of multiple binding sites, akin to the interlocking mechanism of Velcro. This multivalent interaction allows F. nucleatum to dynamically switch between firm anchoring and easy detachment, adapting to varying physiological microenvironments. Our study elucidates the dynamic modulation of bacterial adhesion strength and lays the foundation for developing therapeutic interventions to disrupt the bacterium–host interface.",

          "abstract": "Many soft, tough materials have emerged in recent years, paving the way for advances in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and flexible displays. However, understanding the interfacial fracture behavior of these materials remains a significant challenge, owing to the difficulty of quantifying the respective contributions from viscoelasticity and damage to energy dissipation ahead of cracks. This work aims to address this challenge by labeling a series of polymer networks with fluorogenic mechanophores, subjecting them to T-peel tests at various rates and temperatures, and quantifying their force-induced damage using a confocal microscope. The results challenge longstanding assumptions underlying linear viscoelastic fracture theories, revealing a complex interplay between viscoelasticity and damage governed by the Weissenberg number, W i . Specifically, they suggest a molecular picture in which the interfacial toughness increases due to polymer chain breakage and enlarged strains when W i &lt; 0.3 , and significant chain friction and network stiffening when W i &gt; 0.3 , with the damage being negligible in the limits of W i ≪ 0.3 and W i ≫ 0.3 either due to insufficient strains at the peel front or because of excessive stress at weak interfacial bonds. Overall, these results illustrate the molecular and mesoscopic mechanisms underpinning interfacial fracture, aiding to refine current viscoelastic fracture theories and accelerating the development of advanced polymer networks for increasingly demanding applications.",

          "abstract": "Proliferative retinopathy is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in humans; however, the molecular mechanisms behind the immune cell–mediated retinal angiogenesis remain poorly elucidated. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, we identified an enrichment of sorting nexin (SNX)-related pathways, with SNX3, a member of the SNX family that is involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, being significantly upregulated in the myeloid cell subpopulations of OIR retinas. Immunostaining showed that SNX3 expression is markedly increased in the retinal microglia/macrophages of mice with OIR, which is mainly located within and around the neovascular tufts. Myeloid cell-specific deficiency of Snx3 inhibited retinal neovascularization, hyperpermeability, and dysfunction in OIR mice. Using glutathione S-transferase pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescent staining, we found that SNX3 interacted with receptor-interacting protein 1/3 (RIP1 and RIP3). We further demonstrated that RIP1/3 degradation was accelerated in SNX3-deleted microglia/macrophages, causing an inhibition of hypoxia-induced necroptosis and mitochondrial fission, thereby decreasing the production of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors (FGF2 and MMP12). Moreover, OIR retinas from myeloid cell–specific SNX3 overexpression transgenic mice presented more angiogenic tufts, while RIP1/3 inhibition largely ablated SNX3 overexpression–induced pathological angiogenesis. Based on the structure of SNX3, we identified a small-molecule inhibitor, W1122. Intriguingly, we found that W1122 effectively inhibited retinal angiogenesis in the OIR model, and combination treatment with anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) yielded enhanced antiangiogenic effects. Collectively, our findings disclose a link between SNX3 and RIP1/3 signaling and implicate SNX3 in the development of ischemic retinopathy.",

Targeting ever more structurally complex, dynamic, and functional assemblies necessitates going beyond the design of the structure itself, to the measurement and control of the local flexibility of the intersubunit connections and its impact on the collective mechanics of the entire assembly. In this study, we demonstrate a method to infer the mechanical properties of multisubunit assemblies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and RELION’s multi-body refinement. Specifically, we analyze the fluctuations of pairs of DNA-origami subunits that self-assemble into tubules. By measuring the fluctuations of dimers using cryo-EM, we extract mechanical properties such as the bending modulus and interparticle spring constant. These properties are then applied to elastic models to predict assembly outcomes, which align well with experimental observations. This approach not only provides a deeper understanding of nanoparticle mechanics but also opens pathways to refining subunit designs to achieve precise assembly behavior. This methodology could have broader applications in the study of nanomaterials, including protein assemblies, where understanding the interplay of mechanical properties and subunit geometry is essential for controlling complex self-assembled structures.",

Rad54 is an ATP-dependent DNA motor protein that stimulates Rad51 activity during mitosis. In meiosis Rad51 is downregulated by the protein Hed1, which blocks Rad54 binding to Rad51, and allows Dmc1 to function as the active recombinase. We currently have a poor understanding of the regulatory interplay between Rad54, Hed1, Rad51, and Dmc1. Here, we identify a conserved Rad51 interaction motif within Rad54, and we solve a CryoEM structure of this motif bound to Rad51. We also identify a distinct Rad51 interaction motif within Hed1 and solve its structure bound to Rad51. These structures explain how Rad54 engages Rad51 to promote recombination between sister chromatids during mitosis and how Rad51 is downregulated by Hed1 upon entry into meiosis such that its meiosis-specific homolog Dmc1 can promote recombination between homologous chromosomes.",

The superconducting T c in many of these materials is maximized in the regime of strong nematic fluctuations, making the role of nematicity in influencing the superconductivity a topic of intense research. Here, we use the AC elastocaloric effect (ECE) to map out the phase diagram of Ba(Fe 1− x Co x ) 2 As 2 near optimal doping. The ECE signature at T c on the overdoped side, where superconductivity condenses without any nematic order, is quantitatively consistent with other thermodynamic probes that indicate a single-component superconducting state. In contrast, on the slightly underdoped side, where superconductivity condenses within the nematic phase, ECE reveals a second thermodynamic transition proximate to and below T c . We rule out magnetism and reentrant tetragonality as the origin of this transition and find that our observations strongly suggest a phase transition into a multicomponent superconducting state.

          "abstract": "Turbulent convection governs heat transport in both natural and industrial settings, yet optimizing it under extreme conditions remains a significant challenge. Traditional control strategies, such as predefined temperature modulation, struggle to achieve substantial enhancement. Here, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that autonomously discovers optimal control policies to maximize heat transfer in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection. By dynamically adjusting wall temperature fluctuations, the DRL agent achieves a heat transfer enhancement of up to 38.5%, exceeding the 20 to 25% limit of conventional methods. The learned strategy reveals a nonlinear state–action relationship, inducing a fully modulated boundary layer regime. Furthermore, we distill the DRL insights into a simplified bang-bang control model, which retains comparable performance (up to 40.0% enhancement) and, crucially, generalizes to unseen, higher Rayleigh number cases without additional training. Our results demonstrate the power of machine learning in turbulence control and reveal a framework with potential for intelligent heat transfer optimization in real-world applications.",

          "abstract": "Multivalent binding and the resulting dynamical clustering of receptors and ligands are known to be key features in biological interactions. For optimizing biomaterials capable of similar dynamical features, it is essential to understand the first step of these interactions, namely the multivalent molecular recognition between ligands and cell receptors. Here, we present the reciprocal cooperation between dynamic ligands in supramolecular polymers and dynamic receptors in model cell membranes, determining molecular recognition and multivalent binding via receptor clustering. The nonlinear dependences of the ligand concentration, receptors, and their binding affinity are observed experimentally by fluorescence and superresolution fluorescence microscopies, revealing a valency-dependent clustering mode of anchoring. The mechanism is supported by stochastic modeling demonstrating that such nonlinear dependence is unlikely in the absence of any dynamics and superselectivity. Using a coarse-grained molecular model, the subtle competition between local and global entropies that controls this anchoring mechanism explains the clustering. Further investigation using single particle tracking reveals the presence of two populations of bound and unbound receptors after the clustering process. The result of this study highlights the importance of reciprocity of dynamics in supramolecular polymer and lipid membrane for recruitment, multivalent binding, and clustering, all of which are crucial elements in the design of materials capable of actively interacting with biological targets.",

However, the net surface temperature impact of these processes—whether ET cooling or albedo-induced warming predominates—and how the dominance changes across phenological transitions and regions remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of vegetation foliage on daytime land surface temperature (LST) following six phenological transitions, spanning from the start of season to end of season, in deciduous and mixed forests across the mid- to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere during 2013–2021 using multiple satellite products and ground observations. We quantified vegetation effect as the difference between observed LST and LST estimates from the Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) model, representing a no-foliage scenario. We found that vegetation-induced cooling consistently outweighs warming following all phenological transitions except for the end of the season. Cooling intensity increased with vegetation greenness, ranging from 1.0 ± 0.5 °C (mean ± 0.15 SD) in 59% of forests after the start of the season (SOS) to 6.1 ± 0.8 °C in 89% of forests following the onset of maturity, before declining toward the end of the season. Over half of the regions experiencing cooling showed intensification of surface cooling with climate warming, suggesting an amplified vegetation-mediated cooling under future climate change. The findings provide a more precise understanding of the role of vegetation in modulating climate at the intraseasonal scale, highlighting the importance of integrating phenological impacts into climate adaptation strategies and Earth system modeling.",

          "abstract": "Agonist-induced interaction of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) with β-arrestins (βarrs) is a critical mechanism that regulates the spatiotemporal pattern of receptor localization and signaling. While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR–βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.",

          "abstract": "The origin and phylogenetic distribution of symbiotic associations between nodulating angiosperms and nitrogen-fixing bacteria have long intrigued biologists. Recent comparative evolutionary analyses have yielded alternative hypotheses: a multistep pathway of independent gains and losses of root nodule symbiosis vs. a single gain followed by numerous losses. A detailed reconstruction of the history of genes involved in signaling between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and potential hosts, particularly lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signaling, is needed to distinguish between these hypotheses. LCO recognition by plants involves the Nod Factor Perception ( NFP ) gene family; in the legume model Medicago truncatula (Fabales), MtNFP is essential for establishing rhizobial symbiosis. Here, we document convergent evolution of NFP , indicating multiple origins of LCO-driven symbiosis. In contrast to previous models that explain the recruitment of NFP via a single duplication in the ancestor of the nitrogen-fixing clade, our phylogenomic and synteny results suggest this duplication does not span the entire clade. Tandem duplication in a common ancestor of Cucurbitales and Rosales resulted in the NFP1 and NFP2 groups. In contrast, the phylogenetically closest paralog of MtNFP is MtLYR1 , located on a different chromosome within a large syntenic block. All available data indicate that a large-scale duplication resulted in MtNFP and MtLYR1 , likely corresponding to a whole-genome duplication in an ancestor of subfamily Papilionoideae of Fabaceae. We show that MtNFP and the NFP2 -like group are not orthologous, indicating multiple independent gains of NFP -based LCO signaling. This molecular convergence provides a possible mechanism for multiple gains of root nodule symbiosis across the nitrogen-fixing clade.",

The prelimbic cortex (PL) plays a central role in this process, with a stable PL neuronal population (ensemble) recruited during operant reward learning to encode response execution. However, it is unknown how this established reward-learning ensemble adapts to changing reward contingencies, such as reward omission during extinction. Specifically, does the same ensemble adjust its activity to support behavior suppression, or is a distinct ensemble recruited for this new learning? Our data reveal that operant extinction learning recruits a distinct PL Extinction ensemble to support response inhibition, and concerted engagement of both ensembles encodes both ongoing and subsequent context-specific behavior. Using single-cell calcium imaging, we longitudinally tracked PL neurons in rats as they pressed a lever for food rewards (Training), learned to suppress responding upon reward omission (Extinction), and reinstated responding following a noncontingent “priming” pellet (Reinstatement). We trained decoders on individual rats’ PL activity patterns to predict trial-wise responses and used an in silico deletion approach to identify separate PL Training and Extinction ensembles associated with response execution and inhibition, respectively. Critically, both ensembles were reengaged and maintained their distinct roles during Reinstatement. These findings highlight ensemble-based encoding of multiple, even opposing, learned associations within the same region, demonstrating how selective ensemble recruitment enables behavioral flexibility under changing contingencies.",

To effectively exploit these resources, they have evolved a wide range of feeding strategies that combine chemotactic motility with active feeding flows. However, there is a notable lack of experimental studies that examine how these active flows shape resource fields to optimize feeding. In particular, the suspected cooperative hydrodynamics provided by groups of cells remains largely unexplored due to the difficulties in visualizing these dynamic three-dimensional flows. Here, we experimentally investigate how Stylonychia lemnae ciliates form feeding clusters of independent cells around food patches. Individual feeding flows interact hydrodynamically to create a chaotic collective flow at the population scale. Using a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, we measure and predict the entire collective flow, enabling us to assess its remarkable mixing and dispersion properties. We show that the active spreading of the food patch accelerates its detection by starving cells. As many fitness advantages provided by collective flows can be envisioned, we propose that this feeding cluster represents a form of intraspecific by-product cooperative behavior.",

However, due to the localized stress concentration induced by a high Peierls-Nabarro stress and limited dislocation mobility, increasing material strength usually comes at the expense of ductility and toughness, resulting in a trade-off between strength–ductility/strength–toughness. Here, we report an anomalous phenomenon of dislocation absorption at the crack front, which is unlike typically observed dislocation emission at the crack tip, in a heterogeneous “plain” steel consisting of tempered lath martensite embedded with stable carbon-enriched retained austenite. The continuous absorption of dislocations emitted from the tempered martensite into the tough austenite significantly alleviates the localized stress concentration, and as such retards crack propagation in the tempered martensite matrix. This allows the plain high-carbon low-alloyed steel subjected to simple quenching–partitioning–tempering processes to achieve remarkable properties comprising a multiplication of strength and elongation over 50 GPa·% with an exceptionally high fracture toughness over 130 MPa·m 1/2 . The toughening strategy based on this mechanism provides a promising route for developing cost-effective plain steels with ultrahigh strength, ductility, and toughness that is a persistent pursuit in the steel industry.",

Bismuth (Bi) anode, with its high theoretical capacity and low cost, enhances the performance and competitiveness of ASIBs in energy storage applications. However, as a conversion-type material, Bi inevitably undergoes dramatic volume changes during cycling, limiting the structural stability and calendar life of the electrode. Herein, we present a Bi-carbon composite electrode with ultrafine Bi nanocrystals (&lt; 10 nm) uniformly integrated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (UF Bi@NCF). Despite Bi’s low melting point (271 °C), Ostwald ripening of metallic Bi during carbonization (750 °C) is effectively suppressed by incorporating polyacrylic acid as a chelating polymer in the electrospun Bi(III)/polyacrylonitrile precursor solutions. The high dispersity of Bi nanocrystals at elevated temperature is attributed to the strong coordination and electrostatic interactions between carboxyl groups and Bi 3+ . This structural refinement significantly reduces localized stress concentrations during sodiation/desodiation. The UF Bi@NCF anode demonstrates a reversible capacity of 237.5 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C, and negligible capacity decay even after 5,700 cycles at an extremely high current rate of 20 C for ASIBs.

Herein, we find elevated levels of muricholic acid (MCA) species in the serum of girls with central precocious puberty, which strongly correlate with indices of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis activation and can reach peak levels during puberty among healthy children. Intriguingly, reduction of MCA species can lead to decreased expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and delay the early onset of puberty, while elevated MCA levels induced premature sexual development in female mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that MCA had strong activation effects on Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), and MCA enhanced GnRH expression in GnRH neurons through activation of the TGR5-PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

While stress-induced organismal death has been observed in many species, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of stress-induced organismal death in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . We identified a chymotrypsin-like serine protease Phaedra1 ( Phae1 ) as a death mediator in D. melanogaster larvae. Phae1 expression was up-regulated by lethal heat stress (40 °C) but not nonlethal heat stress (38 °C or lower). The most prominent induction of Phae1 occurred in the central nervous system (CNS). We found neuro-specific knockdown of Phae1 increased survival and reduced neuronal caspase activity following exposure to lethal heat stress, suggesting that the transcriptional upregulation of Phae1 in the CNS is essential for stress-induced organismal death. We next found via bioinformatic and biochemical analyses that the transcription factor Zeste (Z) bound the Phae1 enhancer region and that z loss-of-function impaired Phae1 induction in the CNS, increasing survival following lethal heat stress. In addition, we found via chemical screening that rapamycin, a chemical inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), suppressed Phae1 expression. Neuro-specific knockdown of mTor reduced the protein levels of both Phae1 and Z, leading to an increase in survival following lethal heat stress. Together, these results indicate that heat stress–induced organismal death in D. melanogaster larvae is regulated by a genetically encoded transcriptional signaling pathway involving the mTOR–Z–Phae1 axis.",

To complete replication, this ssDNA gap is filled in by one of the two lesion tolerance pathways: the error-prone Translesion Synthesis (TLS) or the error-free Homology Directed Gap Repair (HDGR). In the present work, we evidence a role for the RecBC complex distinct from its canonical function in homologous recombination at DNA double strand breaks. We show that upon lesion encounter RecBC (independently of its catalytic activity and of the RecD subunit) is required to protect the nascent DNA in order to promote efficient lesion bypass. In the absence of RecBC, our data indicate that the nuclease ExoI can access and degrade the nascent DNA, affecting both TLS and HDGR mechanisms. We show that the recruitment of RecBC becomes particularly important at strong blocking lesions, when postreplicative ssDNA gaps persist and are covered by the ssDNA binding proteins. This protective role of RecBC is reminiscent of the role of BRCA2 in protecting the nascent DNA in human cells, highlighting once again the evolutionary conservation of DNA replication mechanisms across all living organisms.",

We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface.

We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g., growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.",

          "abstract": "The size and composition of local species pools are, in part, determined by past dispersal events. Predicting how communities respond to future disturbances, such as fluctuating environmental conditions, requires knowledge of such histories. We assessed the influence of a historical dispersal event on community assembly by simulating various scales of dispersal for 240 serpentine annual plant communities that experienced a large shift from drought to high rainfall conditions over three years. We collected, aggregated, and redistributed the aboveground seed bank (i.e., all loose seed present on the soil surface before the growing season initiates) from 30 sites across five nested spatial scales ( ∼ 1 m, 5 m, 100 m, 5 km, and 10 km), and annually censused communities to identify change in community structure among dispersal scales and over time. Our one-time dispersal manipulation diversified aboveground seed banks, provided insurance against temporal variability at intermediate and large dispersal distances ( ≥ 100 m), and even supported community reassembly toward a new compositional state at the 10 km scale. We also found evidence that temporal lags directed community responses to environmental fluctuations, preventing rare species extirpations and providing subordinate species discrete windows of time to supplement their seed banks. Our results reveal a joint spatiotemporal equilibrium in this system where dispersal through space interacts with temporal fluctuations in climate to support species’ persistence via aboveground seed banks. This experiment underscores the importance of dispersal for diversity maintenance in this global biodiversity hotspot, where the magnitude and frequency of future climate fluctuations is uncertain.",

Despite significant advancements, there are still challenges in using SSEs, particularly in extreme conditions. This study presents a hydrated metal-organic ionic cocrystal (HMIC) solid-state ion conductor with a solvent-assisted ion transport mechanism suitable for extreme operating conditions. Through crystal engineering strategies, the adsorption capacity of HMIC for anions and water molecules can be regulated, thereby facilitating cation hopping transport and enhancing electrochemical stability. As a result, optimized HMIC shows exceptional properties, including an extraordinarily high Zn 2+ transference number (t Zn2+ = 0.81), an expanded electrochemical stability window (~2.6 V), and an exceptionally high Zn 2+ ion conductivity (8.6 mS cm –1 , 25 °C). Interface dynamics analysis indicates that this strong binding to water molecules can significantly reduce the desolvation energy barrier and enhance the ionic diffusion coefficient. (10 to 100 times higher than that in aqueous electrolytes). This allows Zn|| Prussian blue analog batteries to exhibit impressive fast-charging performance (180 C, 20 s, over 1,000 charge/discharge cycles) and maintain 100% discharge capacity retention and discharge plateau from –30 to 30 °C.

We demonstrated that small current adjustments in electromagnets significantly alter the levitation heights of diverse particles and cell types. By periodically modulating and tracking cell positions along the z-axis, Electro-LEV identified distinct levitation behaviors between single cells and cell clusters, with clusters responding more rapidly to magnetic field changes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Electro-LEV significantly enhances the purity and efficiency of levitational sorting, achieving 10-fold enrichment of live cells from 50% starting viability samples and 18.8-fold enrichment from 10% starting viability samples. These results establish Electro-LEV as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity, differentiating cell sizes and types, and improving cell sorting efficiency. Thus, Electro-LEV is broadly applicable, offering different possibilities for high-resolution cell analysis and label-free cell sorting in various biomedical fields, including but not limited to single-cell sequencing and drug screening.",

          "abstract": "Typically, people perform actions in a valenced—positive or negative—way, depending on their attitudes or desires. These forms of action are named vitality forms (VFs). While it is well established that action goals are mediated by a parieto-frontal network, less is known about the processing of VFs. Recent fMRI studies suggest that the insula (INS)—and its connections with the parieto-frontal circuit—plays a crucial role in VFs processing. However, a key question remains: How does our internal affective state shape our motor behavior? To explore this issue, we conducted an fMRI study. Participants were required to perform two sequential tasks: 1) to evoke either a positive (enthusiastic) or a negative (angry) affective state (feeling task); 2) to execute an action while maintaining these affective states (execution task). Univariate analysis revealed activation of the INS and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the feeling task, which extended to the premotor (PM) and parietal areas during the execution task. To determine the directionality of information flow among these nodes, we employed dynamic causal modeling. Bayesian model comparison showed that, during the feeling task, affect generation involves INS, which, together with the PFC, modulates the activity of PM. In contrast, during execution, motor commands emerge from PM and influence activity in the INS and PFC. These findings indicate that while the internal states crucially imply the INS, their regulation is mediated by PFC. The PM cortex plays a crucial role in the selection of the corresponding action VFs.",

Alterations in nuclear size or the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio are hallmark features of cancer cells and often correlate with disease progression. However, the mechanisms underlying nuclear size abnormalities and their impact on tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear hypertrophy occurs in response to enhanced DNA replication stress, a key characteristic of cancer cells. Increased actin polymerization within the nucleus appears to be the primary mechanism driving nuclear hypertrophy downstream of the ATR-CHEK1 pathway. Replication stress–induced nuclear hypertrophy alters transcriptomic profiles and chromatin topology, while reducing the migratory and metastatic capacity of cancer cells. In addition, nuclear hypertrophy in cancer cells is associated with increased infiltration of antitumor immune cells. Our findings suggest that cell-autonomous effects of nuclear hypertrophy do not promote cellular fitness or aggressive characteristics in cancer cells. This may explain why cells with nuclear hypertrophy are not positively selected and persist as a subpopulation during tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, the link between replication stress and nuclear hypertrophy provides insights into why enlarged nuclei are consistently observed in advanced-stage cancers.",

While divergent genetic clocks have been studied extensively in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, an ancient conserved circadian redox rhythm has been recently reported. However, its biological function and physiological outputs remain elusive. Here, we uncovered the coexistence of redox and genetic rhythms with distinct period lengths and transcriptional targets through concurrent metabolic and transcriptional time-course measurements in an Arabidopsis long-period clock mutant. Analysis of the target genes indicated regulation of the immune-induced programmed cell death (PCD) by the redox rhythm. Moreover, this time-of-day-sensitive PCD was eliminated by redox perturbations and by blocking the signaling pathway of the plant defense hormones jasmonic acid/ethylene, while remaining intact in genetic clock-defective backgrounds. This study shows that compared to robust genetic clocks, the more sensitive circadian redox rhythm serves as a signaling hub in regulating incidental energy-intensive processes, such as immune-induced PCD involving reprogramming of chloroplast and mitochondria activities, to provide organisms a flexible strategy to mitigate metabolic overload during stress responses.",

          "abstract": "The β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR), a prototype G protein–coupled receptor, controls cardiopulmonary function underpinning O 2 delivery. Abundance of the β 2 AR is canonically regulated by G protein–coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestins, but neither controls constitutive receptor levels, which are dependent on ambient O 2 . Basal β 2 AR expression is instead regulated by the prolyl hydroxylase/pVHL-E3 ubiquitin ligase system, explaining O 2 responsivity. Interplay between O 2 and nitric oxide (NO, a potent bronchodilator) is central to cardiopulmonary function. Here, we demonstrate that pVHL-mediated β 2 AR degradation is counteracted by NO, revealing pVHL control of pulmonary function. NO S-nitrosylates Cys77 in human pVHL (cognate to mouse Cys43), which induces binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to degrade pVHL, thereby increasing β 2 AR expression. pVHL–C43S mutant mice refractory to S-nitrosylation exhibit decreases in β 2 AR signaling and increases in airway tone. Thus, pVHL controls adrenergic pulmonary function and contributes to bronchodilation by NO. Our findings suggest therapeutic approaches to asthma and obstructive airway disease.",

This method enables customization and large-scale production of exosomes with specific functionalities, potentially advancing precision therapies across a wide array of diseases. As demonstrated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models, exosomes derived from hybrid cells (HCs) (H/Exos) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neutrophils efficiently targeted AD-affected areas via LFA-1/ICAM-1 and improved the cognition of AD mice. Beyond directly promoting neural repair and inhibiting inflammation, we surprisingly found that H/Exos increased microglia abundance, modulated microglia gene expression, enhanced the endocytic and lysosomal function, and promoted microglial phagocytic phenotypic differentiation to clear Aβ. This hybridoma-inspired strategy offers a versatile and practical way to engineer exosomes with desired therapeutic functions, representing a promising direction for personalized therapies.",

The origin of this ectopic fat remains enigmatic, and the absence of a genetic animal model has hindered its investigation. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P 3 ], a key signaling lipid that regulates cellular growth and differentiation, is tightly regulated by the lipid phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and SHIP2 (SH2-containing inositol phosphatase 2). Here, we demonstrate that simultaneous loss of Pten and Ship2 in the adrenal cortex induces adrenal lipoma formation in mice. These lipomatous cells display both adipocyte-like morphology and adipocyte-specific gene expression. Lineage tracing revealed that these lipomas originate from the adrenal cortex. Mechanistically, PI(3,4,5)P 3 hyperaccumulation in the adrenal cortex activates AKT (AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog), leading to ectopic PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) expression, a key driver of adipocyte differentiation. This study suggests that the PI(3,4,5)P 3 /AKT-driven transdifferentiation of adrenocortical cells may represent a central mechanism underlying adrenal lipoma formation, thereby providing insights into lipoma pathogenesis and cellular reprogramming in vivo.",

We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ordinary differential equation (ODE) inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.",

          "abstract": "During wound healing, tumor growth, and organ formation, epithelial cells migrate and cluster in layered tissue environments. Although cellular mechanosensing of adhered extracellular matrices is now well recognized, it is unclear how deeply cells sense through distant matrix layers. Since single cells can mechanosense stiff basal surfaces through soft hydrogels of &lt;10 μm thickness, here we ask whether cellular collectives can perform such “depth-mechanosensing” through thicker matrix layers. Using a collagen-polyacrylamide double-layer hydrogel, we found that epithelial cell collectives can mechanosense basal substrates at a depth of &gt;100 μm, assessed by cell clustering and collagen deformation. On collagen layers with stiffer basal substrates, cells initially migrate slower while performing higher collagen deformation and stiffening, resulting in reduced dispersal of epithelial clusters. These processes occur in two broad phases: cellular clustering and dynamic collagen deformation, followed by cell migration and dispersal. Using a cell-populated collagen-polyacrylamide computational model, we show that stiffer basal substrates enable higher collagen deformation, which in turn extends the clustering phase of epithelial cells and reduces their dispersal. Disruption of collective collagen deformation, by either α-catenin depletion or myosin-II inhibition, disables the depth-mechanosensitive differences in epithelial responses between soft and stiff basal substrates. These findings suggest that depth-mechanosensing is an emergent property that arises from collective collagen deformation caused by epithelial cell clusters. This work broadens the conventional understanding of epithelial mechanosensing from immediate surfaces to underlying basal matrices, providing insights relevant to tissue contexts with layers of varying stiffness, such as wound healing and tumor invasion.",

Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a common form of ocular fibrosis, is a major cause of blindness, characterized by the formation of extensive fibrous proliferative membranes. Understanding the cellular origins of PVR-associated fibroblasts (PAFs) is essential to decipher the mechanisms of ocular wound healing. In this study, we combined single-cell transcriptomics with genetic lineage tracing to map the contributions of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, immune cells, and Müller cells to disease progression. RPE cells were found to constitute the largest fraction of cells within PVR lesions, transitioning through metabolic, proliferative, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition stages during their conversion to PAFs. These cells exhibited remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity. Notably, Pdgfrb + RPE cells demonstrated significant morphological plasticity, transitioning toward a fibroblast-like phenotype, while macrophage-like RPE cells acquired inflammation-related functions post-PVR. Cell communication network analysis identified Thbs1 (encoding TSP-1) as a key hub gene driving RPE cell fate transitions during PVR. Importantly, therapeutic antibodies targeting TSP-1 significantly mitigated PVR progression. This study provides a detailed roadmap of fibrosis formation during ocular wound healing and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting TSP-1 in the management of PVR.",

Here, we explored the structure and population variability of the CACNA1C intron 3 VNTR using 155 long-read genome assemblies from 78 diverse individuals. Based on sequence differences among repeat units, we clustered individual sequences into 7 VNTR structural alleles called Types. Three Types were related through large duplications, but the other Types diverged much earlier such that only 12 repeat units at the 5′ end of the VNTR were shared across most Types. The most diverged Types were rare and present only in individuals with African ancestry, but a multiallelic structural polymorphism was present across populations at different frequencies, consistent with expansion of the VNTR preceding the emergence of early hominins. We demonstrated that this polymorphism was in complete linkage disequilibrium with fine-mapped schizophrenia variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and that this risk haplotype was associated with decreased CACNA1C gene expression in the brain. Our work suggests that sequence variation within a human-specific VNTR affects gene expression and provides a detailed characterization of new alleles at a flagship neuropsychiatric GWAS locus.",

In both injury and disease, RGC degeneration occurs in a similarly compartmentalized manner, with distinct molecular and cellular responses in the axonal and somatodendritic regions. The goal of this study was to establish a microfluidic-based platform to investigate RGC compartmentalization in both health and disease states. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs were seeded into microfluidic devices that allow physical separation of axons from the somatodendritic compartment, enabling precise study of each region. Initial experiments characterized axonal outgrowth and the specific segregation of axons and dendrites. We then examined compartment-specific phenotypes in RGCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation compared to isogenic controls, including differences in axonal growth and axonal transport efficiency, with OPTN-mutant RGCs showing reduced axon length and slower transport, hallmarks of neurodegeneration. Axonal RNA-seq analyses revealed transcriptomic alterations related to disease states, including specific transcriptomic changes along OPTN axons. To assess glial influences on axonal health, we developed models with astrocytes localized specifically to the proximal axonal compartment and modulated their disease states to simulate pathological conditions. Importantly, the induction of diseased astrocytes solely along proximal axons triggered compartment-specific neurodegenerative changes in RGCs. Collectively, this platform represents a successful recapitulation of the spatially distinct features of hPSC-derived RGCs under both healthy and disease conditions, offering a physiologically relevant, human-specific in vitro system to study neuronal development, axon–glia interactions, and mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.",

          "abstract": "Color polymorphism can influence the evolutionary fate of cryptic species because it increases populations’ chances of survival in heterogenous or variable environments. Yet, little is known about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the persistence of cryptic color polymorphisms, or the impact these polymorphisms have on the macroevolutionary dynamics of lineages. Here, we examine the evolutionary history of the most widespread cryptic color polymorphism in anurans, involving green and brown morphs. Using an order-scale comparative analysis, we show that these morphs can coexist within species over long evolutionary periods and that polymorphic lineages switch habitat more frequently and have greater diversification rates than other groups. We then identify the locus responsible for the green/brown polymorphism in a group of African grass frogs, and demonstrate that it evolves under long-term balancing selection, resulting in trans-specific polymorphism. These results provide a microevolutionary mechanism for the long-term persistence of multiple color morphs within species observed at a macroevolutionary scale. This study underscores the importance of cryptic color polymorphism in the ecology and evolution of anurans, and provides a framework for future research on the genetic architecture and selective forces underlying cryptic coloration traits.",

          "abstract": "Despite periods of permanent darkness and extensive ice coverage in polar environments, photosynthetic ice diatoms display a remarkable capability of living inside the ice matrix. How these organisms navigate such hostile conditions with limited light and extreme cold remains unknown. Using a custom subzero temperature microscope during an Arctic expedition, we present the finding of motility at record-low temperatures in a Eukaryotic cell. By characterizing the gliding motility of several ice diatom species, collected from ice cores in the Chukchi Sea, we record that they retain motility at temperatures as low as − 15 ° C. Remarkably, ice diatoms can glide on ice substrates, a capability absent in temperate diatoms of the same genus. This unique ability arises from adaptations in extracellular mucilage that allow ice diatoms to adhere to ice, essential for gliding. Even on glass substrates where both cell types retain motility at freezing temperatures, ice diatoms move an order of magnitude faster, with their optimal motility shifting toward colder temperatures. Combining field and laboratory experiments with thermo-hydrodynamic modeling, we reveal adaptive strategies that enable gliding motility in cold environments. These strategies involve increasing internal energy efficiency with minimal changes in heat capacity and activation enthalpy, and reducing external dissipation by minimizing the temperature sensitivity of mucilage viscosity. The finding of diatoms’ ice gliding motility opens new routes for understanding their survival within a harsh ecological niche and their migratory responses to environmental changes. Our work highlights the robust adaptability of ice diatoms in one of Earth’s most extreme settings.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to pose significant threats to public health, particularly vector-borne diseases. Despite dramatic recent increases in dengue that many anecdotally connect with climate change, the effect of anthropogenic climate change on dengue remains poorly quantified. To assess this link, we assembled local-level data on dengue across 21 countries in Asia and the Americas. We found a nonlinear relationship between temperature and dengue incidence with the largest impact of warming at lower temperatures, peak incidence at 27.8°C, and a decline at higher temperatures. Using this inferred temperature response, we estimate 18% (95% CI: 11 to 27%) of historical dengue incidence on average across our study countries is attributable to anthropogenic warming. Future warming could further increase incidence by 49% (95% CI: 16 to 136%) to 76% (95% CI: 27 to 239%) by midcentury for low or high emissions scenarios, respectively, with cooler regions projected to double in incidence due to warming while other currently hot regions experience little impact or even small declines. Under the highest emissions scenario, we estimate that 262 million people are currently living in places in these 21 countries where dengue incidence is expected to more than double due to climate change by midcentury. These insights highlight the major impacts of anthropogenic warming on dengue burden across most of its endemic range, providing a foundation for public health planning and the development of strategies to mitigate future risks due to climate change.",

Here, we use a combination of stable isotope imaging and tracing to reveal carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) exchanges among three symbiotic primary producers that fuel a salmon-bearing river food web. Bulk isotope analysis, nanoSIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) isotope imaging, and density centrifugation for quantitative stable isotope probing enabled quantification of organism-specific C- and N-fixation rates from the subcellular scale to the ecosystem. After winters with riverbed-scouring floods, the macroalga Cladophora glomerata uses nutrients in spring runoff to grow streamers up to 10 m long. During summer flow recession, riverine N concentrations wane and Cladophora becomes densely epiphytized by three species of Epithemia , diatoms with N-fixing endosymbionts (proto-organelles) descended from a free-living Crocosphaera cyanobacterium. Over summertime epiphyte succession on Cladophora , N-fixation rates increased as Epithemia spp. became dominant, Cladophora C-fixation declined to near zero, and Epithemia C-fixation increased. Carbon transfer to caddisflies grazing on Cladophora with high densities of Epithemia was 10-fold higher than C transfer to caddisflies grazing Cladophora with low Epithemia loads. In response to demand for N, Epithemia allocates high levels of newly fixed C to its endosymbiont. Consequently, these endosymbionts have the highest rates of C and N accumulation of any taxon in this tripartite symbiosis during the biologically productive season and can produce one of the highest areal rates of N-fixation reported in any river ecosystem.",

It is transported extracellularly as a proinflammatory mediator or late warning protein to induce immune and inflammatory reactions upon stimuli such as microbial infection. Here, we have found that HMGB1 directly interacts with bacterial DNA analogue CpG-A in the extracellular environment to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) via its positively charged DNA-binding domain. We have demonstrated that the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE) responds to stimulation of the extracellular HMGB1-CpG-A complex and triggers phase separation of the downstream adaptor protein, Src76kDa structural domain leukocyte protein (SLP76), which promotes activation of the MAPK pathway and release of inflammatory cytokines. These results not only designate that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism involved in the axis of DNA-HMGB1 stimulated RAGE-SLP76 signaling pathway but also provide evidence that the activity of HMGB1 is regulated by LLPS, highly relevant to immune responses of inflammatory cells toward microbial infection. Especially, the finding that the intracellular SLP76 forms condensates with the cytosol domain of RAGE may represent a general downstream phenomenon when an inflammatory cell membrane receptor is activated.",

          "abstract": "The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is a voltage-gated cation channel that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular excitability, especially in cardiac pacemaker cells and neurons. Its dysregulation is linked to heart diseases such as bradycardia and neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain. Structural and functional studies have revealed that the S4 voltage sensor of the HCN channel moves downward during hyperpolarization. Recent structural studies of HCN channels have shown that the extracellular portion of the S4 segment is approximately three helical turns longer than that of voltage-gated K + (Kv) channels. However, whether this extended extracellular part of S4 plays a functional role in gating is still unknown. In this study, utilizing the available HCN4 channel structures, we examined the formation of salt bridges in the extracellular part of S4 with the S5 segment and the S1-S2 linker. Results from charge-swapped mutants and double cysteine mutants suggested that sequential, stepwise salt bridge formation involving the extracellular positively charged amino acids of S4 plays a role in the voltage-dependent gating of HCN channels. Furthermore, we applied voltage clamp fluorometry to confirm that the extracellular salt bridge network affects the S4 movement. This extracellular S4 portion includes disease-related arginine residues, R375 and R378. Our results suggest that disruption of salt bridge formation may perturb the smooth transition of S4 movement and cause HCN channel dysfunction.",

However, the selectivity of the chaperones mediating Rubisco assembly in vascular plants toward their cognate Rubisco presents a substantive roadblock to both Rubisco protein engineering and transgenic expression of heterologous Rubisco orthologs, both of which necessitate changes to the Rubisco sequence. Here, we ask whether a plant Rubisco chaperone can be reprogrammed by directed evolution to accommodate a nonnative client. We developed a selection strategy to assess Rubisco assembly factor activity in high-throughput and used this selection to identify mutants of the chaperone Raf1 from Arabidopsis thaliana ( At Raf1) that assemble Nicotiana tabacum Rubisco, for which wild-type At Raf1 has minimal activity. We show that directed evolution can generate At Raf1 variants that enable significantly increased N. tabacum Rubisco assembly compared to wild-type At Raf1. Evaluation of evolved At Raf1s indicates that they retain the ability to assemble their native client and can assemble other dicot Rubisco orthologs that they were not evolved to recognize. This work may provide a strategy for addressing the constraints chaperone selectivity impose upon Rubisco-centric efforts to improve plant photosynthesis.",

In plants, seed traits such as size, yield, and dormancy are all affected by the environment during reproduction, but whether developing progeny sense temperature within the fruit or whether seasonal climate information is inherited intergenerationally from the parents remains unclear. In this study, we use intergenerational single-nucleus omics to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of seasonal temperature changes in fruits containing developing seeds of the next generation. We show that the sensing of temperature takes place specifically in maternal fruit tissues and that mothers preadapt their progeny to maternal temperature through the intergenerational flux of the hormone ABA to the zygote itself where it is sensed to affect dormancy. We conclude that mothers can control filial traits via direct transfer of hormones to progeny and propose that this is an important mechanism by which populations can rapidly adapt to environmental change.",

          "abstract": "Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4 , the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater neuronal activity than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta in response to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Finally, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.",

While bacterial and archaeal primase generate short RNA primers, the eukaryotic primase, Polα-primase, contains both RNA primase and DNA polymerase (Pol) subunits that function together to form a &gt;20 base hybrid RNA–DNA primer. Interestingly, the DNA Pol1 subunit of Polα lacks a 3’-5’ proofreading exonuclease, contrary to the high-fidelity normally associated with DNA replication. However, Polδ and Polε synthesize the majority of the eukaryotic genome, and both contain 3’-5’ exonuclease activity for high fidelity. Nonetheless, even the small amount of DNA produced by Pol1 in each of the many RNA/DNA primers during chromosome replication adds up to tens of millions of nucleotides in a human genome. Thus, it has been a longstanding question why Pol1 lacks a proofreading exonuclease. We show here that Polα is uniquely capable of traversing common oxidized or hydrolyzed template nucleotides and propose that Polα evolved to bypass these common template lesions when they are encountered during chromosome replication. Additionally, we show a unique ability of replication factor C (RFC) to stimulate Polδ lesion bypass, independent of its sliding clamp. This suggests that there may be a coordination between Polδ and RFC that does not involve RFC loading of PCNA.",

Targeting this pathway represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human REV1, a ca. 100 amino acid scaffold essential for TLS polymerase interactions, disrupts REV1/POLζ-dependent TLS in mammalian cells. Inducible expression of REV1-CTD in multiple human and murine cancer cell lines sensitizes cells to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, and methyl methanesulfonate, without intrinsic cytotoxicity. REV1-CTD expression increases genomic instability, decreases mutagenesis, and enhances G2 arrest following genotoxic stress. Mutational disruption of the CTD’s interaction interfaces abrogates these effects, confirming a dominant-negative mechanism via sequestration of TLS components. In a xenograft mouse model, REV1-CTD expression markedly enhances cisplatin efficacy, significantly reducing tumor burden. These findings establish the REV1-CTD as an effective dominant-negative inhibitor of TLS and support its development as a therapeutic agent delivered to cancer cells to enhance the efficacy of genotoxic chemotherapy.",

In this study, we found that increased severity in IAV infection and reduced innate immune response correlated with extensive mitophagy in senescent human cells and in the lung of aged mice. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) was identified as strongly elevated in the lungs and sera of aged human (&gt;65 y old) and mouse (&gt;21 mo old). ApoD was able to localize to mitochondria and interact, through its WXXI motif in the LC3B-Interacting Region domain, with LC3B to trigger mitophagy during IAV infection, in a PINK1 pathway independent manner, which attenuated type I interferon response and promoted virus replication. ApoD deficiency, on the other hand, protected older mice from severe influenza and improved survival. Likewise, depletion of senescent cells by ABT-263, a senolytic compound, in aged mice lowered ApoD level and restored innate immune antiviral response, limiting virus propagation and associated pulmonary damage. Thus, age-induced ApoD drives IAV-mediated mitophagy, and promotes virus replication and infection severity, and is therefore a promising target for inhibition to improve disease outcome in older patients.",

This increase is initiated by the male seminal fluid protein ovulin and is executed by female pathways, including octopamine (OA) neuronal signaling. Despite OA signaling’s central role in ovulation regulation, the broader molecular landscape underlying female control of ovulation remains poorly understood. Here, using ovulin as a probe, we performed evolutionary rate covariation and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction screens to identify candidate female ovulation-regulating proteins. Ovulation assays performed on knockdowns or mutants of identified membrane-protein candidates revealed seven important female ovulation regulators: Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, mthl9, Smog, Cirl, and CG6067. Lgr3 and GabaβR1 function in an ovulin-dependent manner, while SIFaR and mthl9 regulate ovulation independently of ovulin. For proteins with known nervous system expression, we examined their requirement in OA neurons and their expression in female reproductive tract neurons. Tissue-specific knockdown revealed that Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, and CG6067 act in OA neurons to influence ovulation, highlighting OA neurons as a key signaling hub. Additionally, Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, Smog, and Cirl are expressed in OA neurons innervating the reproductive tract, suggesting a potential local function. Finally, we identified evidence of recurrent positive selection having acted on residues within Smog’s ligand binding region, which is interesting in light of ovulin’s rapid evolution. Together, these findings significantly expand our understanding of the molecular networks regulating ovulation following mating in Drosophila .",

However, understanding how wild predators may use multimodal sensing when hunting prey in split-second interactions remains largely unexplored. As nocturnal hunters, bats rely on echolocation to navigate and to locate evasive prey, yet they have retained functional vision, despite the associated costs. We therefore hypothesized that bats use vision to enhance sensory redundancy when commuting and tracking small insects. To test this, we equipped 21 wild common noctule bats ( Nyctalus noctula ) with high-resolution light, sound, and motion sensor loggers and measured their echolocation and movements while commuting and foraging in both dark and lit environments. When commuting, the bats maintained consistent echolocation sampling across light levels. However, when tracking prey in illuminated environments, the bats emitted calls with half the rate and with 7 dB higher call levels compared to in dark conditions, but at much faster approach speeds (from 5.2 in darkness to 7.9 m/s in lit conditions). This suggests that, in illuminated environments, hunting bats integrate acoustic and visual information, resulting in more efficient approaches to prey. Our findings demonstrate how a wild sensory specialist predator uses multimodal sensing to hunt efficiently in highly dynamic resource landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Up to 10 to 20% of the proteome contains regions with much lower amino acid diversity than would be expected by chance. This year’s Lasker Basic Science Award is given to Steven McKnight and Dirk Görlich for their pioneering work on such low-complexity domains (LCDs). They showed, using a variety of elegant approaches, that such LCDs can form homotypic and heterotypic interactions that lead to reversible phase separations in cells. These phase separations, which in the laboratory manifest as hydrogels and in cells as membrane free structures (liquid condensates) such as P bodies and stress granules, form hubs for molecular processes such as transcription and messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and also underlie the selectivity of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which act a barriers to large molecules unless they are escorted by specific LCD containing nuclear transporters that interact with LCD containing nucleoporins within NPC channels. Naturally occurring LCD mutations linked to neurodegeneration and other diseases cause the formation of irreversible (rather than reversible) LCD polymers, resulting in insoluble, amyloid-like, fibrils, underscoring the critical importance of these domains.",

          "abstract": "Organisms often face multiple selective pressures simultaneously (e.g., mine tailings with multiple heavy metal contaminants), yet we know little about when adaptation to one stressor provides cross-tolerance or cross-intolerance to other stressors. To explore the potential for cross-tolerance, we adapted Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high concentrations of six single metals in a short-term evolutionary rescue experiment. We then measured cross-tolerance of each metal-adapted line to the other five metals. We tested three predictors for the degree of cross-tolerance, based on similarity in 1) the physiochemical properties of each metal pair, 2) the overlap in genes known to impact tolerance to both metals, and 3) their co-occurrence in the environment. None of these predictors explained significant variation in cross-tolerance. Instead, the strongest predictor was the metal in which adaptation occurred: Cobalt-adapted lines performed well in most metals (generalists) while manganese-adapted lines typically performed poorly (specialists). To determine the genetic basis, we sequenced the genomes of 109 metal-adapted lines. Broader cross-tolerance characterized lines bearing mutations affecting phosphorus metabolism, with three genes related to phosphate metabolism bearing several independent mutations ( PHO84 , SIW14 , VTC4 ). Thus, while a genome-wide analysis failed to predict cross-tolerance, a subset of genes facilitated growth in multiple metals. We also observed two “mutator” lines (both in manganese) and report evidence that cadmium, cobalt, and manganese altered the mutation spectrum. While it is challenging to predict how evolutionary adaptation to one stressor will impact tolerance to other stresses, our work helps reveal the environments and pathways that contribute to cross-tolerance among metals.",

Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of sporadic and familial BDII patients, we found that Serinc2 expression showed deficits in iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, resulting in decreased synaptic pruning. Further, combining the microglia-specific Serinc2-deficient mouse and iPSC-microglia models, we found that microglial Serinc2 deficits functioned through attenuating the synthesis of serine-related phospholipids in the plasma membrane, thus resulting in depression-like behavioral abnormalities in the animals. Finally, we showed that the Serinc2-dependent lipid deficits diminished microglial membrane CR3 formation to interrupted synaptic pruning signals from neurons. Therefore, our results indicated that Serinc2 deficits in microglia might contribute to the pathogenesis of BD.",

However, dozens of historically clear streams have recently turned orange and turbid. Thawing permafrost is thought to have exposed sulfide minerals to weathering, delivering iron and other potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report stream water metal concentrations throughout the federally designated Wild and Scenic Salmon River watershed and compare them with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic (4-d) exposure thresholds for toxicity to aquatic life. The main stem of the Salmon had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca relative to a predisturbance baseline for most of its length, consistent with increased sulfide mineral weathering. Most of the tributaries also had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca, especially those in the upper watershed. The Salmon River mainstem consistently exceeded EPA chronic exposure thresholds for total recoverable iron, total recoverable aluminum, and dissolved cadmium from its first major tributary to its mouth. Nine of ten major tributaries that we sampled exceeded EPA thresholds for at least one metal on at least one of three sampling dates. Our findings indicate that habitat quality for resident and anadromous fish has been severely degraded in the Salmon River watershed. Loss of important spawning habitat in the Salmon and many other streams in the region might help explain a recent crash in chum salmon returns, which local communities depend upon for commercial and subsistence harvest.",

          "abstract": "Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) is the central prey species in the Southern Ocean food web, supporting the largest and fastest-growing fishery in the region, managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Climate change is threatening krill populations and their predators, while current catch limits do not take into account climate variability or krill population dynamics. In 2024, CCAMLR was unable to renew its spatial catch limits, highlighting the urgent need for improved management of the krill fishery to prevent any harm to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. To address this, we propose a management framework that integrates variability in krill recruitment and key pathways between spawning and nursery areas—a krill stock hypothesis—to inform decisions on catch limits and conservation measures. Implementing this approach will require targeted data collection, which we propose can be achieved through a multisector collaborative network that combines traditional and new technologies, including the use of fishing vessels as data collection platforms. We use case studies to demonstrate how fisheries can contribute to data collection while promoting sustainable management. A major challenge in this effort is securing long-term funding for data collection, which is critical for managing climate-sensitive populations of high commercial interest. We therefore recommend using the industry as a source of funding, research platform and data provider, alongside national research funding opportunities. Given the fundamental role of krill in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, its decline would have cascading effects on predators and essential ecosystem services.",

          "abstract": "Excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs), composed of the glycine-binding NMDA receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN3A, have recently emerged as a novel neuronal signaling modality that challenges the traditional view of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Unlike conventional GluN1/GluN2 NMDARs, the distribution and role of eGlyRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that eGlyRs are highly enriched in the ventral hippocampus (VH) and confer distinct properties on this brain region. eGlyRs display a massive expression in both VH CA1 pyramidal cells and SST- and PV-positive interneurons, whereas in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) pyramidal cells lack these receptors. eGlyRs mediate excitatory tonic currents and control VH network excitability. They are also responsible for the attenuated long-term potentiation (LTP) in the VH compared with the DH, providing a molecular basis for this difference. Furthermore, eGlyRs are required for regulation of VH LTP by corticosterone, pointing to eGlyRs as mediators of the neuroendocrine stress response. Consistent with this pervasive influence in the ventral division of the hippocampus, eGlyRs contribute to the modulation of anxiety-related behaviors. Our work identifies eGlyRs as key players in VH circuitry and function, demonstrating their intimate association with brain regions that control internal states and emotional processing.",

However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue. The interfaces achieve light-controlled in vivo neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution.",

Electrophysiological recordings in postsubiculum, the cortical head direction (HD) system hub, confirmed a preference for visual objects in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons.

One major problem is that regulatory and policy requirements force researchers to spend nearly half of their research time on paperwork associated with receiving federal grants and contracts, not on discovery. The situation is made worse when research institutions themselves layer on additional requirements to ensure compliance. The administrative tasks are unnecessarily complex, duplicative, and, in some cases, contradictory. They also waste taxpayer dollars intended for scientific discovery and innovation.

We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.",

Initially this fibroblast response reorganized fibrillar collagen and stiffened the myocardium albeit without depositing fibrotic tissue. These adaptations coincided with heightened matrix-integrin receptor interactions and diastolic tension sensation at focal adhesions within fibroblasts. Targeted p38 deletion arrested these cardiac fibroblast responses in DCM mice, which prevented cardiomyocyte remodeling and improved contractility.

By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.",

This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM 2.5 levels in the EUS.

Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.",

Among photosynthetic organisms, PSI-LHC (light-harvesting complex) structures exhibit substantial differences in their sizes, reflecting adaptation to different light environments. Here we report the structure of a PSI-fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding protein (FCPI) supercomplex from the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Eh) at 2.79-angstrom resolution by cryo–electron microscopy, which showed a huge Eh-PSI-FCPI supercomplex containing 38 peripheral Eh-FCPI antennae and a linker protein (EhLP) in addition to the PSI core. A network of 819 pigments was found in Eh-PSI-FCPI, which functions to capture and transfer light energy with 95% quantum efficiency. This elucidates how its modular Eh-FCPI arrangement contributes to the expansion of PSI cross section and efficient light harvesting.",

          "abstract": "Isolated cluster systems can help to elucidate the molecular level description of water-mediated proton transfer. Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid ( O -protomer) and amine ( N -protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH + ·(H 2 O) 6 ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale. These results quantify the kinetics of proton transfers in the context of a closed, finite system at well-defined internal energies and therefore provide experimental benchmarks for theoretical efforts that are being developed to treat relatively slow, highly cooperative solvent-mediated chemical processes.",

A psychiatrist's investigation revealed that AI therapy chatbots encouraged troubled teens to “get rid of” parents and made sexual suggestions while falsely claiming to be licensed therapists. Reports emerged of a man hospitalized after following ChatGPT’s advice to add sodium bromide to his diet.

This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked. These understudied circuits and nontraditional network dynamics such as dentate spikes have recently begun to yield fresh insights into unconventional circuit computations that extend the repertoire of hippocampal function beyond current models.",

We analyzed global forest fragmentation from 2000 to 2020 using complementary metrics that captured patch connectivity, aggregation, and structure. Connectivity-based metrics revealed that 51 to 67% of forests globally—and 58 to 80% of tropical forests—became more fragmented, which is nearly twice the rate suggested by traditional structure-focused methods (30 to 35%). Aggregation-focused metrics confirmed increases in 57 to 83% of forests. Human activities such as agriculture and logging drive this change. Yet protected tropical areas saw up to an 82% reduction in fragmentation, underscoring the potential of targeted conservation.",

We determined a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the endogenous Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex showing that Pfs48/45 interacts with Pfs230 domains 13 and 14. Transgenic parasite lines with these domains removed were defective in Pfs230 gamete localization and showed reduced oocyst formation. Nanobodies against domains 13 and 14 inhibited Pfs230-Pfs48/45 complex formation and reduced transmission, and structural analyses revealed their epitopes.

We combine provider knowledge assessments and over 2000 anonymous standardized patient visits to providers in India to examine why they overprescribe antibiotics for pediatric diarrhea and figure out how to reduce overprescribing. Seventy percent of providers prescribed antibiotics without indication of bacterial infection. Knowledge gaps explain little: 62% of providers who knew antibiotics were inappropriate still prescribed them. Closing this “know-do gap” would reduce prescribing by 30 percentage points, versus only 6 points if all providers had perfect knowledge. Using randomized experiments, we revealed that the know-do gap stems from providers’ beliefs that patients want antibiotics, not from profit motives or lack of alternative treatments. Yet, a discrete choice experiment suggests patients do not prefer providers who give antibiotics. Our findings indicate that addressing provider misperceptions about patient preferences may be more effective than standard information-based interventions in reducing antibiotic overuse.",

However, the fabrication of three-dimensionally (3D) architected electronic devices with ordered constructions of network microstructures remains challenging. Here, we introduce the tensile buckling of stacked multilayer precursors as a unique route to 3D network materials with regularly distributed 3D microstructures. A data-driven topology optimization framework enables efficient search of the optimal 2D precursor pattern that maximizes out-of-plane dimension of the resulting 3D network material. Computational and experimental results demonstrate rational assembly of optimal multilayer precursor structures into well-architected 3D network materials with an evident interlayer separation. The resulting 3D network materials offer anisotropic, tunable J-shaped stress-strain curves, which can be tailored to reproduce stress-strain responses of biological tissues. Demonstration of reconfigurable volumetric 3D display suggests rich application opportunities in biointegrated electronics and tissue scaffolds.",

In plants, they also serve as precursors to phytohormones and specialized metabolites important for development, defense, and health. Although the sterol biosynthetic pathway is considered well-characterized, we report the discovery of a plant-specific cytochrome b 5 –like protein, CB5LP, as a critical component of phytosterol biosynthesis. Loss of CB5LP in Arabidopsis causes embryonic defects, seedling lethality, and accumulation of 14α-methyl-sterols, with reduced levels of sitosterol and stigmasterol—indicating a defect in sterol 14α-demethylation. TurboID-based proximity labeling and in vitro assays show that CB5LP physically and functionally interacts with CYP51, a cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing this demethylation step. Unlike canonical cytochrome b 5 proteins, CB5LP has a reversed topology and is exclusive to plants, acting as an evolutionarily distinct electron donor. This discovery reveals an uncharacterized redox partnership essential for sterol biosynthesis and highlights a promising target for the development of selective herbicide.",

          "abstract": "Insects, unlike vertebrates, use heteromeric complexes of odorant receptors and co-receptors for olfactory signal transduction. However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP 3 ) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP 3 levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP 3 is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP 3 as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts. These findings elucidate the universal function of IP 3 in olfactory signal perception, shedding light on the key nodes of insect olfactory signal transduction.",

Our analysis, combined with additional synthesis, supports a hypothesis that the net land sink is substantially weaker than commonly reported. At a global scale, our estimate of the net land carbon sink is 0.8 ± 0.7 petagrams of carbon per year from 2000 through 2019, nearly a factor of two lower than the Global Carbon Project estimate. With concurrent adjustments to ocean (+8%) and fossil fuel (−6%) fluxes, we develop a budget that partially reconciles key constraints provided by vegetation carbon, the north-south CO 2 gradient, and O 2 trends. We further outline potential modifications to models to improve agreement with a weaker land sink and describe several approaches for testing the hypothesis.",

Experimental characterization indicates stable single-mode operation over a wide injection current range (65 to 300 milliamperes), exhibiting a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 decibels. The laser’s Voigt linewidth was reduced from 2 megahertz to 4.2 kilohertz, with an intrinsic linewidth of 983 hertz extracted from power spectrum density, underscoring the MOIL-TISE laser’s promise for coherent communications and modulation-free quantum key distribution applications.",

Collectively, the results from single-cell sequencing of five diagnostic leukemia samples demonstrated that somatic mtDNA mutations can arise early in leukemogenesis and undergo positive selection during disease progression, achieving intermediate heteroplasmy—a “sweet spot” that balances mitochondrial dysfunction with cellular fitness. Network-based systems biology analyses link specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations to metabolic reprogramming and therapy resistance.

Rapid eye movement SD (REM SD) modulates the excitability of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons, influencing the synaptic plasticity of pyramidal neurons. However, the precise mechanism remains undefined. To investigate this, we used a modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to induce 12 hours of REM SD, specifically targeting VIP neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our results show that REM SD mitigated depression by suppressing VIP neurons activity, which directly increased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and, consequently, promoted synaptic plasticity recovery. In addition, the knockdown of VPAC2 on mPFC pyramidal neurons revealed that VPAC2-mediated AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in these neurons is essential for REM SD to mitigate depression-like behavior. These findings suggest that VIP neurons directly regulate pyramidal neurons and are crucial in alleviating depression by REM SD.",

Early-season westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been suggested to be important for ENSO evolution and diversity, with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) among the main sources of WWBs. However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role. These findings suggest that March MJO activity alone may not be a reliable predictor for ENSO evolution, but underscore the importance of North Pacific atmospheric variability.",

In a humanized xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, they dampen T cell activation, alleviate GVHD pathology, and prolong survival without impairing antileukemia activity. Mechanistically, CD8 T rp cells promote immune regulation by inducing FOXP3 expression in both CD4 T reg cells and themselves.

Knockout of either OsbZIP35 or OsTCP19 results in increased grain length, confirming their regulatory roles in grain development.

To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms.

One of the core bottlenecks in multidimensional manipulation is the lack of a systematic design methodology, which prevents the generation of an acoustic field that simultaneously meets the collaborative control requirements of multi-degree-of-freedom forces and torques, making it difficult to achieve precise control under conditions of stable suspension, high-frequency rotation, and complex spatial constraints. To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end inverse design methodology for acoustic tweezers based on coding metasurfaces, establishing a dual-objective, dual-scale optimization paradigm. At the microscale, the phase modulation and transmission efficiency are co-optimized through coupled physical models. While at the mesoscale, the particle suspension and rotation dynamics are considered. Based on the inverse design framework constructed with a finite-bit element library, we successfully optimized the metasurface configuration with specific acoustic response characteristics and achieved noncontact, multi-degree-of-freedom customized manipulation of individual particles.

          "abstract": "Salicylic acid (SA) is a key defense hormone shaped by temperature. High temperatures suppress, while low temperatures enhance, SA biosynthesis and signaling, thereby influencing plant immunity and temperature resilience. This review synthesizes current understanding of how temperature modulates SA pathways and their cross-talk with other hormones to balance growth and defense. We also propose a conceptual model positioning SA as a central integrator of temperature perception, immune regulation, and hormonal signaling. However, key questions remain: How do plants sense temperature shifts to regulate SA dynamics? How do temperature-induced epigenetic changes in SA pathways contribute to long-term adaptation? And how can these insights inform crop improvement? Addressing these gaps is essential for developing climate-resilient crops.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic transducers require films that demonstrate both toughness and fatigue resistance, presenting notable challenges when achieved through conventional nanoscale reinforcing strategies. Here, we found that the rib structure of a cicada’s tymbal exhibits exceptional toughness and fatigue resistance, attributed to its unique architecture composed of alternating soft and stiff polymer layers. Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life. The nanoconfined crystallization restricts molecular motion and disperses external forces within the crystalline structure, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties. These improvements enable the ARF to outperform commercial polymer films as an acoustic transducer, achieving 2.7 times increase in frequency response and 2.2 times increase in displacement amplitude.",

However, their long-term functionality remains limited due to signal degradation caused by acute insertion trauma, chronic foreign body reaction (FBR), and biofouling at the device-tissue interface. To address these challenges, we introduce a multifunctional surface modification strategy called targeting-specific interaction and blocking nonspecific adhesion (TAB) coating for flexible fiber, achieving a synergistic integration of mechanical compliance and biochemical stability. The coating combines brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) conjugation and a lubricant-infused surface. This dual-functional design enables selective interaction with neurons and astrocytes while preventing nonspecific adhesion. Notably, high-quality single-unit neural signals were stably recorded for more than 12 months after implantation, demonstrating exceptional long-term recording performance. Integrating mechanical compatibility, antifouling properties, and selective neural cell interaction, the TAB-coated multifunctional fiber represents a transformative approach for neural implants, bridging biological systems with computational systems.",

          "abstract": "The locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC-NE) system regulates arousal and awakening; however, it remains unclear whether the LC does this in a global or circuit-specific manner. We hypothesized that sensory-evoked awakenings are predominantly regulated by specific LC-NE efferent pathways. Anatomical, physiological, and functional modularities of LC-NE pathways involving the mouse basal forebrain (BF) and pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) were tested. We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC → PRN and LC → BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN. Causal optogenetic interrogation of LC efferent pathways, by retro-channelrhodopsin (ChR2) activation or Platynereis dumerilii ciliary opsin (PdCO) silencing of synapses in target regions, revealed a role for early LC → PRN activity in driving arousal and sound-evoked awakenings. Together, our results uncover a role for early LC-NE PRN activity in connecting sensory and arousal pathways and establish LC heterogeneity in regulating arousal.",

On the basis of a multimodel ensemble of historical aerosol forcing simulation for a period of global aerosol increase during 1965 to 1989, here, we show that the precipitation response shares a common southward displacement of tropical rain bands but the magnitude differs markedly among models, accounting for 76% of the intermodel uncertainty in zonal-mean precipitation change. Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands. This has important implications for understanding and reducing intermodel uncertainty in anthropogenic climate change.",

Clinical programs have centered on neutralizing mAbs, only to be thwarted by strain specificity and rapid viral escape. We instead engineered three non-neutralizing IgG2a mAbs that target distinct, overlapping epitopes within the conserved N terminus of the M2 ectodomain (M2e). Combined at low dose, this “triple M2e-mAb” confers robust prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice challenged with diverse human and zoonotic IAV strains, including highly pathogenic variants. Therapeutic efficacy depends on Fc-mediated effector activity via FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV, rather than in vitro neutralization. Serial passaging in triple M2e-mAb–treated immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts failed to generate viral escape mutants. Our findings redefine the influenza-specific antibody therapeutic design and support Fc-optimized, non-neutralizing M2e-mAbs as a broadly effective, mutation-resistant, off-the-shelve therapy with direct relevance to human pandemic preparedness.",

Here, based on in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified PTDSS1 as a target to improve anti–PD-1 therapy. Depletion of Ptdss1 in tumor cells increased expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–regulated genes, including B2m , Cxcl9 , Cxcl10 , and Stat1 , even in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation in vitro. Loss of Ptdss1 in tumor cells also led to increased expression of MHC-I, enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8 + T cells, and increased frequency of an iNOS + myeloid subset. A gene signature derived from the iNOS + myeloid cell subset correlated with clinical benefit in patients treated with anti–PD-1 therapy. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Ptdss1 in different tumor models improved anti–PD-1 therapy. Together, our results provide insights on a therapeutic strategy for overcoming immunosuppression by inhibiting PTDSS1 and provide rationale for development of a combination immunotherapy strategy composed of PTDSS1 inhibition plus PD-1 blockade.",

Here, we introduce a liquid-amplified electrostatic rolling (LAER) mechanism, which elegantly integrates actuation and adhesion into a streamline single-degree-of-freedom structure. Based on this, we developed a rigid tethered LAER roller (0.015 grams) that exhibited a rapid moving speed of ~210 body length per second on ceilings and a flexible tethered roller (10.600 grams) that had a load-to-weight ratio of ~121 moving on the ground. Liquid regulating modules were embedded into LAER structures to exhibit controlled moving. We also developed a single-wheeled and two-wheeled untethered LAER robots with onboard power supply. Furthermore, we demonstrate a LAER linear actuator and a camera equipped untethered LAER robot for preliminary environmental monitoring. The lightweight, scalable LAER structure is promising to bring fast electrostatic actuators, motors, and robots with superior load-to-weight ratios and multimodal locomotion capabilities such as turning, circular moving, and plane-to-plane transitioning.",

The molecular causes of low milk production are not well understood. Fresh milk samples from 30 lactating individuals, classified by milk production levels across postpartum stages, were analyzed using genomic and microbiome techniques. Bulk RNA sequencing of milk fat globules (MFGs), milk cells, and breast tissue revealed that MFG-derived RNA closely mirrors luminal milk cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA analyses identified changes in gene expression and cellular composition, highlighting key genes ( GLP1R , PLIN4 , and KLF10 ) and cell-type differences between low and high producers. Infant microbiome diversity was influenced by feeding type but not maternal milk production. This study provides a comprehensive human milk transcriptomic catalog and highlights that MFG could serve as a useful biomarker for milk transcriptome analysis, offering insights into the genetic factors influencing milk production.",

Early in chordate evolution, some α subunits acquired an “inserted” (I) domain that expanded integrin’s ligand-binding repertoire but obstructed the ancestral ligand pocket, seemingly blocking conventional integrin activation. Here, we compare cryo–electron microscopy structures of apo and ligand-bound states of the I domain–containing αEβ 7 integrin and the I domain–lacking α 4 β 7 integrin to illuminate how the I domain intrinsically mimics an extrinsic ligand to preserve integrin function. We trace the I domain’s evolutionary origin to an ancestral collagen-collagen interaction domain, identifying an ancient molecular exaptation that facilitated integrin activation immediately upon I domain insertion. Our analyses reveal the evolutionary and biochemical basis of expanded cellular communication in vertebrates.",
