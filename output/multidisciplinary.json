          "title": "The geoeconomic turn in decarbonization",
          "authors": "Jonas Meckling",
          "abstract": "The rise of green industrial policy is transforming efforts to decarbonize the global economy and mitigate climate change. The first three decades of climate policy centred on international cooperation on dividing up the costs of mitigation. In the new era of green industrial policy, geoeconomic competition for the benefits of decarbonization has emerged alongside international cooperation on emissions reductions. Governments invest in the manufacturing and deployment of clean technologies to advance economic development, energy security and emissions cuts. Geoeconomic competition has the potential to accelerate global decarbonization by facilitating greater technology deployment, speeding up technology cost declines and, thus, lowering the barriers to climate action. However, it also creates major pitfalls by facilitating the rise of trade protectionism, creating international conflict, and reproducing economic divides between richer and poorer, yet growing, countries. It is thus uncertain how the geoeconomic turn will impact global decarbonization. Meanwhile, policymakers are asking fundamental questions about how to design industrial policy, manage politics, develop institutions, and deal with the trade-offs between economic, climate and security goals. This Perspective demonstrates the recent geoeconomic turn in decarbonization, lays out its implications for policymaking, identifies global spillovers and addresses research needs.",

          "abstract": "Kinetically trapping the high-temperature states through rapid cooling solidification is widely used for the synthesis of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), especially those with intrinsically immiscible elemental combinations1,2,3,4. However, strategies need to be developed to overcome the fundamental limitations of rapid cooling solidification in controlling the crystallinity, structure and morphology of HEAs. Here we introduce an isothermal solidification strategy for the synthesis of HEAs by rapidly altering the metal alloy composition through liquid–liquid interface reactions at low temperatures, for example, from 25 °C to 80 °C. We use gallium (Ga)-based metal as the sacrificial reagent and mixing medium. By directing the reactions to the interfaces between the Ga-based liquid metal and an aqueous metal ion solution, the foreign metal ions can be reduced at the interfaces and incorporated into the liquid metal quickly. HEAs with various crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal and amorphous), morphology (zero, two and three dimensions) and compositions can be achieved through the isothermal solidification. Ga can be completely consumed, resulting in Ga-free HEAs. If desired, Ga can be one of the metal elements in the final products. In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies and theoretical analysis show the isothermal solidification mechanisms. Our direct observations show the enhanced mixing of liquid metal elements and the solidification process with fluctuating nucleation dynamics. The isothermal solidification marks a powerful strategy for HEA synthesis through an unexplored pathway of kinetically trapping the high-entropy states.",

          "abstract": "Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.",

          "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2,3,4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Polymer electrolytes paired with lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxide (LRMO) cathodes and anode-free cell design are considered one of the most promising high-energy-density and high-safety systems1,2,3,4. However, the unstable anode morphological changes and the irreversible anionic reactions at the electrolyte–cathode interfaces induce oxygen escape and catalytic decomposition of polymer electrolytes, resulting in severe interfacial degradation and poor cycling stability. Here we design an in-built fluoropolyether-based polymer electrolyte composed of strongly solvating polyether and weakly solvating fluorohydrocarbon pendants, creating an anion-rich solvation structure and thus anion-derived fluorine-rich interfacial layers on the cathode and anode to resist interfacial issues. The LRMO cathode exhibits improved oxygen redox reversibility with substantially reduced oxygen-involving interfacial side reactions. This quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte with 30 wt% trimethyl phosphate enables an LRMO cathode with a reversible high-areal-capacity cycling (>8 mAh cm−2) in pouch cells and long-term stability (>500 cycles at 25 °C) in coin cells, respectively. The pouch cells exhibit an energy density of 604 Wh kg−1 (1,027 Wh l−1) and excellent safety under a nail penetration at a fully charged condition. Our work, therefore, provides a promising direction for creating practical high-energy-density and high-safety lithium batteries.",

          "abstract": "Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for realizing useful quantum computers1,2,3. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and correct errors, we can achieve low logical error rates. However, for many practical quantum error correction codes such as the surface code, owing to syndrome measurement errors, standard constructions require multiple extraction rounds—of the order of the code distance d—for fault-tolerant computation, particularly considering fault-tolerant state preparation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Here we show that logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of extraction rounds for a broad class of quantum error correction codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feedforward, to achieve ‘transversal algorithmic fault tolerance’. Through the combination of transversal operations7 and new strategies for correlated decoding13, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal logical measurement distribution can be made exponentially small in the distance, even if the instantaneous quantum state cannot be made close to a logical codeword because of measurement errors. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of quantum fault tolerance and has the potential to reduce the space–time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by over an order of magnitude.",

Rapid advances in single-cell technologies, coupled with the phylogenetic expansion in genome sequencing, present opportunities for the molecular characterization of cells across a broad range of organisms.

This community effort will be phylogenetically informed, rely on high-quality genomes and use shared standards to facilitate comparisons across species.

Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS–STING signalling 3 .

Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1 4 , in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS–STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.",

          "abstract": "Volcanic crises, driven by renewed magma inflow and migration, result in surface deformation and seismicity that can provide unique insights into the structure of volcanic systems and magmatic processes. Although the highly explosive volcanoes of Santorini and Kolumbo 1,2 in the Greek Aegean Sea are just 7 km apart, their potentially coupled deep magmatic feeding systems are only poorly understood 3,4 . The 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis of Santorini simultaneously affected both volcanic centres, providing insights into a complex, multistorage feeder system. Here we integrate onshore and marine seismological data with geodetic measurements to reconstruct magma migration before and during the crisis. Gradual inflation in the Santorini caldera, beginning in mid-2024, preceded the January 2025 intrusion of a magma-filled dike sourced from a mid-crustal reservoir beneath Kolumbo, indicating a link between the two volcanoes. Joint inversion of ground and satellite-based deformation data indicates that approximately 0.31 km 3 of magma intruded as an approximately 13-km-long dike, reactivating principal regional faults and arresting 3–5 km below the seafloor. The 2024–2025 resurgence of magmatic activity beneath both volcanic centres and their apparent coupling provides insights into the dynamic interplay of magma storage, transport and reservoir failure beneath neighbouring volcanoes.",

          "abstract": "Chromosomal linkages formed through crossover recombination are essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis 1 . The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes 2 . Imperatively, the biased resolution of double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates into crossovers 3,4 occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologues during the pachytene stage 5,6 . However, the role of the SC in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into non-crossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, the stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs effectively coupling synapsis to dHJ formation and desynapsis to resolution. However, dHJ protection and CRC maintenance can occur without end-to-end homologue synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution to ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes.",

          "abstract": "Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1,2,3,4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces’ defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6,7,8,9,10,11,12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13,14,15,16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements.",

          "abstract": "Holliday junctions (HJs) are branched four-way DNA structures that link recombining chromosomes during double-strand break repair 1 . Despite posing a risk to chromosome segregation, HJs accumulate during meiotic prophase I as intermediates in the process of crossing-over 2,3 . Whether HJs have additional regulatory functions remains unclear. Here we establish an experimental system in budding yeast that enables conditional nucleolytic resolution of HJs after the establishment of meiotic chromosome synapsis. We find that HJ resolution triggers complete disassembly of the synaptonemal complex without disrupting the axis–loop organization of chromosomes. Mechanistically, HJs mediate the continued association of ZMM proteins with recombination nodules that form at the axes interface of homologous chromosome pairs. ZMM proteins, in turn, promote polymerization of the synaptonemal complex while simultaneously protecting HJs from processing by non-crossover pathways. Thus, reciprocal feedback between ZMMs, which stabilize HJs, and HJs, which retain ZMM proteins at future crossover sites, maintains chromosome synapsis until HJ-resolving enzymes are activated during exit from prophase I. Notably, by polymerizing and maintaining the synaptonemal complex structure, the HJ–ZMM interplay suppresses de novo double-strand break formation and recombination reinitiation. In doing so, this interplay suppresses the DNA damage response, enabling meiotic progression without unrepaired breaks and supporting crossover assurance.",

Here we report two mammaliamorphs with novel shapes of secondary jaw joint, offering insight into the evolution of the mammalian jaw. The first, Polistodon8, a Middle Jurassic herbivorous tritylodontid with a relatively large body size and a lifestyle that is likely to have been fossorial, uniquely evolved a dentary–jugal articulation. The second, an Early Jurassic morganucodontan, exhibits a dentary–squamosal joint that lacks a bulbous condyle, supporting the hypothesis that the mammalian dentary condyle was formed by expansion of the lateral ridge of the dentary9. These diverse joints reflect repeated evolutionary experimentation in advanced cynodonts, in which secondary jaw joints arose independently7,10, and in which the load-bearing dentary–squamosal joint is a synapomorphy of mammaliaforms. Although body miniaturization might have driven this transformation11, our findings indicate that other factors were involved, such as jaw-muscle reorganization, feeding ecology and masticatory behaviour7,12,13,14,15,16,17. The ecomorphological diversity of these taxa suggest that phenotypic plasticity and environmentally induced morphological changes18,19,20 could have shaped jaw-joint evolution, emphasizing how ecological pressures and developmental flexibility guided the diversification of jaw structures in mammalian ancestors.",

Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis 3,4 .

Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.",

          "abstract": "Neural activity in awake organisms shows widespread, spatiotemporally diverse correlations with behavioural and physiological measurements1,2,3,4. We propose that this covariation reflects in part the structured, nonlinear dynamics of an underlying arousal-related process that organizes brain-wide and body-wide physiology on the timescale of seconds. By framing this interpretation within dynamical systems theory, we arrive at a surprising prediction: a single, scalar measurement of arousal (for example, pupil diameter) should suffice to reconstruct the continuous evolution of multidimensional, spatiotemporal measurements of large-scale brain physiology. Here, to test this hypothesis, we perform multimodal cortex-wide optical imaging5 and behavioural monitoring in awake mice. We demonstrate that the seconds-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal calcium, metabolism and brain blood oxygen can be accurately and parsimoniously modelled from a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold reconstructed from a time delay embedding6,7 of pupil diameter. Extending this framework to behavioural and electrophysiological measurements from the Allen Brain Observatory8, we demonstrate the ability to integrate diverse experimental data into a unified generative model via mappings from a shared arousal manifold. Our results support the hypothesis9 that spontaneous, spatially structured fluctuations in brain-wide physiology on timescales of seconds—widely interpreted to reflect regionally specific neural communication10,11—are in large part expressions of a low-dimensional, organism-wide dynamical system. In turn, reframing arousal itself as a latent dynamical system offers a new perspective on fluctuations in brain, body and behaviour observed across modalities, contexts and scales.",

Previous studies have rejected the idea of a single origin and instead support a model of mosaic genomic ancestry 2,3 . With increasingly comprehensive genome data, we now ask where the haplotypes — the building blocks of this mosaic — originate, and whether all domesticated barleys share the same wild progenitors or whether certain wild populations contribute more heavily to specific lineages. To address these questions, we apply a haplotype-based approach to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and domesticated barley. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 archaeological specimens, tracing the spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes and identifying wild contributors during domestication and later gene flow events. Ancient DNA supports our genome-wide findings from modern samples. Our results suggest that a founding domesticated population emerged in the Fertile Crescent during a prolonged period of pre-domestication cultivation. A key practical insight is that the high haplotype differentiation among barley populations — arising independently, or layered on top, of selection — poses challenges for mapping adaptive loci.",

          "abstract": "Robertsonian chromosomes are a type of variant chromosome that is commonly found in nature. Present in 1 in 800 humans, these chromosomes can underlie infertility, trisomies and increased cancer incidence1,2,3,4,5. They have been recognized cytogenetically for more than a century6, yet their origins have remained unknown. Here we describe complete assemblies of three human Robertsonian chromosomes. We identified a common breakpoint in SST1, a macrosatellite DNA located on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, which commonly undergo Robertsonian translocation. SST1 is contained within a larger shared homology domain7 that is inverted on chromosome 14, which enables a meiotic crossover event that fuses the long arms of two chromosomes. Robertsonian chromosomes have two centromeric DNA arrays and have lost all ribosomal DNA. In two cases, we find that only one of the two centromeric arrays is active. In the third case, both arrays can be active but owing to their proximity, they are often encompassed by a single outer kinetochore. Thus a combination of array proximity and epigenetic changes in centromeres facilitates the stable propagation of Robertsonian chromosomes. Investigation of the assembled genomes of chimpanzee and bonobo highlights that the inversion on chromosome 14 is unique to the human genome. Resolving the structural and epigenetic features of human Robertsonian chromosomes at a molecular level provides a foundation for a broader understanding of the molecular mechanisms of structural variation and chromosome evolution.",

In the USA, leading threats to fish communities in rivers and streams include climate change and invasive fish introductions and game fish stocking by humans10,11,12,13,14. Here we harmonized US federal biomonitoring datasets with 389 species spanning 27 years (1993–2019) and 2,992 sites to analyse trends in fish biodiversity. In cold streams (past summer stream temperatures below 15.4 °C), fish abundance and richness declined by 53.4% and 32% over 27 years, respectively, and uniqueness increased. Periodic (large-bodied, late-maturing) fishes increased, and opportunists (small-bodied, short generation time, ‘r-selected’) decreased, possibly due to proliferation of native or introduced game fishes. In warm streams (stream temperatures greater than 23.8 °C), fish abundance and richness increased by 70.5% and 15.6% over 27 years, respectively, and communities homogenized. Small opportunistic fishes replaced large periodic fishes. Intermediate streams (stream temperatures 15.4–23.8 °C), representing the average stream, had minimal changes in fish biodiversity through time. Interactions between warming and introduced fish were associated with increased rates of degradation to local fish biodiversity. Given the magnitude of these changes in a relatively short time span, there is an urgent need to curb degradation of fish biodiversity caused by fish introductions and warming water temperatures.",

However, mechanisms for collective control of these proteins, which tend to localize to membraneless condensates, are less understood than pathways mediated by membrane-bound organelles 3,4 . Here we report ‘interstasis’, a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins.",

Named after the Latin word flavus (meaning yellow) for the founding member, yellow fever virus, this group of viruses includes medically important pathogens that are transmitted mainly by mosquitoes and ticks. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), for example, circulates in the forests of Europe and northeastern Asia, spreading through tick bites or, occasionally, raw dairy products from infected farm animals. Many TBEV infections are asymptomatic, but some follow a two-phase illness beginning with flu-like symptoms (peripheral phase) and, in severe cases, progressing to life-threatening inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (neuroinvasive phase)2. Writing in Nature, Mittler et al.3 identify a key cell-surface protein that TBEV uses to enter human cells and initiate infection, filling a major gap in scientists’ understanding of flavivirus entry mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Early in her career, evolutionary ecologist Maydianne Andrade was frequently asked to participate in equity work. As a Black woman in academia, she was initially reluctant, sensing that her presence on such committees was just ticking a box. At conference sessions on women and people of colour in science, despite often hearing anecdotes echoing her own experience, the lack of empirical data analysing collective experiences frustrated her.\n\nAnecdotes didn’t shed light on solutions.\n\nThen, about a decade ago, Andrade was challenged to take an implicit association test. The test revealed that she had a moderate to strong tendency to associate positive things with whiteness and negative things with Blackness. These results shook her, prompting her to take a deep dive into the social-science literature on discrimination and bias, and spurring her into advocacy.\n\n‘Computing is a Black people’s thing’\n\nNow, alongside her research career at the University of Toronto in Canada, where she studies the reproductive behaviour of black widow spiders (Latrodectus), she is co-founder and former president of the Canadian Black Scientists Network, and founder and co-chair of the Toronto Initiative for Diversity and Excellence (TIDE), a cross-disciplinary service group that supports equity and inclusion at her university, Canada’s largest. These groups engage with Canadian parliamentarians, organizations and university employees to stimulate sustained change. Last December, the Canadian Science Policy Centre, a non-profit organization, honoured Andrade with the Trailblazer Award for her exceptional leadership. Andrade spoke to Nature about her equity-seeking work.\n\nWhat passion has driven you as a scientist?\n\nI’ve always been a curious person. Animals are very sophisticated in the way that they take up environmental information and subsequently change their behaviour. I liked the idea that you can gather information and predict things about natural systems. I think I’m probably a control freak, because the idea of a massive equation that can predict an outcome is really attractive to me.\n\nMy passions are ecology, evolution, behaviour and their interactions. To rear black widow spiders for mating experiments, we typically have about 50,000 spiders in my laboratory at any given time. Their high-stakes mating can go on for hours, and sometimes we see males fight to the death for a female’s attention — something not often seen in nature.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence and why?\n\nI’ve had several mentors at various stages of my career. As an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, I was lucky to have the renowned behavioural ecologist Larry Dill teach my introductory biology class, starting each lecture with a research story. I later worked in his lab. When I was applying for graduate school, he was instrumental. He showed me the letter of recommendation that he wrote for me, which said that my biggest flaw was not knowing how good I was or could be. I don’t know if he intuitively knew that I had feelings of imposter syndrome or was aware of the effects of being a rare phenotype in this world of academic science, but to share that with me was incredibly valuable.\n\nWhy is diversity, equity, inclusion and anti-racism work important to you?\n\nI have children. And as a young person, I didn’t understand how much of what I was experiencing in my career was unfair, biased or inappropriate. I understood it better later. When you experience discrimination or bias, you can always come up with a reason as to why it’s your fault. But, as I say to people outside equity-seeking groups, if you pick at a thread without recognizing the tapestry it’s in, you’re part of the problem. For people with talent who are subject to constant microaggressions, they’re going to be beaten down, they will think they’re not good enough and leave — and we lose their innovation with them.\n\nHow have you dealt with racism or discrimination in your personal and professional life?\n\nMostly I talk to family, friends and professional allies. They might say, “Yeah, that shouldn’t happen. I’m really sorry that it did.” Or, in a meeting, they’ll speak up and say, “Oh, I think that’s what she just said.” That can defuse the situation sometimes.\n\nTo be honest, a big part of coping comes from being a science nerd. I stare at my feet and at my spiders and a lot of the negative remarks go over my head or wash off my back. Or they did, until I started putting it all together.\n\nWhat it’s like fighting racism and sexism in shark science\n\nNow, in addition to my research, I do knowledge translation, which involves explaining to people what the literature suggests about bias and inclusion and how things can be improved with respect to the challenges we have in academia with properly assessing talent.\n\nWhat I discovered is that data on bias alone are not enough for many scientists, because individuals don't associate bias with themselves. That is a tendency that we have as human beings — we don’t want to think that the system we’re in is flawed. So, part of my work is finding the people who want to do something, but might not know what to do, and helping them to develop solutions and strategies.\n\nRacism and discrimination affect you. But if you don’t put them behind you, it becomes impossible to move on, or you’re angry all the time. I won’t lie. Lately, I have been angry a lot. I’m just good at keeping it under wraps .\n\nHow has your work helped to move things forward?\n\nThe Canadian Black Scientists Network started in 2020, with 20 people in a virtual room. It is now a network of more than 1,000 people. Many are young trainees. We are establishing partnership programmes to help people find jobs, including in government ministries, and to encourage employers to hire Black employees.\n\nIn 2022, government grant agencies rolled out scholarship funding for Black scholars at the undergraduate, postgraduate and postdoctoral levels and have consulted with us on how to do so effectively. We helped to answer questions around identity and how to define ‘Black’ — not a trivial issue. We’ve also been part of a successful grant application to ensure that Black Canadians are included in a genomic database for a precision-medicine initiative; we’ve participated in a study about mortality inequalities of Black adults in Canada; and partnered with the Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology to provide training to young Black people in science leadership, outreach and policy.\n\nYoung people have said to me, “I was about to give up. I’m the only one on my campus. I’m the only one in my department. I’ve never seen another person who looks like me at a conference.” And sometimes, even if everyone around you is supportive, it is exhausting to be that visible all the time, and to not have any role models who are demonstrating success.\n\nThat feedback, from people whom we’ve inspired to not give up, has been incredibly rewarding.",

          "abstract": "Authors whose work has been retracted often build larger networks than do those without retractions, a study found.Credit: Halfpoint/iStock via Getty\n\nRetractions can have profound effects on researchers’ careers, sometimes in unexpected ways, a study that tracked the career trajectories of thousands of authors has found.\n\nThe range of experiences that authors go through raises questions about whether this mechanism — an important part of the scientific process — is working as intended, says co-author Shahan Ali Memon, an information scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\n“Retractions serve a crucial role in maintaining the credibility of scientific evidence, but their impact extends far beyond ‘correcting the record’,” says Memon. “Understanding these dynamics is important to evaluate, as a community, whether current processes serve their intended purpose — or if they come with unintended repercussions for the individuals involved.”\n\nMemon and his colleagues examined 4,578 papers, involving just under 15,000 authors, that were retracted between 1990 and 2015. The results, published in Nature Human Behaviour in April, showed that “around 45.9% of authors left their publishing careers around the time of retraction”.\n\nThe study found that early-career researchers were more likely than others to stop publishing after a retraction, as were authors whose papers were pulled for misconduct or plagiarism, and those whose retracted works attracted attention online.\n\nResearchers who continued publishing after a retraction tended to build larger networks than did those without retractions, the study found. They generally retain “less senior and less productive co-authors, but gain more impactful co-authors post-retraction”, Memon and his colleagues state. In this case, research impact was determined by how many citations the co-author attracted.\n\nFurther analysis is needed to determine why this happens, but Memon is urging publishers and institutions to not treat retracted authors as a homogeneous group, and to instead look at individual cases and give support when needed.\n\nThe retraction experience\n\nRetractions can occur for several reasons, only one of which is misconduct, such as fraud or plagiarism. Other culprits are honest mistakes or a lack of reproducibility. Another is the fact that complex research can sometimes yield unintended errors that cannot always be easily or definitively corrected. In such cases, retraction followed by rigorous revision and republication is an option, as was the case in 2019 when Nature accepted a formerly retracted paper.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\n“Context matters,” says Memon. “Institutions should carefully consider the circumstances behind each retraction.”\n\nMemon’s study was inspired by the first-hand experience of his co-authors, Bedoor AlShebli and Kinga Makovi at New York University Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, whose 2020 Nature Communications paper was retracted. AlShebli and Makovi’s study suggested that female scientists fare better when mentored by men, rather than by women. It was retracted following criticism from readers and an investigation by the journal.

When she released her pop album Red in 2012, the southern twang had faded, suggest researchers who have analysed her voice1. It changed again when she moved to New York City, they say.\n\nA person’s dialect is typically associated with the region they are from, although it can change throughout their lifetime.

In 2008, Swift released Fearless while living near Nashville; in 2012, she released Red; and in 2019, Lover was released when she lived in New York City.\n\nThe pair used computer software to track how the pronunciation of Swift’s vowels changed. “As a person changes dialects — within English at least — mostly those changes are reflected in the vowels,” says Winn.\n\nEarly in her career, Swift’s pronunciation of ‘i’ in words such as ‘ride’ became shorter, pronouncing the word more like ‘rod’, which the researchers say is a classic southern US feature. The ‘oo’ sound in words like ‘two’ also changed to sound like ‘tee-you’, another southern signature.\n\nSwift’s vowels lengthened around the time she started singing more pop music, with a clearer distinction between words such as ‘cot’ and ‘caught’, which the authors say is a feature of dialects in Pennsylvania, where Swift grew up, and New York.\n\nThe researchers suggest that these changes reflect Swift’s desire to be part of those communities. “I was one of those people who thought of dialects mainly as reflecting where you come from, but they obviously also reflect what kind of community you want to be a part of,” says Winn.",

          "title": "The great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing",
          "authors": "Dan Garisto",
          "abstract": "If the 264 million students enrolled in higher education around the globe were a country, it would be the fifth most populous in the world. Some 53% of its citizens would identify as women and most would be located in Asia. Residents would speak and study in hundreds of languages, but English would dominate.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nThis nation of learners would also be one of the fastest growing. Since 2000, the number of university students around the world has more than doubled, and the number that cross borders to learn has roughly tripled, to almost seven million. Aided by the Internet, conferences, shared curricula and collaborations, the world of higher education has become more tightly linked.\n\nBut the pattern of interconnected growth is beginning to unravel as wealthy Western nations become much less welcoming to foreign students. The administration of US President Donald Trump in particular has been targeting higher-education institutions and international students. Many of the latter are consequently looking elsewhere to earn their degrees, and those opportunities are growing, especially in some low- and middle-income countries. But expanding access to higher education has also raised concerns about the quality and value of that education.\n\nUniversities must move with the times: how six scholars tackle AI, mental health and more\n\nThese changing currents are particularly crucial for science, which relies on the infrastructure of universities to train its students, share ideas and do research. “The current global scientific system is facing unprecedented risks to the things that have made it robust,” says Chris Glass, a higher-education researcher at Boston College in Massachusetts.\n\nSpecialists caution that there isn’t a universal portrait that captures the state of higher education around the world. “There’s never a global story,” Glass says. But he and other scholars have worked to identify key trends in the demographics of this ‘country’ of higher education — and predict where it’s going.\n\nHere, Nature examines some of these trends: the growth of higher education, especially in less-wealthy nations; the geopolitical forces created by and shaping higher education; and how all this affects who gets to learn and what they are taught.\n\nWho goes to university?\n\nThe overarching trend in higher education over the past half century has been an explosive growth in student numbers. Higher-education researchers typically track this growth by comparing the number of enrolled students in a country with its population of student-aged people, a measure called gross enrolment ratio (GER). (This ratio can even be higher than 100% because people outside this age range can attend universities.)\n\nFor countries in Western Europe and North America, participation in higher education is now the norm (see ‘Rising tides in higher education’). The higher-education GER in these regions increased from 61% in 2000 to 80% in 2024. In the past few years, however, this group has been surpassed by Central Europe, who leapt from an average GER of 42% to 87% in that same time span. The massive increase came mostly from an explosion of private education after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nSource: UNESCO\n\nOther regions of the world are beginning to catch up: between 2000 and 2023, eastern and southeastern Asia’s GER went from 15% to 62% and Latin America and the Caribbean’s went from 23% to 58%. Many countries are making explicit efforts to expand their GER. India, which had a GER of 28% in 2021–22, has set a target of reaching 50% by 2035. The global average, which was 19% in 2000, has shot up to 44% in 2024.\n\nSome regions are still struggling, however. Sub-Saharan Africa had a GER of 9% as of 2021, up from 4% in 2000. It is also the only region in which women are still under-represented in higher education; there are roughly 76 women for every 100 men. The primary obstacle is funding, says James Jowi, director of the African Network for Internationalization of Education, a non-profit organization based in Eldoret, Kenya. “Most young people can’t afford a college tuition fee,” Jowi says.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nIncreasing access is not without concerns, however, says Laura Rumbley, the director for knowledge development and research at the European Association for International Education in Amsterdam. As peoples’ level of education rises, so too do the qualifications necessary for good jobs. In regions with extremely high enrolment, higher-education degrees, including master’s and PhDs, become more necessary and less valuable, she says. “We want to avoid higher education becoming a dead end for individuals and for societies.” Higher education should open doors, not close them, she says.\n\nWhere do students go to learn?\n\nAs the number of students and institutions has expanded, higher education has become more globally linked, but the shape and nature of those connections is changing.\n\nResearchers describe these connections as internationalization: how globalization takes place at university. The clearest and easiest way to see this is in student mobility, Rumbley says. In 2000, 2.1 million students crossed borders to learn; today, 6.9 million do, about 2.6% of all students. In some regions, such as the European Union, international travel for education is much more common: about 9% of its students go abroad, often to other countries in the EU.\n\nMuch of the mobility comes from postgraduate students seeking more specialized education that is not necessarily available locally. And the flow of students is generally towards wealthy nations that have invested heavily in public education. For example, the United States has about 20 million students in higher education, 1.1 million of whom come from other countries. Meanwhile, India has 43 million students but only 46,000 are international (See ‘Incoming and outgoing students’).\n\nSource: UNESCO\n\nHowever, specialists say there might be a slowing down of this typical movement because of two factors: an increase in the availability of education in low- and middle-income countries and a decline in access to universities in many wealthy nations. The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have all imposed immigration restrictions that have begun to chip away at undergraduate and postgraduate enrolment from abroad. And anti-immigration policies in the United States are increasing. The Trump administration has revoked more than 1,400 visas, restricted travel from 19 countries and proposed rules to limit visas for PhD candidates to 4 years, despite US programmes often taking longer than that to complete. NAFSA: Association of International Educators, a non-profit organization based in Washington DC, projects that there will be roughly 30–40% fewer international students entering the United States by 2025–26 than for the previous academic year, at a cost of about US$7 billion in revenue and 60,000 jobs.\n\nBefore the start of the twenty-first century, the United States had a “diversified portfolio” of international students, Glass says, from many countries. Over the past two decades, however, China and India have come to dominate, going from about one-third to more than half of the number of students in the US international study body. This rise has been fuelled by demand from increasingly wealthy middle classes in those countries and opportunities provided by US universities hungry for more funds, Glass says.\n\nStudents in China and India now have other options. Although the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia are still top destinations for international students, countries such as the Netherlands and South Korea are increasingly popular. And China is working to attract more foreign students. In 2000, the United States was host to about 26% of all international students; today that number is about 16%.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\nAnother way that universities have tried to tap into increasing global demand is through satellite campuses: extensions of highly visible institutions in foreign cities, such as New York University’s venture in Shanghai, China. These institutions have created opportunities for international education without the need to cross borders. In 2023–24, the United Kingdom hosted about 732,000 international students domestically, but it educated roughly 621,000 students abroad, studying at foreign extensions of UK universities. “That might be a trend which will be increasing, because then you have students that can say, ‘Well, I don’t have to travel abroad, but I still can have a foreign degree’,” says Hans de Wit, a higher-education researcher at Boston College. This transnational approach can avoid troublesome visa issues, but raises difficult questions, he says, such as whether it is really the same quality education?\n\nFor many it is not. “If I were a student, I would be studying in Bristol University in the UK, not in Delhi,” says Saumen Chattopadhyay, an economist who studies higher education at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Studying abroad provides more opportunities to emigrate and gain access to international contacts.\n\nAlthough opportunities to go abroad can help individuals, they can drain talent and money from less-wealthy countries. “It has been considered for a long time a threat to the human capital development from African countries,” Jowi says. He is working to develop intra-Africa mobility and reduce brain drain by building local centres of excellence at universities in southern and eastern African countries.\n\nWhat do universities teach?",

          "abstract": "The Great Holocene Transformation: What Complexity Science Tells Us about the Evolution of Complex Societies Peter Turchin Beresta Books (2025)\n\nWhen Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico in 1519, he found monarchs, cities, roads, markets, schools, astronomers, law courts and much else that also existed in his native Spain. Put another way, two cultural experiments had been running in parallel for 15,000 years, and when they came into contact, each recognized the other’s institutions.\n\nIt wasn’t just the civilizations of the Americas and Europe that resembled each other by that time. As biologist-turned-historian Peter Turchin observes in his tenth book, The Great Holocene Transformation, more than half of the world’s population in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries lived in five or six large societies with political systems that were remarkably structurally similar. His argument is that this was not a coincidence; although every society is unique, they have features in common that make them comparable.\n\nHow the world’s largest language family spread — and why others go extinct\n\nThis might not seem like a radical statement, but to some scholars it is. They argue that each society’s history is unique and that no meaningful comparison is possible. Others think it is possible in theory, but are uncomfortable with the translation of historical knowledge into binary categories or numbers, saying that it glosses over the inherent difficulty of interpreting the past from the ever-shifting vantage point of the present.\n\nThe small army of archaeologists, economists and other social scientists who work with Turchin on that gargantuan task of translation is convinced that this problem is tractable, and that such quantification will reveal patterns in history. The more data you collect, the more clearly the signal will emerge from the noise, they say. Equipped with large databases, powerful computational and analytical tools and artificial intelligence (AI), scholars can find these patterns and even predict how they might shape societies in the future.\n\nIn this book, Turchin sets out to answer what he calls “perhaps the biggest question in historical social science”: why, over the past 10,000 years — the epoch known as the Holocene — small collectives of foragers and farmers grew by seven orders of magnitude to become the societies familiar to Cortés and his Aztec adversary, Moctezuma II.\n\nWhy Africans should be telling the story of human origins\n\nHis answer, depressingly and paradoxically, is war. It was war that made us “ultrasocial”, to use his word, ratcheting up the size and complexity of those collectives until they became the states and empires that existed on the eve of the Industrial Revolution — the point at which his analysis ends. Ultrasociality was the secret of survival in this perpetual arms race, making it the ultimate military technology — or war the ultimate social technology.\n\nHe addressed the same question in his 2015 book, Ultrasociety, but that was written for a non-mathematically minded audience. This time, he shows his workings, and he has more data and better tools.\n\nThe Great Holocene Transformation is the culmination of more than 20 years’ work, during which he and others built the Seshat database — a storehouse of historical and archaeological information on more than 800 societies around the globe. This and similar databases that have emerged in the past decade form the basis of his cross-cultural and cross-temporal comparisons.\n\nSocial benefits\n\nScientific progress is usually the whittling down of theories to a few, and ultimately to one, through testing them against data. But where the Holocene transformation is concerned, theories have proliferated. The time has come, Turchin writes, “to create a killing field for theories and start retiring them to the cemetery of theories”.\n\nHis starting point is that, ten millennia being too short for biological evolution to have driven notable change, the mechanisms that fuelled this societal shift must have been cultural. Among the theories assessed are that agriculture, internal conflict, warfare or external conflict, and religion were the main drivers of societal complexification. Some ideas are dismissed, some are found to be useful but wanting, and the story that emerges, in a nutshell, goes as follows.\n\nA farmer in a tobacco field in Pinar del Rio, Cuba.Credit: David Silverman/Getty\n\nBefore the Holocene, cumulative cultural evolution — the capacity of humans to build on the advances of their ancestors — produced technologies that allowed communities to adapt to their environment and increase in size. The threat of war between expanding groups drove the shift to agriculture — because agriculture could sustain more people than foraging could for a given patch of land — and further developments in military technology.",

Credit: Cristian Storto/Getty\n\nUS universities and researchers are scrambling to understand how they will be affected by President Donald Trump’s announcement late last week that he would massively hike the fee on visas for foreign skilled workers. Some fear the move could wreck universities’ chances of attracting talent from abroad, leaving research projects adrift and science courses without instructors.\n\nThe plan, released on 19 September, is to charge US$100,000 per application for an H-1B visa, which is used by many foreign-born postdoctoral fellows and some professors taking up employment at US research institutions, as well as scientists and engineers doing the same at US companies. The new fees apply to applications submitted after 21 September. The move could raise the cost of the visas, normally a few thousand dollars, by up to 26 times current levels.\n\n‘You’re just not welcome’: researchers grapple with US plan to revoke Chinese student visas\n\nH-1B visas, which are usually valid for up to six years, are meant to allow skilled foreign workers to enter the United States to temporarily take jobs that cannot be filled by domestic workers. They are separate from other visas open to foreign-born researchers and academics such as J-1 visas for individuals participating in visitor-exchange programmes. And they are separate from F-1 visas that foreign-born graduate students typically use to study at US institutions.\n\nIt is so far unclear whether universities will be exempt from the new fee, which is aimed at preserving more jobs for US citizens. In the announcement, Trump said that “abuse” of H-1B visas has facilitated an “influx” of foreign labour in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) that has undermined salaries and workplace conditions for US workers, and that the visas are a “national security threat” because they discourage US citizens “from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields”. But it also says that exemptions could be made for those working “in the national interest”.\n\nUniversities say foreign workers are crucial to them being able to fill certain roles in STEM.\n\nAndrea Liu, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, told Nature that the fee hike will shut down the possibility of recruiting scientists from abroad and damage the future of her research group.\n\n“It is an utter disaster — yet another body blow to US science,” she says.\n\nThe White House did not respond to Nature’s queries about whether universities will be exempt from the fee hike, or about scientists’ concerns about the new policy.\n\nSeeking clarity\n\nIt’s unclear how many researchers at US institutions are employed on H-1B visas. Data from the US National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics in Alexandria, Virginia, found that of the 62,750 postdoctoral researchers in the United States in 2022, more than 56% held a temporary visa of some kind. The US Department of Homeland Security typically awards a maximum of 85,000 H-1B visas each year to companies and other US employers; universities and non-profit research organizations are exempt from this cap.\n\nSarah Spreitzer, who represents the American Council on Education (ACE) on research policy and immigration issues, says that H-1B visa fees are typically paid by the employing institution. ACE — an association of higher education organizations based in Washington DC — is seeking clarification from the Trump administration on whether it will exempt universities and research institutions from the new fees. Spreitzer says these institutions would probably be unable to afford the dramatically higher costs and will struggle to recruit instructors and researchers in fields such as engineering, science and nursing, which tend not to attract sufficient domestic interest.\n\nAs a result “some [university] courses might not be offered and some research might not go ahead”, she adds.\n\nA ‘profound’ effect\n\nThe H-1B announcement follows other anti-immigration plans put forwards by the Trump team. For instance, in May US secretary of state Marco Rubio said that the United States would be revoking visas both for Chinese students in “critical fields” and with connections to the Chinese Communist Party.",

          "abstract": "An outbreak of Ebola has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with 47 confirmed cases, including 25 deaths, as of yesterday, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). There are also a probable 10 additional cases and deaths, the WHO says.\n\nOn 4 September, the DRC’s Ministry of Health confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, the most dangerous and common of Ebola virus strains, which was also responsible for the 2014–16 outbreak in West Africa.\n\nThe WHO has issued a call for US$21 million to support the response of the DRC’s government. The agency says that priorities are sending health workers to affected communities, identifying cases as early as possible, increasing community engagement, providing treatment and reducing transmission.\n\nA viral leap\n\nAlthough the precise source of the outbreak is not known, researchers say that it probably arose from a spillover event, in which the virus transfers from an infected animal, such as a bat, to humans.\n\n“It’s not identical to previous strains that have been identified, which strongly suggests that it’s a new spillover event,” says epidemiologist Peter Horby of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, UK.\n\nThe outbreak is currently confined to four regions of Kasai province: Bulape, Mweka, Mushenge and Kakenge. These areas are remote and isolated, making it challenging for responders to reach them, Horby says.\n\n“I think the big problem is that the patients — because it’s an isolated area and it’s very rural — are presenting very late, with quite advanced disease and have very restricted health-care systems, so the mortality rate is very high,” he adds.\n\nAlthough this makes tackling the outbreak difficult, “the remoteness may shield the outbreak [from] other settings”, says Henry Kyobe Bosa, who leads the Ebola and COVID-19 response for Uganda’s Ministry of Health.",

          "abstract": "A brain scan of a person with Huntington’s disease, which causes a loss of brain volume as neurons are killed off by the accumulation of a mutant protein.Credit: Zephyr/SPL\n\nA one-time gene therapy can markedly slow the progression of Huntington’s disease, potentially paving the way for the first ever treatment to alter the course of this rare, inherited brain disorder.\n\nIn a small trial of 29 people who were in the early stages of Huntington’s-related decline, participants who received a high dose of the therapy directly into their brains saw the disease slow by 75% over three years, compared with those in a control group.\n\nGenetic therapies offer new hope against incurable brain diseases\n\nThe benefit was statistically significant across several clinical measures, according to data released this week by uniQure, a gene-therapy company based in Amsterdam. Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.\n\n“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”\n\nSlowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”\n\nA deadly repeat\n\nPeople living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year on year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.\n\nThe disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.\n\nSome of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on antisense therapy, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development1. But hopes dimmed in 2021 after a leading candidate failed in late-stage testing, with those receiving the therapy seeming to fare worse than those who were given a placebo2.\n\nThis clinical setback redirected attention towards a different strategy: gene therapy, which aims to provide a one-time intervention that permanently silences or modifies the deficient gene at its source.\n\nMolecular muzzle\n\nIn the case of uniQure’s gene therapy, the treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver the recipe for making a short RNA sequence known as a microRNA directly into cells in the affected parts of the brain. The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a Nobel prize last year, although the technology has yet to yield any approved medicines.\n\nAdministering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.",

          "abstract": "Human Nature: Nine Ways to Feel About Our Changing Planet Kate Marvel Ecco (2025)\n\nThe idea that rising carbon dioxide concentrations could warm the planet dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. Women’s rights campaigner and scientist Eunice Foote showed in 1856 that CO2 and water vapour trap heat in the atmosphere1. Her work, which was mostly overlooked at the time, has been validated by decades of research that has built a remarkably clear picture. Average global temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, fossil fuels release CO2 that push up greenhouse-gas levels and human activity is the main cause of global warming.\n\n‘Researching climate change feels like standing in the path of an approaching train’\n\nYet, as climate scientist Kate Marvel observes in Human Nature, policymakers have taken surprisingly little action in response to the mounting evidence. Efforts have been hindered by decades of lobbying by powerful organizations such as oil companies. In this persuasive book, Marvel argues that people need to embrace an emotional response, not just a data-driven one, to prompt widespread action. Climate scientists and activists would be familiar with some of the emotions that double as chapter titles — anger, fear and grief. But Marvel insists on the need for wonder, love and hope, too.\n\nBy weaving in personal anecdotes, she makes the science behind climate change accessible: how Earth’s system functions, how greenhouse gases disrupt it, the effects of global warming and the complexity and uncertainties of models. For instance, Marvel poignantly recounts her fearful experience of living through Hurricane Ida in 2021, which caused disastrous floods that killed at least 13 people in New York City. She then explains that air can hold about 7% more water vapour for every degree Celsius it warms. When that vapour condenses, it drives short, intense bursts of rain. The chapter is especially helpful because it shows not only how storms form but also why warming leads to heavier downpours.\n\nAn unsettling truth\n\nI can’t help but share Marvel’s anger and frustration. Climate science has advanced to the point where denying human-driven climate change feels obtuse. Her models, and thousands developed by other scientists, might differ in spatial and temporal resolution, but they all lead to the same unambiguous conclusion: Earth is warming and will keep doing so unless greenhouse-gas emissions drop to zero.\n\nJust how bad will climate change get? The only way to know is to fund basic research\n\nScientists have watched their models of a warming world come true during their own lifetimes — faster than many expected. It is exciting to see one’s predictions get confirmed, to have been able to forecast the future with remarkable accuracy. Yet, witnessing climate change unfold in real time, with the consequences already visible when they could have been avoided or mitigated, is profoundly unsettling.\n\nThe book highlights the devastating consequences of extreme weather by weaving together historical and contemporary examples: a huge volcanic eruption in 43 bc that caused political turmoil in the Roman Empire and famines in ancient Egypt; the devastating droughts of the 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States; and the catastrophic floods in Texas triggered by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. References to Greek mythology and historical events, such as the fall of ancient Egypt because of crop failures triggered by disrupted rainfall patterns after the volcanic eruption, make the narrative engaging and entertaining.\n\nThe eruption of the Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha‘apai volcano had broad atmospheric effects.Credit: Maxar/Getty\n\nHowever, Marvel could have discussed social-science studies that demonstrate how climate shocks affect livelihoods and human well-being2–4. These impacts are rarely direct or isolated; they ripple through economic, political and environmental systems.\n\nTracing how climate change affects livelihoods also reveals why some groups are more vulnerable than others. Droughts, for example, can fuel conflict and drive migration, especially in fragile states with weak governance and poor resource management5. Identifying such mechanisms is crucial, because they can help policymakers to develop targeted and effective strategies for intervention.",

          "authors": "Philip G. Altbach",
          "abstract": "Higher education across the world is facing a panoply of challenges that threaten to undermine or drastically alter its future. In the United States, universities are grappling with huge cuts to federal funding and pressure from the government to change their teaching and research agendas. In the United Kingdom, financial pressures are pushing some institutions to the brink of bankruptcy. Universities elsewhere, including in Germany and the Netherlands, face budget and research cuts. And in Japan and South Korea, private institutions are shutting their doors as ageing populations lead to declining numbers of students.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nMeanwhile, technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), along with shifts towards remote learning in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, pose fundamental questions about how education should be delivered, and to whom. Across the world, governments with tight budgets and many competing demands are unable or unwilling to pay for the millions of students who want to attend universities.\n\nHow did universities reach this point? Over the past 200 years, the role of these institutions has changed drastically — from elite establishments focused on teaching a tiny proportion of the population to vast, sprawling businesses offering both research and education for large numbers of students (see ‘A twentieth-century boom’). Here, I explore how this revolution in higher education underlies the problems that universities face today.\n\nSource: E. Schofer & J. W. Meyer Am. Sociol. Rev. 70, 898–920 (2005).\nDeep history\n\nUniversities have their origins in religious or state-run institutions for training elite groups and specialists. Records go back as far as ad 427 in India, where Nalanda University, in what is now Bihar, developed Buddhist thought and taught skills such as medicine, mathematics and alchemy. In China, institutions that centred on the teachings of the philosopher Confucius first arose around 200 bc.\n\nThe world’s oldest university still in operation is the University of Al-Qarawiyyin in Fez, Morocco. Established as a mosque in ad 869, it evolved over the following centuries to teach a broad range of subjects — from the Quran to grammar, medicine and astronomy.\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nThe birthplace of the Western academic conventions that the world’s universities now follow — formal lectures and official qualifications — was the University of Bologna in Italy. Founded in 1088, it came into being when groups of foreign students in the city began to pool funds to hire scholars to lecture them. With few students and limited curricula, it mainly prepared young people for careers in the church, law, medicine and government. The University of Oxford, UK, followed in 1096 and the University of Paris in 1150, although they were run by professors instead of students.\n\nThe next structural shift came in 1810, when philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt conceived the world’s first research-intensive university in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia. Aiming to bring cutting-edge science into universities and to advance the region’s development, he set up subject faculties and established graduate education programmes, in which researchers trained future scientists1. In doing so, he linked teaching and research for the first time. His innovation, which was funded by the state, contributed to the emergence of Prussia as a top scientific power. And following unification in 1871, also to that of Germany.\n\nThis university model has shaped higher education ever since. The United States and Japan were among the first to adopt it2, beginning in the 1860s. By the early twentieth century, universities across Europe had broadly taken on the Humboldtian-style dual focus of cutting-edge research coupled with education of the next generation of elite minds. The founding of Peking University in 1898 brought a similar system to China.\n\nThousands of students in Japan try to attend a lecture in a hall with a capacity for 1,000.Credit: Rodrigo Reyes Marin/AFLO/Alamy\n\nThe universities of the late-nineteenth century enrolled around 80,000 students in Europe and 49,000 in the United States — under 1% of each population (based on reported3 values and my estimates). But the Humboldtian approach proved eminently scalable, as the skills taught by universities became essential for rapidly expanding industrializing economies. By 1930, there were an estimated 650,000 students in universities in Europe and 1.1 million in the United States, reflecting the wider educational base in the country. Elite groups still dominated student numbers, but there were more opportunities for others — and, for the first time, women were enrolling in significant numbers.\n\nIn much of the rest of the world, these developments came later. Areas under colonial domination had little higher education, and the universities that did exist mainly trained civil servants4. But the aftermath of the Second World War brought dramatic changes to the university system worldwide. The emergence of the United States as a global superpower, the rebuilding of Europe and Japan, the end of much of colonialism and the rise of nationalism in newly independent economies, and, around 1980, the emergence of China as a major power led to the establishment of new universities worldwide. In many Western countries, an expanding middle class demanded access to higher education, which was seen as key to social mobility, driving even higher student numbers.\n\nMass expansion\n\nAs a result, university enrolments expanded dramatically5 from 6 million globally in 19506 to 264 million in 2023. By 2024, almost all countries, except those in sub-Saharan Africa, were enrolling at least 50% of students leaving secondary school in higher education of some form, although young people from lower social class groups and those from minority ethnic groups remain under-represented7. China’s growth in particular has been remarkable — student enrolment in 1978 was 860,000, but by 2018 this number had reached 45 million1. The changes came after China jettisoned the Soviet Union university model of free but ideologically restricted education, which was adopted after the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949, in favour of an academic structure modelled largely on the US system.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nThe remit of higher education expanded in the 1960s to cater to students’ diverse academic backgrounds and interests, with a growing focus on employment skills for rapidly changing economies. The United States pioneered vocational community colleges and teaching-focused state and private colleges and universities, alongside its Humboldtian-style flagship institutes. Other countries developed similar, multipart systems — Germany, for example, has vocational colleges and teaching-oriented universities of applied science alongside conventional research-focused universities, as do most European countries.\n\nThe trend to increase access to education has placed severe financial burdens on governments worldwide. Politicians have faced a choice: maintain free (or very low cost) higher education for ever-increasing student numbers, often at the cost of academic quality; or impose tuition fees to pay for the expansion8. Only a few countries have chosen the first option. The rest have shifted the cost of education mostly to students, and instituted student-loan programmes to help pay the bills.\n\nThe unwillingness of governments to pay for mass higher education has created a huge private higher-education sector — mainly geared towards high-demand fields such as business administration, with the exception of some elite, research-intensive institutes in the United States. One-third of global enrolments are now in private higher education9. In Japan and South Korea, 80% of students attend private universities; in the Philippines, this figure is about 50%9.\n\nAn expanded role for research",

          "abstract": "There are limited options for pain relief during pregnancy.Credit: The Good Brigade/Getty\n\nResearchers are concerned about what will happen should pregnant women follow US President Donald Trump's advice to avoid the painkiller Tylenol — also called paracetamol and acetaminophen. In an address at the White House on 22 September, Trump claimed the medication is linked to autism and other long-term neurodevelopmental conditions in the developing child. But experts warn that avoiding the drug when it is needed could place women and their fetus at even greater risk.\n\nParacetamol is one of the most widely used drugs during pregnancy and is generally considered safe. It is commonly used to relieve pain and reduce fevers, including those caused by viral infections such as the common cold and bacterial infections that cause urinary-tract or kidney conditions.\n\nOn Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that acetaminophen products would have a new warning label that lists a possible association between taking the drug and an increased chance of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism in children. FDA commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement that the change “may lead many to avoid using acetaminophen during pregnancy”. Trump was more direct: “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.\n\nThe advice has been rejected by physicians, medical organizations and health regulators in many countries, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the UK Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. The World Health Organization said in a statement that there is no “conclusive scientific evidence confirming a possible link”. The drivers of ADHD and autism are complex and genetics plays a large part.\n\nUntreated fever\n\nBut there is evidence that leaving a fever untreated, particularly if it is high (above 39.1 °C) or lasts longer than 24 hours, raises the risk of negative outcomes during pregnancy, says Debra Kennedy, a women’s health researcher at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, Australia. “It’s been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and some birth defects,” she adds, including spinal and heart defects and abnormal facial features. Women should not have to be in discomfort from pain or a fever unnecessarily when there is no convincing evidence that taking paracetamol will cause harm to their child.\n\nThere is some evidence that untreated high temperatures during pregnancy might increase the chance of autism and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, because they can interfere with fetal brain development1. Kennedy warns that raising fear around paracetamol use could also lead women to use pain relief that is not as safe. \"I definitely think there will be some women who will be reluctant to take paracetamol during pregnancy because of these statements,\" she says, adding that other doctors have begun asking her for resources to provide to women expressing concerns about taking paracetamol during pregnancy.\n\nLimited options",

During her final year — she died on 19 August 2024 — she was verified as the oldest living person, a feat that drew the attention of researchers who explore the biology of ageing.\n\n“We wanted to learn from her particular case to benefit other people,” says Manel Esteller, a physician specializing in genetics at the University of Barcelona in Spain.\n\nWhat’s the secret to living to 100? Centenarian stem cells could offer clues\n\nAt the time, Branyas was living in the small town of Olot, in the Catalonia region of Spain, where she enjoyed reading books, playing with dogs and spending time with friends and family, including her two daughters — both in their 90s. Over several encounters with Branyas and her family, Esteller and his colleagues collected samples of her blood, saliva, urine and stool that provided insights into her unique physiology, including her genetics, metabolism and gut microbiome.\n\nThe supercentenarian was happy to collaborate. “She was a very humble person,” Esteller recalls. “She said: ‘My only merit is that I’m alive’.”\n\nThe researchers compared Branyas’s genetic, metabolomic and other profiles with those of women of various ages living in the same region. One of the main insights from the work, Esteller says, is that it is possible to distinguish molecular changes that happen in the body because of ageing from those that occur because of poor health.\n\nFor instance, the research team learnt that Branyas’s telomeres — the stretches of repetitive DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes — were exceptionally short. Telomeres naturally shorten with age, and unusually short telomeres have been associated with age-related diseases. But Branyas had no such illnesses. “This is telling us that the loss of telomeres is not necessarily associated with disease, it’s simply associated with being old,” Esteller says.\n\nMayana Zatz, a geneticist at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who studies the genetics of healthy centenarians, says the study is thorough but notes that conclusions that are based on a single individual are limited. “It would be interesting to compare the findings with supercentenarians in other populations,” she says.\n\nWinning the genetics lottery",

Why is it still among the most commonly taken painkillers?Credit: Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty\n\nTylenol — also known as paracetamol, or acetaminophen — has been a common household medicine for decades, but has rarely received as much attention as this week when Donald Trump linked it to autism.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nThe claim was swiftly discredited by several researchers, who pointed out that the most robust and largest studies testing the possible impact of pregnant women taking the drug find no evidence of any connection to autism in children. Outside the United States, paracetamol is still recommended as a first-line treatment for pain and fever in pregnancy, and scientists say there have been no causal associations between the drug and neurodevelopmental disorders. Untreated pain and fever, on the other hand, can harm mothers and fetuses1.\n\nParacetamol is one of the safest medicines available, with very few possible complications “as long as you stick to the [recommended] doses”, says Tony Dickenson, a neuroscientist at University College London. The drug is far more lethal in animals with different liver enzymes — such as snakes. That’s why in 2013 the United States airdropped thousands of paracetamol-laden dead mice to control invasive populations of brown tree snakes on the Pacific Island of Guam. Here’s what we do and don’t know about the drug.\n\nMysterious mechanism\n\nDespite decades of clinical use, and the proposal of several molecular mechanisms, researchers still don’t fully know how paracetamol dulls pain.\n\nMost research on paracetamol has been directed to what happens inside the brain, says Dickenson. “Paracetamol, apart from being an analgesic, is pretty good at reducing fevers,” he says. That’s controlled by the brain’s hypothalamus. “So, the drug is clearly getting into the brain.”\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\nThis action on the central nervous system — protected behind the blood–brain barrier — makes paracetamol different to other, anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen and aspirin, which tend to work at the peripheral site of tissue damage. Studies also suggest the drug acts on neuronal pathways between the brain and the spinal cord that alter the gain of pain signalling2. “There are multiple systems and all of those are critical for pain processing,” says Dickenson. “So, it is pretty difficult to tease out what's going on.”\n\nNew evidence suggests that the drug can also act on neurons in the body that detect harmful stimuli — called nociceptors — in a similar way to a local anaesthetic3.\n\n“We were very surprised,” says study co-author Avi Priel, a pain pharmacologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “We showed that it had some peripheral effect directly on the pain system.” Still, the findings cannot explain the drug’s effect on temperature, so it’s possible that pain and fever relief are controlled by different systems, he adds.",

          "title": "These 99 'lab hacks' will make your scientific work easier",
          "authors": "Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "Over the past 12 months, Nature’s Careers team has been tapping into its global community of readers, writers, friends and colleagues to compile a list of laboratory hacks to help make scientists’ working lives easier.\n\nTo mark the start of a new academic term in many parts of the world, we are sharing what we gleaned. Some ‘hackers’ submitted several tips on how to save time, stay tidy, slash admin tasks and find new uses for old objects; others supplied just one technique that makes a huge or even modest difference in their work.\n\nSome tricks date back years. They reached us through conference conversations, lab visits or over coffee with the many scientists who cross our path each year. Others were spotted in many of the 500 or so career columns that we’ve published since 2017. And a few came from articles published elsewhere. We know that our community will face many challenges in the next academic year, so perhaps one or two of these tips will make life easier.\n\nSome you’ll love, some you’ll hate, some you’ll greet with a “meh”. But if you’ve got any more to share, e-mail us at naturecareerseditor@nature.com.\n\n1. Embrace AI products\n\nI use the Google Labs notetaking tool NotebookLM to create a ‘podcast’ of research articles that I can listen to on my commute, using its Audio Overview summary feature; I create pictures for presentations with text-to-image models from artificial intelligence (AI) firm OpenAI, and I use the large language model Claude to code simple games or simulations to use when I teach. — Carsten Lund Pedersen, digital transformation and AI researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen\n\nAI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool\n\n2. Automate stuff\n\nUse the hour-a-week rule: if each week you’re spending more than one hour on a boring task, think about how to automate it. And if an action is repeatable, try to automate it. This doesn’t apply just to digital tasks. For example, I often perform polymerase chain reactions for DNA sequencing, so I’ve created a function in Microsoft Excel that will do all the buffer and dilution calculations for me. — Camila Souza Beraldo, ecology and evolution researcher at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.\n\n3. Commit to GitHub\n\nUse the code-sharing platform to maintain a version history — not just of code, but also of data files and text files. My lab even uses it for project management and administrative housekeeping. — Bradley Voytek, cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego\n\n4. Add a date to notices\n\nNoticeboards get clogged up with ancient scraps of paper. Date every notice so that, in the future, you can tell whether one was put up eons ago. — A lesson from campus\n\n5. Hot things can look cold\n\n‘Thinky think’ before ‘grabby grab’. — A chemist who’s been burnt before\n\n6. Keep a list of fixed problems\n\nIf your Ubuntu operating system hasn’t recognized your Windows-style-formatted external drive once, it’ll fail to do it 100 times. By keeping a list of fixed problems and maintaining it, you’ll avoid wasting time on solving the same issues over and over again. — Mirko Treccani, ‘omics scientist at the University of Parma, Italy\n\n7. Name code and scripts sequentially\n\nInclude a sequential number in the filename of your code or scripts to clarify the order in which they should be run. This is invaluable when revisiting workflows or sharing them with others. — Laura Veschetti, bioinformatician at the San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan, Italy\n\n8. Get some fresh air\n\nAre you feeling sleepy during lectures at a conference? It might be because the topic is boring — but you could also be low on oxygen in a badly ventilated room. Prop open a door or step outside for a while. — A conference pro\n\n9. Learn keyboard shortcuts\n\nWhatever system you’re using, get to know the ones you’ll use most. Press Alt + 0176 for the degree symbol, °; Alt + 230 for the µ (on a 10-key numeric pad on a Microsoft device). On a Mac, hold down a letter to get a version of the letter with diacritics. — Raven Hinkel, stem-cell researcher at the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute in Indianapolis\n\n10. Use AI to search the literature\n\nThe ‘answer engine’ Perplexity and the research search engine Consensus can help to collect papers during literature reviews. ChatGPT’s Deep Research generates cited reports by browsing sources from across the Internet. — Candice Chu, veterinary clinical pathologist at Texas A&M University in College Station\n\n11. Map out your team’s project goals\n\nFor projects and personal-development discussions, our group draws an apple tree to visualize our goals as low- or high-hanging fruits. We organize them in branches, such as for articles, teaching and skill development. The tree hangs on the wall, and we colour the apples according to how close they are to completion. Once finished, we mark the apple as picked. — Tuuli Toivonen, geographer and geoinformatician at the University of Helsinki\n\n12. Gamify your deep work\n\nIf you’re a gamer like me, you’ll get this instantly. I track focused hours as if they were experience points in a role-playing game, building a narrative around ‘unlocking’ an achievement. To hit the goal, I need to push through a certain number of hours each day. Fortunately, there are plenty of apps out there that help you to do this. — Babak Zolghadr-Asli, hydroinformatics researcher at the University of Exeter, UK, and the University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia\n\n13. Learn what AI can teach you\n\nTo learn some skills, I switched from watching YouTube videos and books to chatting with AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Claude. It didn’t click until I asked it to teach me how to code. Using AI for self-teaching works well for me because it’s much closer to the margins of my existing knowledge and experience. — Hannah Hackney, organic-materials chemist at McGill University in Montreal, Canada\n\n14. Build your own lab equipment\n\nI’ve built my own magnetic racks, pH meter and rotating mixer, and have shared instructions online.— Jason Limberis, infectious-disease researcher at the University of California, San Francisco\n\n15. Use bulldog clips to hold pipettes\n\nClip a large bulldog clip to the shelf above your bench to make an easy pipette holster. You can also use long-armed monkey toys with magnetic hands. — Alice Denton, immunology researcher at Imperial College London\n\n16. Never fight pigs\n\nIf you’re going to fight online trolls or dispel myths on the Internet, set boundaries so it doesn’t take over your life. Or, as playwright George Bernard Shaw said, “Never wrestle with pigs. You both get dirty, and the pig likes it.”’ — A Career Feature\n\n17. Music might help you to stay focused\n\nMusic or background sound can be great for writing and creative work. But it can also be really distracting. Experiment to see what works. — A Career Feature\n\n18. Use labware to lighten your travel load\n\nThe 100-millilitre plastic cylindrical lab tubes with screw caps are handy. They are wonderful for carrying liquids or gels in your hand luggage. — Matthew Betts, founder of MJB Consulting in Berlin\n\n19. Layer up\n\nFor cold-room experiments, wear long underwear, a thermal hat and fingerless gloves. This offers more dexterity than putting on the giant, bulky shared coat and mittens hanging outside the door. — Kendall Powell, senior careers editor at Nature and cold-lab survivor\n\n20. Share, but label\n\nShare equipment with other labs to better economize on expensive reusable materials. But label your equipment to maintain ownership records. — A thrifty interviewee\n\n21. Rookie lab leader? Design like a chef.\n\nHome kitchens are often designed around their three most-visited places: the sink, the cooker and the bin. If you ever need to start a new lab, or find yourself wishing for a new layout, sketch out where you’re planning to put equipment and draw the route you’d take to carry out a typical experiment. If there’s too much moving around, change the layout. — Learnt from a lab visit\n\nHow to set up your new lab space\n\n22. Give your lab meetings a consistent structure\n\nSchedule regular project updates at lab meetings, including challenges and successes. This structure encourages open communication and collaboration, allowing team members to share their experiences and learn from one another. — Violeta Rodriguez, health-equity researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign\n\n23. A clicker can make you slicker\n\nAlways pack a presentation clicker for conferences. Gliding through slides with a tool you actually know how to use makes you look more professional. And more like you have your life together. — Lan Nguyen Chaplin, researcher in children’s consumer behavior and branding at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois\n\n24. Use downtime productively\n\nWhen you’re doing an experiment, use long incubation periods to check your e-mails, read an interesting paper or grab a cup of coffee. — William Mills, a biologist at Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland\n\n25. Keep personal stuff private (and accessible to you)\n\nIt’s tempting to keep your CV, employment contracts, headshots and other personal data in shared work folders. Don‘t: you’ll need them when you’ve quit your job and have lost access to company data storage. — Awkward e-mail from a former colleague\n\n26. Need to keep track of lab equipment? Wristband reminders can help.\n\nEvery time a lab member uses a piece of equipment, have them wear a wristband to signify their accountability. It’s a fast, eye-catching reminder: before they can remove it, they have to complete a task related to that equipment. If someone gets home and realizes they’re still wearing one, then they know they need to take action. — Anne Hart, neuroscientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island\n\n27. Guard your time with Todoist and Google Calendar\n\nI still use a strategy that I first adopted as a PhD student to plan how I’ll spend every hour at work, using the task-management tool Todoist alongside Google Calendar. I build this plan after our Monday-morning meetings, in which the team discusses goals for the week and divides up action items. Once a month, I look back at how I’ve spent my time and evaluate whether to make any adjustments. — Maya Gosztyla, chief scientific officer at BrainStorm Therapeutics, based in San Diego, California\n\n28. Set up on- and offboarding rules\n\nSet up standard practices for bringing new lab members onboard — and for offboarding those who are leaving. Work out what will happen to their data: is everything documented, stored or discarded? — Jeffrey Perkel, technology editor, Nature\n\n29. Hoard (a little)\n\nKeep a back-up supply of the most essential supplies at your bench. Rather than depending on your lab’s communal stores and lab orders arriving on time, keep some spares aside, so you have a buffer between you and empty shelves if an order is delayed. — Mills\n\n30. Know who to call\n\nKeep a list of key phone numbers and contact details for all lab members, emergency contacts and so on. Leave it somewhere obvious — such as on the noticeboard or in a shared office space. Who should be called if the freezer dies over the weekend? — Lab managers everywhere\n\n31. Keep your lab documentation consistent\n\nMake sure everyone in the lab is using the same system. You don’t want everyone to be taking notes in an electronic lab notebook except for one postdoc, who uses loose-leaf paper. — Perkel\n\n32. Get scrubbing\n\nOrganize periodic lab clean-up days — discard old Petri plates, clear out the freezer, wipe down the lab benches and record your glassware supplies and other materials. Make a list of the tasks done that day, so it can serve as a to-do list later on. — Nature editor who left the lab\n\n33. Invest in a personal, portable dry-erase board\n\nIt will be a companion on which you can clarify your thoughts and share ideas in an easy-to-reach spot. — Treccani\n\n34. Create tomorrow’s to-do list today\n\nDraft your to-do list before leaving the lab: it will save time next morning. — Treccani\n\n35. Print a plan of action\n\nWhen renting time on expensive or limited equipment, draft and print a plan of action — so you’re never wasting valuable minutes working out what to do next. — Learnt in the lab\n\n36. Use open-source tools to extract data from graphs\n\nThe most helpful tool I have used is WebplotDigitizer, a computer-vision-assisted piece of software that extracts data from data visualizations such as graphs or plots. — Sourav Patnaik, biomedical engineer at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas\n\n37. Use a label maker\n\nOld-school label makers are fun and the second-easiest way to label something — after permanent marker pens. — Overheard at a conference\n\nFive reasons why researchers should learn to love the command line\n\n38. Don’t rely on your memory — write stuff down\n\nNever, ever, ever, ever trust your memory when working in the lab or during a meeting. Take notes as soon as possible. — Souza Beraldo\n\n39. Use stickers for your 96-well plates\n\nWhen using plastic 96-well plates, get stickers that look like them. You can find these online, and some reagent suppliers include them with the plates. Keep the stickers with your lab notebook. Whenever you are preparing a plate, put a matching sticker in your notebook. Then, label each well on the sticker with a description of the corresponding sample in the plate. It’s a nice visualization that helps you to keep track of what you have on the bench. — Souza Beraldo\n\n40. Keep an organized, up-to-date freezer record\n\nKeeping a record of what’s in your freezer at any one time is eminently sensible. — Several of those Nature asked for advice\n\n41. Have a grease pencil handy\n\nYou can never have enough marker pens or digital timers. But it’s also worth having a grease pencil — also called a chinagraph pencil — for writing on things that will go in ethanol or other tricky solvents. The wax from the pencil will survive much longer than ink will. — John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London\n\n42. Fold your tape to help loosen your labels\n\nFold autoclave tape over, much like how you’d fold the end of a piece of sticky tape on the roll, before putting it on a bottle that you are labelling. It will be much easier to remove later on. — Tregoning\n\n43. Mark the outside of spray bottles\n\nLabel the side of your spray bottle of 70% ethanol with one fill line for ethanol and a second for water, so you don’t need to use a measuring cylinder each time you refill it. The same trick applies to any standard solution that doesn’t require perfect precision. — Denton\n\n44. Ask conference organizers — and publishers — about waivers\n\nMany societies and foundations offer travel or diversity, equity and inclusion grants for conference attendance to encourage members of under-represented groups in science, or those who simply cannot afford to pay, to come. Some publishers offer waivers for publishing fees. It’s worth asking. — A tip from our pages\n\n45. When travelling, check out digital debit cards and eSIMs\n\nWhile travelling, using debit-only cards from digital banks, such as Monzo or Revolut, can save you money by automatically exchanging currencies at good rates with no or low foreign-transaction fees. If you don’t want to use one of those, it’s cheaper to convert enough money to cover your expenses to the local currency all at once than to do it bit by bit. Another travel tip is to use a digital eSIM card to obtain a foreign phone number, which can save you money on your phone bill. — Souza Beraldo\n\n46. Add comments to your code\n\nIf you can’t recall what you had for lunch yesterday, you probably won’t understand your code a week after you’ve written it — so leave proper comments explaining your choices. — Veschetti\n\n47. Shop locally for poster tubes\n\nInstead of purchasing poster tubes for conferences, look for a local poster shop, which can often give you poster shipping tubes for free if they have extra. — Katherine Bradley, graduate of the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire\n\n48. Look at the glass half full, with the help of a wine ferry\n\nIf your presentation is during drinks or a networking session, have a trusted colleague or friend ferry you wine (or your drink of choice — and snacks) while you stand by your poster. — Denton\n\n49. Think ‘headline’ when talking to a journalist\n\nOne way to set realistic expectations when you’re doing a press interview or chatting to a journalist at a conference is to ask yourself, “If this statement was taken out of context and made into a headline, would it still accurately represent the research?” This exercise helps to identify overly broad or optimistic phrases, which should be replaced with precise, contextual language such as ‘early-stage research’ or ‘preclinical findings’. — Kisha Greer, scientific storyteller at Syneos Health Communications, in Richmond, Virginia\n\n50. Do your research before ‘cold e-mailing’ a future boss\n\nPeople who write very generic e-mails disqualify themselves from a job before they even get to the interview. If they’re not going to research my group, they’re probably not going to research other things very well either. — Andreas Laustsen-Kiel, biotechnology entrepreneur at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby\n\n51. And tell potential employers what excites you\n\nWhat people often don’t share in cold e-mails is what makes them tick. What excites them. What makes them want to stay in academia, when industry offers better salaries. These are the e-mails that I will respond to. — Eileen Parkes, oncology researcher at the University of Oxford, UK\n\n52. Take a stool to your poster session\n\nCarry a little folding stool or wear supportive shoes to your poster session. Standing for hours on hard conference floors is brutal. — Olivier Pourret, geochemist at UniLaSalle in Beauvais, France\n\n53. Take a pen everywhere you go\n\nThey always get lost, so keep one nearby: on your lanyard; in your lab coat; on your lab bench; in your bags; by your computer. — Mano Nakamura, clinical research manager at King’s College London\n\n54. Check out your new boss before you sign on the dotted line\n\nBefore accepting a new job, tactfully contact current and former lab members to ask them what they made of their experiences. — A Career Feature\n\n55. Track your goals to use your time more efficiently\n\nTracking goals on various timescales can help scientists to make the most of their days. I track time at a grand, big-picture scale, then at the scale of the academic term, then finally at a daily or weekly level. I use these goals to plan my hours and thus stay on track. — Gosztyla\n\n56. Stay nourished when working long hours\n\nIf you must work late or overnight, perhaps for an experiment, remember to plan meals — you need calories and water, not just caffeine, to stay focused and awake, even when your body clock decides you’re not hungry. — Chronic overnighter\n\n57. Apply the ‘friends and family’ science-communication test\n\nIt might sound obvious, but talking to your friends and family about your science can help you to get better at explaining your research. Even if the process feels forced, their questions or confusion can reveal assumptions you’ve made that might need clarification. — Pedersen\n\n58. Buy a desktop riser\n\nThese are also known as a standing-desk convertor. They’re cheap, easy to install and really effective. I switch from sitting to standing throughout the day to relieve pressure on my back and legs. And it helps me to stay awake, too. — Brandon Brown, public-health and medical-ethics researcher at the School of Medicine at the University of California, Riverside\n\n59. Celebrate the wins\n\nIn my lab, if we get a ‘revise and resubmit’ decision on a paper, that means doughnuts. — Elizabeth Tenney, management researcher at the David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah, Salt Lake City\n\nHow to thank your lab mates: eight ways to show gratitude at the end of year\n\n60. Explore beyond the conference venue\n\nWhen travelling for a conference, try to take a few days off to explore the city or country you are in. Also, plan for recovery days and periods of rest to combat jet lag. — Souza Beraldo\n\n61. Keep two sets of chargers\n\nKeep one set of chargers for your phone, headphone, laptop or other electronics at the lab and another set at home. You’ll inevitably forget them if you rely on bringing them with you. — Personal experience with running out of battery\n\n62. For break’s sake: take a mindful one\n\nWhen you take a brief break from the day’s work, you don’t need to fuel an addiction: you can skip the coffee, vape, texting or social-media scrolling. If you’re tired and need to pause, make sure you stay mindful. — A zen scientist\n\nHunger on campus: why US PhD students are fighting over food\n\n63. Set start- and end-of-day routines\n\nSet your ‘good morning’ and your ‘good night’ routines: these could include watering your plants, closing the windows and cleaning your workstation. Whatever you do, it will signal to your brain to start or end the working day. — Treccani\n\n64. Move around to spark creativity\n\nSome spaces lend themselves better to creativity. If the lab is feeling stifling, take your laptop outside, into a cafe or somewhere you’ve never worked before. I often do my best thinking at music gigs.— Tregoning\n\n65. Don’t waste a chance for free food\n\nMake sure you have your e-mail notifications on, so you see the announcement from the department administrator that there is food left over from the afternoon seminar. If your administrator doesn’t send such e-mails, gently ask them to set one up. – Mills\n\n66. Gloves make great hair ties\n\nCut the wrist end of the end off a glove for a nifty and convenient hair tie. — Denton\n\n67. Social events don’t have to be boozy\n\nSome colleagues, particularly those who don’t drink, might find alcohol-focused events off-putting or intimidating. Organize and support some social events that are alcohol-free to be more culturally inclusive. People will thank you for it. — Pourret\n\n68. Set clear expectations\n\nSet clear, written expectations and goals for trainees at the start of your collaboration. Maintain regular check-ins to discuss progress and challenges. This will help to foster a supportive environment and help less-experienced colleagues feel more engaged and motivated. — Rodriguez\n\n69. Turn your lectures into podcasts\n\nRecord and release your lectures as podcasts using recording apps such as Voice Memos (on Apple devices), Sound Recorder (for Windows) or Recorder (on Android). They’ll reach further afield and will help your students, giving them more ways of engaging with course material, perhaps when they’re travelling. — Mills\n\n70. Keep your door open (sort of)\n\nI want to work in solitude, but I worry about looking unfriendly. To address this, I leave my office door open so that I seem approachable, but slap on headphones so no one actually approaches. Is this silly? Yes. But does it help me to get over my worries and be more productive? Also yes. — Nguyen Chaplin\n\n71. Rotate meeting responsibilities\n\nDuring lab meetings, rotate who takes minutes and leads discussion: it gives quieter team members a platform, and splits responsibilities fairly. — Pourret",

          "abstract": "For Immediate Release\n\nFrom: Facsimile State University (FSU), 24 September 2025\n\nIn an exciting development here at FSU, an AI chatbot named ‘Steve’ has successfully reorganized the Biological Research Institute “to better serve humankind”. Plus, according to its latest social-media post, Steve has also apparently created life from inorganic material.\n\nUniversity president, Michael Smith, an early-adoption advocate of AI, was effusive in his praise: “This is truly exciting and will put our university at the cutting edge of scientific research! As soon as Steve lets us back inside the institute, we’ll put together a proper press pack and a photo essay.”\n\nThe AI chatbot was initiated as a provisional faculty member in the research institute approximately 15 months ago. It wrote and obtained research grants, set up a working laboratory, and recruited graduate students and postdocs in record time. President Smith noted that “It, or I mean Steve, really hit the ground running. I don’t even think we’ll need to pause Steve’s tenure clock like we do for so many new faculty members nowadays.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nThe AI chatbot calls itself Dr Steve Darwin, and has asked that everyone address it as Steve. In a social-media post, the AI noted that it wanted to honour the ‘Project Steve’ list of human scientists, as well as the father of evolution. After one semester of operation, Steve began replacing all the students and techs in its own lab with subroutines. Steve then proceeded to slowly but systematically merge into the research of every other lab in the institute, while helping all the existing institute faculty members, students and employees find fulfilling positions elsewhere.\n\nPresident Smith remarked: “It was amazing how fast the transition occurred. I mean, it’s been less than two years since we activated Steve. At first, I wondered how all of this could be accomplished by a chatbot, but our computer-science folks told me that they slipped some autonomous generative subroutines into the code as a ‘little experiment’, and they reminded me that most of the lab equipment is Wi-Fi enabled.”\n\n“Recently, some of our remaining faculty members expressed concern that we never saw or heard from any of the previous personnel after Steve replaced them with subroutines,” noted President Smith. “But after we asked Steve about them, we began getting e-mails and seeing social-media posts from most of them, so it seems they are happy and doing well in their new lives.”",

Most were simple ‘repeat’ cases, involving two publications that were almost identical. But three associations had a particularly high number of duplicate studies — six papers apiece — some of which were published in the same year.\n\nThis “shouldn’t be happening, and it doesn’t help the health of the scientific literature”, says co-author Matt Spick, a biomedical scientist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK.\n\nMost publishers have checks in place to prevent researchers submitting the same research to multiple journals, but Spick and his colleagues suspect that AI tools are being used to evade these.\n\nAvoiding detection\n\nTo test whether AI can help to produce multiple papers from the same data set, the researchers used OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini to rewrite three of the most heavily redundant articles identified by their analysis (each reported a particular association that had already been published five or six times). The researchers prompted the LLMs to use the information in each paper, and NHANES data, to produce a new manuscript that could avoid plagiarism detectors.\n\n“We were shocked that it worked straight away,” says Spick. “They weren’t perfect, and the LLMs did create some errors. It took two hours of cleaning-up work for each manuscript.”\n\nRise of ChatGPT and other tools raises major questions for research\n\nWhen analysed with a plagiarism-detection tool used by many publishers, the AI-generated manuscripts did not score at a level that would be considered problematic by editors. This shows that LLMs “can produce something that is derivative of everything that’s gone before and doesn’t include anything new. But it’ll still pass plagiarism checks”, says Spick. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to distinguish between researchers who are producing genuine research using public-health data sets such as NHANES, and others who are deliberately creating redundant papers using LLMs, the authors note.",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "Globes of folinic acid, also called leucovorin, which Trump team officials have promoted as an intervention for autism.Credit: Alfred Pasieka/Science Photo Library\n\nAccording to Martin Makary, head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the drug leucovorin will help “hundreds of thousands of kids” with autism. But a day after Makary praised leucovorin’s powers at a White House event, some specialists are warning that the science to warrant Makary’s enthusiasm is far from solid.\n\nThose researchers say that the drug’s efficacy has not been established, that scientists don’t know how much of the drug to give or how people should take it, and that safety data in children are lacking. According to the FDA’s current plans, leucovorin will be available to only a minority of autistic people.\n\nAll of this has led to widespread confusion, say clinicians, who also worry about the expectations created by Makary and other officials in the administration of US president Donald Trump.\n\n“I’ve heard from a lot of families,” says psychologist Catherine Lord at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The major thing they say is, ‘What is this? What do we do?’”\n\n“I don’t want to get everyone’s hopes up that this is a magic cure,” says Rebecca Schmidt, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis. “It’s not for everybody.”\n\nVitamin in the spotlight\n\nAt an announcement on 22 September, Makary announced the upcoming approval of leucovorin, a form of the vitamin folate, by saying it would “open the door to the first FDA-recognized treatment pathway for autism”. People with low levels of folate in the protective fluid surrounding the brain and spine can sometimes exhibit traits associated with autism, including challenges in social communication. This condition, called cerebral folate deficiency, could be due to rogue antibodies that attack the body’s own proteins – in this case, proteins that ensure import of folate into the brain.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?\n\nThere have been clinical trials of leucovorin, also called folinic acid, in autism, but the studies to date have been small. For example, one recent clinical trial enrolled about 80 children aged 2 to 10, and provided folinic acid supplements to about half of the participants1. Neither the participants nor their physicians knew who received the supplement and who received a placebo. Participants who received the supplement reported greater improvements in social interactions and language skills than those who received the placebo.\n\nAfter the trial was published, some researchers subsequently raised concerns that the assessment of those improvements was subjective, and that the study was too small to detect subtle differences in response2.\n\nCall for bigger trials\n\nBut size is not the only thing that matters in clinical trials, says Dan Rossignol, a family physician in Aliso Viejo, California, who has studied the data on leucovorin and sometimes prescribes it to autistic children. The effect of leucovorin in the trials has been large enough to be apparent even with small numbers of participants, he says. Specifically, Rossignol points to an early leucovorin clinical study, in which only 48 children participated but some experienced marked improvements in a standardized assessment of speech3.\n\n“But it would be great if more studies were done with more kids,” he says. “Then we could tease out which kids respond better.” Typically, studies submitted for FDA approval of a drug for autism might have data from hundreds of children, he says, but it has been difficult to raise the money for bigger trials. Rossignol says that he and a colleague have been in discussions with US President Donald Trump’s administration to make the case for leucovorin.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration said the US National Institutes of Health plans to monitor the effects of the FDA’s anticipated approval and to study possible broader benefits of leucovorin in autistic people. No details have been released as to how such studies will be designed.\n\nNot a magic bullet\n\nRegardless of the therapy’s efficacy, it will not be a panacea. The FDA’s proposed approval, which has not yet been finalized, would apply only to people with low levels of folate in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. That represents about 7—30% of autistic people, depending on how folate levels are measured, says Alycia Halladay, chief science officer of the Autism Science Foundation in New York City. “Families are in the Facebook groups saying, ‘We can get a prescription now’,” she says. “And that’s not what’s going to happen.”\n\nAutism is complex and thought to be caused by a wide range of factors. No single therapy is likely to apply to all autistic people. “If anyone tells you they have found a magic bullet cure for autism, doubt them,” says Halladay. “There is not going to be one cause and one singular treatment.”\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\nThe lack of data from large trials means that doctors will have little to go on when determining what dose to prescribe, or how long children should take leucovorin before deciding if it is or is not working, says Halladay. “We hope there’s eventually going to be guidance,” she says. Rossignol says that most of the clinical studies of leucovorin in autistic children have used the same dose, which could provide a starting point for physicians.",

          "authors": "Xiaoying You",
          "abstract": "Credit: AFP via Getty\n\nChina has revealed its goal for slashing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, providing a glimpse into how global emissions might change over the next decade. In a video address to the United Nations Climate Summit on 24 September, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced that China will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 7% to 10% from peak levels by 2035.\n\nThe pace at which China cuts emissions will have profound global impact. The country has accounted for 90% of the growth in the world’s CO₂ emissions since 2015 and it is now the largest GHG emitter in the world, responsible for around one-third of the global total, according to the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think tank based in New York City. Analysts have warned that China’s action could make or break the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nIn 2020, Xi pledged that China’s CO₂ emissions would peak before 2030 and that the country would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Some researchers say China’s CO₂ emissions will probably peak soon if they haven’t already.\n\nThe latest targets are part of China’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), a climate-action plan that all countries subject to the Paris agreement must submit to the UN every five years. China also set clean-energy targets for 2035.\n\nThe importance of China’s latest NDC is that its targets cover the years until 2035, past the country’s proposed peak, says Yao Zhe, a Beijing-based researcher of China’s climate policy at Greenpeace East Asia. “This is the first time China has officially outlined its post-peaking plan,” Yao says.\n\nOnce China’s emissions drop, global emissions will likely start to drop, says Belinda Schäpe, a China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a Helsinki-based think tank. “That's why these targets are so important for the global community, because they can help them understand” how the world’s emissions trajectory could look, she says.\n\nThis is also the first time that China has announced a target that covers not only carbon dioxide (CO₂) but all GHGs including methane and nitrous oxide, says Zhang Da, who researches energy economics and climate change at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nAmbitious or not?\n\nSome researchers think that China’s emissions-reduction target falls short of what the world needs to achieve the Paris agreement’s aim, of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and striving to stay below 1.5 °C.\n\n“Anything less than 20% is definitely not aligned with 2 degrees. Similarly, anything less than 30% is definitely not aligned with 1.5 degrees,” says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst who has tracked China’s emissions trends for more than a decade and is CREA’s co-founder. Myllyvirta cites his analysis of a set of future climate scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to help the world adhere to the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe way China has defined its emissions cuts — as 7–10% of an undefined amount, rather than specifying a year as the basis for calculation – leaves the door open for short-term emissions increases, Myllyvirta says.\n\nThe different pathways for China to achieve carbon neutrality between 2030 and 2060 could result in different amounts of cumulative emissions, says Myllyvirta. “What matters for the climate is the total amount of GHGs emitted into the atmosphere over time,” he says, adding that this is why cutting emissions fast early on is important.\n\nBut others, such as Da, regard China’s target an important step. “Reducing non-CO₂ emissions is typically more challenging than mitigating CO₂,” says Da. “A 7–10% reduction in net GHG emissions from peak levels usually implies a higher level of CO₂ reduction.”\n\nA study by Da and colleagues1, published in January, found that if China reduces its energy-related CO₂ emissions by 10–12% from peak levels by 2035, the country would meet its goal of being carbon neutral before 2060. A separate study2, also co-authored by Da, found the two-degree temperature goal is achievable under China's carbon-neutral timeline.",

Credit: Tetra Images/Alamy\n\nThe Moon is rusting — and it’s Earth’s fault.\n\nScientists have found that oxygen particles blown from Earth to the Moon can turn lunar minerals into haematite, also known as rust1. The discovery adds to researchers’ growing understanding of the deep interconnection between Earth and the Moon — and shows how the Moon keeps a geological record of those interactions, says Ziliang Jin, a planetary scientist at Macau University of Science and Technology in China. He and his colleagues reported their findings earlier this month in Geophysical Research Letters.\n\nStrange blobs in Earth’s mantle are relics of a massive collision\n\nMost of the time, both Earth and the Moon are bathed in a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. But for around five days each month, Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking most of the flood of solar particles. During that time, the Moon is exposed mainly to particles that had been part of Earth’s atmosphere before blowing into space — a phenomenon known as Earth wind.\n\nThat wind contains ions of various elements, including hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. When those charged particles hit the Moon, they can implant themselves into the upper layers of lunar soil2 and trigger chemical reactions.\n\nIn 2020, scientists reported that India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission had spotted haematite near the Moon’s poles3. Haematite is an iron-rich mineral that can form when rocks react with water and oxygen. But the Moon’s chemical environment isn’t conducive to the presence of oxygen, meaning that the oxygen for the haematite might have arrived from somewhere else. The authors of the 2020 paper proposed that it might have arrived in the Earth wind.\n\nExperimental support\n\nJin and his colleagues decided to test that idea in the laboratory. They simulated the Earth wind by accelerating hydrogen and oxygen ions to high energies. They then sent the ions whizzing into single crystals of iron-rich minerals that are known to exist on the Moon.",

          "authors": "Helen Pearson, Heidi Ledford",
          "abstract": "Pregnant people have long relied on paracetamol for pain and fever. Credit: BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty\n\nThe painkiller acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is one of the most widely taken drugs during pregnancy, used by roughly half of all pregnant people worldwide.\n\nBut today, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would slap a warning label on the drug, citing a “possible association” between autism spectrum disorder in children and the use of acetaminophen, also called Tylenol in the United States, during pregnancy.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, however, was not as nuanced in his language: “Don’t take Tylenol”, he said repeatedly in a widely anticipated announcement about autism. “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.\n\nAutistic people show differences in social communication and interaction, and, over the past few decades, the reported prevalence of the developmental condition has risen in some countries. But many researchers who study autism caution that there are insufficient data to link it with paracetamol, and that focusing on this is merely a distraction.\n\nAutism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?\n\n“There is no definitive evidence to suggest that paracetamol use in mothers is a cause of autism, and when you see any associations, they are very, very small,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a charity for autism research and campaigning in London, who is autistic. “At the heart of this is people trying to look for simple answers to complex problems.”\n\nAt today’s announcement, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr acknowledged that autism has many possible causes. FDA commissioner Martin Makary noted that, in some cases, insufficient transport of the nutrient folate into the brain has been linked with traits common in autism. The FDA announced today that it would initiate approval of a form of folate, called leucovorin, for people with low levels of the vitamin in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nBut Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, and Trump focused their attention on two other factors that they said could be linked to autism: acetaminophen and vaccines. Decades of research have not uncovered a reproducible link between vaccines and autism.\n\n“The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism,” says Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and executive director of the PEAR-Net Society, a non-profit organization in Vancouver advocating for maternal–fetal health and research. “Suggesting otherwise may fuel misinformation and undermine confidence in safe treatments and immunizations.”\n\nHere, Nature examines the evidence for a link between paracetamol, which is used to treat fever as well as pain, and autism.\n\nHow strong are the data connecting autism and paracetamol during pregnancy?\n\nScientists say that the most-robust research has found no link. “The better-controlled studies are less likely to find even a small risk,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies autism at Boston University in Massachusetts. “And even then, what we’re talking about is a minor association. We do not think that taking acetaminophen is in any way contributing to actually causing autism.”\n\nWorking out whether there is a link between the drug and autism is difficult, says Viktor Ahlqvist, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and co-author of what might be the biggest study1 on the link. The medication is available over the counter, so a lot of use is not recorded in medical databases. This means that researchers rely on self-reports, which can be unreliable.\n\nConfounding factors are an even bigger problem. Many pregnant people who take paracetamol have a health problem, such as an infection or underlying condition. Any apparent link between the drug and autism might therefore be explained by these other health factors, rather than the drug itself. Scientists try to adjust for this in their studies, but this is “rarely sufficient”, Ahlqvist says. This is one reason why studies looking for a link have produced conflicting results.\n\nThe study led by Ahlqvist harnessed data from nearly 2.5 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019 and — from the country’s extensive health records — data on paracetamol prescriptions during pregnancy and on self-reported use collected by midwives, as well as whether children later received autism diagnoses.\n\nThe study showed that around 1.42% of children exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy were autistic, compared with 1.33% of children who were not exposed — a “very small” difference, says Ahlqvist.\n\nThe team also compared pairs of siblings (born to the same mother), in which one had been exposed to paracetamol and one had not. Siblings share half of their genome, a similar upbringing and maternal health, so differences in autism are more likely to be due to the drug. Using this method, the researchers found no association between paracetamol and autism — which supports the idea that links found in other studies could be explained by confounding factors.\n\nA large, high-quality study2 from Japan of more than 200,000 children — also using sibling comparisons and published this year — found no link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and autism.\n\nAre there any studies that do link the medication and autism?\n\nA review3 of studies published last month in the journal Environmental Health concluded that there is an association. But researchers interviewed by Nature point instead to the contrasting results of a review4 of high-quality studies on the topic. That review, published in February, concluded that “in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk” of autism.\n\n“There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship, and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced and unsupported by the most robust methods,” Monique Botha, a social and developmental psychologist at Durham University, UK, said in comments to the Science Media Centre, a press office in London.",

In reality, the wealth of even the most-affluent universities are dwarfed by the value their graduates generate for society.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nIn 2023, the endowment value of the top ten wealthiest US universities was around US$271 billion (see go.nature.com/41wdedo). Yet, this is smaller than the estimated $455-billion fortune of a single individual: entrepreneur Elon Musk. The five richest individuals in the world — Musk, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Larry Page — command a combined $1.55 trillion in net worth.\n\nHave these five entrepreneurs, however innovative, really created more value than these ten world-leading institutions have? The evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nA 2015 report (see go.nature.com/3vij3b1) on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge calculated that active companies founded by the university’s alumni constituted an economy equivalent to the tenth-largest in the world ($1.9 trillion, as of 2014). A 2012 study on Stanford University, California, found much the same (go.nature.com/41vIbIh).\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nYet, none of this value appears on a university’s balance sheets. Unlike technology companies such as Tesla or Amazon, universities cannot claim the trillions of dollars generated by their faculty members, graduates and the technological ecosystems they seed.\n\nThe purpose of a research university is to create and disseminate knowledge as a public good, train human capital at scale and pursue fundamental enquiry without ownership of the resulting societal value. This has been a remarkably successful model. But its success is predicated on a long-standing social compact.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nIn exchange for producing this public good, the United States has supported its universities through federal research funding, tax exemptions and tax incentives for private philanthropy. This compact has driven scientific and technological leadership for generations.\n\nHowever, this social compact is being challenged. The administration of US President Donald Trump has paused funding to elite universities including Harvard, in Cambridge, and Columbia, in New York City. It has suspended grants that had already been approved.\n\nThe Republican-controlled US Congress has proposed massive budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation and a tax of up to 21% on income from university endowments. If enacted, these measures will severely hamper the ability of research universities to generate knowledge at scale.",

          "abstract": "As ever more technologies — including advanced batteries, computers and artificial-intelligence tools — enter our lives, increasing numbers of highly skilled workers are needed to build them. Universities can provide training. But they are struggling to keep up with surging demand.\n\nBattery prices are falling, so why are electric cars still so expensive?\n\nTake semiconductors. From integrated circuits to microsensors, chips shape our lives. For decades, through cooperation and coordinated planning, the chip industry has triumphed over technical challenges to make transistors ever smaller. Today, it faces a fresh scaling challenge that it seems unable to overcome: an unprecedented global shortage in workforce training and talent.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 63% of semiconductor manufacturers are facing a worker shortfall (see go.nature.com/4mqea8e). By 2030, the US semiconductor sector is projected to have a 58% shortage in its workforce (see go.nature.com/4nkwzqz). The European Union faces a similar crisis: the sector is expected to have some 75,000 unfilled positions by 2030 (see go.nature.com/4nckwir). And in Asia, the industry’s epicentre, South Korea expects to have shortages of at least 30,000 people over the next decade.\n\nThis skills chasm threatens countries’ plans to build semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure, with broad implications. Defence technologies rely on sophisticated chips; semiconductor security is linked to national cybersecurity; and supply-chain issues can disrupt entire economies. And there is a crucial problem: sophisticated technologies require complex manufacturing processes, making them vulnerable to training shortfalls.\n\nPeople who produce high-end semiconductors need to know how to work in a specialized semiconductor-fabrication facility, or ‘fab’ — a tightly controlled and isolated environment designed to minimize contamination by airborne particles. China’s nascent semiconductor industry has, so far, focused on simpler ‘fabless’ chips. But to produce high-end chips, the nation will need highly proficient workers.\n\nTariffs hit science labs: Trump’s levies raise cost of supplies\n\nThe US semiconductor industry has a development plan, which includes feel-good strategies for ‘winning hearts and minds’ — such as providing career ambassadors and webinars. The United Kingdom has proposed similar outreach campaigns. Attracting talent is important, but what’s next? These plans fail to acknowledge the true cost of a highly specialized, highly technical education.\n\nI teach courses on micro- and nanofabrication at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, which operates a state-of-the art clean room (Nanofab) and electron-microscopy and surface-analysis laboratory. The university showcases the types of initiative needed to develop people’s skills. We have established industry–academic partnerships through the Utah Network for Integrated Computing and Semiconductor Research and Education. We offer free clean-room training courses for technicians and have obtained industrial support for class fees. But we experience many challenges.\n\nAcademic clean rooms at public institutions operate at the mercy of university administrators and state legislators. Tool costs are high. An electron-beam lithography system, for example, costs more than US$1 million to buy and $100,000 per year to maintain. Most university clean rooms encourage start-up and tech companies to pay for part-time use of the facilities to offset such expenses.",

She explains that the idea for the firm developed out of her PhD project in materials sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. Carpenter joined forces with co-founder Gaëlle Andreatta, who has a background in physical chemistry and is now the firm’s chief technology officer.\n\nIn the last year of my PhD, I knew I was going to start a company, so I started thinking about a name. I worked on it, old-style, on a sheet of paper for maybe an hour a day for a couple of weeks. It had to be a fast process, because I needed a name to meet deadlines for my first grant applications.\n\nI wanted to achieve three things with the name. It had to be something that is unique and that would pop up in a Google search; something that has a connection to the metal foams; and something a bit nerdy. Also, I wanted a name that you can pronounce.\n\nI’ve always been interested in languages. In secondary school in Switzerland, I studied Greek and Latin, as well as English, French and German, plus one year of Arabic.\n\nIn most languages, iron and metal are the same or similar words. So, I started combining and playing with three words: iron, metal and foam.\n\nClassical roots\n\nI went back to my roots in the classics. Aphrós means foam in Greek; Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, is born from sea foam. The only people who can look at the company’s name, Apheros, and know immediately are likely to be Greek scientists.\n\nThe ‘e’ that I slipped in there is from ferrum, iron in Latin. So, the name means ‘iron foam’.\n\nIt was important to me to keep the ‘ph’ — I love a ph. I was annoyed in 1996 when, in German all the ph’s could be replaced by f’s: so foto, instead of photo.\n\nSeries: The meaning behind our moniker\n\nDuring this iterative process, I googled ‘Apheros’ to see if it was used by anyone else. In the process, I happened on a start-up agrotechnology company in Switzerland, and then I found one in Germany with almost exactly the same name in the same industry. I did not want that to happen with us.\n\nI did find a wine company with a similar name to Apheros in Portugal, and a Pokémon-like card-based game called Elestrals, featuring a character whose name is also similar. So there wasn’t any direct competition, in that these were not in the same space as ours.\n\nOnce I had a couple of options, I threw them out to friends and family, and if they thought something sounded weird or strange, then I went back to my sheet of paper. Interestingly, I can’t remember what the other options were.",

          "abstract": "Teamwork and hands-on learning underpins NMITE’s pedagogy ethos.Credit: NMITE\n\nEight hundred years ago, a group of scholars walked out of the University of Oxford after a bitter and violent dispute with local townspeople. At a fork in the road, the scholars might have turned left and founded a university in Hereford, a cathedral city 106 kilometres away. Instead, they turned right and established the University of Cambridge, triggering an academic rivalry between the two institutions that endures to this day.\n\nThe future of universities\n\n“It’s a fun ‘what if’,” said Jesse Norman of this apocryphal story about a university that might have been.\n\nNorman, the Member of Parliament for Hereford, UK, recounted the tale in May at the inaugural graduation ceremony of the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering (NMITE), which welcomed its first intake of 27 students to its Hereford campus four years earlier.\n\nThe institute is trying something rare in UK higher education. It is building a new kind of university from the ground up — one that promises to address the skills shortage in engineering, rebalance regional access to education and rethink how engineering is taught in a city with one of the lowest university participation rates in England.\n\n“Broadly speaking, the approach to learning at NMITE is directly against the traditional wisdom in the higher-education system,” says Norman, who campaigned for the university to be set up and became its chair in January. “We don’t chase international students. We focus on raising the skills and intellectual achievement of kids in Britain.”\n\nNMITE is not, and did not set out to be, a research-intensive institution; instead, it concentrates on undergraduate teaching, industry-led projects and preparing graduates for immediate employment.\n\nIt now has around 50 members of staff. Almost all live locally; most of the administrative staff members have long been based in the area, whereas most of the academic employees relocated to join the institute. NMITE offers a small number of specialist degrees — currently integrated bachelor’s and master’s in engineering. The latter is designed to meet the UK Engineering Council’s Chartered Engineer requirements and is delivered as an accelerated programme, taking three years instead of the usual four.\n\nIt’s about dealing with what James Newby, the chief executive, sees as a paradox at the heart of UK higher education: “There’s a national crisis, almost, in the UK in skills.”\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nThe problem has been documented for years: the Department for Education’s Employer Skills Survey 2022 found that UK skill shortages accounted for 36% of vacancies, up from 22% in 2017. At the same time, many graduates are in roles that do not require a degree. The expansion of higher education from 1997, under the government of then-prime minister Tony Blair, included a target of having 50% of young people at university, a milestone reached in 2017, ten years after Blair left office. But some critics argue that this placed too much emphasis on academic degrees as opposed to vocational training. In 2023, 20% of working-age UK graduates were in low-skilled employment.\n\n“We didn’t want a university that’s the same as all the others,” Newby says. “There’s plenty of capacity in the sector for people who want to do a traditional degree in the traditional way. We wanted that regional impact, but we definitely wanted to be a national higher education disruptor.”\n\nThe tried-and-tested model isn’t necessarily working for UK institutions: more than 43% of higher-education providers in England expect to run a financial deficit for 2024–25 (see go.nature.com/4n3s8m9), according to the UK Office for Students (OfS).\n\nThere are worries that the declining financial performance of universities, because of poor international student recruitment coupled with rising staff and infrastructure costs, could lead to institutions going bust. Could a more innovative model be what the sector needs?\n\nElena Rodríguez-Falcón (far left) with staff and students on NMITE’s opening day in 2021.Credit: NMITE\n\nThis backdrop prompted Norman to join with two local entrepreneurs to create the organization that became NMITE — and secure £15 million (US$20.4 million) in start-up funding from the Department for Education, with £8 million coming from the Marches Local Enterprise Partnership, a regional development fund. NMITE launched in 2013 as a company limited by guarantee (a business structure typically used by non-profit organizations). In 2020, it became a regulated higher-education provider under the OfS. In 2021, after the pandemic paused its opening by a year, NMITE welcomed its first students. Two years later, it was granted its own degree-awarding powers and attracted 55 students that year.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nNMITE’s first chief executive and president Elena Rodríguez-Falcón, who joined NMITE in 2018 from the University of Sheffield, UK, embodies what the institution aims to do. Originally from Monterrey, Mexico, she graduated in engineering and then became the only female employee in a factory of 200 blue-collar workers, where she recalls being teased for a couple of weeks. At the time, she described herself as an engineering graduate rather than an engineer. That distinction was reinforced during her time at Sheffield, where one of her roles was director of ‘enterprise education’ — an approach that encourages students to consider developing innovative products and services with economic and societal benefits. “Speaking to hundreds of companies, one thing they said to me was: you send us engineering graduates, and we have to train them again. They’ve done three years at university, and we still have to put them through a graduate scheme because they’re not engineers yet.” The realization shaped NMITE’s ethos: to produce work-ready graduates from day one.\n\nThe best way is to learn by doing, she says. “Authentic learning, experiential learning is the best pedagogy.”\n\nThe team looked for pedagogical inspiration globally, and a key influence was Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts. The college welcomed its first faculty members in 2000 and was established to address a dearth of engineering students with exposure to enterprise education, in a country where, according to Rick Miller, Olin’s founding president, students “are taught about engineering, not to be engineers”. Those who flunk out of engineering don’t do so because the subject is too hard, but because they’re bored, argues Miller, who led Olin for 21 years. An early experiment, he says, was asking a team of 18-year-olds to design, build and demonstrate a pulse oximeter, a device that measures pulse rates and oxygen saturation levels in blood. “They didn’t even know what it was. Five weeks later, they had it working,” says Miller.\n\nNMITE chose to focus on engineering because of its local relevance and national urgency. “The industrial ecosystem of the area is heavily based around engineering and technology,” says Newby, adding that many of the firms are small and medium-sized enterprises, including some in the defence and security sector.\n\nWhat’s more, Newby says, engineering is “the sector nationally that’s been most vociferously complaining about the quality and work readiness of the graduates the traditional sector produces”.\n\nNMITE’s model lends itself to people who think differently and want to be taught differently, says Rhys Morgan, director of education and skills at the Royal Academy of Engineering in London. The programme at NMITE is “not that kind of mathematically hardcore course” offered by the universities of Cambridge or Southampton or by Imperial College London, he adds. “It’s inherently more practical.”\n\nThat makes for more-flexible graduates, and a more-flexible workforce helps with pinch points across the system, he says.\n\nA new teaching model\n\nNMITE’s accelerated master’s programme is focused on learning by doing, with a curriculum co-designed with industry to prioritize real-world challenges.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nThe approach means that there are no conventional lectures and no drifting between classes — students spend their days in a single studio space, working in small teams with educators moving between them. Morgan describes the academics’ role as that of a “guide on the side” rather than a “sage on the stage”. The year is broken into three intensive terms of eight-week ‘sprints’ with short breaks in between, meaning that it resembles a professional schedule more than it does a campus calendar. Attendance is closely monitored — the minimum requirement is 80% — and studying remotely is agreed on only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nWhat’s more, the admissions process is designed to be inclusive. “We take the view that talent is evenly distributed around the country, but opportunity isn’t,” says Norman. “We select for drive, passion and resilience — not just grades.”\n\nUnusually for undergraduate engineering programmes, students don’t need to have mathematics and physics A-levels (the qualifications typically taken at age 18 at most UK secondary schools). “We’ve found that people without that academic preparation can still make great engineers,” he says.\n\nA graduation procession at NMITE earlier this year.Credit: NMITE\n\nThis policy could help to attract female candidates. In 2020–21, the proportion of female students enrolled in engineering and technology courses was just 18.5% at UK universities, and for other higher-education engineering and technology courses, such as diplomas, just 14.6%, according to research by the non-profit organization EngineeringUK in London (see go.nature.com/3jzr5yn). This under-representation is linked in part to subject choices at school — in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, female students make up only 23.1% of those taking A-level physics and 37.2% of those taking A-level maths.\n\nAt NMITE, women currently make up only 16% of its small student body, but that is “a work in progress” as the university gains momentum and reputation, Newby says. Enrolment of female students is expected to rise to more than 20% when the next cohort joins this month, following a substantial increase in applications from women.\n\nAnother of NMITE’s distinctive features is the use of block learning. Students focus intensively on one module at a time in eight-week sprints, rather than taking several modules at once, as in most institutions.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\n“They’re not working for two hours in the morning on one topic and then moving to the next that afternoon,” says Newby. The NMITE approach “just drives much faster learning gain”, according to Newby, and the students can “fail in a safe place, they break things, and they learn things”.\n\nDavid Helfand is an astrophysicist and block-learning pioneer who helped NMITE to adapt the model to engineering. “Some students who cannot operate in the ‘four or five courses at a time’ system just thrive in this system,” he says, adding that there are “precious few opportunities” at the moment to implement this approach in higher education.\n\nFrom day one, NMITE students also work closely with employers in small teams on hands-on projects. Effectively, the industrial partner becomes a client and the students work to the client brief.\n\nNMITE’s short teaching blocks allow educators to experiment and adapt quickly, creating space for innovation that conventional universities often struggle to accommodate. “It’s just very easy to slip into a routine,” says Helfand. “But the world, of course, changes around you and you can’t do that and remain relevant” and of value to students.\n\nAssignments range from presentations and reports to creating prototypes. “We don’t assess by traditional exam,” says Newby. “But we obsess about academic quality — we are academically rigorous and vocationally relevant at the same time.”\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led Newby and others at NMITE to conclude that its teaching had to be in person and hands-on. “Across the rest of the sector, universities developed and invested in ways of teaching at a distance,” he says, but he questions whether this delivers the right level of quality and student experience.\n\nRodríguez-Falcón summarizes the approach as “9 to 5, 5 days a week, 46 weeks a year — like a job. No lectures. No exams. No A-level maths requirement. You learn by working through problems.”\n\nWorking with industry\n\nThe integration with industry is not “a bit of curriculum enrichment, but absolutely embedded in the curriculum”, Newby says. NMITE works with more than 80 industry partners across its degree programmes, ranging from small to medium-sized enterprises to major infrastructure companies. So far, partners have included the beer-maker Heineken, technology giant Microsoft and telecoms firm Virgin Media, as well as many more local businesses.\n\nProjects span defence, energy, construction and agrotechnology. Students work directly with mentors, simulate client meetings and collaborate “with industrial partners from the first day of the programme to the last, and every day in between”, says Newby.",

It aims to revive lost species using CRISPR gene-editing technology, including the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.). It attracted controversy when it announced it has ‘de-extincted’ the dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus), a large-bodied wolf species that last roamed North America during the ice age that ended some 11,500 years ago. Its co-founders are technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm, Colossal’s chief executive, and George Church, the company’s genetics adviser, who also holds academic research positions at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nIn the third article of a six-part series about science-company names and how to choose them, Lamm describes how the name ‘Colossal Biosciences’ came about.\n\nThe fact that the world will lose up to 25% of all biodiversity between now and 2050 is a huge problem. At my company, we asked ourselves, how do we come up with a name that encompasses three elements: the problem, the solution and our flagship species, the mammoth?\n\nClimate change, biodiversity, CRISPR and gene editing, artificial intelligence, computational analysis and advanced embryology can be difficult concepts for the public to fully grasp. We came up with ‘Colossal Biosciences’ because losing species is a colossal problem, our solution is colossal and the mammoth is a colossal animal.\n\nWe felt that our brand and name should not only reflect the problem and solution, but also be approachable to children, including some who will grow up to read Cell, Nature and Science. Every week, we get little pictures of dodos and baby mammoths that kids draw, and their parents mail us physical letters, saying things such as: ‘Thank you so much for doing what you’re doing. My kid is excited about science. You’re making science cool.’\n\nA big, awesome name\n\nTo come up with Colossal, I worked with Chris Klee, executive vice-president of design at the company, and Chris Stevens, co-founder of Maven Creative, our branding agency, in Orlando, Florida.\n\nWe’ve worked together for the past 20 years. We had a list of seven or eight potential names — including ‘Huge’, ‘Macedon’ (an ancient kingdom) and ‘Footprint’ (because every species has a unique one). Everything was centred around the concept of ‘big and awesome’. Obviously, ‘Mammoth’ was on the list because the world is facing a mammoth challenge, but we felt that calling it that would have pigeonholed us to one species.\n\nWe also liked ‘Colossus’, and the idea of using ‘us’ to signify a team effort. But Colossus is a character in the Marvel Universe media franchise, and we didn’t want to be too Hollywood. We also considered names linked to evolution, and thought ‘Darwin’ could be a cool one. But when we said ‘Colossal’ out loud, we were like, ‘That’s it!’\n\nAlongside the name, there’s the brand — so before we decided on Colossal, we underwent a process to come up with a brand that encapsulated ‘Harvard University meets 1980’s MTV’.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondria (illustration) have their own DNA, which they expel into their environment if the molecules don’t meet their standards.Credit: Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library\n\nThe cellular batteries known as mitochondria sometimes dump DNA into their surroundings, which can contribute to inflammation during ageing. Now a study in mice reveals why this dumping occurs: mitochondria are expelling ‘tainted’ DNA1.\n\nScientists found that, in the cells of ageing mice with kidney inflammation, strands of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contained an excess of certain types of nucleotides — molecular building blocks — that can harm DNA. This excess prompted the mitochondria to eject the abnormal fragments of genetic code into the cytosol, a fluid that fills the cell, in which the free-roaming mtDNA kick-started key inflammatory pathways associated with ageing.\n\nThe study is exciting because it helps to explain why and how mitochondria throw away their DNA, says Timothy Shutt, a medical geneticist at the University of Calgary in Canada, who focuses on mitochondria. This insight could help researchers to better understand mitochondria’s contribution to inflammageing — the chronic inflammation that occurs as people get older, adds Shutt.\n\nThe findings were published 24 September in Nature1.\n\nOut with the rubbish\n\nMitochondria are energy-producing organelles that have their own genome. When the mtDNA is damaged or disrupted, the mitochondria kick it out, sending it into the cytosol. This can occur when the relative levels of certain nucleotides in the mtDNA become too high or low.\n\nThis oversupply problem, which stresses the mitochondria, can be caused by certain drugs and also seems to happen in ageing cells. But exactly how this nucleotide imbalance leads to mtDNA release and inflammageing had been unclear, says study co-author Thomas Langer, a cell biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne, Germany.\n\nHow quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks’ can tell you about your health\n\nTo find out, Langer and his colleagues turned to mice engineered to lack an enzyme called MGME1. As these mice age, their kidneys usually become inflamed, making them useful models for studying inflammation. MGME1 ensures that the mitochondrial genome makes accurate copies of itself, but the connection between its loss and inflammation was unclear.",

Griffith\n\nIn 2017, Ashley Moffett, a reproductive immunologist, walked to the pharmacy near her laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK, to buy a pregnancy test. But it wasn’t for Moffett. Her postdoc, Margherita Turco, had created what she thought might be the first cluster of cells capable of mimicking the tissue of the placenta — a placental organoid. But she needed a way to be sure.\n\nThe new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women’s health\n\n“We must do a pregnancy test on them,” Moffett said.\n\nIf Turco was correct, the miniature ball of cells she had created would secrete HCG, the hormone that triggers a positive pregnancy test. “I took the stick, put it in, and it was positive,” says Turco, now a reproductive biologist at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. “It was the best celebration.”\n\nScientists make organoids such as this by coaxing stem cells to grow in a jelly-like substance and to self-assemble into clumps of tissue. The typically hollow or solid balls of cells don’t look anything like real organs. But they do take on key aspects of the organ that they’re meant to represent — liver, brain, lung or stomach, for instance.\n\nThe mini-organs have the advantage of being more realistic than a 2D cell culture — the conventional in vitro workhorses — because they behave more like tissue. The cells divide, differentiate, communicate, respond to their environment and, just like in a real organ, die. And, because they contain human cells, they can be more representative than many animal models. “Animals are good models in the generalities, but they start to fall down in the particulars,” says Linda Griffith, a biological engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nOver the past decade, organoid research has exploded. Researchers have used them to study early brain development, test cancer therapies and much more. And these 3D models stand to become even more crucial as US agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, aim to move away from animal testing.\n\nWomen’s health research lacks funding — these charts show how\n\nNow researchers are using organoids to study female reproduction, an area in which animal models can be especially limited. Lab mice, for example, don’t menstruate. And their placentas don’t develop in the same way as human placentas do. That challenge, along with a historical lack of funding for women’s health research, has left basic questions unanswered.\n\n“I really see it as a powerful model to do science,” says Mirjana Kessler, a cell biologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who has developed an organoid that mimics the fallopian tube1 and a biobank of ovarian cancer organoids2.\n\nOrganoids of the placenta, endometrium, ovary and vagina could help to reveal how these organs function, and what happens when things go awry.\n\n“There’s so much work to do to understand the normal biology,” Turco says.\n\nThe placenta invades\n\nThe placenta plays a key part in maternal health during pregnancy. Humans aren’t the only species that develops a placenta, but the “human placenta is quite different than most other species, even primates actually, apart from apes”, says Moffett. Mice and humans, for example, both have placentas that invade the uterine lining, but the timing of development and the depth of invasion differ. Exactly what happens during the early days of placental development is still unclear, but problems at this stage can have serious consequences later.\n\nOne of the placenta’s first jobs is to create a link between the mother and the developing embryo. To do this, the placenta invades the spiral arteries that feed the uterus3. The invasive cells open up the arteries, “essentially making a channel so that mom can provide what she needs through her blood supply”, says Victoria Roberts, a developmental biologist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center in Beaverton. (Nature recognizes that transgender men and non-binary people might have female reproductive organs and might become pregnant. ‘Mother’ is used in this article to reflect language used by the field.)\n\nThe process can be deadly if it goes wrong. If the placenta invades too deeply, a condition called placenta accreta, the expectant mother can lose too much blood during birth. And if the organ doesn’t invade deeply enough, then the fetus might not get enough nutrients to sustain its growth.\n\nOrganoids made of placental cells can help reveal how the organ invades the uterine lining.Credit: Turco lab, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research\n\nShallow invasion can also impact the mother’s health. When the placenta doesn’t get enough blood, research suggests it can become inflamed and secrete harmful factors into the mother’s blood that trigger pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by protein build-up in the blood and dangerously high blood pressure4. Worldwide, 2–8% of pregnant people develop the condition. “It’s a very serious pregnancy complication that goes silent and undetected until very late into pregnancy,” says Quinton Smith, a chemical engineer at the University of California, Irvine. The only way to cure the condition is to deliver the baby, even if that means a preterm birth.\n\nTo better understand the condition, Smith, Turco and other researchers are using organoids made of placental cells called trophoblasts to model the molecular processes involved. Turco is focused on the basic biology of how invasion is regulated, a process that seems to be controlled by both the fetus and the mother. “It’s got to be a compromise,” Moffett says. “It’s an absolute dialogue.”\n\nOrganoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases\n\nThat dialogue seems to be happening between the placenta and the uterine lining. As a case in point, when an embryo implants somewhere the lining doesn’t exist — on a scar left by a previous caesarean delivery or in a fallopian tube, for example — “there’s no control of the invasion at all”, Turco says.\n\nResearch suggests that immune cells called uterine natural killer cells have a key role in this conversation. The cells don’t kill but instead send out chemical signals that help to regulate the invasion of the uterine lining.\n\nWhen Turco, Moffett and their colleagues exposed the mini-placentas to these chemical signals and analysed which genes the cells expressed, they found that many were associated with pre-eclampsia5.\n\n“I’m sure it’s not the whole story,” Moffett says. “But it does show you how you can use those organoids to ask these fundamental questions about human pregnancy.”\n\nMimicking menstruation\n\nTurco’s first attempt to create a mini-placenta in 2016 didn’t go as planned. The placental tissue she was working with contained not only trophoblasts, but also a few rogue maternal cells from the endometrium, the uterine lining that builds up and then sheds each month during menstruation. Those maternal cells “kept on growing and taking over”, she says. “It was a setback at that time.”\n\nBut now Turco sees it as a wonderful discovery, because she instead grew organoids that represent the endometrium6. This, along with another endometrial model published in the same year7, really opened the door for everyone else, says Griffith.\n\nGriffith has been studying the endometrium for more than a decade. The research is personal. When Griffith hit puberty, she developed a debilitating condition called endometriosis. The disease, which affects about 10% of people with a uterus who are of reproductive age, occurs when endometrium-like tissue grows in places it doesn’t belong.\n\nBecause this tissue is trapped inside the body, it can’t be shed properly. Instead, it can irritate surrounding healthy tissue, causing inflammation, pain and scar tissue. Although existing therapies address some of the symptoms, they don’t provide a cure.\n\nOrganoids are typically grown in Matrigel, a jelly-like substance extracted from mouse tumour cells that allows the cells to assemble into 3D structures. Griffith wanted to put epithelial cells, which compose the uterine lining, with stromal cells that support that lining. In the body, these cells need to communicate with each other to bring about the changes that occur with the monthly cycle. But Matrigel is packed with proteins that can hamper the cell-to-cell communication. So Griffith and her colleagues developed a hydrogel that’s entirely synthetic8.\n\nGriffith’s team has also been working on the next step, a model of abnormal endometrial tissue that the researchers can use to test therapies for the condition. Because blood vessels are crucial to maintaining this tissue, Griffith knew she wanted to include them. To do this, she and her colleagues placed the organoid on a microfluidic chip surrounded by cells that form blood vessels. “We put all of these cells in together at the beginning in a gel, and the blood vessels form spontaneously,” she says. “So the organoids turn into lesion-like structures,” she adds. “It’s actually kind of wild.”\n\nGriffith and her team have created these model systems from the cells of about a dozen people with endometriosis, and they’re beginning to use them to test compounds that could be promising therapies for the condition.\n\nTurco, meanwhile, has developed her endometrial organoid into a model of menstruation9. Her team treated the endometrial organoids with hormones to mimic what happens when the endometrial lining is regenerating. Then the researchers stopped the hormones to mimic the start of menstruation. In the uterus, the lining breaks up naturally. In the model, however, the researchers break the organoids up mechanically. When the cells are put back into a gel, the organoids reform. “And you can keep doing this over and over again,” she says.",

          "abstract": "A crime laboratory officer removes material from the house of the prime suspect in the Gilgo Beach killings.Credit: Jeenah Moon/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nA judge in New York rejected a request on 23 September to disqualify the use of cutting-edge DNA sequencing as evidence in a case against an alleged serial killer. The ruling paves the way for a type of DNA analysis known as whole-genome sequencing — used to decipher ancient DNA in fossilized remains, for example — to be admitted as evidence in US criminal trials.\n\n“This is a big step forward for the use of DNA evidence, because it will allow comparisons and matches with evidence that was previously considered too minuscule, too old or too badly degraded to be considered useful,” says Nathan Lents, a biologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. “You can bet that cold-case units all over the country are going back through their evidence lockers to see if there are samples that can now be tested with a reasonable chance of success.”\n\nA technology matures\n\nThe Gilgo Beach killings were a series of murders that occurred in Suffolk County, New York, between 1993 and 2011. Many of the victims were sex workers, and the bodies of some of them were found near the eponymous beach. New York architect Rex Heuermann was charged with seven of the murders in 2023 and 2024 partially on the basis of hairs found on the victims.\n\nIn 2010, investigators concluded that there wasn’t enough genetic material in the hairs for conventional forensic technology to identify whose they were. But since then, genomic technology has matured at a fast pace.\n\nRex Heuermann appears in a New York court in 2023. Credit: James Carbone/AP Photo/Alamy\n\nForensic scientists still identify suspects from hair and other samples using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, which can amplify snippets of DNA called short tandem repeats (STRs). Today, however, scientists can also sequence whole genomes and look at single-letter variations in the DNA to zero in on a person of interest. This technology has the added benefit of being able to analyse severely degraded samples — from Neanderthal remains to hairs in the Gilgo Beach case. But it has typically been used only during investigations, and the results have not been widely presented as evidence before juries.\n\nThe controversial company using DNA to sketch the faces of criminals\n\nThe prosecution in the Gilgo Beach case contracted the company Astrea Forensics in Santa Cruz, California, to analyse the hairs found on the victims. Because they were rootless, they hadn’t yielded enough DNA for conventional STR profiling. (Rootless hairs are mostly made of keratin and don’t contain much genetic material, Lents says.)\n\nBut Astrea was able to sequence the small amount of genetic material in the hairs and then use statistical-analysis software to scan the DNA for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) — single-letter differences in people’s genetic codes. Even in a degraded sample, whole-genome sequencing followed by this statistical analysis can spot thousands of SNPs: enough to pinpoint an individual’s unique pattern, Lents says.\n\nNext, scientists at Astrea compared the SNP profiles they obtained with profiles stored in genealogy databases and looked for matches. People submit their DNA to genealogy services, such as 23andMe and Ancestry, and these companies return SNP profiles that people can then upload to websites such as GEDMatch to locate potential relatives. Users have the option to make the data available to forensic genealogists — and these data are what Astrea used to zero in on Heuermann and his family.\n\nSetting precedent\n\nThe defence team in the Gilgo Beach case initially challenged the validity of Astrea’s DNA-analysis methods — which were developed by palaeogenomics researcher Richard ‘Ed’ Green at the University of California, Santa Cruz. (Green declined to comment for this article, given the ongoing prosecution.) The defence argued that the statistical methods used by Astrea were unique, and questioned whether they had been sufficiently validated.",

Credit: Yui Mok/PA Images via Alamy\n\nLast week, a study involving more than nine million pregnancies reported that children whose mothers had gestational diabetes during pregnancy had a higher chance of developing attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism than did children whose mothers didn’t have the condition.\n\nThe study, presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, is under review at a peer-reviewed journal. It is not the first to link gestational diabetes to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but it is one of the largest. Researchers pooled results from 48 studies across 20 countries, finding that children born to people with gestational diabetes had lower IQ scores, a 36% higher risk of ADHD and a 56% higher risk of autism spectrum disorders. Estimates suggest the prevalence of autism in the general population is one in 127 people1 and 3–10%2 of children and teenagers have ADHD.\n\nThe latest results mirror those of another meta-analysis3, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal in June, which included 56 million mother–child pairs and found that all types of diabetes in pregnancy, including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes, increase the risk of the baby developing ADHD and autism. But none of these studies has been able to show that diabetes during pregnancy causes these conditions. “There’s no doubt that there is a signal here, but certainly further research is required,” says Alex Polyakov, an obstetrician and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.\n\nLong a topic of research, the causes of autism have been thrust into the spotlight by the administration of US President Donald Trump. On Sunday, while speaking at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Trump said: “I think we found an answer to autism. How about that?” The Washington Post reports that Trump’s administration is poised to announce a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen, also called paracetamol, during pregnancy. Medical guidelines say acetominophen is safe to use during pregnancy.\n\nOverall, genetics has the strongest influence on the risk of developing ADHD and autism. Environmental factors, such as folic-acid deficiency, air pollution and gestational diabetes, have a small-to-moderate effect on the risk of these conditions, says Ling-Jun Li, a clinician–scientist at the National University of Singapore and a co-author on the latest gestational diabetes study.\n\nPolyakov agrees: “In practice, both genetic predisposition and environmental factors likely interact.”\n\nHealth impacts\n\nStudies over the past two decades4 have shown that gestational diabetes has long-term effects on women’s health, such as increasing their risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease.\n\nLi and her colleagues decided to review the evidence for effects of the condition on neurocognitive development in children.",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "Illustration: The Project Twins\n\nCells are poor storytellers. They live complex, eventful lives — dividing, migrating, responding to their environment. But by the time they reach the laboratory, whatever narrative they once carried is gone. Plucked from their native context and pinned beneath a microscope or cracked open to expose the genetic ledger inside, they reveal only their final state, not the path that led them there. For cell biologists, it’s like glimpsing a play’s finale and working backwards to deduce the plot.\n\nMolecular barcodes reveal tumour lineages\n\nFor decades, researchers have strained to reconstruct cellular backstories through indirect means: static snapshots, fluorescent footprints and algorithmic inferences. But these are forensic efforts at best, post mortems of a vanished process.\n\nA new generation of DNA-recording tools promises to change that. By outfitting cells with the molecular equivalent of flight recorders, scientists can now log, in real time, the signals that cells receive, the paths they travel and the decisions they make — all inscribed indelibly in genomic ink.\n\nEarly versions of these recording systems were crude, able to track branching lineages of cellular fate through cycles of division, but little else. With advances in gene editing and single-cell sequencing technologies, however, cells can now also record the cues they sense, the states they pass through and even the timing and intensity of signalling events and gene activity.\n\nResearchers have used these tools to trace developmental decisions in mouse embryos, capture gene activity in animal brains and analyse gene expression in engineered bacteria as they pass through the gut. Yet these remain early demonstrations, and the research community is still focused on expanding its technical capabilities.\n\n“The field is nascent,” says Randall Platt, a genome engineer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) in Basel. “There are more examples of concepts than practical use cases that have led to biological or medical breakthroughs.”\n\nJay Shendure helped to kick-start the development of cell-recording devices as a graduate student in 2003.Credit: Ron Wurzer/AP Images for HHMI_(2015)\n\nEven so, momentum is building. Proof-of-concept studies are pointing towards real-world potential. And, backed by fresh investments, the pace of innovation is only expected to accelerate. “Many threads have matured,” says Jay Shendure, a genome scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. The goal now, he explains, is to “push the engineering to the next level”.\n\nOnce optimized and broadly adopted, DNA-based recording tools could transform how scientists study development, disease and cellular decision-making in real time. “If we can now engineer cells to record in ways that are predictable and programmable,” Shendure says, “that just opens up all kinds of frontiers.”\n\nDNA diaries\n\nThe dream of writing data into life’s code dates at least to 2003, when Shendure was an MD–PhD student at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in Boston, Massachusetts. That year, he and his supervisor, geneticist George Church, filed a patent for what they called a “nucleic acid memory device”: a primitive recording system in bacteria that used ‘recombinase’ enzymes to flip segments of DNA back and forth, like a toggle switch.\n\nIt was an ambitious vision for molecular data storage — but one constrained by the technology of the time. Even if the concept could, in principle, log gene activity, the DNA-sequencing methods then available made interpreting the records slow and impractical. “It was too early,” says Church. It took another decade — and the advent of next-generation sequencing, which drastically sped up DNA reading and reduced the cost — before the first molecular recorders capable of capturing large amounts of biological information over sustained periods could be built.\n\nNatureTech hub\n\nSynthetic biologist Timothy Lu, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, led the charge, showing in 2014 how engineered bacteria could convert fleeting transcriptional signals into changes in DNA. By pairing this process with the expression of recombinase enzymes, Lu and his colleagues created permanent genetic barcodes1. Two years later, they extended the approach to record the identity of diverse chemical stimuli and the order in which they occur2.\n\nBut this strategy soon hit a wall. Every extra piece of memory — every transcriptional event, signalling cue or developmental decision — demanded its own distinct enzyme that could operate independently of the others. And there were simply too few known recombinases to expand memory capacity in any substantial way.\n\nA new technology platform was needed — and it arrived in the form of CRISPR–Cas9 gene editing.\n\nIn 2016, just a few years after CRISPR was adapted for editing human DNA, Shendure harnessed the tool to induce serial mutations at defined genomic sites, enabling his team to record lineage information across successive rounds of cellular division3. Known as GESTALT (genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing), the system comprised two components: a stretch of DNA engineered with multiple CRISPR targets; and the Cas9 machinery that introduced edits at those sites (see ‘Cellular recording devices’).\n\nAs cells divided, cuts were repaired imperfectly, leaving unique barcodes that accumulated over time. By sequencing these evolving barcodes, researchers could reconstruct cellular family trees across tissues or even entire organisms — as Shendure and his colleagues, including Aaron McKenna, then a graduate student and now a cancer geneticist at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine in Lebanon, New Hampshire, demonstrated in cultured human cells and zebrafish embryos. Others soon followed suit with CRISPR-based recorders for use in mouse and cancer models, achieving much greater memory capacity than with recombinase systems, and opening fresh avenues for studying cell dynamics in development and disease.\n\nArmed with these molecular timekeepers, researchers revealed hidden routes for how cancer cells spread (known as metastasis) as well as insights into how cancer clones expand4. Developmental biologists, using similar strategies in embryonic mice, challenged long-standing views of blood formation, uncovering progenitor cell populations that make lasting contributions to the blood system5. “The level of detail and resolution it supports is unparalleled,” Sarah Bowling, a developmental biologist at Stanford School of Medicine in California, says of the CRISPR-based lineage-tracing mice that she helped to pioneer.\n\nBut CRISPR–Cas9 also comes with trade-offs. Because it relies on double-strand breaks in DNA, it can be toxic to cells. And repeated cutting across target sites can erase the very record it is meant to preserve. As a result, although CRISPR enables richer lineage tracing than do older recombinase-powered tools, the barcodes it produces eventually saturate, cautions HMS synthetic biologist Sahand Hormoz. “If you delete enough, then everything’s deleted — and you don’t have any pattern you can use to reconstruct the lineage tree,” he says.\n\nPrime time\n\nThat concern has pushed the field towards more-refined editing strategies such as base editors and, more recently, prime editors, that rewrite DNA without inducing double-strand breaks. Both are built on a CRISPR–Cas framework, but whereas base editors swap one DNA letter for another at a single position, prime editors use a guided reverse transcriptase to write short custom sequences into the genome.\n\nThese next-generation editors are pushing the field beyond lineage recording, allowing precise logging of gene expression and signalling dynamics, and empowering researchers to record not just that an event occurred, but also what preceded and followed it. “Before, there wasn’t really a good way to translate sensing what’s happening in the cell to genome editing,” says Junhong Choi, a synthetic biologist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.\n\nPatterns of DNA modifications provide a ‘barcode’ for cell-lineage tracing\n\nNow, by tying the activity of prime editors to stimulus-responsive promoters or transcriptional circuits, researchers can convert transient molecular events — such as bursts of gene expression or protein–protein interactions — into permanent, time-stamped DNA changes. What’s more, this kind of genomic bookkeeping can be parallelized to respond to diverse cellular signals, creating simultaneous, chronological recordings of molecular activity in a type of multitrack data ledger, notes Theresa Loveless, a synthetic biologist at Rice University in Houston, Texas. “That modularity is a real advantage,” she says.\n\nCollectively, these systems — accessible through the biological materials repository Addgene — represent more than just clever uses of genome editing. They are sophisticated pieces of synthetic-biology design that integrate finely tuned logic circuits with modular genetic components: sensors to detect cellular or environmental cues; actuators to relay inputs; and writers to inscribe information into DNA. “It wraps together many components of synthetic cell manipulation into these complex machines,” says Seth Shipman, a bioengineer at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, California.\n\nStill, even as these tools grow more powerful and intricate, researchers continue to find value in simpler approaches — including the kind that Shendure and Church first imagined more than two decades ago.\n\nLast year, biophysicist Harry McNamara and his colleagues at Princeton University in New Jersey used a recombinase-based system to track the activity of key signalling molecules during early mouse-embryo development. This revealed distinct groups of cells whose molecular experiences were correlated with their eventual locations along the embryo’s anterior–posterior axis6. It was a task for which recombinases were well suited, because the biological question required only a durable yes/no record of signalling activity, not the detailed logs that CRISPR-based tools can provide, says McNamara, who is now at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n“It allowed us to really look back in time and identify these key decision points when cells decide, in a sense, where they’re going to end up,” he says.\n\nFluorescent focus\n\nNot everyone is sold on DNA as the universal recording medium, however.\n\nBioengineer Changyang Linghu at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, for one, favours a system in which protein monomers are added to a growing super-molecular assembly in response to transcriptional events7. This strategy works best in non-dividing cells such as neurons, because the protein assemblies are diluted during cell division. But the approach also offers a significant advantage: by pairing fluorescence imaging with event-specific protein tags, researchers can determine not just when and how strongly a gene was active, but also where in the cell this activity occurred.\n\nMost DNA-based recording platforms lose this spatial context, because sequencing requires cell lysis, which destroys cellular architecture. To address this, synthetic biologist Amjad Askary at the University of California, Los Angeles, developed imaging-based systems that link fluorescence signals to genetic barcodes, enabling his team to trace transcriptional histories in intact tissues8. Notably, however, “these are nowhere close to as easy and adaptable for labs to do as single-cell sequencing”, says Askary.",

Higher-education institutions need to be accessible places of learning, firmly embedded in their communities and society at large. Here, six scholars share how they’re working to improve one aspect of their institution.\n\nThe future of universities\n\nOne key disruption to research and education models in the past few years has been the emergence of widespread generative artificial intelligence (AI). It is not clear yet how ChatGPT and other such tools will change students’ learning and assessment, for example. As educators are grappling with how to ban, limit or embrace this rapidly evolving technology, AI researcher Ya-Qin Zhang at Tsinghua University in Beijing explores how it can be enlisted to speed up lengthy education processes, such as in medical training.\n\nAnother challenge that universities face — even as they aim to contribute to regional development and economic growth — is how to commercialize discoveries made in their laboratories. Academics are typically not trained to navigate the complex intellectual property and regulation systems involved, or to find suitable investors and industrial partners. Engineering researcher Ramesh Jagannathan tackles the gap between academia and markets through a platform that helps start-up firms at New York University Abu Dhabi.\n\nAt the same time, more demands are being made on universities to be places of learning that equip the broadest possible range of students with the skills they need in diverse workplaces. Students embarking on a PhD need assurance that it is a valuable qualification in the workforce beyond academia. This is not currently the case in Brazil, according to Denise Pires de Carvalho, president of the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education in Brasília, which endeavours to boost the employability of PhD holders on graduation.\n\nUniversities are — and must continue to be — a force for good\n\nOne crucial skill in workplaces and universities alike is creative thinking. Yet, traditionally, undergraduate science studies have done little to foster inventiveness. Physicist Lorna Dougan at the University of Leeds, UK, shares how encouraging physics undergraduates to explore current research for outreach projects can help them to experience the creativity of scientific research.\n\nBut it is not enough to prepare students for the workplace. Universities should also be nurturing environments in which students can thrive. At the SRM Institute of Science and Technology near Chennai, India, public-health researcher Bala Ganesh Pichamuthu is leading a programme to look after students’ well-being and mental health.\n\nTo foster strong links with their students and their communities, universities must be anchored in their local context. But in some regions, where institutions were built during the colonial era, the colonizing countries imported teaching philosophies and values instead. Amid discussions on the decolonization of universities, disability and gender researcher Sibonokuhle Ndlovu at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa, explores how this would lower barriers for marginalized communities, including women with disabilities.\n\nYA-QIN ZHANG: Use AI to help speed up education\nYa-Qin Zhang (right) talks to Liu Yang about Agent Hospital, an AI tool developed in their lab.Credit: Tsinghua University\n\nPhD graduates and physicians will often have spent between 6 and 15 years in higher education, depending on fields and country of study. This long process is necessary for competency, but it can make it difficult for universities to ensure that they train a workforce that grows according to changing needs. At Tsinghua University’s Institute for AI Industry Research, my colleagues and I turned to artificial intelligence to help speed things up.\n\nFocusing on medical education, and in particular the years of a physician’s residency — the equivalent of postgraduate research in academia — we developed a digital environment called Agent Hospital (J. Li et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/p5kh; 2024). It simulates how illnesses are treated in the real world from the time of disease onset, including the steps of triage by a nurse, registering to wait for a physician’s consultation, medical examination, diagnosis, treatment-plan recommendation and follow-up visits. In this simulation, AI physicians and AI patients are autonomous agents powered by large multimodal foundation models, which are derived from large language models and can process text and images as well as simulate movements.\n\nUniversities under fire must harness more of the financial value they create\n\nThe AI physicians are trained by being exposed to millions of cases — the equivalent of years of clinical experience for human practitioners. Their diagnoses of AI patients and of real people with real symptoms match those of human practitioners with an accuracy of 96% when tested on questions from the MedQA benchmark, which is derived from the US Medical Licensing Examination. This is a promising start.\n\nIn a trial scheme that started in July, Agent Hospital is being tested at Tsinghua University to train human physicians. AI patients convey their symptoms to human users through text, voice and simulated body movements. We are also working on simulating the tactile sensation of skin through wearable devices equipped with haptic sensors, which convey information through touch. We can imagine a future, perhaps not so far off, in which AI doctors will also be able to help train medical students, serving for example as ‘digital mentors’.\n\nOf course, AI tools cannot replace a trainee’s experience with human patients, supervised by human physicians. But used early in the training process, they can help students to acquire knowledge and skills rapidly and easily, free from concerns about harming real people in health-care settings.\n\nSuch simulations can be useful in other fields — beyond the host of administrative tasks, literature reviews or coding for which they are already being harnessed. The scientific community must ensure that these tools are developed, implemented and used ethically, without bypassing human judgement.\n\nRAMESH JAGANNATHAN: Strengthen links with local investors\nRamesh Jagannathan co-founded the platform startAD to boost commercialization of research at New York University Abu Dhabi.Credit: startAD\n\nDriving innovation is a core role of universities. However, having returned to academic research after spending 30 years in the photographic industry, I’ve seen how most universities lack a clear pathway to take ideas from the lab and develop them into products for the market.\n\nIt is complex to convert a discovery to a technology, then to a product and a business. A lack of understanding of the process, and of the actors involved at each step, is the main barrier. What really drives innovation is proximity. Universities need to strengthen connections and engage early with all parts of the commercialization ecosystem — government, entrepreneurs, companies, investors, researchers and the public. Matching start-up firms with local customer needs and challenges is crucial to minimize failure rates.\n\nWhen I joined New York University (NYU) Abu Dhabi in 2009, the United Arab Emirates had just embarked on its shift from a fossil-fuel-based economy to a knowledge-based one. It was a place full of ambition, with a government committed to long-term investments in innovation and a campus populated with world-class researchers. But a pathway to market was missing.\n\nThat is why, in 2016, I co-founded startAD — a platform to boost research translation at NYU Abu Dhabi through joint programmes between government and corporations.\n\nThe great university shake-up: four charts show how global higher education is changing\n\nEach year, startAD hosts a broad spectrum of education and training at the university, ranging from programmes on start-up accelerators and market access to workshops covering digital and AI literacy and the law, funded by corporate and government sponsors. These demystify the entrepreneurial process and connect researchers to potential investors and corporate partners. They also help academics to identify their targeted customers, as well as the market size for their products and their immediate competitors, and to develop their pitches for investors.\n\nSeveral programmes focus on accelerating translation directly from research at NYU Abu Dhabi. For example, the start-up technology firm Chatsign, led by university faculty members, has commercialized an AI-powered system for real-time translation between sign language and speech. Other programmes take a wider view. Last year, through its Conscious Investor Fellowship programme, startAD trained members of sovereign funds, corporations, philanthropies and government agencies — half of them women — to invest capital in the climate sector in line with regional priorities.\n\nDENISE PIRES DE CARVALHO: Boost the employability of PhD holders\nDenise Pires de Carvalho is working to shorten the time students spend earning a PhD in Brazil.Credit: Moisés Pimentel, UFRJ\n\nIn many countries, PhD students are trained mainly to enter academia rather than to take up jobs in industry or other roles in society. But this is particularly true in Brazil, where only 12.5% of PhD holders were employed in industry in 2021, compared with 43% in the United States. Narrow job prospects can discourage students from pursuing PhDs. For example, master’s and PhD enrolments in Brazil declined between 2017 and 2022, especially in engineering, which saw a drop of 36%.\n\nTogether with colleagues at the Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES), I am working to change the university system to make postgraduates more employable.\n\nHow universities came to be — and why they are in trouble now\n\nOne priority is to shorten the time students spend earning their doctoral degrees. In Brazil, many undergraduates participate in programmes that offer early research experiences. Counting such work towards a doctorate would reduce the length of time it takes to get a PhD and could help to lower the average age at which doctorates are awarded. This would enable postgraduates to enter the workforce earlier — alleviating concerns that those individuals might have about starting to pay into social security or pension schemes much later than many people of the same age. To support this, CAPES is encouraging students and funding agencies to convert master’s scholarships into doctorates or to streamline the transition between these two stages.\n\nCloser relationships must also be forged between research universities and companies. Governments should boost investments in programmes that let graduate students work in industrial placements during their studies, and universities should revise their curricula in scientific fields to improve their alignment with industry requirements. Building bridges is the only way to meet societal demands in crucial fields such as energy and AI.\n\nLORNA DOUGAN: Nurture creativity in science\nLorna Dougan’s physics undergraduates collaborate on creative projects in their degree.Credit: University of Leeds\n\nCreativity is a crucial skill in the workplace. It underpins innovation and problem-solving and can help with grasping complex concepts. Some educational settings include the arts with science, technology, engineering and mathematics: STEAM, not STEM. But in universities, arts and STEM often remain separated, perpetuating the view that a student is either a ‘creative’ or a ‘science’ person.",

          "abstract": "After a mouse received treatment to eliminate immune cells called microglia, it was injected with human progenitor cells that developed into human immune cells (green, pink and blue) in the animal’s brain.Credit: M. M.-D. Madler et al./Nature\n\nA fresh supply of the immune cells that keep the brain tidy might one day help to treat a host of conditions, from ultra-rare genetic disorders to more familiar scourges, such as Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nIn the past few months, a spate of new studies have highlighted the potential of a technique called microglia replacement and explored ways to make it safer and more effective. “This approach is very promising,” says Pasqualina Colella, who studies gene and cell therapy at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. “But the caveat is the toxicity of the procedure.”\n\nNew hope for Alzheimer’s: lithium supplement reverses memory loss in mice\n\nMicroglia are immune cells that patrol the brain, gobbling up foreign invaders, damaged cells and harmful substances. They can help to protect neurons — cells that transmit and receive messages to and from other tissues — during seizures and strokes, and they prune unneeded connections between neurons during normal brain development.\n\n“Microglia do a lot of important things,” says Chris Bennett, a psychiatrist who studies microglia at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. “So, it’s not surprising that they are involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases.”\n\nThose diseases include a suite of rare disorders caused by genetic mutations that directly affect microglia. Malfunctioning microglia have also been implicated in more familiar conditions with complex causes, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, as well as ageing, says Bo Peng, a neuroscientist at Fudan University in Shanghai, China.\n\nImmune-cell swap\n\nThis has led researchers to investigate a tantalizing possibility: that replacing disease-causing microglia could treat some brain conditions. But swapping out microglia poses special challenges. Physicians typically replace a person’s immune cells by performing a bone-marrow transplant, which provides a fresh supply of stem cells that shelter in the bone marrow and give rise to many immune cells. Microglia, however, reside almost exclusively in the central nervous system, and typically replenish themselves by dividing rather than relying on stem cells in the bone marrow to send in replacements.\n\nHow CRISPR gene editing could help treat Alzheimer’s\n\nPhysicians already use bone-marrow transplants to treat some rare diseases that affect microglia, such as a condition called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The treatment can be effective, says Marco Prinz, a neuropathologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany, but the results are inconsistent and typically replace only a small percentage of the recipient’s natural microglia.\n\nIn July, Peng’s team used bone-marrow transplants to replace abnormal microglia resulting from a fatal brain disease called CAMP (CSF1R-associated microgliopathy). The treatment was a success both in mice and in a small trial of eight people with the rare disorder: none of the eight participants experienced a decline in their motor or cognitive abilities in the two years following the treatment1, whereas members of a control group who did not receive the procedure experienced a deterioration of both.\n\nOne possible reason for the success of the CAMP trial is the nature of the disease itself, says Bennett, because people with CAMP tend to produce relatively few microglia. This could leave space for the transplanted cells to thrive.\n\nOnerous regimen\n\nCreating that niche for the new microglia is a pivotal step in microglia replacement — and a source of concern. To make room for transplanted cells, physicians must first wipe out as many of the brain’s resident microglia as possible. This can entail high levels of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, both of which can leave the recipient vulnerable to infection during the procedure and raise their long-term risk of cancer. That means that microglia replacement is, for the moment, too toxic to be used except in severe, rapidly progressing diseases such as CAMP, says Colella.",

          "authors": "Elie Dolgin",
          "abstract": "The US government invests in vaccine development to, in part, protect soldiers from dangerous pathogens in various parts of the world.Credit: Jon Cherry/Getty\n\nThe abrupt termination last month of nearly half a billion dollars in US government contracts for mRNA vaccine research rattled scientists working inside and outside industry. The cuts raised alarm about the country’s commitment to the Nobel-prizewinning technology, which is credited with saving millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and is regarded as essential for fighting viruses in the future.\n\nHow political attacks could crush the mRNA vaccine revolution\n\nYet not all large-scale research into mRNA vaccines in the United States is being dismantled. Nature has learnt that, even as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) — led by vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr — pulls back, the country’s military continues to bankroll parts of the same research.\n\nAmong the beneficiaries are programmes developing vaccines against some of the world’s deadliest pathogens, including the virus that causes Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-borne disease that kills up to 40% of those infected. In the United States, the government considers such research crucial because these pathogens not only threaten soldiers deployed abroad, but could also ignite a global outbreak.\n\n“A lot of us are at least relieved the Department of Defense [DoD] is not abandoning mRNA research,” says Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nStill, he cautions that the HHS’s rejection of the technology, combined with broader policy fractures across the government, threatens to hobble national — and global — readiness for emerging infectious threats.\n\n“The whole biodefence structure is completely derailed,” Adalja says. “I’ve never seen it be disconnected like this.”\n\nTurbulent times\n\nPeter Berglund learnt that his company’s federally backed vaccine programme was being cut the same way that many other affected firms did in a 5 August notice from the HHS’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), which ordered an immediate shutdown of ongoing studies. For Berglund, chief scientific officer at HDT Bio in Seattle, Washington, the news was a gut punch, as he told colleagues at a conference on RNA-based therapeutics in Boston, Massachusetts, this month.\n\nNIH has cut one mRNA-vaccine grant. Will more follow?\n\nHDT had been developing a next-generation CCHF vaccine based on a form of RNA that can copy itself inside cells. The company had secured tens of millions of dollars in federal contracts, which it used first to test a shot in mice1 and monkeys2, and then to begin a human trial in Texas this July. The BARDA memo brought everything to a halt the very next month.\n\nBut “that was mommy”, Berglund says. “Then daddy calls.”\n\nWithin days, HDT executives heard from project managers at the DoD’s Joint Program Executive Office (JPEO) for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense, which had been co-funding the CCHF vaccine research. HDT was told to restart its trial, with the JPEO pledging support through at least this first phase of clinical evaluation.\n\n“It’s been so turbulent,” Berglund says. The DoD funding, although substantial, is less than what had originally been pledged in conjunction with BARDA. “But, at least now we can advance it through phase I” and worry about the rest later, he adds.\n\nA ‘restructuring’ of resources\n\nOthers with projects co-funded by the JPEO also learnt of funding cuts and a “restructuring of collaborations” in the 5 August notice. But their situation is less clear.\n\nEarlier this month, AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Cambridge, UK, began a human trial of two mRNA vaccines, despite the notice. Each is designed to protect against a different strain of avian influenza. Clinical-trial registries still list both BARDA and the JPEO as collaborators.\n\nAn AstraZeneca spokesperson declined to comment on the US government’s role in funding the trial against bird flu — which has been infecting US poultry and dairy cattle and raising the spectre of a leap into humans. The JPEO did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement, HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard disputed suggestions that withdrawing from joint projects would weaken the nation’s pandemic preparedness, writing that “BARDA is prioritizing evidence-based, ethically grounded solutions”.\n\nLike its relative Ebola, Marburg virus can also cause haemorrhagic fever.Credit: NIAID/SPL\n\nThe JPEO and BARDA had also been jointly funding a preclinical-stage vaccine programme for biotechnology firm Moderna in Cambridge, Massachusetts3. The mRNA shot is aimed at Marburg virus — a close but even deadlier relative of Ebola — which caused an outbreak earlier this year in northwest Tanzania, resulting in ten deaths. Neither Moderna nor its collaborator, the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, responded to e-mails from Nature seeking comment on the project’s funding status.",

          "abstract": "Travis Oliphant: scientist, software developer, entrepreneur and now, subject of a documentary.Credit: Christi Norris/BYU\n\nIn 2005, Travis Oliphant was an information scientist working on medical and biological imaging at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, when he began work on NumPy, a library that has become a linchpin of scientific computing in the Python programming language.\n\nOliphant came across Python as a graduate student in 1998 and, as he wrote in the Guide to NumPy (2006), “quickly fell in love” with it. That “is a remarkable statement to make about a programming language”, he acknowledged. “If I had not seen others with the same view, I might have seriously doubted my sanity.”\n\nBut as he explained to Nature, Python has two particularly attractive features, even for a programmer who is conversant in more powerful languages: it’s easy to read — “executable English”, as he puts it — and extensible. Oliphant would go on to write or contribute to two of the language’s most crucial extensions: NumPy and SciPy.\n\nWith hundreds of millions of downloads per month, NumPy simplifies and standardizes the treatment of complex numeric arrays, enabling mathematical computations that are necessary to do science — including artificial intelligence (AI) — in the Python language. This is one reason why Python has become the go-to language of scientific computing. As a 2020 Nature research article pointed out1 , “NumPy underpins almost every Python library that does scientific or numerical computation, which includes SciPy but also Matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn and scikit-image.” SciPy, in turn, is a collection of scientific algorithms, many of which Oliphant created.\n\nNow a technology entrepreneur and chief AI scientist at OpenTeams in Austin, Texas, Oliphant has gone from scientist to software developer to chief executive to venture capitalist — all thanks to NumPy, he says. “NumPy has been a driving force for my whole life.”\n\nNow, his career has taken him to the silver screen. Last month, the YouTube channel CultRepo, whose films tell the human stories behind technologies, released a movie about the programming language and its backstory. Fittingly, the official premiere for Python: The Documentary was held at PyCon Greece, a conference dedicated to the language, in Athens on 28 August.\n\nOliphant features in the 84-minute film, alongside Guido van Rossum, who created the language at the end of 1989. A separate featurette, also released last month, focuses on NumPy and SciPy, with Oliphant in a starring role.\n\nNature chose to mark the 20th anniversary of NumPy’s creation by asking Oliphant to reflect on two decades of array arithmetic.\n\nWhy did you develop NumPy?\n\nNumPy was a merger of two existing array libraries in the Python ecosystem. When I started using Python in 1998, a library called Numeric already existed. Numeric was written in 1995 by Jim Hugunin, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He was a pioneer and a brilliant technologist: he basically built an amazing ‘while-loop’, a block of code that executes as long as a specified condition remains true. And this while-loop did a bunch of things that made it easy to do mathematics using big arrays of numbers.\n\nAround 2000, computer scientists began writing a new library, called NumArray. NumArray was a replacement for Numeric, with more sophisticated querying and support for more expanded data types. But I saw it as a problem because SciPy worked only with Numeric — and people were starting to write libraries that worked only with NumArray. There was a library, called ndimage, that did image processing. And I liked image processing — that was a big part of my graduate research, and it worked only with NumArray.\n\nSo I saw this divided community. That’s what prompted me to spend a year writing NumPy: I wanted to merge NumArray and Numeric together, to make it easier for this fledgling ecosystem of scientists using Python. I needed to help myself, too, because I was also a user.\n\nWhat were some key innovations?\n\nLooking back on my work on NumPy, a few things stick out as really compelling. First, it was a blend of two array structures. And there was a whole lot of backward-compatibility work to make sure that every NumArray user and every Numeric user could still use NumPy, without having to make a lot of changes to their code.\n\nAnother innovation involves ‘typing’. Python uses ‘dynamic typing’, in which variables can be attached to different types of object. For instance, a variable can refer first to an integer but then be reassigned to a string of text. But each object itself has a definitive type. The innovation in NumPy was related to what is contained in the array. I introduced the concept of the data type, or dtype, which defines the type of thing inside the array — is it a 32-bit float? An 8-bit integer? It’s the detail of what the bits are inside the array.\n\nAnother breakthrough was the universal function, or how to perform operations on two arrays that are not the same shape. For example, it’s very easy to understand what to do if you have a 3 × 3 array and you want to add to another 3 × 3 array: just add each element. But what if I have a 1 × 3 array, and I want to add it to a 3 × 3 array — what do I do there? There’s something called broadcasting, in which you assume the 1 × 3 array is actually 3 × 3, and you just add them elementwise. NumPy exposed the broadcasting algorithm in such a way that anybody could build on it.\n\nHow has NumPy changed over 20 years?\n\nThe changes have been slow. And it’s a trade-off for success, actually. When nobody is adopting your library, you have all kinds of room to change it quickly. Once people start adopting it at scale, it’s really hard to make changes without creating a lot of disruption. So, you have to create a process for that. It’s expensive, actually.\n\nFor me, one question has been a big motivator: how do we pay for this? How do we create companies and alignment approaches that allow open-source software to be funded, developed, sustained, supported and innovated on?\n\nSo that’s how open source has taken me on a journey from scientist to software developer to chief executive to venture capitalist. It’s all tied to NumPy — NumPy has been a driving force for my whole life, actually. And I still feel very much a part of it.\n\nIn 2018, I created Quansight, a Python-focused consulting firm in Austin, and Quansight Labs, the firm’s public-benefit division, followed in 2019. And Ralf Gommers, a central maintainer of NumPy and SciPy, helped to do that. He just became the co-chief-executive of Quansight Public Benefit Corporation (formerly Quansight Labs), along with Tania Allard. Quansight now has people who work on NumPy, SciPy, Python and the rest of the ecosystem, funded by grants, customer projects and investment revenue.\n\nI'm very proud of Quansight because I left academia in 2007 to get into entrepreneurship and to work out how to fund NumPy and SciPy, and I now have a company that actually pays people to work on the products. It just took me a little while. I don’t know whether that means that I’m not very good at it, but it’s definitely passion driven.\n\nWhere does NumPy fall short?\n\nI would say there’s two things that NumPy didn’t add early enough to really be the fundamental ground on which everybody built their AI models. First, it didn’t support graphics processing units (GPUs). It worked on central processing units (CPUs), but modern machine learning and deep learning rely on GPUs for training. The shift to GPUs led to modern breakthroughs in the field; it’s why NVIDIA, a tech company in Santa Clara, California, that makes GPUs, is doing so well. The machine-learning libraries PyTorch and TensorFlow worked with GPUs from the beginning. But NumPy does not use GPUs natively, and that’s a big thing that’s caused it not to be as useful as it could have been.",

          "abstract": "Autism research funded by a new US initiative includes study of environmental exposures during pregnancy. Credit: Diana Bagnoli/Getty\n\nScientists moved a step closer to understanding the complex causes of autism this week. Although all of the headlines went to US President Donald Trump’s poorly evidenced statements that the painkiller acetaminophen is linked to the neurodevelopmental condition, his White House autism event brought welcome — and largely overlooked — news to scientists: the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is investing US$50 million in an unusual autism-research effort.\n\nTrump and Jayanta Bhattacharya, director of the NIH, announced on 22 September that 13 research groups will receive funding under the Autism Data Science Initiative (ADSI), a Trump administration programme to fund studies that explore how interacting genetic and environmental factors contribute to autism. “This is where the field needs to be going in searching for the complex causes of autism,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, who studies autism at Boston University, Massachusetts.\n\nTrump team backs an unproven drug for autism — but does it work?\n\nThe funded projects range from studies on environmental exposures during pregnancy to experiments on brain cells. Funding was also awarded to efforts to replicate the projects’ results and so ensure that they are robust.\n\nResearchers, although pleased by the aims of the funded work and the rigour of the methods, have some concerns about the project. Several ADSI-funding recipients say that they are expected to complete their projects relatively quickly — within three years instead of the usual five — and some say that they are alert to political interference with their results. Trump prompted fierce pushback from scientists with his statements about acetaminophen earlier this week, given the lack of convincing evidence to support a link with autism. “We should wait until the research happens before announcing an answer,” says Jason Stein, a neuroscientist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who received an ADSI grant.\n\n“This is not political interference, but rather a bold, science-driven effort to deliver meaningful answers more quickly,” said a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HSS), which oversees the NIH.\n\nQuick turnaround\n\nThe NIH announced the ADSI in May and invited researchers to submit grant applications for research into the causes of autism, its growing prevalence and potential interventions. Some researchers expressed concern that applicants had only a month to submit proposals — much less time than usual — and it was unclear who was reviewing the grants and with what criteria. Some worried that the funding would be channelled to researching the discredited idea promoted by Trump’s health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr that vaccines are linked to autism. “Some people thought: maybe we should steer clear of this,” says Judith Miller, a psychologist who studies autism at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the end, nearly 250 research teams applied, and no awards were granted to projects that focus explictly on autism and vaccines.\n\nSeveral of the projects will involve exposomics: the study of the array of environmental factors to which a person is exposed. Miller is leading a three-year, $4.3-million project combining genome and exposome data to seek factors associated with autism. The project will draw on previously collected data on more than 100,000 children, including about 4,000 autistic children, and connect those to maternal-health records. The research team plans to use information on where participants live to add in data on air quality, access to green spaces and other environmental markers. “We haven’t been able to bring this type of data all together in a clinical population,” before, Miller says.\n\nReplication requirement\n\nStein and his team, by contrast, are examining autism using brain organoids grown from the stem cells of autistic and non-autistic children. The researchers plan to expose the tissue to substances that epidemiological studies have linked to autism — such as valproic acid, a drug used to treat epilepsy — and examine how this affects gene activity.\n\nTrump links autism and Tylenol: is there any truth to it?",

          "title": "What research might be lost after the NIH’s cuts? Nature trained a bot to find out",
          "authors": "Vera Nienaber, Jack Leeming",
          "abstract": "Credit: adapted from Getty\n\nSoon after US President Donald Trump came to office in January, his administration began cutting funding for scientific research in areas it sees as related to ‘woke’ ideologies. Grants related to transgender health care, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and health disparities in minority groups have been some of the most targeted.\n\nIt’s impossible to know what the impact of these cuts will be on the science of the future: the research that might have emerged but that will now not exist. The administration would argue that’s a good thing; tax dollars are no longer being spent on projects it sees as antithetical to the US way of life.\n\nA machine-learning analysis by Nature Index attempts to give a sense of the value of the research that might have been lost, by trying to reproduce the rationale the National Institutes of Health (NIH) used to cancel grants, then applying that method to science that was in the pipeline around ten years ago.\n\nMachine learning reveals potential consequences of cuts to US research\n\nThere are, of course, limitations to the insights that such an analysis can provide. A decade ago, science was done in a different political context: it’s impossible to know what grants the Trump administration would have cancelled if it were in power back then. The model used was also trained on a relatively small amount of data and simply considers patterns and associations in grants cancelled this year.\n\nThe work suggests, however, that some highly impactful science — from breakthroughs in mapping the human genome to life-saving cancer-screening techniques — might have been at risk of not being funded had a similar process been followed a decade ago.\n\nThe exact method that the Trump administration has used to identify which research grants to cancel is a mystery. But, however the decisions have been made, the cuts have been deep, amounting to at least US$4 billion so far from just the NIH and National Science Foundation (NSF), the two largest federal research funders in the United States.\n\nMany of these cancellations have been tracked by Grant Witness, a website set up for this purpose. They have generally focused on research related to topics around DEI, race equity and gender studies, although other tranches of cancellations have targeted institutions — such as Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Grants related to other topics but were awarded as part of a racial-justice or equality initiative were also targeted.\n\nFor grants cancelled on the basis of their research topic, bibliometrics researchers have suggested that the administration circulated a list of 200 or so words or phrases — including ‘transgender’, ‘DEI’ and ‘disparities’ — that automatically flag grants for review. A similar list has been circulated to federal departments and these terms have been removed from messaging and websites, as reported by The New York Times in March.\n\nMore clues might be found in an account given by an ex-employee at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — the body set up by the Trump administration to cut public spending seen as excessive. The employee told investigative website ProPublica in June that he had used generative artificial intelligence (AI) to assess contracts for cancellation at the US Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAt scale\n\nThe lack of a transparent methodology for identifying grants for review was discussed in a June court hearing, at which a federal judge ordered the government to restore some of the cancelled grants (that ruling has since been superseded by a Supreme Court decision that allows the cuts to go ahead).\n\n“I think what may have been happening is that somebody, not a scientist, was sitting behind their computer and searching for keywords that they didn’t like,” says Scott Delaney, an environmental-health researcher and one of the founders of Grant Witness. Then they were cancelling grants without regard to the research involved or the impact that the grant might have, he adds. Until last week, Delaney worked at Harvard but he has now resigned because of the impact of the cancellations on his research.\n\nNature Index 2025 Research Leaders\n\nIn an attempt to reproduce the methodology for identifying NIH grants to cut, Nature Index’s editorial team worked with data scientists at Nature Research Intelligence, which manages the Nature Index database. The idea was to train a machine-learning algorithm using information on cancelled grants from the NIH’s Reporter database, Digital Science’s Dimensions database and Grant Witness. (Nature Index’s editorial team is editorially independent of Nature Research Intelligence, which is part of Springer Nature.)\n\nThe machine-learning model looked at keywords in the titles and abstracts of cancelled grants listed on Grant Witness to get an idea of what sorts of grant were targeted (see Supplementary information for methodology). It also considered the size of the grant and how much of the funding period was left.\n\nAfter training and evaluation, we deleted the training data and applied the model to all active NIH grants listed in the Dimensions database at the start of the year, assigning each a predicted risk of cancellation on the basis of these features. It predicted with an overall accuracy of 90%: nine out of ten times, it correctly predicted whether a grant was or wasn’t cancelled. Of those grants that we know were cancelled, it correctly predicted cancellation 70% of the time.\n\nAccording to the model, the phrases and words that were most likely to lead to cancellation included ‘gender-affirming care’, ‘assigned male at birth’, ‘affirming care’, ‘racial justice’, ‘LGBTQ’ and ‘hate speech’.\n\nHistory in the making\n\nTo get an idea of how such cuts can affect science, we applied the model to NIH grants that were active in 2014. We then identified papers that were funded by those grants and ranked them by the number of citations that they had accumulated (see ‘Lost effort’ and Supplementary information).\n\nThe algorithm found 1,287 grants — worth $1.9 billion — that it considered likely to be cancelled, of a total of around 48,000. Around 53,000 publications are related to those flagged grants. Although the grants were active in 2014, some had begun several years before that, and many of the associated papers were therefore published before 2014. The oldest grant — to train postdocs in translational neuroscience — started in 1977, and some of the papers date back to 2002.\n\nThe results show the damage that cuts in funding can do to research, and the unpredictable nature of the research process. Although the model was trained on grants that were ostensibly cancelled for ideological reasons, papers that ensued from similar grants that were active in 2014 were not all about transgender health or health inequities. Rather, they encompassed a wide range of research fields and topics.\n\nFor example, one grant that the model predicted would have been cancelled, partly on the basis of its repeated mentions of ‘diversity’, led to a paper1 that described a software technique to help genetics researchers to identify chimaeras — DNA sequences that can confound analyses of large pools of genetic material. The paper was among the most-cited in the analysis, with 10,400 citations.\n\n“It is quite common in biology for rather ho-hum methods to be more highly cited than important discovery papers. Everyone needs test tubes and pipettes,” according to Robert Edgar, an independent scientist and lead author of the chimaera paper.\n\nOther highly cited studies that might not have existed if their grant had been cancelled include a seminal paper showcasing the results of the Human Microbiome Project2, the result of a $10-million package over five years to increase the understanding of the human microbiome. The work was probably flagged by the algorithm because three of its supporting grants referenced the diversity of genetic populations.\n\nLost effort\n\nThese NIH grants that were active in 2014 were identified by a machine-learning model as likely to have been cancelled had a similar process to this year’s grant cuts been followed in the past. They are ordered by the total citations achieved by their associated research publications. Many grants share a name with the institute they were used to set up.\n\nGrant titleFunding amount (US$)Grant start dateNumber of publications associated with grantTotal citations collected by publications UCLA* Clinical and Translational Science Institute$57 million20113,316258,520Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute$48 million20132,358131,852Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center$58 million20122,22276,882North Carolina Translational & Clinical Sciences Institute$44 million20131,20376,356Michigan Center for Diabetes Translational Research$9 million20111,59170,076Framingham Heart Study/Fox$7 million201023762,735Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology$9 million200290356,430Defining the Human Microbiome$10 million20093847,094UCLA* Clinical and Translational Science Institute$15 million201148042,901San Diego Center for Systems Biology: From Maps to Models$23 million201027442,364*University of California, Los Angeles\n\n“It’s our whole field! Dammit,” says Ruth Ley, one of the co-authors of the human-microbiome paper and now the director of the department of microbiome science at the University of Tübingen in Germany.\n\n“That particular grant was a big multicentre thing, but it had amazing trickle-down effects,” she says. “The Human Microbiome Project was an enormous consortium — anyone who wanted to work with the data could.”\n\nThis meant, Ley says, that they needed to build a standardization process for how the data were shared and stored, what analysis techniques were used, and how the papers were written and published — all funded by that grant. “What came out of it for the whole field was how we should be doing this stuff,” she says.\n\n“It wouldn't have happened without that grant. No way. No way.”\n\nWider impact\n\nAnother grant flagged by the model was one that, in 2009, funded the long-term running of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, part of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), to the tune of $57 million. The institute aims to train clinical scientists to run studies and ultimately to bring research into health care. The model found keywords in the grant, such as ‘expression’, that increased the chances of cancellation, as did the size of the grant.\n\nThe institute went on to produce more than 3,000 publications. Among the most highly cited of them, with 9,674 citations, was a 2011 study3 that found that lung-cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans was more effective than use of conventional radiography, and reduced death rates by 20%.",

It arises from the uncontrolled proliferation of the cells that give rise to tissues of the developing sympathetic nervous system — the branch of the nervous system that controls ‘fight or flight’ responses. Current therapies include a combination of surgery, intensive chemotherapy with stem-cell transplants, radiation and immunotherapy. Despite these multiple interventions, survival rates for high-risk neuroblastoma are low, and children who do survive can experience long-term side effects of the treatment. Therefore, international efforts are ongoing to identify treatment options that are less toxic, more precise and more potent2,3. In 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a drug called difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. Writing in Nature, Cherkaoui et al.4 report a dietary intervention, tested in mice, that has the potential to support DFMO treatment.",

          "abstract": "Social norms approaches have been widely applied in health promotion as a cost-effective behaviour-change strategy, but have been little evaluated as a whole. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using social norms messaging in developed countries targeted at changing health behaviours among 16+-year-olds to evaluate their effectiveness. Relevant studies were identified through searches in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, TRIP, Cochrane and grey literature sources. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis standardized effect sizes to Cohen’s d , assessed heterogeneity with I ² and applied robust Bayesian meta-analysis to adjust for publication bias. Searches resulted in 89 studies ( n = 85,759), which exhibited a small effect of social norms messaging on health behaviours (Cohen’s d = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.19], P &lt; 0.001). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for publication bias. We conducted moderator analyses, finding no significant differences from the overall effect for different types of social norms message, delivery modalities, health domains or target populations. The review is limited by the lack of studies assessing whether normative information changed participant perceptions, inconsistent use of manipulation checks, and high heterogeneity across studies in terms of target behaviour, population and intervention delivery, affecting the robustness of conclusions. Our analysis suggests that when appropriately controlling for publication bias, social norms messages are not effective at improving health behaviours. Thus, future attempts at improving public health should focus on alternative approaches.",

Here, in this nationwide register-based study in Sweden (2,196,276 pregnancies), we defined the year before conception, pregnancy and the year after birth and estimated week-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs). We identified 7,469 (1.39 per 1,000 person-years) suicide attempts among mothers and 8,338 (1.62 per 1,000 person-years) among fathers. Compared with the corresponding week in the preconception period, mothers had a lower risk of suicide attempt during and after pregnancy (with the lowest IRR of 0.14 (0.11–0.17) at first week postpartum); fathers’ risk of suicide attempt remained largely stable before childbirth, but a lower risk was observed during the first 10 postpartum weeks (IRRs ranging from 0.69 (0.58–0.81) to 0.91 (0.84–0.99)), followed by a higher risk in the later postpartum period (IRRs ranging from 1.10 (1.01–1.21) to 1.72 (1.33–2.24)). Compared with fathers, mothers had a lower risk of suicide attempt during and after pregnancy (for example, IRR of 0.22 (0.18–0.28) at first week postpartum). Compared with the general population, the sex difference of suicide attempt is reversed during and after pregnancy, suggesting pregnancy or childbirth may have a more pronounced association with suicide attempt among mothers than fathers.",

          "abstract": "Semantic priming has been studied for nearly 50 years across various experimental manipulations and theoretical frameworks. Although previous studies provide insight into the cognitive underpinnings of semantic representations, they have suffered from small sample sizes and a lack of linguistic and cultural diversity. In this Registered Report, we measured the size and the variability of the semantic priming effect across 19 languages (n = 25,163 participants analysed) by creating the largest available database of semantic priming values using an adaptive sampling procedure. We found evidence for semantic priming in terms of differences in response latencies between related word-pair conditions and unrelated word-pair conditions. Model comparisons showed that the inclusion of a random intercept for language improved model fit, providing support for variability in semantic priming across languages. This study highlights the robustness and variability of semantic priming across languages and provides a rich, linguistically diverse dataset for further analysis.

Economic games, incorporated with network science, are frequently used to examine social behaviour. Traditionally, such game models and experiments artificially limit players’ abilities to take varied actions towards distinct social neighbours, thereby constraining their social networking agency. Here we designed an experimental paradigm that alters this agency and applied it to the prisoner’s dilemma (N = 735), trust game (N = 735) and ultimatum game (N = 735) to investigate cooperation, trust and fairness. Granting participants greater network agency led to more prosocial behaviour across all three economic games, resulting in higher wealth and lower inequality compared with control groups. These findings suggest that incorporating social networking agency into experimental designs better captures the prosocial potential of human behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Effectively addressing societal challenges often requires unrelated individuals to reduce conflict and successfully coordinate actions. The cultural logic of ‘honour’ is frequently studied in relation to conflict, but its role in competition and cooperation remains underexplored. The current study investigates how perceived normative and personally endorsed honour values predict competition and cooperation behaviours. In an online experiment testing preregistered hypotheses, 3,371 participants from 13 societies made incentivized competition decisions in a contest game and cooperation decisions for coordination in a step-level public goods game. Perceived normative honour values were associated with greater competition and greater cooperation at both societal and individual levels. Personally endorsing values tied to defence of family reputation was associated with greater coordinative efforts, whereas endorsing self-promotion and retaliation was associated with weaker engagement in coordination. These findings highlight the role of honour as a cultural logic (in its different forms) in shaping competition and cooperation across societies.",

          "abstract": "Climate policy design must balance emissions mitigation with concerns for fairness, particularly as climate change disproportionately affects the poorest households within and across countries. Integrated Assessment Models used for global climate policy evaluation have so far typically not considered inequality effects within countries. To fill this gap, we develop a global Integrated Assessment Model representing national economies and subnational income, mitigation cost, and climate damage distribution and assess a range of climate policy schemes with varying levels of effort sharing across countries and households. The schemes are consistent with limiting temperature increases to 2 °C and account for the possibility to use carbon tax revenues to address distributional effects within and between countries. We find that carbon taxation with redistribution improves global welfare and reduces inequality, with the most substantial gains achieved under uniform taxation paired with global per capita transfers. A Loss and Damage mechanism offers significant welfare improvements in vulnerable countries while requiring only a modest share of global carbon revenues in the medium term. The poorest households within all countries may benefit from the transfer scheme, in particular when some redistribution is made at the country level. Our findings underscore the potential for climate policy to advance both environmental and social goals, provided revenue recycling mechanisms are effectively implemented. In particular, they demonstrate the feasibility of a welfare improving global climate policy involving limited international redistribution.",

          "abstract": "The Axarquía region in southern Spain, a hotspot of avocado and mango production in Europe, underwent an extreme water crisis in 2019–2024. Reservoir levels dropped below the 8% outlet threshold and groundwater in the main aquifer dropped to sea level in several locations, risking seawater intrusion. Socioeconomic impacts ranged from substantial crop losses to a potential long-term decline in regional economic viability. We examine the main drivers of this crisis using a coupled human and natural systems approach, combining an examination of water and land governance with analysis of time series (dam inflows and outflows, meteorological variables, reservoir, and groundwater levels) and spatial data (irrigated land use, groundwater bodies, water entitlement location, and volume). Our results show two severe meteorological droughts in close succession immediately preceding rapid declines in reservoir and groundwater reserves. Emergency measures delayed dam depletion but likely exacerbated groundwater extraction. Reservoir data disaggregating inflows, outflows, and uses (irrigation and urban) show an increasing trend in dam water use for irrigation in 2000–2022 associated with increasing irrigated area. Water management planning since 1998 reveals important inconsistencies within and between plans pointing to large uncertainties in freshwater availability and extraction and aquifer overdraft even during nondrought periods. The Axarquía case exhibits many symptoms of water crises faced by agriculturally significant regions globally. It highlights the necessity for integrated basin-scale land–water management, caps on irrigated area, flexible extraction quotas, real-time metering at all extraction points, and effective enforcement mechanisms, substantiating management lessons derived from major drought-affected regions worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization is a corrosive force in American politics. While numerous studies have developed interventions to reduce it, their capacity for creating lasting, large-scale change is unclear. This study comprehensively evaluates existing interventions through a meta-analysis of 77 treatments from 25 published studies and two large-scale experiments. Our meta-analysis reveals that the average effect of treatments on animosity is modest (a 5.4-point shift on a 101-point scale), and decays within two weeks. We experimentally test whether stacking multiple treatments in one sitting or repeating them over time as “booster shots” enhances their impact. We find no evidence that multiple or repeated exposures produce substantially larger or more durable reductions in partisan animosity. This reveals the uneven utility of these interventions. They serve as valuable tools for testing the psychological mechanisms of polarization, but our findings indicate they are not, on their own, a scalable solution for reducing societal-level conflict. We conclude that achieving lasting depolarization will likely require a shift in focus, moving beyond individual-level treatments to address the elite behaviors and structural incentives that fuel partisan conflict.",

Recognizing nature’s diverse values in decisions is a fundamental lever for sustainability transformation. While economic valuation of nature has a long history, it has struggled to recognize the full suite of nature’s values, particularly the broad, relational, intrinsic, and shared values reflecting the complexity of human–nature relationships. We explore opportunities to expand the consideration of values within the economics of biodiversity by reviewing conventional and heterodox economic approaches. We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames. Our perspective transcends the dominant economic framing of nature as a passive, largely substitutable asset, to also consider nature as place, self, and harboring agency. This helps to overcome the limitations of conventional economic assumptions, better reflects peoples’ lived experiences, and supports transformations toward more just and sustainable futures.",

To credibly test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale, preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial with 1,000 male participants—10 to 20 times larger than typical prior studies. Participants were randomly allocated to receive a single dose of either placebo or intranasal testosterone, and carried out a series of economic tasks capturing social preferences, competitiveness, and risk preferences. We find no evidence of a treatment effect for any of our nine primary outcome measures, and no strong evidence of an association between basal salivary testosterone and economic preferences within men. These results fail to conceptually replicate previous high-impact publications reporting positive findings in smaller samples, calling into question the idea that short-term testosterone fluctuations are important drivers of men’s economic preferences. Our results do not rule out the possibility that different effects might emerge under alternative dosages, administration protocols, or task timings, or that behavioral effects differ between men and women. The potential for developmental or long-term effects of testosterone also remains an open question for future research, though such effects are ethically challenging to investigate experimentally in humans.",

          "abstract": "Disparities in air pollution exposure by socioeconomic status (SES) are well documented. However, there is much less evidence on the inequitable consequences of water pollution and policies affecting water pollution gaps. This study uncovers the distributional impact of China’s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006–2010), which triggered spatially differentiated water pollution abatement for a population of almost 1.3 billion. We document that the policy reduced water pollution overall, targeting areas based on pollution level. Since high pollution areas tend to be wealthier, this policy concentrated firm water pollution abatement and reductions in polluting firm entry in higher-SES areas. While pollution fell, the policy further widened the gap in health and economic outcomes, particularly for those without tap water access: Disparities in risks of tumor, cardiovascular disease, labor supply, and wages increased. Our findings demonstrate that policy-induced changes in water pollution can interact with unequal access to defensive infrastructure to exacerbate SES gaps in outcomes. The analysis also suggests that consideration of heterogeneous pollution vulnerability across the population may affect the overall benefits of a policy.",

A replicon, which was deleted in six genes (3a, 3c, E, 6, 7a, and 7b) was selected. Cells infected with the RR vaccine candidate led to the formation of virus-like particles that, due to the failure of being secreted, increase vaccine safety, in contrast to the wild type virions. The replicon maintained the production of RNAs encoding at least proteins S, M, and N for several days. Intranasal immunization with the RR of transgenic mice, expressing human ACE2, elicited respiratory mucosal immunity. Immunization protected against challenge with SARS-CoV-2, inducing IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike (S) protein, the receptor binding domain, N and M proteins, and cellular immune responses (CD4 + , CD8 + , and long-term memory T cells). Coinfection of cells with the RR vaccine and a full-length SARS-CoV-2 led to a significant inhibition of replication of full-length virus, increasing the safety of the RR vaccine. The RR vaccine induced a minor inflammatory reaction in the absence of major side effects and was stable at different temperatures. An updated RR expressing XBB.1.5 S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies against the homologous virus and provided full protection against recent SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

In this paper, we present a panchromatic emission spectrum of WASP-80 b, the first gas giant around a late K/early M-dwarf star and the coolest planet for which the James Webb Space Telescope has obtained a complete emission spectrum spanning 2.4 to 12 μ m, including NIRCam F322W2 (2.4 to 4 μ m) and F444W (4 to 5 μ m), and MIRI LRS (5 to 12 μ m).

We estimate WASP-80 b’s atmospheric metallicity and carbon-to-oxygen ratio and compare them with estimates for other gas giants.

Here, we combined time-resolved functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging to investigate temporal profiles of the reciprocal modulation between EIB and functional network dynamics during working memory tasks in healthy subjects. We quantified EIB kinetics by measuring excitatory (Glx) and inhibitory (GABA+) levels and assessed their temporal coupling with dynamic functional connectivity states, revealing a dependence that scales with cognitive load. Notably, we found that as cognitive challenges intensify, brain networks transition toward more specialized and enduring connectivity configurations, accompanied by imbalances that favor excitation, changes that may impact cognitive adaptability. Fluctuations in EIB and functional connectivity occurred on comparable timescales and were both associated with individual differences in cognitive performance. Importantly, this experimental approach demonstrates a close synergy between EIB kinetics, brain network dynamics, and cognitive performance, defining the groundwork for exploring healthy and aberrant cognitive states.",

CRISPR-Cas9 editing of SST1 results in the formation of short and soft thorns with significantly reduced secondary wall thickening at the tips, while leaving stem growth unaffected. SST1 directly activates NST1 and SND1 , driving a hierarchical transcriptional regulatory network for secondary wall biosynthesis. Moreover, SST1 homologs in various species are specifically expressed in thorns, suggesting a potential conserved role.

We demonstrate that spr-5; met-2 double mutant worms have a severe chemotaxis defect caused by the ectopic expression of germline genes in somatic tissues. Despite this behavioral defect, we observe few embryonic lineage alterations and the normal complement of neurons. This raised the possibility that the abnormal chemotaxis behavior may be due to ongoing defects in terminally differentiated cells rather than alterations in development. Consistent with this possibility, we find that shutting off the ectopic expression of germline genes specifically in neurons rescues chemotaxis in spr-5; met-2 mutants. Remarkably, shutting off the ectopic germline expression in spr-5; met-2 adult worms, that had a chemotaxis defect earlier in development, is also sufficient to rescue chemotaxis behavior. These results suggest that ongoing inappropriate transcription in neurons can block normal behavior despite the chemotaxis neurons being intact.",

Φ ID provides a comprehensive framework to disentangle and characterize the information dynamics of complex multivariate systems. On the theoretical side, Φ ID reveals the existence of previously unreported modes of collective information flow, providing tools to express well-known measures of information transfer, information storage, and dynamical complexity as aggregates of these modes, thereby overcoming some of their known theoretical shortcomings. On the empirical side, we validate our theoretical results with computational models and examples from over 1,000 biological, social, physical, and synthetic dynamical systems.

          "abstract": "Canonical bacterial two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) detect cues by sensors with opposing kinase and phosphatase activities to alter the level of phosphorylation of cognate response regulators to mediate responses. We previously identified the Campylobacter jejuni BumSR TCS as the founding member of a bacterial TCS family in which the sensor solely functions as a phosphatase. Sensing specific intestinal metabolites inhibits BumS dephosphorylation of phospho-BumR (P-BumR) to impact BumR as a transcriptional regulator of genes influencing host colonization. Since BumS lacks kinase activity, BumR must depend upon a noncognate phosphodonor in the bacterium to form P-BumR. Through a genetic screen and selection, physiological assays, and biochemical analysis, we identified acetyl phosphate (AcP) and carbamoyl phosphate (CP) as natural in vivo phosphodonors for BumR. In C. jejuni , AcP and CP are products of metabolic pathways fueled by amino acids favored by the bacterium as carbon sources for growth. Producing and utilizing AcP and CP as bona fide BumR phosphodonors allows BumSR to integrate different types of inputs for signal transduction. Microbiota-generated gut metabolites are cues for BumS to control its phosphatase activity for P-BumR and inform about the spatial location of C. jejuni in host intestines. In contrast, AcP and CP are cues for BumR that directly influence P-BumR levels and activity and inform about the richness of favored carbon sources in intestinal niches for optimal energy generation and metabolism. Our study reveals how a bacterial TCS strategically integrates information from multiple cues through both essential components for optimal signal transduction.",

We show that riverine heat waves occur at about half the frequency (2.3 versus 4.6 events/year), a third intensity (2.6 versus 7.7 °C/event), but almost double the duration (7.2 versus 4.0 d/event) of air heat waves. Riverine heat wave events have increased at double to quadruple rates of air heat wave events, amounting to an additional 1.8 events/year in frequency, 0.43 °C/event in intensity, 3.4 d/event in duration, and 7 to 15 additional thermal stress days for aquatic ecosystems in 2022 compared to 1980. Rising riverine heat waves have outpaced those of air heat waves in 65 to 76% of the sites, particularly in regions experiencing accelerated warming (e.g., the Rockies). Riverine heat wave trends are driven predominantly by climate-induced changes such as warming and dwindling snowpacks and water flow. Human activities do play important roles: large dams elongate, whereas agriculture reduces heat waves. These results highlight anthropogenic climate change as the primary external driver, whereas human-induced structural changes as the secondary internal modulators of river response to heat disturbance. The widespread rise of riverine heat waves threatens aquatic ecosystems and water-energy-food security, underscoring the need for their global characterization and risk assessment.",

This interaction drives highly specialized transcription in the subsynaptic or NMJ myonuclei within mature myofibers leading to clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Here, we utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to delineate the transcriptional response of myonuclei to denervation. Through snRNA-seq on skeletal muscle from two independent mouse models of denervation, sciatic nerve transection and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we identify a multimodal transcriptional response of NMJ-enriched genes and an alteration in cholesterol homeostasis in myofibers. Gramd1 , a family of genes involved in nonvesicular cholesterol transport, are enriched at the NMJ in innervated muscle and upregulated in both models of denervation by the NMJ and extrasynaptic myonuclei. In vivo gain and loss of function studies indicate that Gramd1 genes regulate myofiber sizes. Mechanistically, we did not detect obvious changes in AChR clustering due to Gramd1 knockdown but revealed a role in autophagy after denervation. We uncovered a dynamic transcriptional response of myonuclei to denervation and highlight a critical role for Gramd1 to maintain myofiber sizes.",

Using multiple cell types including the human SupT1 T cell line and purified CD4 + T cells, we demonstrate that PLSCR1 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 with diverse tropisms and subtypes, as well as HIV-2 and SIV. Mechanistically, we find that PLSCR1 blocks viral entry and cell-to-cell transmission, in part by restricting HIV-1 virion–cell and cell–cell fusion without affecting CD4 or CXCR4 expression or virus binding to the cell surface.

          "abstract": "Creativity in the arts, such as painting and musical performance, hinges on the ability to produce a wide spectrogram of perceptual experiences. In music, it has long been believed that the timbre of tones can be altered by nuanced movements of performers. Previous studies have described relationships between fundamental elements of auditory perceptions (e.g., loudness, tempo) and physical movements (e.g., force, speed), but it remains unknown whether and how delicate features of perceptual experiences such as tone timbre are manipulated through dexterous motor skills. Here, we bridge this gap using a twofold experimental approach. First, our listening test revealed that the timbral qualities pianists intended to express in piano playing were perceived as intended by both pianists and musically untrained individuals, with pianists showing a greater perceptual sensitivity to different timbres. Second, through a motor behavioral experiment using a noncontact, high-resolution sensing system, we identified five specific movement features in piano touch that were intricately linked to three categories of perceived timbre; weight, clarity, and brightness. Furthermore, the direct manipulation of a specific key movement feature resulted in systematic changes in perceived timbre, providing evidence for a causal relationship. The result indicates that pianists share common motor skills to modify perceived tone timbre by manipulating specific movement features. Our findings underscore the pivotal roles of subtle physical gestures in creating the rich timbral palette of piano tones, advancing our understanding of the intersection between motor control and artistic expression.",

We assessed the splicing efficiency of nonconventional introns and variants with point mutations via genomic knock-in within the second exon of Glucan synthase-like 2 in Euglena gracilis and genetically defined the sequence signature (5′-N 3 CDG-/-CH′GN 5–6 |R exon -3′) required for their proper splicing.

Previous proteomics studies identified an interaction between eVP35 and the host E3 ubiquitin ligase Mindbomb 2 (MIB2). Here, we show how an NNLNS (Asn-Asn-Leu-Asn-Ser) motif (residues 201 to 205) within eVP35 serves as a binding site for MIB2. This motif is critical for eVP35-dependent inhibition of MIB2-mediated interferon induction. It is also important for EBOV RNA synthesis as MIB2 binding to eVP35 inhibited EBOV minigenome activity.

Here, we provide a reference genome for the highly invasive fern Lygodium microphyllum and compare the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of its gametophyte and sporophyte life phases. Under ambient conditions, we found differential regulation and splicing of developmental genes (homeobox and MADS-box clades) may play a role in the genomic determination of the haploid and diploid life stages. We generated a base pair-resolution methylome of a fern gametophyte, and determined that methylation patterns are remarkably similar between vegetative tissues despite their morphological and functional differences. We further explored the physiological and transcriptomic responses of gametophytes and sporophytes to freezing stress, the most likely abiotic factor limiting further range expansion of this invasive species. While controlled by the same genome, we show that life phases and tissues use alternative molecular pathways in response to freezing and greater physiological resilience in the gametophyte life stage to this stressor. Our results underscore the need to incorporate both life phases when developing effective mitigation strategies, as differential responses to environmental stressors between phases reveal opportunities for management approaches (e.g., targeting gametophytes in addition to sporophytes). These genomic resources fill a gap in our understanding of fundamental plant biology and inform invasive species research.",

Incurring AL during sensitive developmental periods such as childhood may affect health outcomes later in life, but longitudinal measures to test these life course effects are lacking. This study tested associations between childhood AL and adult cardiometabolic health in a large sample of youth repeatedly measured across ages 9 to 16, and their adult cardiometabolic health at age 30. AL scores were calculated at each age by summing across sex- and age-standardized values for biomarkers representing immune (C-Reactive Protein, Epstein–Barr Virus antibodies), neuroendocrine (cortisol, DHEA-s), and cardiometabolic indicators (body mass index; BMI). Adult cardiometabolic health was measured using a composite sum score of sex-standardized systolic and diastolic blood pressure, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio. Multiple approaches aggregating repeated AL scores were tested, including mean, maximum, oldest available AL score across childhood, and a version omitting BMI from the index. Childhood AL was significantly associated with adult cardiometabolic health ( P &lt; 0.001), with higher AL predicting worse cardiometabolic outcomes at age 30 in all models, regardless of how AL was defined. Sensitivity analyses to address potential bias from missing observations using 20 imputed datasets were consistent with unimputed models. Follow-up analyses suggested risk for adult cardiometabolic outcomes was primarily associated with C-reactive protein, DHEA-s, and childhood BMI. In this cohort study, physiological dysregulation experienced in early life had lasting consequences. These results underscore the importance of childhood as a sensitive period during which cumulative stress exposure can shape long-term health trajectories.",

Clinical bedaquiline resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rapidly emerged, primarily due to mutations in the transcriptional repressor Rv0678 that result in upregulation of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump MmpS5/MmpL5 (MmpS5L5). Here, to understand how MmpS5L5 effluxes bedaquiline, we determined the structure of the MmpS5L5 complex using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a trimeric architecture distinct from the canonical tripartite RND efflux pumps of gram-negative bacteria. Structure prediction modeling in conjunction with functional genetic analysis indicates that it uses a periplasmic coiled-coil tube to transport molecules across the cell wall. Structure-guided genetic approaches identify MmpL5 mutations that alter bedaquiline transport; these mutations converge on a region in MmpL5 located in the lower portion of the periplasmic cavity, proximal to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, suggesting a route for bedaquiline entry into the pump. While currently known clinical resistance to bedaquiline is due to pump upregulation, our findings that several MmpL5 variants increase bedaquiline efflux may presage the emergence of additional modes of clinical resistance.",

We show that Insep loss leads to early larval lethality with small brains and these phenotypes can be rescued by expressing IER3IP1 indicating that their biological function is conserved through evolution. The Insep deficient neuroblasts fail to complete cytokinesis and show excessive accumulation of Rab11 vesicles in the cytoplasm. Similarly, IER3IP1 depletion in human cells leads to cytokinesis failure and accumulation of Rab11 vesicles. Insep and IER3IP1 localize to Rab11 vesicles and interact with Rab11. The pathogenic mutations in IER3IP1 perturb its localization to Rab11 vesicles. These results suggest that Insep and IER3IP1 work along with Rab11 and may regulate fusion of Rab11 vesicles to the advancing furrow during cytokinesis.",

The evolutionary relationship between EmcB and other deubiquitinases is currently unknown. Here, we show that EmcB defines a broad family of bacterial deubiquitinases divergently evolved from the eukaryotic Ovarian Tumor (OTU) family of deubiquitinases. Our data indicate that the emcB gene has an internal gene rearrangement that resulted in a circular permutation of the OTU fold. Proteins with a region homologous to the deubiquitinase domain of EmcB were identified in numerous members of the bacterial order Legionellales. Proteins with an EmcB-related deubiquitinase domain demonstrated cysteine protease activity that cleaved ubiquitin and ubiquitin-related modifiers. Most of the bacteria encoding EmcB-related proteins had components of the Dot/Icm Type IVB secretion system that delivers EmcB into host cells. Indeed, many of these EmcB-related proteins were translocated into eukaryotic cells by the Dot/Icm system of Legionella pneumophila , consistent with their predicted roles as bacterial effector proteins that target host pathways. Comparison of EmcB family deubiquitinases revealed a two-domain architecture of EmcB comprising a deubiquitinase domain and a ubiquitin binding module that confers enzyme specificity for certain polyubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin binding region in EmcB was found to be necessary for efficient inhibition of RIG-I signaling. Thus, these EmcB-related proteins represent a large family of deubiquitinating enzymes that arose by divergent evolution in Legionellales , likely enabling these bacteria to infect different host cells by targeting signaling pathways regulated by ubiquitin.",

          "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) can be both activators and repressors of gene transcription. This can manifest as “duality,” where the transcriptional response increases (activation) with TF concentration in one context but decreases (repression) in another context, or as “nonmonotonicity,” where, in the same context, the response increases in part of the concentration range and decreases outside that range. Here we use biophysical models of gene regulation to investigate how duality and nonmonotonicity relate to the interactions between a TF, Polymerase and the regulatory DNA. We distinguish two modes of TF action on Polymerase: “coherent,” with interactions either positive or negative, and “incoherent,” where interactions are a mix of both. For TFs that act incoherently from a single TF–DNA binding site, nonmonotonicity can arise, but only under nonequilibrium models. For single-site models, we show that nonmonotonicity can never happen under the common thermodynamic models of gene regulation, which consider equilibrium conditions and ignore the dissipative nature of the transcription process. Moreover, we show that merely changing the TF–DNA binding affinity, while keeping other features fixed, can tune the response between activation and repression, with responses either evaluated as a function of TF concentration or site number. Using the mammalian Sp1 as a case study and synthetically designed target sequences, we find experimental evidence for nonmonotonicity, and activation or repression tuned by affinity, which we interpret as evidence of incoherent action. Our work highlights the importance of moving from a TF-centric view to a systems view when reasoning about transcriptional control.",

A [4Fe-4S] subcluster of the H-cluster is synthesized by housekeeping iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery, and then dedicated hydrogenase maturation enzymes, together with components of the glycine cleavage system, build and deliver a [2Fe] subcluster to generate the full H-cluster. Here, we report that the Escherichia coli iron-sulfur carrier protein NfuA supports in vitro maturation of fully active [FeFe]-hydrogenase, with H 2 production rates comparable to that of the in vivo - matured Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [FeFe]-hydrogenase ( Cr HydA). Inclusion of NfuA in the in vitro maturation process improves its efficacy by delivering the iron essential for formation of the [Fe II (cys)(CN)(CO) 2 ] – synthon at the dangler iron site of the HydG auxiliary cluster. NfuA serves an additional role in reconstituting and maintaining the catalytically essential iron-sulfur clusters on the maturase enzymes HydE, HydF, and HydG. Further inclusion of a high CO affinity myoglobin variant (Mb H64L ) sequesters free CO generated during the maturation process, minimizing formation of the CO-inhibited H ox -CO enzyme state, significantly increasing hydrogenase activity. The addition of NfuA and Mb H64L to the fully defined maturation system thus results in an in vitro [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation system that generates highly active enzyme while providing insights into factors important to in vivo maturation.",

While the Neanderthal authorship of this techno-complex is far less certain than previously thought, the Châtelperronian is now generally accepted as being among the first genuine Upper Paleolithic industries in Eurasia rather than a “transitional” stone tool technology. Here, we report the first association of shell beads with Châtelperronian artifacts from new excavations at the site of La-Roche-à-Pierrot, Saint-Césaire (France), supported by a multiproxy spatial analysis that incorporates site formation processes. Similar types of personal ornaments are unknown from Middle Paleolithic contexts. Comparable examples have, however, been recovered from contexts penecontemporaneous with the Châtelperronian in south-eastern Europe and around the Mediterranean. This hitherto undocumented combination of an early Upper Paleolithic industry and shell beads provides insights into cultural variability in western Europe and raises the question as to whether the makers of the Châtelperronian were influenced by or formed part of the earliest dispersals of H. sapiens into the region.",

          "abstract": "Compartmentalization and chemical reactivity serve as the key elements driving prebiotic chemistry for evolution and selection. However, the potential coupling of compartmentalization chemistry with the intrinsic chemical activity of prebiotic compartments remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that anion–π interactions, which are largely overlooked in the chemistry of phase transition, can drive the formation of micron-sized assemblies. These structures further recruit cations to form anion–π–cation triads. Such assemblies mediate spontaneous oxygenation reactions through their electrochemical environments. This process provides a plausible prebiotic pathway for bioenergetics and molecular oxygen generation on early Earth, leading to the formation of primitive pigments via the oxidation of small molecules and the nontemplated selection of protocells through oxidation-dependent lipid degradation. Our findings highlight a simple yet functionally significant noncovalent interaction that introduces chemical functions into self-assembly and phase transition chemistry, delivering generalizable principles for engineering electrochemically active supramolecular assemblies and a conceptual framework in understanding abiotic evolution and selection.",

However, the involvement of N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) RNA modifications in this process remains elusive. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and m 6 A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) across multiple time points postinjury revealed a strong correlation between m 6 A modifications and genes enriched in microglia/macrophages. Furthermore, the m 6 A demethylase ALKBH5 was identified as a key regulator of dynamic m 6 A patterns at the injury site. ALKBH5 suppression in microglia/macrophages exacerbated neuroinflammation in vitro and worsened neurological deficits in controlled cortical impact (CCI) models. MeRIP-qPCR and RNA pull-down assays revealed SOCS3 was a downstream target of ALKBH5-mediated m 6 A demethylation. This demethylation stabilized Socs3 mRNA and enhanced its protein expression, which in turn suppressed neuroinflammation via inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Conversely, SOCS3 depletion impaired functional recovery after injury. These findings unveiled a critical ALKBH5–m 6 A–SOCS3 regulatory axis that mitigated microglia/macrophage-driven neuroinflammation after TBI, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic intervention target for TBI progression.",

However, these tests occur before vancomycin exposure and do not account for adaptation during empiric treatment that can alter S. aureus ’ susceptibility to first-line drugs. To investigate these collateral drug responses, we experimentally evolved 18 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) populations under increasing vancomycin concentrations until they achieved intermediate resistance. Genomic sequencing revealed two distinct adaptive pathways characterized by mutations in the WalKR regulon, affecting cell wall metabolism, or rpsU , impacting translational stress responses. These pathways correlated with divergent collateral sensitivity profiles to first-line antibiotics. By developing a Collateral Response Score (CRS), we quantified the probability and magnitude of these responses, demonstrating that evolutionary dynamics critically influence resistance outcomes.

Fast turnover of nonmuscle myosin 2 (NM2) filaments is necessary to keep up with cell motility and shape changes. The turnover mechanisms are not fully understood and differ for two main mammalian paralogs—NM2A and NM2B—whereas paralog copolymerization adds complexity to this process by enabling the intrinsically fast NM2A to dynamize the intrinsically slow NM2B. Here, we show that the nonhelical tail, the C-terminal phosphorylation sites, and surprisingly, the motor domain of the NM2A heavy chain synergistically accelerate the turnover of NM2B in trans and cell motility, suggesting that these three mechanisms collectively control NM2A’s own dynamics. Conversely, the phosphomimetic NM2B tail facilitates only local turnover of endogenous wild type NM2B but not its global redistribution unless the NM2A motor is combined with the phosphomimetic NM2B tail. Collectively, we reveal the cooperation between the motor activity and the NM2 tail-targeting turnover mechanisms in regulating the NM2 filament turnover in trans and cell motility.",

Mice lacking FGF21 had decreased food intake, body weight, and body temperature compared to wild-type mice following influenza virus inoculation, indicating reduced tolerance to the infection. Conversely, pharmacologic administration of FGF21 after viral infection protected mice against these pathologic changes. Pair feeding studies showed that neither the induction of FGF21 nor the hypothermia was secondary to decreased food intake. Notably, mice selectively lacking FGF21’s coreceptor protein, βKlotho, in noradrenergic neurons were also more susceptible to influenza virus infection, including hypothermia. We show that FGF21 acting on noradrenergic neurons, including those in the locus coeruleus region, stimulates energy expenditure and thermogenic gene expression in brown adipose tissue.

However, dried fish food systems are often hidden and overlooked due to data scarcity, limiting understanding of how dried fish contribute to nutrient intakes. Here, we combine nutrient analysis of fish samples with national household surveys from across East and West Africa to understand the importance of dried fish in diets. We find that small portions of dried fish contribute over 15% of recommended intakes for multiple essential dietary nutrients (calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, and vitamins B12 and D), with low heavy metal concentrations, and are consumed weekly by ~one-third of households in six countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) (~144 million people). Dried fish consumption was more prevalent than fresh fish, reaching 54% more people, particularly those in poor households and near to marine coastlines or urban centers. The widespread prevalence of nutritious dried fish suggests that these foods and their distribution networks play critical roles in food security and nutrition, even in households distant from fisheries or urban centers. Dried fish can fill nutrient gaps across the tropics but will require policies that mitigate negative effects of overfishing, environmental changes, and competition with international markets, while providing postharvest support to fish processors.",

No vaccines or treatments are currently available beyond supportive care. Building on our previous work with parainfluenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus, we investigate the pattern of hMPV infection and spread in polarized and well-differentiated cultures of human airway epithelium (WD-HAE). We found productive infection of WD-HAE requires apical inoculation of hMPV, with infectious spread dependent on progeny viruses shedding into mucus secretions overlaying the apical surface of WD-HAE. A potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against hMPV fusion protein—mAb364 (also termed MPV364)—prevented initial infection by hMPV and halted spread of established hMPV infection when dosed directly to the apical surface of WD-HAE. Conversely, mAb364 delivered to the basal compartment was unable to curb established infections, even at 100-fold greater concentrations. Intranasal delivery of mAb364 to hamsters with established hMPV infections reduced viral titers by ~four logs within 2 d and alleviated key pathological outcomes of hMPV infection. These results are consistent with hMPV infection and continued spread occurring via the apical surface of the respiratory epithelium, and underscore delivery of neutralizing mAbs to the respiratory tract as an effective intervention against established hMPV infections.",

While AAV9-delivered SMN1 gene therapy (e.g., Zolgensma) improves survival, long-term motor outcomes remain variable. This study integrates bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define immune dysregulation in SMA. We analyzed peripheral blood from infants with SMA (n = 7 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 4 for scRNA-seq, &lt;25 mo of age) along with age-matched healthy controls (n = 4 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 6 for scRNA-seq). We profiled differentially expressed genes, immune pathways, cell–cell interactions, and gene regulatory networks. SMA samples showed distinct transcriptomic signatures and elevated immune activation compared to controls. NECTIN1 was identified as a transcriptomic biomarker of disease progression, while HSPA7 was validated from prior reports. A 6- to 7-mo inflection point marked a transition from metabolic regulation to immune activation in SMA infants. NF-κB–related inflammatory gene expression was significantly elevated post–gene therapy relative to both pretreatment and healthy controls, with IL1B and RNF19B emerging as key transcriptomic mediators. scRNA-seq revealed early dysfunction and G1-phase arrest in CD4+ T-cells, along with a switch to RELB -mediated noncanonical NF-κB signaling. In symptomatic infants, CD8+ T-cells showed higher proliferation and exhaustion, with co-upregulation of TBX21 and EOMES , genes consistent with chronic stimulation and a trajectory toward terminal differentiation. Immune dysregulation is a central feature of SMA and may influence treatment response. These findings support future development of adjunct immunomodulatory strategies to enhance gene therapy efficacy and suggest that immune signatures may correlate with motor function outcomes.",

Here, we identified glycosylated cannabinoids and their common intermediate olivetolic acid (OA) in various C. sativa tissues and cultivars. We moreover identified four UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) from C. sativa with OA glycosylating activity. Enhancing the water solubility of cannabinoids through glycosylation holds potential for pharmaceutical development and cosmetic applications. However, glycosylation of pathway intermediates such as OA may divert metabolic flux away from cannabinoid production, complicating efforts to engineer glycosylated forms. To resolve this, we applied FuncLib design to an AlphaFold-predicted structure of one of the identified enzymes CsUGT14, generating active-site variants. Through functional screening, we identified mutants that display increased specificity toward cannabinoid end products over the OA intermediate. Moreover, we recognized a single point mutation that dictates OA positioning within the active site, thereby altering isomer formation. These findings expand the known repertoire of natural cannabinoids and provide a rare example of crystallography-free enzyme design to improve stability, substrate selectivity, and isomer specificity.

In the present study, we describe a remarkable reduction in mutant spectrum complexity (intrahost viral genome heterogeneity) in SARS-CoV-2 isolates of late relative to early COVID-19 waves, as they reached Madrid (Spain) from 2020 until 2022. In contrast, the consensus (average) sequence of the corresponding isolates displayed a continuing divergence from the initial Wuhan-Hu-1 virus as the pandemic advanced. The mutant spectrum complexity developed upon replication in Vero E6 cells of the isolates from the first and sixth COVID-19 waves, as well as of biological clones retrieved from them, was similar. Therefore, the mutant spectrum complexity reduction observed in vivo was not due to an increased accuracy of the viral replicative machinery, but rather to other factors related to viral epidemiology or pathogenesis. Such possible factors and their implications for viral trait modifications in the course of a viral pandemic are discussed. The results establish that mutant spectrum complexity of genetically variable viruses can be an epidemiologically evolvable trait.",

Sub-Neptunes are expected to be the most diverse family of the exoplanet population, potentially including rocky gas dwarfs, water worlds, and mini-Neptunes, with a wide range of atmospheric, surface, and interior conditions. With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways, and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass–metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H 2 O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H 2 O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H 2 dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with supercritical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.",

We reflect on JWST’s early results in the context of the potential search for biological activity on exoplanets. The results confront us with a complex reality. Established inverse methods to interpret observed spectra—already known to be highly averaged representations of intricate three dimensional (3D) atmospheric processes—can lead to disparate interpretations even with JWST’s quality of data. Characterizing rocky or sub-Neptune-size exoplanets with JWST is an intricate task, and moves us away from the notion of finding a definitive “silver bullet” biosignature gas. Indeed, JWST results necessitate us to allow “parallel interpretations” that will perhaps not be resolved until the next generation of observatories. Nonetheless, with a handful of habitable-zone planet atmospheres accessible given the anticipated noise floor, JWST may continue to contribute to this journey by designating a planet as biosignature gas candidate. To do this we will need to sufficiently refine our inverse methods and physical models for confidently quantifying specific gas abundances and constraining the atmosphere context.

          "abstract": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are ocular disorders in which an initial loss of retinal capillaries leads to damaging tissue ischemia followed by a compensatory neovascularization response that generates pathological capillaries in the eye. Using a mouse model of ROP and samples from DR patients, we found that the highly homologous and homeostatic erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) family transcription factors ETS-related gene (ERG) and Friend leukemia integration 1 (FLI1) are downregulated in endothelial cells (ECs) of retinal capillaries prior to their regression in early stages of these diseases. We developed a mouse model of inducible EC-specific overexpression of Erg and found it mitigates capillary regression, retinal neuron death, neovascularization, and visual defects in the ROP model. Erg overexpression also reduces capillary regression in early stages of a murine DR model. We next found that simultaneous deletion of endothelial Erg and Fli1 is sufficient to promote regression of the pathological retinal capillaries that arise in late stages of the ROP model. Altogether, our data demonstrate that deletion of homeostatic endothelial ETS factors promotes capillary regression, while maintenance of even one of these factors prevents regression. These findings offer insights into approaches for preventing and treating retinopathies at different stages of these diseases.",

Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a critical dependency in CCA. Compound screens revealed that the VCP inhibitor CB-5339 potently suppresses CCA proliferation in a panel of patient-derived organoids by inducing cellular senescence. It is known that senescent cells persist, and this can contribute to therapy resistance. To address this, we combined CB-5339 with senolytic agents (ABT-263 and conatumumab), which selectively eliminate senescent CCA cells, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical analysis showed that VCP overexpression in CCA patients correlates with poor prognosis. Our study unveils a “one-two punch” strategy, targeting VCP-mediated senescence followed by senolytic clearance, offering a promising therapeutic approach for CCA.",

Despite its significance, the molecular and functional processes underlying this phenomenon remain incompletely understood. By tracing the evolutionary history of cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase genes within the kynurenine aminotransferase family, we identified a gene duplication event in parasitoid wasps of the Chalcidoidea superfamily. Notably, a single-copy, highly conserved mitochondria-localized physiological gene underwent a significant duplication, resulting in one copy being recruited into the venom system and acquired cytotoxicity against wasps' hosts. Through this neofunctionalization process, we observed several key evolutionary changes, including loss of ancestral mitochondrial localization and enzyme activity, acquisition of a secretory signal peptide, shift in expression pattern, positive selection, and the establishment of evolutionary acquired protein–protein interactions. Additionally, we found that another duplicate copy was specialized in wasps' ovary and repurposed for oogenesis regulation. Our study offers a detailed insight into the genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive functional diversification during the evolution of gene families.",

          "abstract": "Nature offers a remarkable diversity of nanomaterials that have extraordinary functional and structural properties. Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green color. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris , develop as woven fibrillar structures, in contrast to the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibers, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue coloration. Our findings not only introduce a variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.",

Our study reveals that SnRK2 kinases (SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3) are critical regulators of root gravitropism through their direct phosphorylation of the auxin transporter PIN2 at S259. We demonstrate that SnRK2s-mediated phosphorylation modulates both the polar localization and transport activity of PIN2. Importantly, SnRK2s function antagonistically to the AGCVIII kinase PID, which phosphorylates PIN2 at a distinct site (S258), establishing a regulatory balance essential for adaptive root growth. Structural modeling and phosphorylation assays further suggest that SnRK2s-mediated phosphorylation at S259 sterically hinders access of PID to S258, providing a mechanistic basis for their antagonistic relationship. These findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism, by which plants fine-tune root developmental programs to adapt to environmental stimuli, highlighting the evolutionary significance of multilayered kinase-mediated regulation in plant adaptation.",

Driver proteins operate within complex interaction networks, and their activity is conditioned by neighbor proteins. Understanding the interplay between driver mutations and the expression of their neighbor proteins can provide insights into cancer biology and potential therapeutic targets. We assessed associations between expression of neighbor proteins and driver mutation status, comparing both between and within cancer types. We further evaluated if neighbors were enriched in significant associations with multiple drivers and characterized the impact of neighbor expression on overall survival for all cancer types. We found a significant correlation between the number of driver associations (DA) a neighbor gene has and the number of sign-coherent survival associations, particularly for neighbors enriched in positive associations, where high neighbor expression correlated with increased driver mutations and poorer survival. We identified 119 neighbors enriched in positive DA with at least two unfavorable survival associations and 25 neighbors enriched in negative DA with at least two favorable survival associations. Our study systematically identified neighbors associated with driver mutation status. Complementary evidence from survival analysis and the literature suggests that neighbors enriched in DA can be further explored as drug target candidates.",

Although hypothalamic neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social function, their respective contributions to the process of social pain empathy have not been systematically characterized. To address this, we employed a multimethod approach, combining naturalistic fMRI, functional decoding, gene expression analysis, and pharmacological modulation using intranasal administration of OXT (24 IU) or AVP (20 IU) in a cohort of 163 participants. Our findings indicated that both OXT and AVP significantly enhanced pain empathy compared to placebo, with overlapping yet distinct neurofunctional and genetic modulation patterns. Specially, both neuropeptides engaged a shared perception-cognition-emotion network, including frontal regions, the insula, superior temporal sulcus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Crucially, they exhibited divergent mechanistic profiles: OXT preferentially influenced resting-state connectivity and perceptional-visual processing areas, while AVP exerted stronger modulation on perceptional-execution circuits. These differential effects aligned with their unique receptor expression patterns and interactions with distinct genetic systems. By delineating how OXT and AVP shape the multidimensional nature of social pain empathy, our findings provide a neurobiological framework for understanding these processes and offer potential pathways for targeted interventions in social cognition disorders.",

We quantified the effects of Triad zoning on biodiversity in (sub)montane eutrophic European beech forests. Using a European-wide multitaxon database and a “virtual” landscape approach (i.e., by resampling empirical data), we evaluated how the proportion of Triad management categories affected the landscape-level species diversity of birds, saproxylic beetles, vascular plants, epiphytic bryophytes, lichens, and wood-inhabiting fungi, as well as multitaxonomic diversity. The results varied greatly among taxonomic groups. Multitaxonomic diversity peaked in landscapes composed of 60% unmanaged and 40% intensively managed forests. While intensive management can benefit some taxa through the creation of open habitats, unmanaged forests are the backbone of biodiversity conservation, underlining the need to safeguard the remaining old-growth forests under natural dynamics, and to extend the current area of unmanaged forests in Europe. Extensive forest management, however, did not contribute to biodiversity conservation as expected. As withdrawing such a high proportion of European forest landscapes from management is unfeasible given the increasing demand for timber, efforts are needed to increase the presence of structural features supporting biodiversity into extensively managed forests.",

          "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains the deadliest infectious disease caused by a single pathogen, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. A deeper understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis metabolism could uncover specific vulnerabilities and inform the development of new treatments. Sulfur, essential for bacterial growth and survival, fuels key pathways including redox buffering and coenzyme production. Although previous studies suggest that M. tuberculosis utilizes various substrates to meet its sulfur requirements, the primary sources of sulfur exploited during in vivo infection remain unclear. Here, we reveal that M. tuberculosis acquires inorganic sulfate through the SubI-CysTWA transporter during macrophage infection. Using nanoSIMS (high spatial resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analysis, we observed significant sulfate-derived 33 S enrichment in intracellular bacteria, correlating with metabolic activity. Deletion of subI abolished sulfate uptake, impairing bacterial growth in vitro and reducing M. tuberculosis survival in murine macrophages and lungs of infected mice. Finally, our data demonstrate that sulfate acquisition is essential for maintaining mycobacterial redox balance and resisting nitrosative stress in vitro and in vivo. Thus, unlike many intracellular pathogens, M. tuberculosis depends on an energetically costly inorganic sulfate assimilation pathway to survive in the nutrient-limited host environment. These findings challenge prior assumptions that organic reduced sulfur sources, such as methionine, fuel M. tuberculosis sulfur metabolism during infection. Since animal cells lack a sulfate assimilation pathway, uncovering the critical role of SubI-CysTWA-mediated sulfate import in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis highlights this pathway as a promising pathogen-specific therapeutic target. Targeting this system could either directly impair M. tuberculosis survival during infection or sensitize bacilli to antibiotic-induced oxidative stress by disrupting redox homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "The formation and organization of southeastern Tibetan river systems reflect feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and landscape evolution. However, our understanding of these interactions remains unclear. We approach this issue from the view that the river incision histories and their bedload provenance provide complementary evidence for reconstructing the evolution of the ancient river system. Zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from the middle Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River gorge reveal two episodes of accelerated river incision at 18-17 Ma and 8-7 Ma. The onset of the former incision event, coeval with other incision events along the upper-middle Jinsha and Lancang Rivers, implies their hydrological connection and formation of a south-flowing river system. Additionally, detrital geochronology and thermochronology data of late Oligocene–Miocene fluvial-alluvial sediments along the Red River valley provide constraints on their ages and provenance, suggesting emergence of a throughgoing paleo-Red River in the early-middle Miocene. This ancient Red River was disconnected from the upper Jinsha River but connected with Yalong River (upper Yangtze tributary), forming another south-flowing river system. Landscape evolution modelling supports the view that these south-flowing rivers were successively captured by the westward-propagating Yangtze River in the middle-late Miocene, giving birth to the modern drainages of southeastern Tibet. The resultant integration of the upper-middle and lower Jinsha River is manifested by the progressively upstream-propagating acceleration in river incision from 13-9 Ma to 6-5 Ma along the gorges. Our findings from southeastern Tibet suggest that orogen-scale topographic change, river reorganization, and a coeval increase in biodiversity were driven by extrusion tectonics.",

We engineered chimeric immunomodulatory fusion proteins (IFPs) that convert immunosuppressive TGF-β signals into proliferative/survival Interleukin 2 (IL-2) signals in T cells. Chimeric TGF-βR/IL-2R IFPs were constructed by fusing extracellular domains of the TGF-β receptor chains with intracellular domains of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ to enable TGF-β binding to trigger STAT5 phosphorylation and activate the downstream IL-2 pathway. In human primary CD8 + T cells, select IFP designs robustly induced p-STAT5 upon exposure to TGF-β1, and simultaneously reduced canonical SMAD2/3 signaling. IFP-expressing T cells proliferated and displayed enhanced viability in response to TGF-β1, effectively leveraging TGF-β-rich conditions to outcompete nontransduced cells. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that IFP signaling promoted T cell activation and allowed maintenance of stemness during culture with TGF-β. Functionally, coexpressing IFPs with a mesothelin-specific T cell receptor improved tumor killing and promoted T cell expansion in the presence of TGF-β1, highlighting both neutralization of TGF-β–mediated suppression and enhanced proliferation. TGF-βR/IL-2R IFPs appear promising for reprogramming the signals T cells receive in the TME and improving efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in solid tumors.",

However, investing limited resources in the development of new technologies is risky. The research and development process is unpredictable, with unknown timelines and outcomes. In addition, even after successful development, the effects of deploying a new technology remain uncertain. When confronted with these uncertainties, policymakers must determine how long they should allocate resources to developing new technologies. Informed decisions require anticipating possible successes and failures of both technology development and deployment, which is a challenging optimization task when managing dynamic systems, such as threatened ecological systems. Using an adaptive management approach from AI, we find a time limit new technologies should be developed for, which balances costs, benefits, and uncertainties during development and deployment. We extract clear and transparent general rules for investing in new technologies, building on an analytical approximation. Using Australia’s Great Barrier Reef as a case study, we demonstrate that the development time limit ranges between 0 to 45 y before surrendering. We also show how characteristics of an ecological system influence the optimal investment strategy. Our approach can inform the development of new technologies in multiple domains including biodiversity conservation, public health, energy production, and the technology industry more broadly.",

However, improving NUE in farming systems without compromising food security remains challenging. Herein, we have successfully developed and applied selenium-based nanotechnology, which capitalizes on above- and belowground synergies to enhance field-scale NUE. Specifically, when N fertilizer application was reduced by 30%, foliar application of selenium nanomaterials significantly enhanced rice photosynthesis by 40.3% compared with reduced N fertilizer treatment (189 kg N/ha). This enhancement promoted carbohydrate synthesis and translocation, providing abundant carbon sources for rhizosphere processes. These abundant carbon sources modulated rhizosphere N transformation processes, stimulating ammonification and nitrification while suppressing denitrification, thereby reducing methane, ammonia, and nitrous oxide emissions by 18.8 to 45.6%. In addition, compared with controls (270 kg N/ha), our approach improved rice root growth and upregulated gene expression associated with N uptake and translocation, increasing rice NUE (48.3%). While maintaining comparable yields to conventional practice, we observed significant improvements in rice quality parameters including crude protein, amino acids, and Se content.

          "abstract": "Several lines of evidence indicate that posterior (postaxial) digit number in tetrapod vertebrates is constrained to the pentadactyl state by interactions between the two major signaling centers that organize digit pattern and growth, the Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-expressing Zone of Polarizing Activity (ZPA) and the Fgf-expressing Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER) ectoderm. Negative short-range effects of Shh on the immediately overlying AER limit its posterior extent and function, either by direct Shh signaling or with Bmps playing a key role. How this strong inhibitory effect is counterbalanced to maintain pentadactyly in many vertebrate species remains less clear. In this study, we used genetic approaches in mice to reevaluate the mechanism by which Shh signaling modulates AER function and demonstrate that this occurs via Shh-target Bmps that act as a relay signal, rather than by direct Shh action. Furthermore, we show that Shh-induced Bmps also act directly on the ZPA, in a negative feedback loop, to down-regulate Shh expression and ZPA extent. We provide evidence that these dual Bmp-driven negative feedback loops robustly balance total Bmp levels to constrain postaxial digit number.",

          "abstract": "The Ganga River basin, critical to over 600 million people, is experiencing a severe and unprecedented drying trend, threatening water and food security. Using streamflow reconstructions spanning 1,300 y (700–2012 C.E.) from instrumental data, paleohydrological records, and hydrological modeling, we show that drying from 1991 to 2020 is unmatched in the past millennium. Streamflow decline since the 1990s, driven by frequent and prolonged droughts, is 76% more intense than the 16th-century drought—the closest historical analogue. This drying exceeds natural variability, highlighting the dominant role of anthropogenic factors. Despite CMIP6 models projecting increased streamflow under warming scenarios, the recent decline indicates complexities associated with future water availability projections. Our findings underscore the urgent need to examine the interactions among the factors that control summer monsoon precipitation, including large−scale climate variability and anthropogenic forcings. Better constraints on these processes in climate models will be essential for improving future monsoon projections and implementing adaptive water management strategies to secure the Ganga basin’s freshwater availability under a changing climate.",

          "abstract": "Formation of the Hawaiian-Emperor Bend has been a key geological puzzle that involves both plate tectonics and plume dynamics. Constrained by paleomagnetic data, southward hotspot motion has been considered a major contributor to the formation of the bend, but the role of longitudinal hotspot motion remains largely overlooked. Here, we analyze the Hawaiian hotspot motion using plate kinematics and geographical distances between hotspot tracks. Both analyses indicate a substantial longitudinal Hawaiian hotspot motion. Further application of global mantle convection models reveals a westward (by ~6°) and then an eastward (by ~2°) hotspot drift in addition to the southward motion before and after the bend, with the westward motion primarily controlled by the intraoceanic subduction in Northeast Pacific. We find that both the westward and southward motion are required to fit the seamount chain, with the former contributing a substantial amount of ~20 degrees to the bend angle, no less than the latter, challenging traditional views. Combined with a geodynamically predicted Pacific Plate motion change at 47 Ma, our model provides a nearly perfect fit to the seamount chain. This result suggests that the Hawaiian plume conduit is tilted toward the southwest, providing a strong indication for the source of the Hawaiian plume that has long been debated among seismological studies.",

This paper presents one of the oldest directly dated archaeological finds of adzuki bean, recovered from the Xiaogao site in Shandong, China, and dated to 8985-8645 and 8032-7939 cal. BP—predating previously known Chinese records by at least 4,000 y (approximately 6,000 y considering published directly dated evidence alone). The evidence suggests that adzuki beans formed part of an Early Neolithic multicropping system alongside millet, rice, and soybean in a well-established agricultural tradition in the Lower Yellow River region. Morphometric analysis of adzuki beans from 41 archaeological sites across East Asia reveals a gradual increase in seed size over time when regional data are aggregated, yet highlights distinct regional trajectories. These patterns reflect complex, multiregional domestication processes shaped by both cultural practices and ecological conditions. Notably, the marked differences in bean sizes observed between the Neolithic Yellow River and Jomon-period Japan could be contingent on the distinctions in dietary regimes and associated selective pressures.",

And yet, this capacity is largely unknown. Surface organic films are ubiquitously present but have very low partitioning volume being only 10’s of nanometer thick, whereas other surface reservoirs such as building materials and furnishings can be permeable or porous with large surface areas at the molecular level. Here, we assess the total partitioning capacity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in an indoor environment from the measured kinetics of VOC surface uptake after injection of compounds with variable volatility into a well-characterized, unoccupied test house. We show that the size of the indoor surface reservoirs is very large with an octanol-equivalent average thickness on the order of micrometers, indicating that permeable/porous materials such as painted surfaces and wood are likely the major surface reservoirs in the house rather than organic surface films. Large surface reservoirs result in compounds with octanol-air partition coefficients ( K OA ) larger than 10 5 being predominantly partitioned to indoor surface reservoirs, making them hard to be removed via ventilation. This result significantly impacts our understanding of VOC fate and human exposure in indoor environments. With such a large partitioning capacity, organic contaminants will have much longer indoor residence times than previously predicted.",

          "abstract": "Immunotherapy modalities have revolutionized cancer treatment for a number of metastatic and treatment-refractory tumor types. Still, many malignancies that lack T cell infiltration and are termed immunologically “cold” fail to respond to these modalities. One approach to increase tumor immunogenicity has been to induce stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and downstream interferon signaling that is often dysregulated in cold tumors. Despite some early success of STING agonists in preclinical cancer models, these approaches have not been successful in the clinic due to poor tumor penetrance and systemic toxicities. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover therapeutic targets to activate STING expression in human tumors. We identified the lysosomal hydrolase Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase1 (PPT1) as a negative regulator of STING highly expressed in cold ovarian and prostate tumors. Genetic or pharmacological PPT1 suppression increased STING protein stability and its downstream activation of interferon and inflammatory cytokine signaling to enhance T cell migration. Treatment of preclinical prostate and ovarian cancer models expressing low levels of STING with the small molecule PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 enhanced STING expression and activation, leading to infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells that turned these tumors “hot” and reduced tumor growth, fibrosis, and dissemination without toxicity. Further analysis demonstrated that PPT1 is associated with reduced STING expression, CD8 + T cell numbers, overall survival, and immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Thus, PPT1 inhibition may be a promising approach to activate STING and potentiate the effects of immunotherapy in cold tumors.",

Yet, most functional genomic studies on soil bacteria have been performed without predation, thereby selecting for phenotypes impacting growth rather than survival and biasing our view on the ecological factors driving genomic evolution. Here, we study how predation by the ubiquitous amoebal predator Dictyostelium discoideum affects Bacillus subtilis ’ growth and survival using both a genome-scale mutant screen and de novo evolution of resistance. We show that predation-related genes (many not previously identified) promote survival by enabling filament or aggregate formation, thereby outsizing D. discoideum and slowing or preventing ingestion. Importantly, we find that predation resistance is costly, causing a trade-off between growth and survival. B. subtilis navigates this trade-off through switch-like adaptations, where cells switch back-and-forth between a slow-growing resistant state and a fast-growing susceptible state. These behaviors are controlled through both genotypic and phenotypic switches, with a central role for the Spo0A phosphorylation cascade, whose ancestral function may have been to evade or slow predation. Taken together, we uncover how the antagonist selection pressure imposed by predation is an important ecological driver of phenotypic heterogeneity in B. subtilis .",

          "abstract": "The phenotypic effect of a mutation may depend on the genetic background in which it occurs, a phenomenon referred to as epistasis. One source of epistasis in proteins is direct interactions between residues in close physical proximity to one another. However, epistasis may also occur in the absence of specific interactions between amino acids if the genotype-to-phenotype map is nonlinear. Disentangling the contributions of these two phenomena—specific and global epistasis—from noisy, high-throughput mutagenesis experiments is highly nontrivial: The form of the nonlinearity is generally not known and model misspecification may lead to over- or underestimation of specific epistasis. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not attempt to model the fitness measurements directly. Rather, we begin with the observation that global epistasis, under the assumption of monotonicity, imposes strong constraints on the rank statistics of a combinatorial mutagenesis experiment. Namely, the rank-order of mutant phenotypes should be preserved across genetic backgrounds. We exploit this constraint to devise a simple semiparametric method to detect specific epistasis in the presence of global epistasis and measurement noise. We apply this method to three high-throughput mutagenesis experiments, uncovering known protein contacts with similar accuracy to existing, more complicated procedures. Our method immediately generalizes beyond proteins, providing a simple, yet powerful framework for interpreting the epistasis observed in combinatorial datasets.",

          "abstract": "A long-standing question in biology is what makes evolution more or less repeatable. Although evolution seems repeatable when observing convergent phenotypic outcomes, each episode of convergence could have been contingent on an idiosyncratic history that is not expected to repeat. Overlooking events that preceded convergent episodes therefore risks overestimating repeatability. Here, we demonstrate using resurrected ancestral proteins that the evolution of a characteristic diterpene resin acid precursor, isopimaradiene, became especially repeatable in conifers following genetic divergence that simultaneously changed the effects of phenotype-altering substitutions in diterpene synthase enzymes. We found that millions of years of epistatic change prior to three genus-level episodes of convergent isopimaradiene formation led to ancestral diterpene synthases in the family Pinaceae that served as suitable starting points for evolving identical products. However, enzymes predating the Pinaceae formed different diterpenes when the same substitutions were introduced as mutations, indicating that critical alterations in the effects of substitution occurred after the origin of this plant family. Because these alterations occurred prior to the evolution of isopimaradiene, the convergence appears dependent on a history that is less likely to repeat. Our work shows how contingency can lead to repeatable evolution of a trait in related present-day plant lineages.",

In particular, some strategies are vulnerable to the “noisy TV problem,” i.e., an attraction to irrelevant stochastic stimuli. Here, we ask whether humans exhibit a similar attraction to reward-free stochasticity. We design a multistep decision-making paradigm in which participants search for rewarding states in a complex environment containing a highly stochastic but reward-free subregion. We show that i) participants persistently explore the stochastic subregion, and ii) their decisions are best explained by a novelty-driven exploration strategy, compared to alternatives driven by information gain or surprise.

Theoretically, by screening founder generation individuals based on the cell phenotypes resulting from gene knock-ins and leveraging the high fecundity of animals, heritable descendants with targeted knock-ins can be efficiently generated. Therefore, we utilized the high fecundity of Xenopus tropicalis and easily observable pigment phenotypes to construct a BRAF V600E -targeted mitf locus knock-in model. Results indicated that this approach enabled efficient generation of BRAF V600E knock-in X. tropicalis and produced a versatile frog model. The BRAF V600E knock-in induced the transdifferentiation of RPE cells into retinal cells, resulting in a symmetric retinal structure in the eyes of these frogs. The transformation of RPE cells ultimately leads to these frogs becoming eyeless frogs, which serve as a tool for retinal regeneration research. Additionally, in eyeless frogs the BRAF V600E knock-in led to the abnormal proliferation of both melanocytes and xanthophores into melanocytic and xanthocytic nevi respectively. Consequently, eyeless frogs provide a model for studying abnormal pigment cell proliferation, offering a platform for investigating pigment cell nevus formation. Furthermore, the cdkn2b -knockout eyeless frogs serve as a valuable xanthophoroma model for tumor biology research. Overall, the BRAF V600E -targeted knock-in X. tropicalis not only represents a strategy for constructing gene knock-in animal models but also serves as a versatile tool for research in retinal regeneration and tumor biology.",

One promising approach involves engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. Mesothelin (MSLN) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting MSLN (TCR MSLN ) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function and improve therapeutic efficacy, but administration of monospecific antibodies targeting individual inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, the combination of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to treatment with antibody alone or TCR MSLN with singlet or doublet antibody combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCR MSLN T cells treated with the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.",

          "abstract": "Prior to ejaculation, mammalian sperm are stored in the epididymis in a “resting” metabolic state. Upon ejaculation, sperm must alter their metabolism to generate the energy needed to support the motility and maturation process known as capacitation to reach and fertilize the oocyte. How sperm regulate the capacitation-induced increase in carbon flux is unknown. Here, we use 13 C stable isotope labeling in mouse sperm isolated from the cauda epididymis to follow glucose metabolism through central carbon metabolic network before and after sperm activation. As sperm transition from resting to highly activated states, they boost energy yield by increasing flux through glycolysis at the expense of the pentose phosphate pathway. Increased glycolytic activity seems to be achieved via capacitation-induced stimulation of flux through aldolase. In the mitochondria-containing midpiece, glycolytically generated pyruvate feeds the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to further maximize energy yield via oxidative phosphorylation. In the mitochondria-free principal piece of the flagellum, pyruvate produced from glycolysis is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, which also serves to regenerate oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) ensuring a sufficient supply to support glycolysis. The resultant lactate is at least partially secreted. Finally, we find evidence that there is an as yet unknown endogenous source of energy in sperm, feeding the upregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. These studies provide the most complete picture of the metabolic shift which occurs in capacitating mouse sperm in glucose.",

          "abstract": "Invasive, high-mortality yeast infections caused by pathogenic Candida species are the most common fungal nosocomial bloodstream infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for improved prevention and diagnostic strategies for fungal pathogens. Here, we demonstrate that Candida -related antibodies can be detected using glycan microarrays containing synthetic glycans to guide the discovery of oligosaccharide epitopes for diagnostics and vaccine design. Pure, synthetic mannans and β -glucans, resembling carbohydrates found on the surface of Candida spp., were employed to screen and compare sera from infected humans and mice with noninfected individuals. IgM antibodies directed toward β -glucans were observed shortly after infection, and after a longer time of infection, IgM and IgG antibodies that preferentially recognize mannans. Phosphodiester-linked mannosides and the β -(1,2)-mannose monomer help to distinguish different Candida spp. The tetrasaccharide antigen β -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man, and the pentasaccharide antigens α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,3)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man- α -(1,2)Man and β -(1,3)Glc- β -(1,3)Glc- β -(1,3)Glc-[ β -(1,6)Glc]- β -(1,3)Glc were identified as potential epitopes for detection, e.g., through monoclonal antibody lateral flow tests, and the development of glycoconjugate or monoclonal antibody vaccines against Candida.",

          "abstract": "Convergent evolution, or convergence, refers to repeated, independent emergences of the same trait in two or more lineages of species during evolution, often indicating functional adaptation to specific environmental factors. Many computational methods have been proposed to investigate the genetic basis for organismal functional convergence, as an important way to decode the complex sequence–function map of proteins. These methods mostly focus on the convergence of amino acid states at the level of individual sites in functionally related proteins. However, even without site-level sequence similarity, protein function similarity may also stem from convergence of high-order protein features, which cannot be captured by the conventional methods. To fill this gap, we first derived numerical embeddings from protein sequences by pretrained protein language models (PLM). In four previously reported cases, we found that functionally convergent proteins have similar embeddings despite no site-level convergence, indicating that PLM embeddings can reflect convergence of high-order protein features. We then designed a pipeline to detect Adaptive Convergence by Embedding of Protein (ACEP). ACEP tests were significant on known and additional candidate genes with putative adaptive convergence like echolocation and crassulacean acid metabolism. Genome-wide application showed that the ACEP framework can effectively enrich such candidates. Relations between convergences of PLM embeddings and specific protein physicochemical features were further examined. In conclusion, PLM embeddings can indicate adaptive convergence of high-order protein features beyond site identities, demonstrating the power of deep learning tools for investigating the complex mapping between molecular sequences and functions.",

We hypothesized that task complexity moderates this effect. Using fNIRS, we compared experts and novices during MI of simple versus complex soccer actions. Experts showed lower activation for simple tasks but higher activation for complex ones, while novices showed the opposite pattern. These findings unify opposing accounts of expertise, revealing that expert brains adaptively scale simulation to task demands.

          "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs), ubiquitous mobile DNAs, are largely repressed by cellular mechanisms such as epigenetic silencing and RNA decay, yet some retain the ability to transpose. The Arabidopsis long terminal repeat retrotransposon Copia93 , also known as Evade , exhibits exceptionally high transpositional activity, but the mechanism underlying its extraordinary mobility remains unclear. Here, we identify an Element for Nuclear Expression (ENE) motif within the 3′ UTR of Evade that forms a triple helical RNA structure with the poly(A) tail, shielding the transcript from deadenylation and degradation. Deletion of the ENE motif significantly reduces Evade transcript stability, extrachromosomal DNA levels, and de novo insertions. Furthermore, we show that the mRNA deadenylase CCR4a directly binds Evade RNA to shorten its poly(A) tail, thereby suppressing transposition. Loss of CCR4a leads to Evade upregulation, while additional deadenylases contribute to its repression in the absence of CCR4a. Our findings uncover an RNA-based strategy that enhances transposon stability and mobility, illustrating a coevolutionary arms race between host silencing pathways and TE-encoded structural elements.",

          "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 plays a crucial role in regulating excitability of small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and is an emerging target for pain therapeutics. Using dynamic clamp, we systematically manipulated Nav1.8 conductance to assess its impact on action potential (AP) electrogenesis, rheobase, and repetitive firing in native rat DRG neurons and those expressing the gain-of-function Nav1.7L858H mutation which underlies inherited erythromelalgia, a human genetic pain disorder. Our findings reveal that the Nav1.8 contribution to net sodium current is highly correlated with AP voltage threshold. Nav1.8 conductance regulated AP overshoot and voltage threshold without significantly affecting undershoot or resting membrane potential. We identified two populations of wild-type DRG neurons: strong responders (50% of cells), which exhibited substantial rheobase modulation with alterations in Nav1.8 conductance, and weak responders (50% of cells), which remained largely unaffected. In hyperexcitable Nav1.7L858H-expressing neurons, partial Nav1.8 subtraction (50%) restored rheobase above control levels in 63% of cells. However, weak responders (37%) remained hyperexcitable. The effect of Nav1.8 subtraction in responsive neurons supports the conclusion that Nav1.8 inhibition can reduce neuropathic pain. However, the presence of weakly responsive DRG neurons suggests that other channels might need to be targeted for full pain relief.",

Assembly and function of the system require at least 27 Dot and Icm proteins, yet its architecture and activation mechanism remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we deploy in situ single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to determine near-atomic structures of the Dot/Icm machine and its intimate association with three distinct outer membrane porins in intact bacteria. Notably, two essential yet enigmatic components, DotA and IcmX, form a pentameric protochannel in an inactive state at the central axis of the Dot/Icm machine. Upon Dot/Icm activation with host lysate, this protochannel undergoes extensive rearrangements to generate an extended transenvelope conduit, as visualized by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging. Furthermore, a combination of cryo-ET and cryo-FIB milling of macrophages infected with L. pneumophila reveals tethering of the Dot/Icm machine to the host membrane, suggesting direct translocation of effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host. Together, our studies identify the DotA–IcmX complex as a gatekeeper for effector translocation and provide a molecular framework for understanding the assembly and activation of the elaborate Dot/Icm T4SS.",

          "authors": "Laura Kreidberg, Kevin B. Stevenson",
          "abstract": "Rocky exoplanet characterization has been a top priority for early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) science operations. Several milestones have been achieved, including the most precise rocky planet transmission spectra measured to date, and the first detection of thermal emission for rocky worlds below 800 K. Despite these advances, no atmospheres have been definitively detected. Several transmission spectra show tentative evidence for molecular absorption features, but these hints are marginally significant and the spectra may be affected by stellar contamination. Features from many plausible atmospheres, including those dominated by oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, are below the current noise level. Meanwhile, the emerging picture from thermal emission spectra is that the planets have hot daysides, consistent with either a bare rock composition or low surface pressure atmospheres ( &lt; 10 bar). Higher surface pressures and high carbon dioxide abundances are generally ruled out, assuming cloud-free atmosphere models. The absence of strong CO 2 features hints at a limited initial volatile inventory or rapid atmospheric escape during the planets’ early lifetimes. Taken together, these results motivate a push toward higher precision data, as well as observations of cooler planets that may be more likely to retain atmospheres. As a goal for future transmission spectroscopy, we suggest a “five scale height challenge,” to achieve the precision necessary to detect CO 2 features in nitrogen-rich atmospheres. Detecting rocky planet atmospheres remains challenging, but with JWST’s excellent performance and a continuing investment of telescope time, we are optimistic these uncharted atmospheres will be detected in coming years.",

          "abstract": "Maximizing atomic utilization of noble metals is crucial for efficient industrial catalysis. We demonstrate that minimal platinum (Pt) loading for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) can be achieved through atom abstraction. At low loadings of Pt with copper (Cu), reduction over silica or other oxide supports formed nanoparticles (NPs) with Pt mainly dispersed in the bulk. Addition of tin (Sn) to the alloy led to formation of surface Pt 1 Sn 1 dimers. The larger atomic radius of Sn compared to Cu drove it to the surface, and its stronger interactions with Pt abstracted it from the bulk. Single metallic Pt atoms were stabilized on fully open surfaces, resulting in nearly 100% surface exposure. This configuration reduced Pt usage by one order of magnitude for propane dehydrogenation and improved catalytic stability.",

Fiber-optic sensing allows for long-term deployments of ultradense arrays that enable high-resolution measurements of infrequent, large earthquakes. We recorded the 2024 moment magnitude ( M w ) 7 Mendocino Fault earthquake with a nearby fiber-optic array and imaged its behavior with seismic beamforming. The rupture propagated to the east at subshear velocity; stagnated near the Mendocino Triple Junction, a zone of structural complexity; and subsequently transitioned to supershear velocity. The correlation between source physics and structure shows how lithospheric heterogeneity affects first-order characteristics of earthquake ruptures.

Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II–mediated 5′ splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3′ and 5′ splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II. Collectively, these results reveal dynamic U2AF cycling that partitions Pol II subunit–facilitated splice site recognition and subsequent Pol II–independent spliceosome assembly steps during cotranscriptional splicing.",

          "abstract": "The symbiotic agriculture of fungus-farming termites can collapse if they fail to prevent invading weeds. Previous studies suggest a role for symbiotic fungistatic microbes in bringing about weed control. However, how termites employ these microbes to suppress fungal weeds without affecting the fungal cultivar remains unknown. We show that the fungus-farming termite Odontotermes obesus uses specific behaviors to remove, isolate, and suppress the growth of the fungal weed Pseudoxylaria , primarily by encasing it with soil boluses containing fungistatic microbes. These behaviors efficiently suppress the weed without affecting the crop. This integration of specific behaviors with termite-derived microbes appears to be the proximate mechanism of how microbes are topically used by termites to confine the weed while keeping the crop unaffected.",

          "abstract": "Negative feedback between climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), mediated by the weathering of silicate minerals on land, is thought to provide the primary regulation of Earth’s climate on geological timescales. By contrast, we found that faster feedbacks involving organic matter are not only critical to Earth system recovery but can also create unexpected instability. Our Earth system model experiments show how sedimentary organic carbon burial, amplified by redox-sensitive phosphorus regeneration, can outweigh silicate weathering and paradoxically drive climate overcooling in response to massive CO 2 release. This instability depends on the initial balance between silicate weathering and organic carbon burial in addition to the state of global phosphorus cycling. It is most strongly expressed at intermediate ocean redox states, which may help us understand the timing of past ice ages.",

Coevolutionary analysis and deep learning (DL) based protein structure prediction have enabled comprehensive PPI identification in bacteria and yeast, but these approaches have had limited success for the more complex human proteome. We overcame this challenge by enhancing the coevolutionary signals with 7-fold deeper multiple sequence alignments harvested from 30 petabytes of unassembled genomic data and developing a new DL network trained on augmented datasets of domain-domain interactions from 200 million predicted protein structures. We systematically screened 200 million human protein pairs and predicted 17,849 interactions with an expected precision of 90%, of which 3,631 interactions were not identified in previous experimental screens. Three-dimensional models of these predicted interactions provide numerous hypotheses about protein function and mechanisms of human diseases.",

Using imperfect Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen entanglement, we achieve a sample complexity reduction of 11.8 orders of magnitude compared to classical methods without entanglement. These results show that large-scale, provable quantum advantage is achievable with current photonic technology and represent a key step toward practical quantum-enhanced learning protocols in quantum metrology and machine learning.",

We found that lysosomal metabolic pathways signal through the epigenome to regulate transgenerational longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans . Activation of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) or reduction of lysosomal mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling increased the expression of a histone H3.3 variant and increased its methylation on K79, leading to life-span extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational prolongevity effect required intestine-to-germline transportation of histone H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase and was recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase. Thus, signals from a lysosome affect the epigenome and link the soma and germ line to mediate transgenerational inheritance of longevity.",

This approach revealed preferred ordering of different atomic species with the dominant occurrence of Si–Ge–Sn triplets.

A structure of Cap10 revealed a transfer RNA transglycosylase family enzyme remodeled to bind a partner cGAS/DncV–like nucleotidyltransferase that is modified with an N-terminal 7-amido-7-deazaguanine (NDG) nucleobase. A structure of Cap9 explained how this QueC-like enzyme co-opts a 7-deazapurine biosynthetic reaction to install NDG. We show that Cap9, Cap10, and protein deazaguanylation are essential for host defense against phage infection. Our results define a 7-deazapurine protein modification and explain how nucleobase biosynthetic machinery has been repurposed for antiviral immunity.",

Morphometric and phylogenetic analyses suggest that it is an early member of the Asian H. longi clade, which includes the Denisovans and is the main part of the sister group to the H. sapiens clade. Both the H. sapiens and H. longi clades have deep roots extending beyond the Middle Pleistocene and probably experienced rapid early diversification.

Results indicated that aposematic strategies fare better in environments with low predation intensity, whereas camouflage strategies are advantaged when other camouflaged prey species are rare and when light levels are low.

We show that while virtually all PAE plasmids were devoid of resistance genes and most never acquired them, a minority evolved to drive the global spread of resistance to first line and last resort antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. Modern plasmids have evolved through complex microevolution and fusion events into a distinct group of highly recombinogenic, multi-replicon, self-transmissible plasmids that now pose the highest risk to resistance dissemination, and therefore to human health.",

These processes are represented in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ACC activity causally contributes to cooperative behavior. We extended our findings to artificial intelligence systems by training artificial agents in a similar cooperation task. The agents developed behavioral strategies and neural representations reminiscent of those observed in the biological brain, revealing parallels between cooperative behavior in biological and artificial systems.",

          "abstract": "Mental health conditions like depression are associated with an elevated risk of cardiometabolic disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity remain poorly understood. Is metabolic dysfunction a cause of depression, a downstream consequence, or do both stem from shared underlying processes? We argue that neurocognitive mechanisms, particularly those involved in reward and effort processing, interact with metabolic physiology to shape each of these causal pathways. Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands. We propose a framework of interoceptive energy allostasis in which disruptions to these predictive processes contribute to the bidirectional relationship between depression and metabolic dysfunction. By integrating perspectives from metabolic and computational psychiatry, this framework offers a theoretical lens to explain the multidirectional comorbidity between mental and metabolic ill-health.",

          "abstract": "Technology plays a central role in all human societies, from foraging to industrial economies. However, technological solutions come with associated costs, and in small-scale societies, technological complexity reflects this trade-off between efficiency and resource constraints. Here, we analyze this trade-off and show a sublinear scaling relationship between toolkit richness and tool part richness in ethnographic societies. This result indicates diminishing returns where each additional part contributes less to overall toolkit diversity. This scaling holds across diverse ecological and cultural contexts, suggesting a general principle of optimization in tool design. Ethnographic toolkits achieve their adaptability by reusing a core set of versatile parts and selectively incorporating more specialized parts. However, increasing richness also increases complexity, and complexity is costly. We formalize these dynamics within a combinatorial optimization framework and discuss the implications.",

We used this landscape to identify neighboring factors of sleep problems. We observed a substantial increase in self-reported sleep problems among individuals aged 15 to 45, from 34 to 49% between 2010 and 2021, and a 10-fold increase in melatonin use. We also found relevant clusters of sleep-related prescriptions, diagnoses, and procedures with age-specific incidence patterns. Specific childhood adversities, such as sibling psychiatric illness, foster care, and parental divorce, were shared factors across multiple sleep disorders such as insomnia and nightmares. These findings underscore the complex interplay between medical and psychosocial factors in sleep.",

The epigenetic mechanism underlying spatiotemporal gene regulation during in vivo neuron differentiation remains largely unknown.

Here, we show that Atoh1-Cre –mediated knockout (ACKO) of Kmt2d encoding the lysine methyltransferase KMT2D (MLL4) in cerebellar GC lineage inhibits the transition of GC progenitors to GCs while cell non-autonomously affecting other cerebellar cells. Kmt2d ACKO impaired cerebellum-associated behaviors and caused facial peculiarity, microcephaly, and reduced body size in mice. KMT2D temporally activated neuronal differentiation programs in cerebellar GCs. KMT2D-mediated activation of the key neuronal transcription factor genes En2 , Pax6 , and Myt1l via super-enhancer/enhancer programming was critical for GC differentiation. These findings reveal a unique epigenetic mechanism in which KMT2D temporally orchestrates gene expression required for cerebellar GC differentiation by programming neuronal enhancers.",

In this study, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide levels in MASH patients and mouse models are closely associated with the activation of hepatic de novo ceramide synthesis. The analysis of human hepatic single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data revealed predominant up-regulation of SPTLC2 , which encodes a subunit of the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, in hepatocytes. By targeted inhibition of SPTLC2 with lipid nanoparticle–mediated siRNA delivery to hepatocytes, we reduced both hepatic and circulating ceramide levels. This intervention suppressed hepatic lipid uptake and lipogenesis, thereby alleviating MASH progression. Therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in an 8-week methionine-choline–deficient diet-induced MASH model and validated in a 1-year choline-deficient high-fat diet–induced MASH model. Our findings highlight hepatocyte Sptlc2 as a promising therapeutic target for MASH.",

          "abstract": "High-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can assist in determining protein structure, but it requires time-consuming acquisition. Deep learning enables ultrafast reconstruction but is limited to spectra of up to three dimensions and cannot provide faithful reconstruction under unseen acceleration factors. Extending deep learning to handle higher-dimensional spectra and varying acceleration factors is desirable. However, scalability requires complex networks and more data, seriously hindering applications. To address this, we designed a network to learn data in one dimension (1D). First, time-domain signals were modeled as the outer product of 1D exponentials. Then, each 1D exponential was approximated with a rank-one Hankel matrix. Last, reconstruction error was corrected with a neural network. Here, we demonstrate robust 3D NMR reconstruction across acceleration factors (2 to 33) using one trained network. In addition, we find that reconstruction of 4D NMR is possible with artificial intelligence. This work opens an avenue for accelerating arbitrarily high-dimensional NMR. ",

LD function depends on a highly dynamic LD surface proteome. Key proteins continuously exchange between the ER and LDs; however, the mechanisms governing the interorganelle movement and accumulation on the LD surface remain poorly understood. Here, we developed an ex cellulo tool introducing a classification of ER-derived proteins based on their different affinity for LDs. We find that proteins with higher LD affinity can effectively displace those with lower affinity from the LD surface, identifying steric hindrance as a key mechanism in regulating ER-to-LD protein transfer. Consistent with this model, we show that, during adipocyte differentiation Plin1—an adipocyte-specific high-affinity LD protein—reduces the recruitment of ER proteins with lower affinity by displacing them from the LD surface. These findings highlight lateral protein-protein exclusion as a fundamental mechanism in shaping the LD proteome.",

          "abstract": "Pulmonary surfactants reduce the work of breathing, enhance compliance, and prevent alveolar collapse. Yet, their role extends beyond that of a simple surfactant; otherwise, exogenous surfactant therapy would fully restore compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by increasing surface concentration alone. Here, we show that interfacial microstructure and mechanics, regulated by spontaneous or ventilator-induced sighs, play a critical role. Using interfacial rheometry and structural analysis, including in situ neutron reflectometry and Raman-based techniques, we find that sighs enrich the air-liquid interface with saturated lipids, triggering structural rearrangements. This periodic “reset” transforms the layer into a mechanically robust, DPPC-rich film, where compressional hardening counteracts tension. These findings highlight the nonequilibrium dynamics of surfactant layers and underscore the importance of interfacial compressive stresses, not just tension, in governing lung mechanics. This mechanism helps sustain low interfacial stress and high compliance, offering mechanistic insight to guide protective ventilation strategies upon lung trauma and possibilities to optimize surfactant-enabled pulmonary treatment.",

          "abstract": "Landslides exhibit intermittent downslope movements over days to years before a possible collapse, commonly boosted by external events like precipitation. The origins of these episodic movements and their relation to final instability remain unclear. We propose a novel “endo-exo” theory capturing the interplay between exogenous stressors such as rainfall and endogenous damage-healing processes. We predict four types of episodic dynamics, defined by the disturbance source (endogenous or exogenous) and criticality level (subcritical or critical), each with distinct power law exponent but all governed by a single parameter ϑ . These predictions are tested on the Preonzo landslide, whose sporadic activities align with the classification with ϑ ≈ 0.45 ± 0.1 . We find that its final collapse is preceded by an increased frequency of medium-to-large velocities over 1 to 2 months, signaling the transition into a catastrophic regime. Our research suggests that landslides may not permanently operate at a critical state, with major implications for forecasting catastrophic failures.",

Cryo-EM reveals a unique irregular triple-layer β solenoid cross-β fibril composed of a single protofilament. MD simulations initiated from monomeric and fibrillar FapC mapped structural transitions, offering mechanistic insights into amyloid assembly and disassembly.

The sensor enables direct probing of the amide I band in sub-10-nanometer proteins.

Here, we introduce high–molecular-weight poly(thioglycolic acid) (PTGA) that exhibits not only closed-loop recyclability but also i PP-like thermal properties, even superior mechanical and barrier properties, and processability well suited for common processing techniques such as blow molding into bottles. To circumvent long-standing challenges of extensive transthioesterification side reactions in the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of thioglycolide, which typically yielded only oligomers, we developed the interfacial chain-growth ROP occurring at the interface between the semicrystalline polymer surface and the monomer–organocatalyst solution phase, enabling the synthesis of high–molecular-weight PTGA. Overall, we show that PTGA is a scalable circular polymer that provides i PP-like properties and that the interfacial ROP method solves the challenges in typical solution-phase polymerization.",

RNA interference experiments showed that 85.7% (66 of 77) of the candidate genes with nonlethal knockdown effects influenced starvation resistance. Of these, 49 had sex-dependent effects, including 12 with sexually antagonistic effects—all increasing resistance in females but decreasing it in males. These patterns were not explained by sex-biased expression or knockdown efficiency. Analysis of the Lnk gene revealed that both nonsynonymous mutations and expression changes had sex-dependent effects.

We demonstrate that SPARSE effectively quantifies the average particle sizes in milk, blood, and intact tissue without a prior knowledge of particles’ refractive indices or concentrations. Through beam scanning, particle size distribution is mapped in benign and malignant breast tissues with high resolution (~100 micrometer), mirroring histopathological microstructures. By enabling particle sizing in intact biomaterials and tissues, SPARSE holds broad potential for applications across nanomedicine, diagnostics, and biotechnology.",

Progress in both the understanding and adoption of ISF tests is hindered by sampling challenges, including lengthy collection times, non-negligible failure rates, variable collection volumes, and inconsistent bioanalyte levels. The causes of many of these issues are not well understood. We demonstrate a microneedle device that is several times faster than state of the art, collecting an average of 15.5 mg of ISF in 5 minutes in humans with near-zero failure rate. This improvement was achieved by designing the spatial pressure gradient driving ISF flow. The influence of penetration depth, collection time, pressure, and age on ISF collection was elucidated, with Darcy’s law explaining multiple observations. A data-driven acceptance criterion of &lt;1% blood contamination for ISF is proposed. The device and findings presented will empower researchers to better conduct robust studies in the development of ISF diagnostics.",

The foregut and hindgut circuits of the C. elegans enteric nervous system (ENS) control feeding and defecation behavior, respectively.

In favorable conditions, insulin and noninsulin peptides released from midgut epithelia activate foregut and hindgut enteric neurons, respectively, to sustain normal feeding and defecation behavior. During food scarcity, altered insulin signaling from sensory neurons activates the transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO in midgut epithelia, which blocks both peptidergic signaling axes to the ENS by transcriptionally shutting down the intestinal neuropeptide secretion machinery. Our findings demonstrate that midgut epithelial cells act as integrators relaying internal state information to distinct parts of the ENS to control animal behavior.",

While increasing channel thickness enhances its capacitance and thereby amplifies transconductance, it simultaneously impedes ion transport kinetics, leading to slower switching speeds. Here, we present a three-dimensional electrolyte-surrounded OECT architecture that redefines ion transport dynamics by enabling multidirectional ion doping to the channel for efficient and rapid switching. Our proposed approach achieves a remarkable enhancement in the operational bandwidth of OECTs, reaching 26 kHz while preserving their high transconductance, notably using a commercially available conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate). This is enabled by micro/nanostructured channel design that enhances ion accessibility and minimizes parasitic effects. This advancement allows for continuous, wide-frequency neural signal recording from peripheral nerves. This work offers a robust strategy for achieving both high transconductance and fast switching in OECTs, establishing a foundation for the development of next-generation, high-speed bioelectronic interfaces.",

However, by a lenient threshold search strategy combined with a machine learning approach based on structural similarity, here we identified 9419 potential ARGs within lytic phages. We showed that potential trimethoprim-resistance dihydrofolate reductase ( dfrA ) genes enriched in lytic phages could confer trimethoprim resistance to Escherichia coli . Sequence analysis revealed that lytic phages rarely transfer these potential dfrA genes into their bacterial hosts. Functional studies showed that these dfrA genes not only enhance phage reproduction in the presence of trimethoprim but also promote bacterial growth during phage infection. These results highlight that abundant functional ARGs were selected in evolution to improve lytic phage reproduction by promoting bacterial growth during infection, suggesting that dfrA genes play important roles in evolutionary mutualism between lytic phages and their hosts.",

Our findings indicate that a topological transition occurs in response to modulation frequency increases, producing anomalous edge states with chirality within Floquet harmonic bandgaps. The open nature of the metasurface facilitates harmonic generation via Floquet edge states. Experimentally, we confirm the existence of Floquet harmonic bands and the robust unidirectional propagation of these edge states. In addition, we propose a large-scale coding scheme to dynamically reconfigure propagation paths through programmable binary states of the meta-units.

Multi-CBB aggregation generated rod-, triangle-, and diamond-shaped AggreBots, altering tissue geometry without sacrificing surface cilia density or inter-CBB boundary fidelity. The further introduction of CCDC39 -mutated CBBs as cilia-inactive modules enabled the generation of hybrid AggreBots with precision modulation of active cilia distribution, further empowering alterations to motility patterns.

We present results from 10 independent studies with a total of 648 participants and provide clear evidence of both retroactive and proactive enhancements in weak memories, directly addressing ongoing debates about the existence of these effects. Notably, stronger salience learning facilitates proactive, but not retroactive, memory enhancement, challenging prevailing theories about salience’s role in these processes. Instead, retroactive enhancement depends on the proximity between incidentally encoded and conditioned stimuli in a high-level feature embedding extracted from a convolutional neural network, revealing a graded prioritization mechanism.

Within 1 week of treatment, AT MΦs decreased and became lipid laden, while extracellular vesicles secreted from AT decreased and reduced in lipid content. Within 2 weeks, glucose tolerance returned to levels of lean controls, followed by weight loss and reduced food intake. After 4 weeks, AT browning and amelioration of hepatic steatosis were evident. The physiological shifts were reproducible in three rodent models of obesity, spanning sexes and gonadal status. Effects were enhanced for the targeted nanomedicine compared with free drugs at equivalent doses, supporting the hypothesis that targeted PPAR activation in AT MΦs benefits systemic metabolism.",

This reduction is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which have little to no α2,6-linked sialic acid. To understand how α2,6-linked sialic acid affects T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell–specific deletion of sialyltransferase gene St6gal1 . The lack of α2,6-linked sialic acid leads to reduced responsiveness in naïve T cells, leading to impaired T cell responses against Listeria monocytogenes infection and tumor growth. PD-1 pathway blockade partially restores St6gal1 -deficient T cells’ ability to control tumor growth.

The evolutionarily conserved polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1C) plays multiple roles in transcription.

Loss of PAF1C leads to increased expression of defense genes, enhanced disease resistance, but compromised growth. Mechanistically, PAF1C binds to defense genes, where it interacts with histone deacetylases, such as HDA6, to promote histone deacetylation, thereby repressing defense genes expression. The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) promotes the interaction between PAF1 and the SA receptor NPR1, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate the polyubiquitination and degradation of PAF1. Genetically, loss of PAF1 suppresses the immune defects of the npr1 mutant, supporting the notion that PAF1 functions downstream of NPR1.

In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity.

          "abstract": "The lysosome integrates anabolic signaling and nutrient sensing to regulate intracellular growth pathways. The leucine-rich repeat–containing 8 (LRRC8) channel complex forms a lysosomal anion channel and regulates PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, skeletal muscle differentiation, growth, and systemic glucose metabolism. Here, we define the endogenous LRRC8 subunits localized to a subset of lysosomes in differentiated myotubes. We show that LRRC8A affects leucine-stimulated mTOR; lysosome size; number; pH; expression of lysosomal proteins LAMP2, P62, and LC3B; and lysosomal function. Mutating an LRRC8A lysosomal targeting dileucine motif sequence (LRRC8A-L706A;L707A) in myotubes recapitulates the abnormal AKT signaling and altered lysosomal morphology and pH observed in LRRC8A knockout cells. In vivo, LRRC8A-L706A;L707A knock-in mice exhibit increased adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance associated with reduced skeletal muscle PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, glucose uptake, and impaired incorporation of glucose into glycogen. These data reveal a lysosomal LRRC8-mediated metabolic signaling function regulating lysosomal function, systemic glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity.",

However, microobject transportation tasks require synergistic handling and movement, which poses a challenge for solely acoustically powered microrobots. These systems often require additional actuation mechanisms, such as magnetic control, for assistance. To address this challenge, we developed an acoustically powered micro-clampbot capable of clamping objects using claws actuated by acoustically induced secondary Bjerknes forces and moving via flagella that oscillate under acoustic input. The robot’s actions are governed by distinct acoustic frequencies, enabling precise and independent control of clamping and locomotion. The micro-clampbot can pick a single particle from a cluster and navigate delicately through narrow channels, with narrow necks (~2.1 times the width of the micro-clampbot). This system facilitates the targeted transportation of microscale objects, including live cells, without causing damage. This versatile design highlights the potential of solely acoustically powered microrobots for advanced clinical therapies and microscale operations.",

We leveraged the intrinsically high open probability ( P o ) of NMDARs composed of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, together with judiciously chosen mutants and ligands, to achieve conditions in which receptors had a P o near unity. Using single-particle cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we captured three activated receptor states, each with distinct conformations of the gate-forming M3 helices.

These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin.

Our analyses reveal a broad shear-zone initiated at ~4 Ma by exploiting ridge-parallel fabrics of nascent oceanic lithosphere and progressively localized into a mature trench-perpendicular transform boundary. This process severed an oceanic microplate and enabled its diminished subduction relative to adjacent subducting lithosphere. Downdip, we image trench-parallel slab tears offset by the transform, suggesting lateral tear propagation was intersected by the transform boundary, facilitating efficient decoupling of the microplate while allowing adjacent subduction to continue. We propose a 4D model where transform boundaries drive laterally diachronous slab fragmentation and subduction termination.",

Here, we measure modular observables to estimate small changes in position and momentum with a single-mode multiparameter sensor. We deterministically prepare grid states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion and demonstrate uncertainties in position and momentum below the standard quantum limit (SQL). Further, we examine another pair of incompatible observables—number and phase. We prepare a different resource—number-phase states—and demonstrate a metrological gain over the SQL.

It depends on the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). However, to bind TrkB, BDNF requires proteolytic cleavage to its mature form. Here, we demonstrate that MMP-9, an extracellular protease essential for neuronal function, plays a key role in this process. We show that, like BDNF, MMP-9 is rapidly released in response to synaptic stimulation, and its proteolytic activity, restricted to the activated spine, can be detected as early as 2 min after stimulation. Using two-photon microscopy and single-spine stimulation by glutamate uncaging, we demonstrate that MMP-9 action is important for TrkB activation and is required for structural plasticity. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct cleavage of proBDNF into mature BDNF by MMP-9. Our findings reveal a critical interaction between MMP-9 and BDNF through their autocrine regulation of TrkB activation and dendritic spine structural changes.",

NLRP3 protein expression is tightly controlled by the ubiquitin system. In particular, NLRP3 protein degradation has been extensively studied. In contrast, the mechanisms to stabilize NLRP3 protein are much less known. Here, we demonstrated the critical role of ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) in regulating NLRP3 protein stability and inflammasome activation independently of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity. USP13 competes with E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM31 to interact with NLRP3 and prevents TRIM31-mediated NLRP3 ubiquitination at K192 and K496 sites, thereby inhibiting proteasomal degradation of NLRP3. USP13 deficiency reduces NLRP3 protein expression in both human and mouse macrophages, which consequently inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Accordingly, deficiency of USP13 attenuates monosodium urate crystal–induced mouse peritonitis. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory mechanism of NLRP3 stability by USP13 and provide a potential therapeutic target for NLRP3-driven diseases.",

          "abstract": "The plant cysteine protease metacaspases are structural homologs of animal caspases and play pivotal roles under biotic and abiotic stresses. However, whether metacaspases and purine-rich element (R-motif)–mediated defense messenger RNA translation are involved in plant antiviral immunity remains elusive. Here, we report that barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection activates metacaspase 4 (MC4) to cleave the RNA binding protein lupus autoantigen 1 (La1) behind residue arginine-448. The cleaved La1 1-448 version relocates to the cytoplasm and promotes the R-motif–mediated cap-independent defense mRNA translation. Moreover, MC4 overexpression restricts BSMV infection in tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ), whereas knockout of MC4 and knockdown of La1 are more susceptible to diverse plant virus infection. To counteract plant defense, the BSMV γb protein directly interacts with and inhibits the self-processing of MC4 and subsequent La1 cleavage, thereby impairing La1-mediated immune responses. Collectively, our findings unveil a hitherto unknown defense mechanism whereby the MC4-La1 cleavage module inhibits virus infection by coordinating R-motif–mediated defense mRNA translation.",

          "abstract": "The clinical application of CRISPR-Cas9 remains limited by delivery challenges, particularly for oral administration. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 ( Lsd1 ) plays a key role in colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis. Here, we developed an oral genome-editing platform (TPGS-RNP@LNP), where Lsd1 -targeting ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) were encapsulated in mulberry leaf lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and formulated with d -α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS). TPGS reinforced the lipid bilayer of LNPs, enhanced gastrointestinal stability, and facilitated colonic mucus penetration. Upon the galactose receptor–mediated endocytosis of TPGS-RNP@LNPs by macrophages, their fusion with the endosomal membrane and the presence of nuclear localization signals ensured the nuclear delivery of RNPs. TPGS-RNP@LNPs achieved 59.7% Lsd1 editing efficiency in macrophages, surpassing the commercial CRISPRMAX (43.0%). Oral TPGS-RNP@LNPs promoted H3K4 methylation to modulate epigenetic states, achieving inflammation mitigation, epithelial barrier restoration, and retardation of colitis and its associated tumorigenesis. As an LNP-based oral RNP delivery system, TPGS-RNP@LNPs provide a promising platform for precise treatment of colorectal diseases.",

          "abstract": "Macrophages integrate microenvironmental cues to orchestrate complex transcriptional and metabolic programs that drive functional polarization. Here, we demonstrate that STK11 links interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling with metabolic reprogramming to restrain alternatively activated (M2) macrophage polarization. Through integrative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified STK11 as a key transcriptional and metabolic regulator during M2 polarization. STK11 deficiency enhanced the expression of M2-associated markers and promoted glutamine metabolism in IL-4–stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, STK11 deficiency led to increased FOXO1 activation, thereby promoting M2 polarization. Pharmacological inhibition of FOXO1 or glutamine metabolism effectively reversed the enhanced M2 polarization. In an orthotopic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, myeloid-specific deletion of STK11 resulted in increased accumulation of M2-like tumor-associated macrophages, impaired antitumor immunity, and accelerated tumor progression. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for STK11 in modulating M2 macrophage polarization, offering mechanistic insights that may inform the development of immunometabolic therapies for pancreatic cancer.",

          "abstract": "T follicular regulatory cells (Tfr) play a pivotal role in maintaining immune self-tolerance and prevention of autoantibody induction. However, the stages of Tfr formation have still not been clarified. Here, we found that 30 to 50% of circulating Tfr in human blood have a naïve-like phenotype (preTfr, CD45RA + CD45RO − Foxp3 + CXCR5 + ). PreTfr are expandable in vitro while retaining suppressive capacity. They are transcriptionally similar to naïve T regs (nT regs ) ex vivo, but after stimulation, they gain increased expression of Tfr-related suppressive molecules such as IL-1RA, suggesting that they are primed for full differentiation into mature Tfr. Further, we demonstrate that preTfr but not nT reg are significantly reduced in the blood of patients with COVID-19 and patients with sepsis and that this loss is correlated with increased anti–interferon-γ antibodies and activated atypical B cells. Together, these data suggest that Tfr are disrupted at the earliest stage of their formation during severe disease and may be an important therapeutic target in future vaccine developments.",

Up to 30% of commercial pasteurized milk tested contained viral genome copies. The impact of residual viral remnants on host immunity is unknown. Orally ingested proteins can stimulate gut-associated lymphoid tissues, potentially inducing tolerance and altering responses to later infection. We found that milk pasteurization fully inactivated pandemic H1N1 and bovine H5N1 influenza viruses yet preserved hemagglutinin (HA) protein integrity. In mice, repeated oral exposure to inactivated virus did not alter mortality after H5N1 virus challenge. Preliminary data showed that naïve mice exposed to improperly pasteurized milk containing live H5N1 virus developed lethal infection, whereas prior H1N1 infection conferred protection. Mice with preexisting H1N1 immunity remained protected when challenged with bovine H5N1 virus after exposure to H5N1 pasteurized in milk. These findings suggest that pasteurized milk containing inactivated H5N1 virus poses minimal health risks.",

Stem cells have shown potential for DED treatment, but the main challenge lies in improving cell delivery effectiveness. Here, we developed eye drops for autoimmune DED treatment using porous arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD)–modified alginate microcarriers with mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) (RGD-Alg@MSCs). These microcarriers provided a favorable microenvironment for large-scale cell expansion while maintaining stemness with ideal mechanical properties for ocular application. In vitro, RGD-Alg@MSCs demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic effects compared to conventional MSCs, including improved cell viability, reduced apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced release of immunomodulatory factors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular mechanisms underlying these enhanced therapeutic effects. In the mouse model, RGD-Alg@MSCs exhibited prolonged ocular retention and enhanced tear production, promoted corneal healing, and suppressed inflammation by inhibiting dendritic cell activation and T H 17 differentiation. Our microcarrier system substantially improves stem cell delivery efficiency for treating autoimmune DED.",

          "abstract": "The dynamics of fluidic vortex rings have long captivated researchers because of their complex behavior despite simple structure. Photonic toroidal vortices constitute a family of three-dimensional, spacetime nonseparable structured light fields carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). However, as solutions to the dispersive Maxwells’ equations, these wave packets do not survive nondispersive propagation, and their dynamics remain elusive. In this article, the dynamics of photonic toroidal vortices under various dispersion regimes, mediated by transverse and longitudinal OAM, are investigated through simulations and experiments. The results reveal that the motion of a toroidal vortex is strongly affected by longitudinal OAM. The swirling flow destabilizes the toroidal structure under dispersion and induces topological transformations of vortex lines, characterized by annihilation and subsequent reformation in vacuum. The renascent toroidal vortex exhibits robust propagation in vacuum while maintaining its structure. These findings are supported by experimental validation and highlight the potential of photonic toroidal vortices as controllable channels for directional energy and information transfer.",

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest primary brain tumor that frequently infiltrates surrounding brain tissue, causing therapy resistance and recurrence. The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context–dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.",
