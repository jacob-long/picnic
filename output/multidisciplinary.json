          "abstract": "Photons can carry angular momentum, which is conventionally attributed to two constituents—spin angular momentum (SAM), which is an intrinsic property related to the polarization, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is related to the photon spatial distribution. In paraxial optics, these two forms of angular momentum are separable1, such that entanglement can be induced between the SAM and the OAM of a single photon2,3 or of different photons in a multi-photon state4. In nanophotonic systems, however, the SAM and the OAM of a photon are inseparable5,6, so only the total angular momentum (TAM) serves as a good quantum number7,8,9. Here we present the observation of non-classical correlations between two photons in the near-field regime, giving rise to entanglement related to the TAM. We entangle those nanophotonic states by coupling photon pairs to plasmonic modes and use quantum imaging techniques10,11 to measure their correlations. We observe that entanglement in TAM leads to a completely different structure of quantum correlations of photon pairs, compared with entanglement related to the two constituent angular momenta. This work paves the way for on-chip quantum information processing using the TAM of photons as the encoding property for quantum information.",

          "abstract": "Developing a general algorithm that learns to solve tasks across a wide range of applications has been a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. Although current reinforcement-learning algorithms can be readily applied to tasks similar to what they have been developed for, configuring them for new application domains requires substantial human expertise and experimentation 1,2 . Here we present the third generation of Dreamer, a general algorithm that outperforms specialized methods across over 150 diverse tasks, with a single configuration. Dreamer learns a model of the environment and improves its behaviour by imagining future scenarios. Robustness techniques based on normalization, balancing and transformations enable stable learning across domains. Applied out of the box, Dreamer is, to our knowledge, the first algorithm to collect diamonds in Minecraft from scratch without human data or curricula. This achievement has been posed as a substantial challenge in artificial intelligence that requires exploring farsighted strategies from pixels and sparse rewards in an open world 3 . Our work allows solving challenging control problems without extensive experimentation, making reinforcement learning broadly applicable.",

          "abstract": "Although it is one of the most arid regions today, the Sahara Desert was a green savannah during the African Humid Period (AHP) between 14,500 and 5,000 years before present, with water bodies promoting human occupation and the spread of pastoralism in the middle Holocene epoch 1 . DNA rarely preserves well in this region, limiting knowledge of the Sahara’s genetic history and demographic past. Here we report ancient genomic data from the Central Sahara, obtained from two approximately 7,000-year-old Pastoral Neolithic female individuals buried in the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. The majority of Takarkori individuals’ ancestry stems from a previously unknown North African genetic lineage that diverged from sub-Saharan African lineages around the same time as present-day humans outside Africa and remained isolated throughout most of its existence. Both Takarkori individuals are closely related to ancestry first documented in 15,000-year-old foragers from Taforalt Cave, Morocco 2 , associated with the Iberomaurusian lithic industry and predating the AHP. Takarkori and Iberomaurusian-associated individuals are equally distantly related to sub-Saharan lineages, suggesting limited gene flow from sub-Saharan to Northern Africa during the AHP. In contrast to Taforalt individuals, who have half the Neanderthal admixture of non-Africans, Takarkori shows ten times less Neanderthal ancestry than Levantine farmers, yet significantly more than contemporary sub-Saharan genomes. Our findings suggest that pastoralism spread through cultural diffusion into a deeply divergent, isolated North African lineage that had probably been widespread in Northern Africa during the late Pleistocene epoch.",

          "abstract": "Anthropogenic biodiversity decline threatens the functioning of ecosystems and the many benefits they provide to humanity1. As well as causing species losses in directly affected locations, human influence might also reduce biodiversity in relatively unmodified vegetation if far-reaching anthropogenic effects trigger local extinctions and hinder recolonization. Here we show that local plant diversity is globally negatively related to the level of anthropogenic activity in the surrounding region. Impoverishment of natural vegetation was evident only when we considered community completeness: the proportion of all suitable species in the region that are present at a site. To estimate community completeness, we compared the number of recorded species with the dark diversity—ecologically suitable species that are absent from a site but present in the surrounding region2. In the sampled regions with a minimal human footprint index, an average of 35% of suitable plant species were present locally, compared with less than 20% in highly affected regions. Besides having the potential to uncover overlooked threats to biodiversity, dark diversity also provides guidance for nature conservation. Species in the dark diversity remain regionally present, and their local populations might be restored through measures that improve connectivity between natural vegetation fragments and reduce threats to population persistence.",

          "abstract": "The fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect was recently discovered in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2)1–4. Experiments to date have revealed Chern insulators from hole doping at ν = -1, -2/3, -3/5, and -4/7 (per moiré unit cell) 1–6. In parallel, theories predict that, between v = -1 and -3, there exist exotic quantum phases 7–15, such as the coveted fractional topological insulators (FTI), fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) states, and non-abelian fractional states. Here we employ transient optical spectroscopy 16,17 on tMoTe2 to reveal nearly 20 hidden states at fractional fillings that are absent in static optical sensing or transport measurements. A pump pulse selectively excites charge across the correlated or pseudo gaps, leading to the disordering (melting) of correlated states 18. A probe pulse detects the subsequent melting and recovery dynamics via exciton and trion sensing 1,3,19–21. Besides the known states, we observe additional fractional fillings between ν = 0 and -1 and a large number of states on the electron doping side (ν > 0). Most importantly, we observe new states at fractional fillings of the Chern bands at ν = -4/3, -3/2, -5/3, -7/3, -5/2, and -8/3. These states are potential candidates for the predicted exotic topological phases 7–15. Moreover, we show that melting of correlated states occurs on two distinct time scales, 2-4 ps and 180-270 ps, attributed to electronic and phonon mechanisms, respectively. We discuss the differing dynamics of the electron and hole doped states from the distinct moiré conduction and valence bands.",

          "abstract": "Human RAD52 is a multifunctional DNA repair protein involved in several cellular events that support genome stability, including protection of stalled DNA replication forks from excessive degradation1,2,3,4. In its gatekeeper role, RAD52 binds to and stabilizes stalled replication forks during replication stress, protecting them from reversal by SMARCAL1 motor3. The structural and molecular mechanism of the RAD52-mediated fork protection remains elusive. Here, using P1 nuclease sensitivity, biochemical and single-molecule analyses, we show that RAD52 dynamically remodels replication forks through its strand exchange activity. The presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA at the fork modulates the kinetics of the strand exchange without impeding the reaction outcome. Mass photometry and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show that the replication fork promotes a unique nucleoprotein structure containing head-to-head arrangement of two undecameric RAD52 rings with an extended positively charged surface that accommodates all three arms of the replication fork. We propose that the formation and continuity of this surface is important for the strand exchange reaction and for competition with SMARCAL1.",

          "abstract": "Thromboinflammation occurs in various diseases, leading to life-threatening microvascular occlusion with resulting end-organ failure1,2,3,4. Importantly, how microvascular thromboinflammation resolves remains poorly understood due to the small size-scale of microvasculature and the long duration (weeks to months) of this process. Here we introduce a hydrogel-based thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model with long-term culture capabilities to model microvascular thromboinflammation and monitor clot resolution over clinically and physiologically relevant timescales (up to months). Using this system, we mapped out the distinct temporal phases of clot resolution in microvascular thromboinflammation. Using multiplexed RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization in combination with our thromboinflammation-on-a-chip model, we observed that inflammation shifts the endothelium fibrinolytic balance to favour thrombosis and pinpointed neutrophil elastase as a double-edged sword that induces clot resolution but also tissue damage. We then investigated the mechanisms of potential therapeutic agents that either prevent microvascular thrombosis or accelerate clot resolution. Specifically, we observed that, in thromboinflammation, (1) early tissue plasminogen activator administration within 3 h directly improves endothelial barrier function; (2) prophylactic defibrotide and enoxaparin suppress microvascular thromboinflammation through endothelium-mediated mechanisms; and (3) combining enoxaparin with crizanlizumab reduces microvascular occlusion and protects endothelial function in sickle cell disease. These data introduce a paradigm in investigating the underlying mechanisms of thromboinflammatory clot resolution and conducting drug discovery thereof.",

In an experiment to generate haploid embryos through inhibition of pollen phospholipase activity in sunflower (Helianthus annus), we serendipitously discovered that emasculated sunflowers spontaneously form parthenogenic haploid seed. Exploration of genetic, chemical and environmental factors demonstrated that a specific genotype background enabled high parthenogenesis and that full spectrum high-intensity light supplementation boosted parthenogenesis, yielding hundreds of haploid seeds per head. Induction of doubled haploid plants can greatly accelerate plant breeding efficiency; however, despite successful engineering of haploid induction in many crops, few reported systems are commercially scalable1.

          "abstract": "Although Earth, together with other terrestrial planets, must have had an early-formed protocrust, the chemical composition of this crust has received little attention. The protocrust was extracted from an extensive magma ocean formed by accretion and melting of asteroidal bodies1. Both experimental and chronological data suggest that the silicate melt ascending from this magma ocean formed in equilibrium with, or after, metal was extracted to form Earth’s core. Here we show that a protocrust formed under these conditions would have had incompatible (with respect to silicate minerals) trace-element characteristics remarkably similar to those of the current average continental crust. This has major implications for subsequent planetary evolution. Many geochemical arguments for when and how plate tectonics began implicitly assume that subduction is required to produce the continental trace-element signature. These arguments are severely compromised if this signature was already a feature of the Hadean protocrust.",

          "abstract": "Temporary pacemakers are essential for the care of patients with short-lived bradycardia in post-operative and other settings1,2,3,4. Conventional devices require invasive open-heart surgery or less invasive endovascular surgery, both of which are challenging for paediatric and adult patients5,6,7,8. Other complications9,10,11 include risks of infections, lacerations and perforations of the myocardium, and of displacements of external power supplies and control systems. Here we introduce a millimetre-scale bioresorbable optoelectronic system with an onboard power supply and a wireless, optical control mechanism with generalized capabilities in electrotherapy and specific application opportunities in temporary cardiac pacing. The extremely small sizes of these devices enable minimally invasive implantation, including percutaneous injection and endovascular delivery. Experimental studies demonstrate effective pacing in mouse, rat, porcine, canine and human cardiac models at both single-site and multi-site locations. Pairing with a skin-interfaced wireless device allows autonomous, closed-loop operation upon detection of arrhythmias. Further work illustrates opportunities in combining these miniaturized devices with other medical implants, with an example of arrays of pacemakers for individual or collective use on the frames of transcatheter aortic valve replacement systems, to provide unique solutions that address risks for atrioventricular block following surgeries. This base technology can be readily adapted for a broad range of additional applications in electrotherapy, such as nerve and bone regeneration, wound therapy and pain management.",

At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity5,6, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodelling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells7,8,9. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell-type-specific circuits to produce the psychedelics’ behavioural actions10. Here we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation and cell-type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increases the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviourally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin’s ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin’s effects on stress-related behaviour and structural plasticity. Collectively, these results identify that a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex have essential roles in psilocybin’s long-term drug action.",

To overcome this longstanding challenge, we here describe a prototypical example of an alternative conceptual approach, “Strategic Atom Replacement”, in which we synthesize N-alkyl pyrazoles from isothiazoles. The net forward transformation is a “swap” of the isothiazole sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom and its associated alkyl fragment to deliver the alkylated pyrazole.4,5 Linking the two azoles is an orphaned heterocycle class, 1,2,3-Thiadiazine-S-Oxides, whose synthetic potential has yet to be tapped.6 By proceeding via these unusual heterocycles, the typical selectivity and separation challenges associated with exclusively bond-based pyrazole preparations are circumvented, and even minimally differentiated peripheral substituents can be discriminated to afford isomerically pure products.",

          "abstract": "Recently the quest for post-silicon semiconductors has escalated owing to the inherent limitations of conventional bulk semiconductors, which are plagued by issues such as drain-induced barrier lowering, interfacial-scattering-induced mobility degradation and a constrained current on/off ratio determined by semiconductor bandwidth. These challenges have prompted the search for more advanced materials, with atomic-layer-thick two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors emerging as a potential solution. Following over a decade of research advances, recent developments1,2,3 in wafer-scale growth and device fabrication have led to breakthroughs in 2D semiconductor electronics. However, the level of integration remains constrained to a few hundred transistors. We describe a reduced instruction set computing architecture (RISC-V) microprocessor capable of executing standard 32-bit instructions on 5,900 MoS2 transistors and a complete standard cell library based on 2D semiconductor technology. The library contains 25 types of logic units. In alignment with advances in silicon integrated circuits, we also co-optimized the process flow and design of the 2D logic circuits. Our combined manufacturing and design methodology has overcome the significant challenges associated with wafer-scale integration of 2D circuits and enabled a pioneering prototype of an MoS2 microprocessor that exemplifies the potential of 2D integrated-circuit technology beyond silicon.",

          "abstract": "Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with maximized metal use and discrete energy levels hold promise for broad applications in heterogeneous catalysis, energy conversion, environmental science and biomedicine1,2,3,4,5,6,7. The activity and stability of SACs are governed by the pair of metal–adsorbate and metal–support interactions8,9,10. However, the understanding of these interactions with their catalytic performance in nature is challenging. Correlations of activity with the charge state of metal atoms have frequently reached controversial conclusions11,12,13,14,15. Here we report that the activity of palladium (Pd1) SACs exhibits a linear scaling relationship with the positions of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of oxide supports across 14 types of semiconductor. Elevation of the LUMO position by reducing the support particle size to a few nanometres boosts a record high activity along with excellent stability in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. We show that the elevated LUMO of support reduces its energy gap with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of Pd1 atoms, which promotes Pd1–support orbital hybridizations for high stability and further amends the LUMO of anchored Pd1 atoms to enhance Pd1–adsorbate interactions for high activity. These findings are consistent with the frontier molecular orbital theory and provide a general descriptor for the rational selection of metal–support pairs with predictable activity.",

Exposure to direct neonatal but not intrapartum antibiotics was associated with significantly lower antibody titres against various polysaccharides in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and the Haemophilus influenzae type b polyribosylribitol phosphate and diphtheria toxoid antigens in the combined 6-in-1 Infanrix Hexa vaccine at 7 months of age. Blood from infants exposed to neonatal antibiotics had an inflammatory transcriptional profile before vaccination; in addition, faecal metagenomics showed reduced abundance of Bifidobacterium species in these infants at the time of vaccination, which was correlated with reduced vaccine antibody titres 6 months later. In preclinical models, responses to the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were strongly dependent on an intact microbiota but could be restored in germ-free mice by administering a consortium of Bifidobacterium species or a probiotic already widely used in neonatal units. Our data suggest that microbiota-targeted interventions could mitigate the detrimental effects of early-life antibiotics on vaccine immunogenicity.",

Excellent proof of principle for this potentially powerful approach to asymmetric catalysis has been described3,4,5,6,7,8; nevertheless, substantial challenges have not yet been addressed, including the exploitation of carbon–heteroatom (rather than only carbon–hydrogen and carbon–carbon) bond cleavage to achieve deracemization, as well as the development of processes that provide broad classes of useful enantioenriched compounds and tetrasubstituted stereocentres. Here we describe a straightforward method that addresses these challenges, using a chiral copper catalyst, generated in situ from commercially available components, to achieve the photoinduced deracemization of tertiary (and secondary) alkyl halides through carbon–halogen bond cleavage. Mechanistic studies (including the independent synthesis of postulated intermediates, photophysical, spectroscopic and reactivity studies, and density functional theory calculations) provide support for the key steps and intermediates in our proposed catalytic cycle, as well as insight into the origin of enantioselectivity.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors 1 . Frequency differences between overtone modes—large separations—probe stellar density 2 , whereas differences between low-degree modes—small separations—probe the sound-speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main-sequence Sun-like stars 3 , and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterized by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and become proportional to large separations 4,5 . Here we present evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolutions, eventually entering an ultradeep regime that leads to the red-giant-branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.",

          "abstract": "Animals learn the value of foods on the basis of their postingestive effects and thereby develop aversions to foods that are toxic 1–10 and preferences to those that are nutritious 11–13 . However, it remains unclear how the brain is able to assign credit to flavours experienced during a meal with postingestive feedback signals that can arise after a substantial delay. Here we reveal an unexpected role for the postingestive reactivation of neural flavour representations in this temporal credit-assignment process. To begin, we leverage the fact that mice learn to associate novel 14,15 , but not familiar, flavours with delayed gastrointestinal malaise signals to investigate how the brain represents flavours that support aversive postingestive learning. Analyses of brain-wide activation patterns reveal that a network of amygdala regions is unique in being preferentially activated by novel flavours across every stage of learning (consumption, delayed malaise and memory retrieval). By combining high-density recordings in the amygdala with optogenetic stimulation of malaise-coding hindbrain neurons, we show that delayed malaise signals selectively reactivate flavour representations in the amygdala from a recent meal. The degree of malaise-driven reactivation of individual neurons predicts the strengthening of flavour responses upon memory retrieval, which in turn leads to stabilization of the population-level representation of the recently consumed flavour. By contrast, flavour representations in the amygdala degrade in the absence of unexpected postingestive consequences. Thus, we demonstrate that postingestive reactivation and plasticity of neural flavour representations may support learning from delayed feedback.",

          "abstract": "Neurotropic herpesviruses may be implicated in the development of dementia 1–5 . Moreover, vaccines may have important off-target immunological effects 6–9 . Here we aim to determine the effect of live-attenuated herpes zoster vaccination on the occurrence of dementia diagnoses. To provide causal as opposed to correlational evidence, we take advantage of the fact that, in Wales, eligibility for the zoster vaccine was determined on the basis of an individual’s exact date of birth. Those born before 2 September 1933 were ineligible and remained ineligible for life, whereas those born on or after 2 September 1933 were eligible for at least 1 year to receive the vaccine. Using large-scale electronic health record data, we first show that the percentage of adults who received the vaccine increased from 0.01% among patients who were merely 1 week too old to be eligible, to 47.2% among those who were just 1 week younger. Apart from this large difference in the probability of ever receiving the zoster vaccine, individuals born just 1 week before 2 September 1933 are unlikely to differ systematically from those born 1 week later. Using these comparison groups in a regression discontinuity design, we show that receiving the zoster vaccine reduced the probability of a new dementia diagnosis over a follow-up period of 7 years by 3.5 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.6–7.1, P = 0.019), corresponding to a 20.0% (95% CI = 6.5–33.4) relative reduction. This protective effect was stronger among women than men. We successfully confirm our findings in a different population (England and Wales’s combined population), with a different type of data (death certificates) and using an outcome (deaths with dementia as primary cause) that is closely related to dementia, but less reliant on a timely diagnosis of dementia by the healthcare system 10 . Through the use of a unique natural experiment, this study provides evidence of a dementia-preventing or dementia-delaying effect from zoster vaccination that is less vulnerable to confounding and bias than the existing associational evidence.",

          "title": "From bench to bread: how science can enhance your hobbies",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "When Chantle Swichkow hops on a Zoom call, it’s unclear whether she’s logging in from the laboratory or her home. She is in her kitchen, but there are clear markings of a scientist at work. A microscope is on the counter to her left, atop a stack of thick textbooks. A large whiteboard dominates the background, documenting more than a dozen fermentation projects alongside their status and potential next steps.\n\n“I also have a whole little set-up over here with some sauces and some vinegars,” she says, motioning off camera. Her at-home experiments run the gamut of fermentation consumables. She bakes bread, crafts kombucha and concocts kimchi. She has also dabbled in making miso from a type of tortilla chip, and in creating her own peach rings from fermented fruits.\n\nLike many people, Swichkow’s passion for home-based fermentation experiments started during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time, she was doing her PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), studying the genetics of metabolic diseases in mice.\n\n“I was so used to getting up every day and going and doing experiments in the lab. When the world shut down, it was like, I don’t know what to do with myself,” says Swichkow, who describes herself as a fermented-food scientist in her profile on the networking site LinkedIn. “I ended up throwing all of my experimental angst into a sourdough starter that my husband had given me,” she says.\n\nShe became so intrigued by the genetic variation in yeast that her postdoctoral studies at UCLA, which ended last December, focused on the genetic architecture of yeast–bacteria interactions in fermented environments. She would conduct research in the lab, but also use her expertise — and sometimes the yeast — to conduct her own experiments at home as part of a hobby that continued beyond the lockdowns.\n\n“One of my favourite projects now is my own personal sourdough starter that I call the Frankenstarter,” she says. “I brought a handful or so of different sourdoughs that I collected, some from a bakery, some from industrial contexts, into my postdoc lab, but I had some left over, and I ended up just combining them all together.” (Swichkow notes that she wouldn’t usually eat the experiments that come out of the lab.)\n\nChantelle Swichkow has experimented with making miso with Takis, a type of tortilla chip.Credit: Chantle Swichkow\n\nBringing work home is not always about making delicious food, nor is it possible for all scientific disciplines. Virologists can’t bring their specimens back in their briefcases, and chemists can’t play around with hazardous chemicals at home. But for scientists in certain fields, there are ways for scientific knowledge to influence — and enhance — hobbies.\n\nCarrying over to the kitchen\n\nIn labs, researchers follow the scientific method: questioning the world, making hypotheses and testing them accordingly. Swichkow applies a similar framework in the kitchen.\n\n“It’s about knowing what the question is,” she explains. “Sometimes it’s ‘can I make vinegar from this leftover bottle of wine?’ and if I do, ‘what will it taste like?’”\n\nYvonne Henskens, a biochemist who specializes in haemostasis at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, also sees overlap between her lab work and at-home cooking projects. She follows project-management processes with her home ‘experiments’ producing sourdough, cheese and yogurt. Her lab focus is on developing blood tests. But she says that the project-management process is identical. “So I say, on this day I have to do this. On this day, I have to do that. And then I have a checklist.”\n\nThese lab and home checklists can resemble each other, because both processes involve exploration, documentation and testing. In the first step, she brainstorms new reagents (or ingredients, if she’s cooking), followed by a literature review. In the lab that means researching the history of the tests or the reagents, and in the kitchen it means reading recipes. Then she tests the variables, such as time or temperature. Finally, it’s presentation time, either in the clinic or at the dinner table.\n\nSwichkow describes a similar process. “I label things in the same way I would label cultures in the lab,” she explains. “I even got myself a whole set of laboratory tape and pens because I really just like that process,” she says. “I keep meticulous notes because, for me, it’s about reproducibility.”\n\nBut flexibility is also key. According to Henskens, a protocol is important but, in some circumstances, it can be amended. “I want people to understand what they are doing, follow the protocol, but also divert if it’s needed,” she says. In certain situations, such as encountering a strange result, the lab technician might decide to run an extra control, to calibrate an instrument or to use extra reagents, she adds.\n\n“It’s the same with recipes,” she says. “You really have to taste and then have the capability of changing it.” Take lemon juice or red peppers, which will never taste the same each time. “Knowledge of ingredients and their variation, their properties in different cooking techniques makes it possible to deviate from recipes.”\n\nAn alternative outlet for science\n\nJacob Brejcha also credits his cooking skills to science. Transitioning from a bachelor’s degree in chemistry to a master’s in chemical engineering in 2021 meant the time he spent in the lab shrunk. But he channelled his passion for hands-on experimentation into cooking, finding an outlet for skills such as patience and precision, which he’d honed as an undergraduate at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n\n“A lot of those reactions take a long time, so if you mess something up, you’re probably not going to finish your lab work,” says Brejcha, who now works as a licensing associate at Purdue Research Foundation, a non-profit institute that promotes entrepreneurship and helps researchers to secure patents. “Sometimes these baking projects take multiple hours, so it’s important to really be a stickler for getting the measurements right.” Other aspects of the scientific method also creep into his cooking — isolating variables and taking stock of what went wrong to improve the next meal.\n\nA scientific background doesn’t just enhance hobbies in the home — gardens are also a place in which expertise can shine. Conservation biologist Shaun McCoshum at engineering and surveying firm Westwood Professional Services in Odessa, Texas, has been applying a conservation-science approach to gardening.\n\n“Conservation is trying to rebalance nature and let things be messy in a way to support wildlife and help these natural systems continue, and clean up the messes that we’ve made, either from invasive species, pollution or overall habitat destruction,” he explains.\n\nIn his garden, he tries to find ways for native species, such as toads, to thrive. And like Brejcha, he uses the scientific method. “I’ve got gradients of sandy soils in different pockets, but they all have the same Sun exposure, and they all have the same kind of vegetation cover,” he explains. “I’m trying to control as many variables as possible to see which soils are going to support which species.”\n\nShaun McCoshum collected and weighed monarch butterflies before releasing them as part of his at-home scientific approach to gardening.Credit: Shaun McCoshum\n\nScientific knowledge and skills can also enhance other hobbies that take place outside the home. Rosalie Phillips, a mechanical engineer at medical-equipment company Agiliti in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, spends most of her days prototyping health tools, a role that requires both a computer and physical engineering work. But over the past few years, she has been leaning into hands-on projects outside work, exploring the world of glass neon. It’s meant to be a creative outlet, but she is applying what she’s learnt throughout her education and career.\n\n“One of the biggest things that I take from my day-to-day is the practical spatial understanding,” she explains. The complex glass tubing that holds the neon in place often needs to be delicately and deliberately shaped. “You can rarely bend them in precise order,” says Phillips. “You have to plan five steps ahead to make sure that nothing conflicts with itself.”\n\nSimilarly, she says, engineers learn to be meticulous with their projects because if they mess something up, they have to spend several hours getting back to the point at which they can try again. “The desire to make sure you’re measuring everything and setting everything up so that when you do it, you’re setting yourself up for success, is definitely learned from mechanical engineering,” she says.",

          "title": "Do smartphones and social media really harm teens’ mental health?",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "There’s a book perched near the top of The New York Times bestseller list about what’s wrong with kids today. The Anxious Generation (2024), by psychologist Jonathan Haidt, argues that increasing time spent on smartphones and social media, at the expense of play, is rewiring the brains of children and adolescents and driving soaring rates of mental illness. It leapt to the top of the bestseller list when it was released a year ago and has sat there ever since.\n\nThe book reinforced an acute concern among many Western parents about the time that their children spend on smartphones and other screens. In a 2024 survey, nearly half of US teenagers said they were online almost constantly, compared with 24% a decade earlier (see ‘Constantly online’), and one-third used social-media sites such as YouTube almost all the time. Parents are troubled by this technology because “it’s new, it’s different, and it’s not the way that they were raised”, says psychologist Sarah Coyne at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.\n\nAlthough researchers agree that adolescents are struggling with mental health, there is fierce debate about how much phones and social media are to blame. Some scientists say the copious research done so far does not show a large effect of these technologies on teenagers’ psychological health. “Science to date does not support the widespread panic around social media and mental health,” says Candice Odgers, a psychologist at the University of California, Irvine, who has criticized Haidt’s conclusions.\n\nSource: Pew Research Center\n\nScientists acknowledge that smartphones and social media can potentially be harmful for some people, if screen time displaces healthy activities, such as sleep, or if posts encourage them to self-harm, for instance. But these tools can also help people connect to support, advice, education and friends. The impact “depends on the individual themselves and their history and their physiology, the content and the context”, says Coyne.\n\nAnd many researchers are concerned that parents and children are hearing the alarming message propagated by Haidt’s blockbuster book and major media, rather than the more nuanced one suggested by other scientists. Some authorities, meanwhile, are moving to ban phones from schools or restrict teenagers’ access to social media. “Parents and kids are very aware of the narrative and very worried,” says Megan Moreno, an adolescent-medicine physician at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. That sparks family battles over screens — and leaves parents unsure what to do.\n\nAlarming trends\n\nNo one denies that adolescent mental health is a huge concern. Research shows that, over the past two decades, rates of mental illness have been increasing in adolescents in many countries1 (see ‘Sadness epidemic’). For instance, surveys of US adolescents found that the share reporting symptoms of depression rose from 16% in 2010 to 21% in 2015 — mostly due to increases in girls — and that rates of suicide rose from 5.4 to 7 per 100,000 in the same period2. Researchers suspect that some of these trends could be down to increased awareness and reporting of mental-health concerns — but they have also searched for other causes.\n\nSource: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nHaidt, who works at the New York University Stern School of Business, points out in his book that the upswing in mental illness coincides with the widespread adoption by teenagers of smartphones (the iPhone was launched in 2007) and argues that this edged out real-world socializing, playing and sleep. He then draws on many studies of different types to build an argument that “This Great Rewiring of Childhood … is the single largest reason for the tidal wave of adolescent mental illness that began in the early 2010s”. Haidt points in particular to evidence that heavy social-media use by pre-teen girls is linked to depression and anxiety. “Whenever you look at anxiety, depression, you almost always find the effects are larger,” he told Nature.\n\nBut other researchers have criticized some of his views. Odgers published one of the most biting critiques in a review of Haidt’s book (see Nature 628, 29–30; 2024). His argument that digital technologies are driving an epidemic of mental illness “is not supported by science”, she wrote, suggesting that Haidt might be mistaking correlation between technology use and mental illness for causation.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is a large, complex and often conflicting body of research that different researchers interpret in different ways.\n\nMany scientists have looked for correlations between measures of screen or social-media use and mental health in cross-sectional studies — which collect data at one moment in time — or longitudinal studies, which track people over time. Although some studies have found benefits, others have reported harms. A big weakness in such analyses is that they often rely on participants self-reporting the time they spend on screens. This is usually inaccurate, because people can’t remember or are embarrassed to answer honestly. “We all agree it’s terrible,” Haidt says.\n\nAre screens harming teens? What scientists can do to find answers\n\nTo try and make sense of the conflicting literature, researchers have done dozens of reviews analysing many studies together, again with varying results. Many have found relatively weak associations and small effects of these technologies on mental health. One 2020 analysis3 of more than 80 reviews concluded that there was, on average, a “negative but very small” association between adolescents’ use of digital technology, and social media in particular, and psychological well-being. A 2024 literature review4 by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine “did not support the conclusion that social media causes changes in adolescent health at the population level”.\n\nIt’s also unclear in some studies, say Odgers and some other researchers, which comes first: whether social media causes depression, for instance, or whether young people who are depressed are more likely to spend time on social media. “We might have the arrow pointing in the wrong direction,” Odgers says.\n\nThe evidence from experiments in which people swear off smartphones or social media for a spell has also been somewhat equivocal. One systematic review5 of 23 mostly randomized trials found some evidence that abstaining from social media improved measures of depression, says Ruth Plackett, a health researcher at University College London who led the review. But other studies found no effect.\n\nFrom all this evidence, researchers have arrived at differing conclusions. Odgers and others worry that the focus on phones risks distracting scientists and policymakers from other important, but harder-to-tackle, contributors to adolescent mental-health problems, such as poverty, inequality, violence, discrimination and isolation. “We have young people in crisis, and part of it might be technology,” says Amy Orben, who studies digital mental health at the University of Cambridge, UK. “But we also have other areas that we really, truly know influence mental health that aren’t getting near the time they need.”\n\nHaidt takes a different view. He says that the type of small effects that scientists have found is not unusual in public-health studies based on crude measures, such as self-reported screen time. He argues that the effects are often masked when researchers combine and analyse different results — such as data on boys and girls, or measures of overall well-being with those on depression. The links are clearer, he says, in analyses centred on depression and anxiety. “So this is getting very frustrating, because the evidence of harm is there.”\n\nDivergent data\n\nMany scientists say the impacts of smartphones and social media depend on the individual, their family and other circumstances, and what they are doing online. A 2021 study of nearly 400 adolescents, for example, found that 28% of participants felt worse after using social-media platforms (mostly WhatsApp, Snapchat and Instagram), 26% felt better and 45% felt neither better nor worse6.\n\nSuch results might help to explain why some other studies, which look at averages, find little impact, says Ine Beyens, a communications researcher at the University of Amsterdam, who led the study. “When you put all these effects together, of course, in the end, you have a very small effect,” she says.\n\nSome researchers have observed potential benefits for certain groups. Coyne researches under-represented populations, including transgender and non-binary youth, and she says, “they’re using their phones in really effective ways, a lot of the time, to find belonging and community”7.\n\nBy contrast, a small proportion of young people do use their smartphones or social media in problematic ways, researchers and physicians say, and there is debate about how to define and diagnose what constitutes pathological use. “Nothing one does for eight or nine hours a day — except for sleep — should be viewed as a healthful activity,” says Dimitri Christakis, a paediatrician and researcher at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute in Washington.\n\nGovernments are banning kids from social media: will that protect them from harm?\n\nAnd for some, social-media use can lead to devastating consequences. In September 2022, for instance, a London coroner’s inquest found that 14-year-old Molly Russell “died from an act of self-harm whilst suffering from depression and the negative effects of on-line content”. The inquest heard that Russell had viewed content about self-harm and suicide on the platforms Instagram and Pinterest before she took her own life in November 2017.\n\nDuring the inquest, a representative of Meta, which owns Instagram, defended the platform’s policies, and a Pinterest representative admitted that the site was not safe when Russell used it. In response to the inquest findings, both firms pointed to ways they were improving their sites. Last year, Instagram launched ‘teen accounts’, which restrict the content young users can view.\n\nSuch cases are horrific and tragic, says Coyne, and lead to understandable fear among parents that something similar could happen to their child. But jumping from anecdotal cases to an assumption that social media is a terrible peril for all teenagers is problematic, she and other scientists say. “That’s a genuine fear,” says Coyne, but the “likelihood of that is really, really small”.",

The move comes as the administration has also cut hundreds of grants funding HIV and AIDS research.\n\nThe changes leave researchers bewildered: during Trump’s first presidency, his administration launched a plan to eradicate HIV in the United States by 2030.\n\nMultiple people in the US Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy lost their jobs Tuesday, according to a person at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency overseeing the infectious-disease office. That person asked for anonymity because they had not been cleared to speak to the media. A second source familiar with the administration’s efforts to shrink and restructure the HHS said last week that the office’s staff would be cut.\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nIn addition, the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) has cancelled more than 230 research grants funding HIV and AIDS research in the past few weeks, according to a Nature analysis of a crowdsourced spreadsheet of terminated grants. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is losing a key office for HIV prevention as part of the restructuring.\n\nAll of this adds up to “devastating” cuts to research and HIV services in the United States, says Julia Marcus, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who has had several grants terminated. “The likely outcome is going to be a resurgence of HIV.”\n\nIn response to questions from Nature, the HHS issued a statement saying that the infectious-disease office is not closing. Instead, work on HIV and AIDS “is being consolidated and streamlined” to avoid having “multiple offices that do the same work across multiple divisions”, the statement said.\n\nAbrupt reversal\n\nThe lay-offs are part of the Trump administration’s effort to shrink the size of the federal government. HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr announced last week that his agency would lose 20,000 employees, almost one-quarter of the workforce. Kennedy has also repeatedly called for the federal government to focus more attention on chronic disease and less on infectious disease.\n\nAsked by Nature about the administration’s commitment to addressing HIV and AIDS, a person familiar with the changes at HHS said that the remaining programme “is going to continue the very important work to end HIV. That was a big priority of President Trump during the first administration”.\n\nThe HHS infectious-disease office was responsible for coordinating and supporting a policy called Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. and for the Minority HIV/AIDS Fund. The office employed roughly five dozen people, according to US media reports.\n\nWhen news of the lay-offs hit, “I got tears in my eyes”, says Carl Schmid, who co-chaired the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS during the first Trump administration. “These are people who have devoted their lives to ending HIV.”\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\nThe person familiar with the HHS restructuring said that the infectious-disease office is being merged with an HHS programme that provides treatment to people living with HIV/AIDS. The person said they did not know how many people from the infectious-disease office still have jobs. The CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention is also being merged with that programme, the person said.\n\nBut Adrian Shanker, who worked on health policy during the administration of former US president Joe Biden, says that the merger is “deeply problematic”. The existing HHS programme focuses on treatment, whereas the CDC’s division focuses on prevention and the HHS infectious-disease office coordinates surveillance of the HIV epidemic across the country. They cannot absorb each other’s responsibilities, Shanker says. “This is not going to get us closer to end the epidemic,” he says.",

          "abstract": "An analysis identified studies that contained duplicated images or tortured phrases.Credit: bernie_photo/Getty\n\nA biotechnology journal that was inundated with paper-mill submissions in 2021 — and claimed in 2023 that it had tackled the problem — still harbours hundreds of dubious papers, an analysis by research-integrity sleuths has found.\n\nAt least 226 studies on rodents published in the open-access journal Bioengineered between 2010 and 2023 contain manipulated or duplicated images, says the analysis, which was posted on the arXiv preprint server on 28 March1. These are hallmarks of papers produced by paper mills — companies that churn out fake scientific manuscripts to order. Most of these 226 studies have not been retracted.\n\nScience’s fake-paper problem: high-profile effort will tackle paper mills\n\nBioengineered and its publisher, Taylor & Francis, said in a 2023 blogpost that they became suspicious about paper-mill submissions in early 2021. In response, the publisher said, it had introduced policies to screen manuscripts more rigorously. However, the preprint’s authors say that efforts to clean up published papers have been too slow.\n\n“The problem isn’t that they were targeted by paper mills, because that can happen. It’s just the way that you solve the problem afterwards. And I think that this hasn’t happened correctly,” says René Aquarius, a neurosurgery researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a co-author of the preprint. “It’s been two to four years since most of these bad papers have been published,” he adds.\n\nTaylor & Francis says that it is investigating “a large number of articles” in Bioengineered that it suspects were produced by paper mills. “We will cross-check that list with papers of concern identified by the preprint’s authors,” a spokesperson for the UK-based publisher told Nature. “Alongside this work, we have made a range of editorial and process changes to the journal, which, as noted in the preprint, have prevented the publication of further paper-mill content.” The spokesperson declined to answer specific questions about the preprint’s findings.\n\nSuspicious activity\n\nFrom its launch in 2010 until 2019, Bioengineered published around 70 papers a year. This rose to 131 papers in 2020, then soared to more than 1,000 per year in 2021 and 2022.\n\n“Our previous experience on other journals that had been targeted by paper mills signaled the need for a thorough investigation,” said Todd Hummel, a global publishing director at Taylor & Francis, in the 2023 blogpost. He added that the journal had brought in measures to root out fraudulent submissions. These included asking authors to provide raw data with their manuscripts, training editors on how to spot paper-mill submissions and applying closer scrutiny to requests to change author lists. In 2023, the number of papers the journal published dropped back down to 64.\n\nScience journals crack down on image manipulation\n\n“I think it’s admirable that they have been transparent about this,” says Aquarius. “It’s great that [they] stopped the influx of paper-mill papers, or at least the acceptance of them.”\n\n“But why leave some of those papers for multiple years?” he adds. “I think cleaning up the literature is also an important task.”\n\nJana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press, who is based in Heidelberg, Germany, agrees. “It’s important that the effort of correcting the literature takes place efficiently, effectively, thoroughly and at a reasonable pace,” she says.\n\nManipulated images\n\nIn their analysis, Aquarius and his colleagues decided to screen studies that mentioned mice or rats in their titles or abstracts. The number of articles that met these criteria had increased sharply in 2021 — before 2019, they made up less than 15% of Bioengineered papers, but in 2021 and 2022, they accounted for more than 35%.",

          "authors": "Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "Jay Bhattacharya took office as director of the US National Institutes of Health on 1 April.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nOn health economist Jay Bhattacharya’s first day as the head of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), the chiefs of 4 of the 27 institutes and centres that make up the agency — including the country’s top infectious-diseases official — were removed from their posts. The unprecedented move comes amid massive cuts to research funding at the NIH.\n\nThe directors of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) and the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) were informed late on 31 March that they were being placed on administrative leave. Together, these leaders oversaw US$9 billion in funding.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\nAt least some directors were offered reassignments to the Indian Health Service (IHS), a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that provides medical care to Indigenous people in the United States. (The HHS is the parent agency of the NIH.) “HHS proposes to reassign you as part of a broader effort to strengthen the Department and more effectively promote the health of the American people,” reads an e-mail to the directors that Nature has obtained. “This underserved community deserves the highest quality of service, and HHS needs individuals like you to deliver that service,” it says, offering reassignment to locations such as Alaska, Montana and Oklahoma.\n\nThese large-scale reassignments are unheard of for the NIH, the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research: typically, only the NIH director and the director of one of its institutes, the National Cancer Institute, are appointed by the US president. The 26 directors of the other NIH institutes and centres are not usually replaced when presidential administrations change. (The NIMHD director Eliseo Pérez-Stable, for example, had been in his role for nearly ten years, under three US presidents.) But US President Donald Trump, who took office in January, has not been following the norms of past administrations during his second term.\n\n“This will go down as one of the darkest days in modern scientific history in my 50 years in the business,” says Michael Osterholm, an infectious-diseases epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in Minneapolis. “These are going to be huge losses to the research community.”\n\nWhen asked for a response, the NIH directed Nature to the HHS for comment. The NIH’s top communications officer, Renate Myles, was also placed on administrative leave, according to an agency staff member who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The HHS did not answer Nature’s questions but instead said in a statement that the agency “has invited certain individuals to consider positions within the IHS” to “address staffing needs”.\n\nA consolidation of power\n\nThe removal of the directors follows an announcement last week by HHS chief Robert F. Kennedy Jr that the agency, which includes the NIH, would be reducing its workforce by 20,000 employees, or about one-quarter of its staff members. Lay-offs have mainly been targeted at administrative staff, but many scientists, including those who run HIV-prevention programmes and research, have also been affected.\n\nTrump’s nominee for NIH chief talks frozen grants and fostering ‘scientific dissent’\n\nThe lay-offs will challenge the long-standing status of the NIH’s institutes and centres as semi-autonomous entities. Legislative, communications, information-technology and other administrative workers in each institute received termination notices early on 1 April, a move designed to consolidate power under the NIH director. “NIH will cease to function after the RIFs [reductions in force]; it will take months to get things back online administratively,” says another NIH official, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the press.\n\nIn his first e-mail to agency staff members on 1 April, which was obtained by Nature, Bhattacharya wrote: “These reductions in the workforce will have a profound impact on key NIH administrative functions ... and will require an entirely new approach to how we carry them out.”",

          "abstract": "Changemakers\n\nThis Nature Q&A series celebrates people who fight racism in science and who champion inclusion. It also highlights initiatives that could be applied to other scientific workplaces.\n\nInclusion — not gatekeeping — is a theme in mathematician Nathan Alexander’s laboratory at Howard University in Washington DC. His quantitative-histories workshop is a computational and community hub for studying social problems, such as housing insecurity and homelessness. He founded that lab while in a previous post at Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia, and has now expanded it to include Howard and another site at the Institute for Racial Justice in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n“We have anyone and everyone come together,” he says. “Our youngest member is in high school, and our oldest is someone who, in their late 60s, was interested in returning to mathematics. We have members from the community, including formerly incarcerated persons,” he adds.\n\nUndergraduate and graduate students, along with collaborators from outside academia, all have a place at the table. By adopting a community-centred mindset, the team approaches problems with a blend of academic training and real-world experience. As a result, team members learn from each other, broaden their views on the problems they are studying and obtain better results than could be achieved without that diversity of perspectives.\n\nThe financial shackling of historically Black universities in the United States\nFor instance, Alexander’s lab is in the early stages of a project to use the US Census Bureau’s community resilience estimates (CRE) — a metric of how vulnerable neighbourhoods are to disasters — to probe housing insecurity and homelessness.\n\n“Each member of our group is taking on an area of the United States that they are familiar with and conducting a local analysis to help us make sense of the different features across geographical contexts, and by state,” Alexander says. The team is also building a set of statistical models that can be used to compare relationships between the CRE and measures of segregation.\n\nAlexander, who is also assistant graduate director of the Center for Applied Data Science and Analytics at Howard, notes that it’s a common mistake to view mathematics as a universal pursuit that everyone approaches in the same way. Instead, as he tells Nature’s careers team, his team members each approach data-driven problems with their own unique lens.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a mathematician?\n\nSolving problems. At some point in studying mathematics, you learn a method to solve a problem. And then, as you learn more, you realize that there are many different ways to approach a problem. That has been the impetus for my interdisciplinary work — the idea that we can ‘patchwork’ our way to solutions and think about different fields and what they offer.\n\nIs there one thing in your career that you wish you could revisit?\n\nMy knee-jerk reaction is that things have really worked out in a way that has been beautifully scary. So I'm content with my choices.\n\nCollection: Changemakers in science\nIf I could go back and change one thing, I would spend a little more time in graduate school and do more exploring. At the time, I was broke, and wanted to be done with my studies, so I rushed through; I said to myself, let me get my dissertation taken care of and then I can begin my actual academic career. But now, I think it’s all about investigating and solving problems, and as a graduate student, I didn’t do enough of that. Now I’ve found more time to just do that and learn with my students and our community members.\n\nWhat is the coolest discovery to come out of your work?\n\nWe have found some really abstract connections between mathematical fields — such as graph theory, number theory, probability, game theory — and real-world problems.\n\nThe CRE census analysis is one example of our attempts to model real-world factors by taking a numerical analytic approach initially. Our goal is to consider mathematical insights, using probability and statistics, before moving forward with a single methodological model.\n\nMathematics is often viewed as being universal, but the field of ethnomathematics reveals that mathematical practices look different across cultures, communities and their histories. For the sake of universality, we would want to steer clear of a single frame of reference or method. Indeed, what we see among mathematicians today are attempts to make sense of a diverse set of problems across a diverse set of disciplines which give attention to the different cultural foundations of mathematics. People use mathematics differently, and they have done so throughout history.\n\nOur lab’s goal is to learn how to balance a focus on deep theoretical aspects with the need to quantify things. Often when we quantify, or mathematize, things, you want to get down to their essence, to their core. We have been working hard all these years to maintain those theoretical, critical foundations that contribute to intersections between maths and society. For example, we can quantify changes in demographics over time in a specific community, such as the effects of gentrification, but we see that these processes play out differently in cities such as Atlanta and Washington DC. We want to understand those nuances in both our theory and quantification.\n\nIf he could be a graduate student again, Alexander says he would spend more time simply exploring ideas.Credit: Cheriss May for Nature\nWhy is running an inclusive research group important to you?\n\nAnyone who visits our lab understands clearly that we try to get rid of hierarchy as much as possible. So, although I’m the principal investigator, founder and leader of the lab, I think that empowering everyone in our space — other faculty members, students and also our elders — to give us that context, that intuition, has been our greatest asset. We call this a near-peer model.\n\nFor example, a younger team member might have experience of recently released computational tools, whereas a more experienced member might discuss the different tools used over the course of their lifetime.\n\nImplementing this near-peer model has been a learning process. As faculty members, we’re often told to be the expert. I’ve tried to do the opposite of that by saying, “Here’s what I’m able to contribute. What do other people think?” That has led to this explosion of ideas.\n\nI want to ensure that Africans take part in the AI revolution\nIt also opens up space for all lab members to play around with ideas in a way that is not always possible in a conventional classroom setting. This ultimately leads to a ripple effect in which conventional lines of inquiry can be supplemented by, at times, abstract inquiries that result in many more ideas. We try our best to avoid a top-down model and collect regular feedback from lab members.",

          "abstract": "The Breakthrough prize trophy’s design is inspired by imagery from science, including black holes, seashells and the structure of DNA.Credit: The Breakthrough Prizes\n\nFive scientists who contributed to the development of the blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have picked up one of this year’s US$3-million Breakthrough prizes — the most lucrative awards in science.\n\nOriginally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that controls blood sugar levels and helps to curb appetite. “This class of drugs truly saves lives, changes lives and brings joy back to people’s lives,” says Ziyad Al-Aly, a physician-scientist at the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in Missouri, who recently led a massive study analysing data from almost two million people to evaluate the effects of such medication1.\n\nThe ‘breakthrough’ obesity drugs that have stunned researchers\n\nThis life-sciences prize is shared between the four researchers who discovered and characterized GLP-1 – endocrinologist Daniel Drucker at the University of Toronto, Canada; physician-researchers Joel Habener at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts and Jens Juul Holst at the University of Copenhagen; and chemist Svetlana Mojsov at The Rockefeller University in New York City — along with Lotte Bjerre Knudsen of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsværd, Denmark, who spearheaded the development of drugs based on these discoveries2,3.\n\nIn the 1990s, Drucker and his colleagues realized that GLP-1 caused animals to eat less and lose weight. Knudsen stablized the drug by adding fatty-acid chains, enabling it to bind to proteins in the blood, which prevents it from breaking down rapidly once injected. “It’s a tremendous honour to receive this prestigious award,” says Drucker. “But the most amazing gratification is when someone comes to my office and says, ‘I lost 40 pounds [18 kg] and I feel healthy’.”\n\nEveryone’s a winner\n\nThe award is one of six Breakthrough prizes to be awarded this year in life sciences, physics and mathematics.\n\nUnusually for a major award, one of the fundamental-physics prizes was awarded to a grand total of 13,508 physicists spanning four collaborations at CERN, Europe’s particle physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland. Through experiments using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), these researchers have taken multiple precision measurements over the past decade to probe, and so far confirm, the standard model of particle physics. “We’re honoured the award was made to the entire collaboration because without all those people we could not have made these advances,” says Patricia McBride, a spokesperson for CERN’s CMS collaboration. The prize money will be used to fund international students to visit CERN, she adds.\n\nCERN’s Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, one of the collaborations whose scientists share a Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics.Credit: Harold Cunningham/Getty\n\nThe award is well deserved, says Brian Rebel, a particle physicist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. “Finding the Higgs [boson] in 2012 was a once-in-lifetime event, but it was only the first step,” Rebel says. Since then, LHC scientists have been pinning down the mass of the Higgs and its interactions, as well as discovering 72 new particles, investigating antimatter and probing the nature of the ‘quark–gluon plasma’ that existed soon after the Big Bang. “It takes a small army to create the tools to test and validate these results,” says Rebel.\n\nAnother Breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to one of the architects of the standard model, theoretical physicist Gerard ’t Hooft at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, who also won a share of the 1999 Nobel prize in physics for his work on the weak nuclear force, and contributed to understanding the strong nuclear force. “A beautiful synthesis emerges when one’s mathematics is linked to particles actually seen in the world,” says ’t Hooft, adding that he is “honoured” to win the prize.\n\nA theory of everything",

          "title": "AI is transforming peer review — and many scientists are worried",
          "authors": "Miryam Naddaf",
          "abstract": "This February, ecologist Timothée Poisot was surprised when he read through the peer reviews of a manuscript he had submitted for publication. One of the referee reports seemed to have been written with, or perhaps entirely by, artificial intelligence (AI). It contained the telltale sentence, “Here is a revised version of your review with improved clarity and structure”, a strong indication that the text was generated by large language models (LLMs).\n\nPoisot hasn’t yet told the journal editor of his suspicions; he asked that the journal involved — which bans the use of LLMs in peer reviews — not be revealed in this article.\n\nBut in a blogpost about the incident, he argued strongly against automated peer review. “I submit a manuscript for review in the hope of getting comments from my peers. If this assumption is not met, the entire social contract of peer review is gone,” wrote Poisot, who works at the University of Montreal in Canada.\n\nAI systems are already transforming peer review — sometimes with publishers’ encouragement, and at other times in violation of their rules. Publishers and researchers alike are testing out AI products to flag errors in the text, data, code and references of manuscripts, to guide reviewers toward more-constructive feedback, and to polish their prose. Some new websites even offer entire AI-created reviews with one click.\n\nBut with these innovations come concerns. Although today’s AI products are cast in the role of assistants, AI might eventually come to dominate the peer-review process, with the human reviewer’s role reduced or cut out altogether. Some enthusiasts see the automation of peer review as an inevitability — but many researchers, such as Poisot, as well as journal publishers, view it as a disaster.\n\nMy other editor is AI\n\nEven before the appearance of ChatGPT and other AI tools based on LLMs, publishers had been using a variety of AI applications to ease the peer-review process for more than half a decade — including for tasks such as checking statistics, summarizing findings and easing the selection of peer reviewers. But the advent of LLMs, which mimic fluent human writing, has changed the game.\n\nIn a survey of nearly 5,000 researchers, some 19% said they had already tried using LLMs to ‘increase the speed and ease’ of their review. But the survey, by publisher Wiley, headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey, didn’t interrogate the balance between using LLMs to touch up prose, and relying on the AI to generate the review.\n\nThree AI-powered steps to faster, smarter peer review\n\nOne study1 of peer-review reports for papers submitted to AI conferences in 2023 and 2024 found that between 7% and 17% of these reports contained signs that they had been ‘substantially modified’ by LLMs — meaning changes beyond spell-checking or minor updates to the text.\n\nMany funders and publishers currently forbid reviewers of grants or papers from using AI, citing concerns about leaking confidential information if researchers load material into chatbot websites. But if researchers host offline LLMs on their own computers, then data aren’t fed back into the cloud, says Sebastian Porsdam Mann at the University of Copenhagen, who studies the practicalities and ethics of using generative AI in research.\n\nUsing offline LLMs to rephrase one’s notes can speed up and sharpen the process of writing reviews, so long as the LLMs don’t “crank out a full review on your behalf”, wrote Dritjon Gruda, an organizational-behaviour researcher at the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon, in a Nature careers column.\n\nBut “taking superficial notes and having an LLM synthesize them falls far, far short of writing an adequate peer review”, counters Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. If reviewers start relying on AI so that they can skip most of the process of writing reviews, they risk providing shallow analysis. “Writing is thinking,” Bergstrom says.\n\nLLMs can certainly improve some reviewers’ style, says Porsdam Mann: this is unsurprising, given that some peer reviews are slapdash or poorly written. However, LLM output almost always contains errors, because the tools work by producing text that seems statistically likely on the basis of their training data and inputs — although researchers are finding ways to dampen error rates.\n\nIn many cases, the gap between humans and LLMs isn’t so great, according to a study that provided more than 300 US computational biologists and AI researchers with reviews of their own papers — some produced by human reviewers and others by GPT-4, one of the leading LLMs at the time2. Some 40% of respondents said the AI was either more helpful than the human reviews, or as helpful; and a further 42% that the AI was less helpful than many, but more helpful than some (see ‘Comparing AI and human peer review’).\n\nSource: Ref. 2\nAI that goes beyond editing\n\nThe team behind the study that compared AI and human reviews, led by James Zou, a computational biologist at Stanford University, California, is now developing a reviewer ‘feedback agent’. It evaluates human review reports against a checklist of common issues — such as vague or inappropriate feedback — and, in turn, suggests how reviewers can improve their comments.\n\nAt a publisher innovation fair in London last December, many AI developers lined up to pitch products to improve peer review that do more than mere editing. One tool, called Eliza, launched last year by the firm World Brain Scholar (WBS) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, makes suggestions to improve reviewer feedback, recommends relevant references and translates reviews written in other languages into English. The tool is not meant to replace human peer reviewers, says WBS founder Zeger Karssen. “The tool will just analyse what the peer reviewer has written down,” he says.\n\nA similar tool is Review Assistant, developed by multinational publishing-services firm Enago and Charlesworth. Initially, the tool used an LLM system to answer structured queries about a manuscript, which reviewers could then check or verify. But after talking to publishers, developers added a ‘human first’ mode, in which reviewers answer the queries and then have an AI tool look at their answers. The tool can “support reviewers to do what they may already be doing illegitimately, in a legitimate way”, says co-developer Mary Miskin, global operations director at Charlesworth, who is based in Huddersfield, UK.\n\nAnother AI approach aims to free reviewers from the laborious parts of peer review. A start-up firm called Grounded AI, in Stevenage, UK, has developed a tool called Veracity, which checks whether cited papers in manuscripts exist, and then — using an LLM — analyses whether the cited work corresponds to the author’s claims. It functions like “the workflow that a motivated, rigorous human fact checker would go through if they had all the time in the world”, says co-founder Nick Morley.\n\nWhat are the best AI tools for research? Nature’s guide\n\nAnd a host of efforts have sprung up to apply LLM-assisted tools to existing papers — from software to spot image duplications, to statistics-checking programs. But researchers have expressed concerns that LLMs can be unreliable and that some apparent errors could be false positives.\n\nOne AI review tool that’s already in trials with publishers is Alchemist Review, developed by Grounded AI and a company called Hum in Charlottesville, Virginia. The software’s creators say that it can summarize core findings and methods and assess the novelty of research, as well as validate citations. They also say that reviewers can use the tool in a secure environment that protects the confidentiality of manuscripts and authors’ intellectual property.\n\nAIP Publishing, the publishing arm of the American Institute of Physics, headquartered in Melville, New York, is piloting a version of this software in two journals, says chief transformation officer Ann Michael. Journal editors will test a prototype of the tool and, at their discretion, allow some peer reviewers to try it. However, the publisher will not test the tool’s ability to judge novelty, because internal surveys suggested editors didn’t rate that as being as helpful as other features, Michael says. “We’re trying to learn how to responsibly apply AI to peer review,” she says, emphasizing that the tool is being used before human review, not to replace it.\n\nOther publishers also told Nature that they were exploring developing in-house AI tools for peer review, but didn’t say exactly what they were working on. Wiley, for instance, is “looking into various potential use cases for AI to strengthen peer review, including at the editor and reviewer levels”, a spokesperson said.\n\nA December 2024 study of guidelines at top medical journals3 found that among large publishers, Elsevier currently bans reviewers from using generative AI or AI-assisted review, whereas Wiley and Springer Nature permit “limited use”. Both Springer Nature and Wiley require the disclosure of any use of AI to support review, and forbid online uploading of manuscripts. (Nature’s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.) The study noted that 59% of the 78 top medical journals with guidance on the matter ban AI use in peer review. The rest allow it, with varying requirements.\n\nAI-led review?\n\nThe most radical applications of AI in peer reviewing are tools that directly provide automated reviews of manuscripts. One example is Paper-Wizard, which generates full-fledged multi-page reviews when a paper is uploaded, and checks for detailed aspects of methodological designs, such as statistical rigour. Its co-creator, cognitive neuroscientist Shane Ehrhardt in Brisbane, Australia, says that it is a ‘pre-peer-review’ product, intended to help authors with their own work.",

After a long career in the Bulgarian government, including as justice minister, she took office in December.\n\nFar-right governments seek to cut billions of euros from research in Europe\n\nZaharieva’s tenure comes at a turbulent time: Europe is trying to bolster its defences against Russia and boost its lagging economic performance. Research is seen as important to achieving both goals. And the bloc’s relationship with the United States is on rocky ground. The administration of US President Donald Trump has shown open disdain for Europe. It has also begun dismantling science programmes, driving many US scientists to think about leaving. The EU, says Zaharieva, is keen to attract them.\n\nOne of the commissioner’s main jobs is to shape the successor to the EU’s €93.5-billion (US$101-billion) Horizon Europe research programme — which supports basic and applied sciences and start-ups — set to begin in 2028.\n\nThe budget and plan are expected to be decided on this year. But there’s a debate over whether the programme should be subsumed into a wider EU ‘competitiveness fund’, targeted at reviving the economy. Some scientists worry that this could switch the focus from research to meeting immediate economic needs.\n\nNature met Zaharieva in Brussels to discuss the EU’s response to attacks on US science and the future of its flagship research programme.\n\n75% of US scientists who answered Nature poll consider leaving\n\nDoes Europe want to attract disaffected US scientists?\n\nYes, very much. When you speak about science, innovation or start-ups, what moves is the talent. Europe has a big pull factor, so we are working to attract top researchers. Horizon Europe has a focus on that — we have the Marie Skłodowska–Curie Actions, a very successful programme for early-career researchers. This programme will launch another initiative, Choose Europe, which will provide top young researchers with a pathway to permanent positions. We are also working with the European Research Council to have a dedicated programme on academic chairs for top scientists. And in 2026–27, we’ll be expanding the European Research Area chair scheme, spending between €150 million and €170 million. We are also working on a visa strategy to make the process faster.\n\nLast month, several European research ministers warned that freedom of science was at risk, and urged the EU to show solidarity with affected scientists. Would you echo that warning?\n\nWe can have a grant programme to get scientists to choose Europe, but if it’s not a good place to do research, they will not come. It’s important to have the right conditions for them, but they also need to feel free to do research. Even before the new US administration, I committed to preserving academic and scientific freedom as a top priority for my mandate, and we are even going to propose legislative measures next year.\n\nA science mega-programme is taking shape in the EU: what it means for researchers",

          "abstract": "Increased tariffs on imports into the United States are affecting the global trade in laboratory supplies.Credit: Allen J. Schaben/Los Angeles Times via Getty\n\nThe Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs on all imports into the United States — which range from 10% on products from some countries up to 54% on goods from China — are increasing the costs of labware and specialist scientific instruments in the country. The price increases come as research budgets for US laboratories are stretched thin by unprecedented grant cancellations and cuts to university funding introduced since Donald Trump’s second presidency began in January.\n\n“We’re already doing quotes today that are 20% more than they were yesterday,” says Drew Kevorkian, chief executive of ARES Scientific in Miami Beach, Florida, which supplies research equipment to scientific laboratories, including those at many universities. “I think almost everybody is going to see a price increase of some sort.”\n\nThe latest round of tariffs comes into effect on 5 April for all countries, to be followed by steeper hikes for some on 9 April. It represents “systemic changes to the cost structure of doing science — and they’re landing at a time when research institutions are already under acute financial stress”, says Tinglong Dai, who researches global supply chains and health care at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “This isn’t just about belt-tightening. It could be the last straw — and risks causing lasting damage.”\n\nSource: TrendEconomy\n\nThe United States imports billions of dollars’ worth of lab equipment and reagents each year, says Dai (see ‘Global trade in reagents’). Many of these products come from countries about to be hit by tariff rises, including China, Switzerland, Japan, the United Kingdom and European Union countries; others come from Mexico and Canada, on which the Trump administration imposed tariffs earlier this year.\n\nAnnouncing the latest tariffs on 2 April, Trump said they will save the United States from a “national emergency”, boost a hollowed-out manufacturing base and reduce the country’s dependence on “foreign adversaries”. The news prompted global financial turmoil: stocks tumbled, and the International Monetary Fund is warning of a significant risk to the global economy.\n\nMicroscopes, glassware, DNA sequencers\n\nResearchers told Nature that the prices of many scientific products could be affected.\n\nChina supplies basic lab equipment, such as glass tubes, and reagents to the United States, they say, as well as advanced electronic equipment including computer chips, liquid-crystal displays and incubators. Germany (whose imports, like those from the rest of the EU, will be hit with a 20% tariff) and Japan (24%) supply high-end lab instruments such as microscopes or precision analytical devices, whereas Switzerland (32%) and the United Kingdom (10%) are major exporters of diagnostic tools, antibodies and specialty chemicals. Mexico supplies plasticware and Canada provides specialized equipment including DNA sequencers and cell counters. Sterilizers, centrifuges and glassware washers used in US labs often come from Europe.\n\n‘Does anyone have any of these?’: Lab-supply shortages strike amid global pandemic\n\n“These aren’t luxury items,” says Dai. “They’re the core infrastructure of modern science.”\n\nMikhail Kats, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, says it’s not clear how tariffs will apply to items already budgeted for in a grant. “Do we budget the price or the price with the tariff?” he asks.\n\nKevorkian says around 60% of the products his company supplies are made in the United States, and 40% are imported. But even US-made products often rely on imported components. “A DNA sequencer built in California might still depend on optics from Germany and semiconductors from China,” says Dai.\n\nSwitching to US-based suppliers doesn’t always reduce costs, says Kevorkian. “Believe it or not, some of the products that we’re buying overseas, even when you put the tariffs on them, they’re still less expensive than buying them from the US.”\n\nSupply-chain complexity",

Instead of looking directly at it, I focus on the star’s glow reflecting off my slippers. My eyes glitter with the brain-fireworks of looking at something so bright. Beautiful, yes, but let’s not wax poetical before coffee. I avoid looking at the one non-glowing thing: Blue Terra. In three hours, I’ll dock, log in at the Bureau for my nine-to-five and hang space up on a hook.\n\nAnd see Mom.\n\nCan’t think about that. I wander to the upper-deck garden pool, kick my feet in the water and run my fingers through poolside violets.\n\nEven though it’s only me here, my ship is vast. Rooms upon rooms, decks upon decks.

That girl’s a sailor in a spacesuit. Her visual cognitive surroundings are turned off, so to me she’s just a girl floating through space, asking me why I ghosted her.\n\n“Wait.” I see the reflection of her hands moving. “Are you knitting?”\n\nShe shrugs. “I need a new sweater before winter.”\n\nI raise a brow. Our suits regulate any desired temperature, but Rose likes to experience the seasons. It’s up a degree or five in summer and down to about 18 cels in winter per the Northern Terrestrial calendar. I admire her commitment to tradition.\n\n“I’m about to dock at Blue Terra,” I say.\n\nHer fingers go still.\n\nI see her worry, but I’m a pro at avoidance, so I scroll through a sensory playlist on my wrist controls. It starts with Beyoncé and wafts of banana bread. I pixelate the song and scent through receptors so Rose can experience the same thing. It’s the way we talk without talking.\n\nI tap the up-arrow on the banana bread scent as I slide past the planet Kranio Five. Rose purses her lips; she doesn’t approve of my avoidance tactics. Well, I don’t approve of her ambivalence to the smell of banana bread.\n\nRose was there for me, in cadet school, when it all happened with Dad. His big discovery in space travel, then cancer discovering, devouring him before he himself could even kiss the opposite side of the sky.\n\nEver since then, for me, life on solid ground feels like dying.

Between 14,500 and 5,000 years ago, the area was unrecognizable, transformed into a lush savannah by an unusually wet interval called the African Humid Period. People roamed this green landscape for thousands of years before it was again lost to sand.\n\nFrom Vikings to Beethoven: what your DNA says about your ancient relatives\n\nAncient DNA extracted from two women who died in what is now Libya around 7,000 years ago is now helping researchers to reconstruct the origins of these early Saharans. The women’s DNA profiles, described in a study published on 2 April in Nature1, represent the first full Saharan genomes from the African Humid Period — and reveal that the people were remarkably isolated from other African populations.\n\n“The prehistory of North Africa is a big puzzle, and we only have a few pieces available,” says Rosa Fregel, a geneticist at the University of La Laguna in San Cristobal, Spain, who was not involved in the research. The work is “a significant contribution to the palaeogenomics of North Africa”, she says.\n\nPrecious genomes\n\nAncient genomes from North Africa are hard to come by. Almost all palaeogenetic work is concentrated in Europe and Asia. Ancient DNA is especially rare in the Sahara, where high temperatures and strong ultraviolet light quickly degrade genetic material in remains.\n\nThe Takarkori rock shelter in Libya, where the remains were unearthed.Credit: University of Rome La Sapienza\n\nThat’s why it’s important to explore sites that are protected from the elements, says Nada Salem, an archaeologist at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nOne such site is the Takarkori rock shelter in southwestern Libya. Between 2003 and 2007, archaeologists uncovered the remains of 15 people who were buried between 8,900 and 4,800 years ago at Takarkori. Two of the corpses — both belonging to women who lived between 7,000 and 6,000 years ago — had naturally mummified.\n\nArchaeological evidence at the site suggested that the Takarkori women belonged to a group of herders who appeared in the region around 8,000 years ago. This marked a major transition in the way of life of early Saharans, who had previously all been hunter-gatherers. Some researchers have suggested that Saharans learnt herding by intermarrying with people who were migrating into North Africa from the Levant.\n\nTo test this, Salem and her colleagues sequenced the Takarkori genomes and compared the DNA to that of around 800 modern humans and 117 ancient genomes from around Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East. The team found that the Takarkori women had only small traces of Levant ancestry — suggesting that any intermingling had happened long before the advent of herding in the region.\n\nWhat’s more, the analysis struggled to connect these early Saharans to any other ancient group. “This was puzzling for us. How is it that this lineage has not spread either to the east or the west or to the south?” says Salem.",

But scenarios for how to fund the machine will be presented at a later date.\n\nThe European particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, has not yet officially decided whether to endorse the 91-kilometre Future Circular Collider (FCC) project or other options for new colliders, but the study will feed into a review of CERN’s long-term strategy, due to conclude next year.\n\n“This study is the result of an immense amount of work carried out by the international FCC collaboration,” said Fabiola Gianotti, CERN’s director-general, in a presentation to reporters. “If approved and implemented, the FCC could become the most extraordinary instrument ever built by humanity to study the laws of nature at the most fundamental level.”\n\nGrand designs\n\nThe three-volume feasibility study, to which around 1,500 physicists and engineers contributed, estimates that it would cost 15.3 billion Swiss francs (US$17.4 billion) to dig the 91-kilometre-long circular tunnel and build a machine to smash together electrons and their antiparticles, positrons, by the mid-2040s. This would enable high-precision studies of the Higgs boson and other known particles.\n\nThe biggest machine in science: inside the fight to build the next giant particle collider\n\nA second stage of the project — which would reuse the tunnel and collide two beams of protons, as in the LHC — would not come online until 2072 at the earliest, and would cost 18.8 billion Swiss francs to build. That estimate is based on the assumption that the proton collider will operate at 85 teraelectronvolts (TeV) — an energy six times higher than the LHC, but lower than the 100 TeV that was proposed initially. Gianotti told reporters that this was a conservative assumption based on using the high-field superconducting magnets — needed to steer protons around the ring — that are available today. Ongoing research on advanced superconducting materials could put higher energies within reach, perhaps even 120 TeV.\n\nCERN Council president Konstantinos Fountas told reporters that the study will provide “very solid ground” to enable the council to come to a well-informed decision on whether to go ahead with the project. Antonio Zoccoli, president of Italy’s National Institute of Nuclear Physics and one of country’s delegates to the council, agrees, saying that the group has done “very solid work” on the technical design and cost estimates.",

          "abstract": "Top AI models’ performance is improving quickly, and the competition between them is growing ever fiercer.Credit: Adapted from Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) race is heating up: the number and quality of high-performing Chinese AI models is rising to challenge the US lead, and the performance edge between top models is shrinking, according to an annual state of the industry report.\n\nThe report highlights that as AI continues to improve quickly, no one firm is pulling ahead. On the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, which asks users to vote on the performance of various bots, the top-ranked model scored about 12% higher than the tenth-ranked model in early 2024, but only 5% higher in early 2025 (see ‘All together now’). “The frontier is increasingly competitive — and increasingly crowded,” the report says.\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025 was released today by the Institute for Human Centered AI at Stanford University in California.\n\nSource: AI Index Report 2025\n\nThe index shows that notable generative AI models are, on average, still getting bigger, by using more decision-making variables, more computing power and bigger training data sets. But developers are also proving that smaller, sleeker models are capable of great things. Thanks to better algorithms, a modern model can now match the performance that could be achieved by a model 100 times larger two years ago. “2024 was a breakthrough year for smaller AI models,” the index says.\n\nBart Selman, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who was not involved in writing the Index report, says it’s good to see relatively small, cheap efforts such as China’s DeepSeek proving they can be competitive. “I’m predicting we’ll see some individual teams with five people, two people, that come up with some new algorithmic ideas that will shake things up,” he says. “Which is all good. We don’t want the world just to be run by some big companies.”\n\nNeck and neck\n\nThe report shows that the vast majority of notable AI models are now developed by industry rather than academia: a reversal of the situation in the early 2000s, when neural nets and generative AI had not yet taken off. Industry produced fewer than 20% of notable AI models before 2006, but 60% of them in 2023 and nearly 90% in 2024, the report says.\n\nThe United States continues to be the top producer of notable models, releasing 40 in 2024, compared with China’s 15 and Europe’s 3. But plenty of other regions are joining the race, including the Middle East, Latin America and southeast Asia.\n\nMeta AI creates speech-to-speech translator that works in dozens of languages\n\nAnd the previous US lead in terms of model quality has disappeared, the report adds. China, which produces the most AI publications and patents, is now developing models that match their US competition in performance. In 2023, the leading Chinese models lagged behind the top US model by nearly 20 percentage points on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding test (MMLU), a common benchmark for large language models. However, as of the end of 2024, the US lead had shrunk to 0.3 percentage points.\n\n“Around 2015, China put itself on the path to be a top player in AI, and they did it through investments in education,” says Selman. “We’re seeing that’s starting to pay off.”\n\nThe field has also seen a surprising surge in the number and performance of ‘open weight’ models such as DeepSeek and Facebook’s LLaMa. Users can freely view the parameters that these models learn during training and use to make predictions, although other details, such as the training code, might remain secret. Originally, closed systems, in which none of these factors are disclosed, were markedly superior, but the performance gap between top contenders in these categories narrowed to 8% in early 2024, and to just 1.7% in early 2025.\n\n“It’s certainly good for anyone who can’t afford to build a model from scratch, which is a lot of little companies and academics,” says Ray Perrault, a computer scientist at SRI, a non-profit research institute in Menlo Park, California, and co-director of the report. OpenAI in San Francisco, California, which developed the chatbot ChatGPT, plans to release an open-weight model in the next few months.\n\nBetter, smaller, cheaper",

          "authors": "Celeste Biever",
          "abstract": "Minecraft is among the world’s most popular video games and has 100 million monthly active users.Credit: Mojang Studios\n\nAn artificial intelligence (AI) system has for the first time figured out how to collect diamonds in the hugely popular video game Minecraft — a difficult task requiring multiple steps — without being shown how to play. Its creators say the system, called Dreamer, is a step towards machines that can generalize knowledge learn in one domain to new situations, a major goal of AI.\n\n“Dreamer marks a significant step towards general AI systems,” says Danijar Hafner, a computer scientist at Google DeepMind in San Francisco, California. “It allows AI to understand its physical environment and also to self-improve over time, without a human having to tell it exactly what to do.” Hafner and his colleagues describe Dreamer in a study in Nature published on 2 April1.\n\nIn Minecraft, players explore a virtual 3D world containing a variety of terrains, including forests, mountains, deserts and swamps. Players use the world’s resources to create objects, such as chests, fences and swords — and collect items, among the most prized of which are diamonds.\n\nImportantly, says Hafner, no two experiences are the same. “Every time you play Minecraft, it’s a new, randomly generated world,” he says. This makes it useful for challenging an AI system that researchers want to be able to generalize from one situation to the next. “You have to really understand what’s in front of you; you can’t just memorize a specific strategy,” he says.\n\nDiamonds are among Minecraft’s most prized rewards — but finding them takes a series of complex steps.Credit: Mojang Studios\n\nCollecting a diamond is “a very hard task”, says computer scientist Jeff Clune at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who was part of a separate team that trained a program to find diamonds using videos of human play2. “There is no question this represents a major step forward for the field.”\n\nDiamonds are forever\n\nAI researchers have focused on finding diamonds, says Hafner, because it requires a series of complicated steps, including finding trees and breaking them down to gather wood, which players can use to build a crafting table.\n\nAI takes on popular Minecraft game in machine-learning contest\n\nThis, together with more wood, can be used to make a wooden pickaxe — and so on, until players have assembled the correct tools to collect a diamond, which is buried deep underground. “There’s a long chain of these milestones, and so, it requires very deep exploration,” he says.\n\nPrevious attempts to get AI systems to collect diamonds relied on using videos of human play2 or researchers leading systems through the steps.\n\nBy contrast, Dreamer explores everything about the game on its own, using a trial-and-error technique called reinforcement learning — it identifies actions that are likely to beget rewards, repeats them and discards others. Reinforcement learning underpins some major advances in AI. But previous programs were specialists — they could not apply knowledge in new domains from scratch.\n\nDeepMind’s Dreamer AI played repeated runs in Minecraft to learn how to collect diamonds.Courtesy of Danijar Hafner\nBuild me a world model\n\nKey to Dreamer’s success, says Hafner, is that it builds a model of its surroundings and uses this ‘world model’ to ‘imagine’ future scenarios and guide decision-making. Rather like our own abstract thoughts, the world model is not an exact replica of its surroundings. But it allows the Dreamer agent to try things out and predict the potential rewards of different actions using less computation than would be needed to complete those actions in Minecraft. “The world model really equips the AI system with the ability to imagine the future,” says Hafner.\n\nThis ability could also help to create robots that can learn to interact in the real world — where the costs of trial and error are much higher than in a video game, says Hafner.\n\nTesting Dreamer on the diamond challenge was an afterthought. “We built this whole algorithm without that in mind,” says Hafner. But it occurred to the team that it was the ideal way to test whether its algorithm could work, out of the box, on an unfamiliar task.\n\nThe Minecraft virtual world consists of multiple different terrains, from swamps and deserts to farms and villages.Credit: Mojang Studios",

The existence of enantiomers is a headache for the pharmaceutical industry because these isomers can have vastly different biological effects, necessitating the scrupulous separation of enantiomers of drugs. Writing in Nature, Zhong et al.1 report light-activated catalysts that convert one-to-one mixtures of enantiomers (racemic mixtures) of compounds known as alkyl halides directly into a single enantiomer.

          "authors": "Rabah Arezki",
          "abstract": "The race of superpowers to regulate access to ‘critical minerals’ — such as cobalt, copper, lithium and rare-earth elements — poses enormous challenges to global stability. These minerals are crucial ingredients in batteries, electronics, solar panels and computer chips. And demand for them is soaring: it will more than quadruple by 2040 for clean-energy technologies alone (see go.nature.com/3zHuGNm). The United States, China and Europe are taking drastic steps to secure their supplies. In January, US President Donald Trump issued executive orders to promote domestic mining and processing of these essential minerals, as he did during his first term and as his predecessor, Joe Biden, did, too. Trump has even offered to buy mineral-rich Greenland, to the dismay of Denmark, of which the island is a territory. And he is calling on Ukraine to relinquish a large chunk of its critical minerals to the United States as part of a peace deal with Russia.\n\nMeanwhile, in December, China restricted exports of critical minerals to the United States after the latter blocked the transfer of chips to the former. China controls the supply chains, including the processing, of most critical minerals and is heavily invested in mining throughout Africa, Latin America and Central Asia. The United States and the European Union have tried to challenge China’s monopoly by securing their own mining contracts, including in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru.\n\nRisks of conflict, violence and crimes over these materials are growing. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, conflicts have erupted in mineral-rich provinces such as Haut-Katanga and Nord-Kivu. These are being fuelled by neighbouring countries, such as Rwanda and Uganda, which are encouraging the smuggling of minerals across borders to enrich themselves. Illicit artisanal mining — small-scale operations with minimal equipment — is on the rise and has produced a tug of war between the authorities and citizens to claw these materials out of the ground.\n\nHow to build a circular economy for rare-earth elements\n\nThis race is increasingly causing damage to health, society and the environment. And the weak enforcement of environmental and social standards in low-income nations rich in critical minerals is concerning. Extraction is often associated with deforestation, biodiversity loss, water pollution and child labour.\n\nA debate is raging over whether to boycott critical minerals mined in conflict zones and where people are forced into labour. But such boycotts alone are unlikely to sway governments to do right by their citizens. Nations and multinational corporations must push for change.\n\nThat won’t be easy at a time when many countries are switching their priorities away from global public goods and towards domestic ones. Instead of focusing on issues such as global stability, climate and the environment, they are boosting jobs at home and reshoring key industries, for instance. By issuing a flurry of tariffs, the Trump administration has unleashed a global trade war. After Trump’s order to freeze the work of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and to review US engagement in international organizations, the future of these agencies seems bleak. But such organizations should stand firm.\n\nTo confront these challenges, the global community must find better ways to produce public goods that are essential for people’s well-being. This means taking a bottom-up, rather than top-down, approach by amplifying the work and voices of local organizations and civil society. For instance, communities involved in critical-mineral extraction worldwide could be mobilized to shape local practices as well as environmental and social mining standards. They could be helped by non-governmental organizations, including law firms, who are pushing for more-responsible mining.",

          "authors": "Mohamed Ibrahim",
          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is beginning to transform many industries, yet its use to improve public services remains limited globally. AI-based tools could streamline access to government benefits through online chatbots or automate systems by which citizens report problems such as potholes.\n\nCurrently, scholarly advances in AI are mostly confined to academic papers and conferences, rarely translating into actionable government policies or products. This means that the expertise at universities is not used to solve real-world problems. As a No10 Innovation Fellow with the UK government and a lecturer in spatial data science, I have explored the potential of AI-driven rapid prototyping in public policy.\n\nTake Street.AI, a prototype smartphone app that I developed, which lets citizens report issues including potholes, street violence or illegal litter dumping by simply taking a picture through the app. The AI model classifies the problem automatically and alerts the relevant local authority, passing on the location and details of the issue. A key feature of the app is its on-device processing, which ensures privacy and reduces operational costs. Similar tools were tested as an early-warning system during the riots that swept the United Kingdom in July and August 2024.\n\nAI models can also aid complex decision-making — for instance, that involved in determining where to build houses. The UK government plans to construct 1.5 million homes in the next 5 years, but planning laws require that several parameters be considered — such as proximity to schools, noise levels, the neighbourhoods’ built-up ratio and flood risk. The current strategy is to compile voluminous academic reports on viable locations, but an online dashboard powered by AI that can optimize across parameters would be much more useful to policymakers.\n\nHow to track the economic impact of public investments in AI\n\nThis is the key insight from my stint in government: public officials are often interested in deliverable products or demonstrable solutions, whereas academics are trained to funnel new knowledge into papers. Existing mechanisms to bring academic expertise into government, such as secondment opportunities and exchange programmes, do not adequately address the factors that limit collaboration. A more effective approach would be to frame research in practical, solution-oriented terms.\n\nThere are several measures that could strengthen collaboration between academia and public institutions, particularly in emerging domains such as AI, to enhance the delivery of public services.\n\nAcademics can ease into a product-focused mindset through prototyping, where the risk is low. The aim is to go beyond conventional research-dissemination practices to ensure that findings are accessible and can be applied in government settings. This involves translating complex data, models and insights into user-friendly digital tools. For instance, imagine that a university research team has developed an AI model capable of predicting which areas are at high risk of flooding. As well as publishing the findings in academic journals, the team could create a digital tool — an interactive platform — to display the AI insights for government officials in a way that makes them actionable.",

          "title": "AI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool",
          "authors": "Amanda Heidt",
          "abstract": "When Mohammed Shafi, a PhD student in civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, first saw his friends testing out artificial intelligence (AI) tools back in late 2022, he didn’t immediately see the appeal. Mostly, people seemed to be using generative AI platforms such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a replacement for Google, or as a novelty for drumming up ideas for practical jokes and pet names. “They were fun to play around with, but I didn’t necessarily sense any relevance to my own coursework or my research,” he says.\n\nHe quickly came around, however, when he started seeing more AI tools being built to meet the needs of students and scientists. Now a daily user of AI, Shafi has pieced together an entire pipeline of AI-powered platforms that feed into one another. These update him on new research, break down complex topics, troubleshoot experiments, organize his writing and citations, and help him to navigate the demands of classes and research.\n\nShafi now says that the arrival of AI has been “a revolution for research”, a sentiment seemingly shared by others. Surveys show that many university students and scientists are using AI in their work, often on a weekly or even daily basis. And whereas many educators and academic institutions initially responded with wariness, academia seems increasingly willing to allow students to use AI, albeit in controlled ways. Although it wouldn’t be impossible to go back to the way he did things before, Shafi says, “it’s hard to imagine wanting to”.\n\nHere, Nature explores how academics and students can harness AI to streamline various parts of the research process.\n\nSharpen your literature review\n\nDaniel Weld, chief scientist at the academic search engine Semantic Scholar, who is based in Seattle, Washington, says that many popular AI platforms have “advanced enormously” in an area called active learning — a method that mimics how a person would approach a research question. Programs such as Google’s Gemini Deep Research and OpenAI’s Deep Research offer the most powerful tools in this regard, and many companies are launching similar products.\n\nStudents can enter a query, supported by their own data or documents, and then step away as these advanced models conduct in-depth searches over 30 minutes or so. The final report might include text, figures and visualizations, and all output is thoroughly referenced — another jump over past iterations, says Isa Fulford, a technical staff researcher at OpenAI in San Francisco, California, who helped to develop Deep Research. “Especially in the context of scientific research, we recognize that veracity is critical, and we think this model is better at including the proper citations than any other model we’ve released,” she says.\n\nChuck Downing, a PhD student in accounting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, says that these deep-research tools have been especially useful when digging into unfamiliar topics. During one project, Downing used OpenAI’s Deep Research to create a report ranking various approaches for reducing emissions at manufacturing plants. “I didn’t know much going in, but I learnt quite a bit, and so I use these deep dives all the time now,” he says. “It’s better than anything else I’ve used so far at finding good papers and in presenting the information in a way that I can easily understand.”\n\nOther programs enable students to delve more deeply into a single document or small collection of papers. The student-focused AI platform SciSpace , for example, has a ‘Chat with PDF’ function. Users can upload a paper and ask questions about its content — a feature shared by other platforms, such as Claude, NotebookLM and PDF.ai.\n\nFor David Tompkins, a PhD student in human development at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, this approach has helped him to stay on top of the burgeoning scientific literature. Tompkins often goes to journal-club meetings having used Claude to generate a summary of a chosen paper, which he then follows up with more-targeted questions based on the group’s discussion. “I’m still a big believer in actually reading papers to fully understand them, but it’s become much easier to do my prep when I’m feeling stretched,” he says. “In some ways, I feel I’m engaging more with the material through these tools than I did before them.”\n\nCreate your hypothesis\n\nThe ability of AI to pull together many threads of information has seemingly made it easier to identify research gaps and connect ideas — although a recent survey suggests that an over-reliance on generative AI could dampen a person’s critical-thinking skills. Weld, who is also an AI researcher at the Allen Institute for AI in Seattle, says there has been so much demand for tools that assist with ideation that he and his team are developing hypothesis-generation and detection products that attempt to combine ideas across papers into something new. “We have them running internally, but we’re trying to make sure that they’re working robustly,” he says, adding that his Allen Institute group hopes to release them publicly in the next few months.\n\nShafi turned to programs such as the visualization tool Research Rabbit when working on his dissertation, which focuses on how microplastics are transported through soil and into groundwater. Research Rabbit takes a single ‘seed paper’ and generates an interconnected web of research linked by topic, author, methodology or other key features. By piping its results into a chatbot such as ChatGPT, “it’s possible to query the body of work for hidden links or new ideas”, Shafi says.\n\nMaría Mercedes Hincapié-Otero.Credit: Jayson J. Ricamara\n\nAI-powered programs are also proving increasingly capable as experimental assistants. As a PhD student at MIT, Zhichu Ren created the software Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientist (CRESt), which combines several AI technologies into an enhanced chatbot (Z. Ren et al. Preprint at ChemRxiv https://doi.org/pdwv; 2023). Users can chat with CRESt as they would with a colleague, and it can help to craft and run experiments by retrieving and analysing data, turning equipment on and off using digital switches, powering robotic arms, documenting findings and alerting scientists by e-mail when issues arise or protocols end. In a 2023 conference paper, CRESt assisted researchers by prioritizing candidate alloys for a new fuel cell, and suggested experiments that the group might run to test them. “I wanted to create a tool that can continue to help even as your needs change,” says Ren, who now works at the AI start-up firm Labig in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “AI can do that in a way that static, written documentation cannot.”\n\nBut even for students who do not have access to something as advanced as CRESt, AI can still function as a helpful colleague. Gemini Deep Research, for example, can generate a “personalized multi-point research plan” among other features, and resources such as Scite and Elicit are billed as research assistants. Users can give these programs a handful of papers or a working hypothesis, for example, and ask for a set of experiments to test the theory.\n\nJoseph Fernandez, a PhD student in biomedical engineering at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, says he continues to use ChatGPT for most things, including troubleshooting his experiments. In the past, the bot has helped him to brainstorm explanations when one of his assays was returning unusual values, and to calculate serial dilutions to avoid wasting expensive reagents. ChatGPT has also served as a stand-in for his committee, generating pointed questions to test his research proposal before his exams.\n\n“I think you’re really only limited by your imagination, even if some uses are more mundane than others,” he says. “Nowadays, if a question or task pops into my mind, I’m generally wondering if ChatGPT can help with it.”\n\nStreamline your statistics\n\nCode editors including GitHub’s Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer (now Amazon Q Developer) and Anysphere’s Cursor aim to make it easy for beginners to use coding to organize data, create analysis pipelines, run descriptive statistics and generate visualizations. Such tools, researchers note, have also largely overtaken websites such as GitHub and Stack Exchange as the main resources for troubleshooting. Rather than spending hours looking for answers, users can simply highlight a section of code and ask a chatbot to fix it, Downing says.\n\n“Thinking about what a PhD student primarily does, the largest tasks are increasingly coding and data analysis, at least for computational fields, so anything that helps there is just disproportionately useful,” he says. Although he already considered himself an adequate coder, he says that his preferred tool, Cursor, has made him better by removing the more tedious aspects and making it easier to probe specific aspects of a data set. Instead of spending all of his time debugging (cleaning the code), he says, he is “putting more effort into really getting to know the underlying data and engaging with my code in ways that help me learn. If I get curious about something, it’s very easy to generate descriptive statistics, something like a chart.”\n\nTompkins has likewise found tools such as Claude to be essential for writing code for compelling, dynamic visualizations. Creating a good graph, particularly if it’s interactive, can require hundreds of lines of code, and Tompkins says that, in the past, that level of effort had put him off. “But once I started using Claude, I was able to have it write out those literal hundreds of lines of code,” he says. The resulting visualizations have gone a long way towards helping others to understand his research, which describes how small changes in the way in which people experience information can drive their reactions to it.\n\nResearcher Zhichu Ren created an AI-based system called CRESt to run experiments.Credit: Jason Sparapani/MIT Department of Materials Science and Engineering\n\nHe adds, however, that he still always writes his own code for statistical analyses: “I want to make sure that whatever I’m reporting is something that I fully understand and can stand behind when I submit a paper.”\n\nThese AI programs focus on generating new code, but Gaurav Ragtah, who founded a platform called CatalyzeX, saw an opportunity to repurpose existing code. If researchers write a new analysis pipeline for each experiment, for example, it can make it more challenging for others to reproduce their work, particularly if the documentation is poor or a developer stops updating their code. Instead, Ragtah, who is based in San Francisco, wanted to make it easier to locate and share code that others have published. CatalyzeX uses a web platform and browser extension to flag open-source code shared in papers indexed on websites such as Google Scholar or PubMed, and researchers can search for code through the platform using keywords. Someone interested in using machine learning to aid in cancer detection, for example, could search for a modified data-processing pipeline that helps to address the fact that publicly available data often involve small sample sizes.\n\n“As amazing as some of these code generators are, we don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time when there are excellent examples of what you’re trying to do,” Ragtah says. “Open source keeps people from having to start from scratch and gives them a scaffold on which to build and improve, while making research more easily comparable.”",

          "authors": "Heidi Ledford, Max Kozlov",
          "abstract": "Long COVID advocates attend a budget hearing in the US Senate.Credit: Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty\n\nLong COVID advocates and researchers in the United States have done the extraordinary. After a bruising battle, they managed to revive some of the research grants cancelled by the administration of President Donald Trump ― a rare victory for science as Trump’s team slashes funding and fires federal scientific staff.\n\nThe crisis began in late March, when the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) terminated the funding for dozens of long-COVID projects. Activists and researchers – including many with long COVID — began a dogged advocacy campaign, including an eleventh-hour effort to sway a sympathetic member of Congress to intervene, according to an employee of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the NIH. (The employee requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.) Within days, the cuts had been reversed.\n\nBut the administration’s termination of an array of infectious-diseases research suggests a rocky path ahead for long-COVID research. Now activists and scientists are both anxious and hopeful as they brace themselves for the potential of future cuts to federal support.\n\n“The long COVID patient community is reeling and flabbergasted by what they’re seeing,” says Emily Taylor, president of the Solve ME/CFS Initiative and based in Glendale, California. “We’ve been telling congresspeople, ‘Stop cutting, first thing. Stop hurting us. Stop the pain.’”\n\nThe HHS, which includes the NIH and other health agencies, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLong COVID’s reach\n\nOver the past two months, US President Donald Trump’s new administration has cancelled or delayed thousands of biomedical research grants, including those for research on COVID-19.\n\nWhen asked about the COVID-19 cuts, a spokesperson for HHS told Nature on 26 March, “HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”\n\nThat response appalled some long COVID advocates and researchers. “It’s totally shocking and really incorrect,” says Serena Spudich, an infectious disease neuroscientist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “The aftermath of the COVID pandemic is absolutely affecting millions of people, the economy, people’s ability to work and attend school.” A 2024 study estimated that 11 million people in the United States currently have long COVID, and that the condition costs the country more than $152.6 billion in lost work hours each year.\n\nClosed doors\n\nHHS is run by longtime anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr, who said during his confirmation hearing on 29 January that he’d commit to funding long COVID research. That gave Ian Simon, who was at the time the director of HHS’s Office of Long COVID Research and Practice, a “glimmer of hope”, he says, because it seemed “a full-throated endorsement of serious government action.” But the grant cancellations “make me question what a full-throated endorsement in front of Congress means these days”.\n\nLong COVID still has no cure — so these patients are turning to research\n\nUnder Kennedy, the HHS shuttered its long COVID office and laid off Simon and another employee in the office. An executive order signed by Trump dismantled the only federal advisory committee on long COVID, and the US Department of Labor stripped mention of long COVID from its websites.\n\nThe NIH cut not only research on long COVID but also other work that could affect people with the condition. For example, the NIH has terminated several disability studies, says David Putrino, a physical therapist and neuroscientist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Many people with severe long COVID live with disabilities.\n\nDespite this, some advocates had hoped that a US$1.8 billion NIH long COVID research initiative, called RECOVER, might be safe because Congress had funded the programme directly in 2020.\n\nThen, in late March, the NIH cancelled a wave of RECOVER grants. “We were completely shocked,” says Megan Fitzgerald, a neuroscientist in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who has long COVID and works with the advocacy group Patient-Led Research Collaborative. “And that’s when we started mobilizing.”\n\nWasted investment\n\nFitzgerald’s detective work revealed dozens of cancelled projects, most of them studies of either the biology underlying long COVID, or of long COVID in children. The loss of the paediatric studies would have been particularly painful, says Fitzgerald, because the study of long COVID in children has lagged research in adults.\n\nThe biology studies included a project on dysautonomia, a condition sometimes seen in people with long COVID that affects the body’s ability to control heart rate and blood pressure. Another terminated project aimed to characterize antibodies made against the body’s own proteins. Such “autoantibodies” are thought to contribute to some cases of long COVID and could become targets for medicines to treat the condition.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal",

          "title": "How to get rid of toxic ‘forever chemical’ pollution",
          "authors": "XiaoZhi Lim",
          "abstract": "This February, 14 lorries set out from Wilmington, North Carolina, with a toxic cargo: more than 150 tonnes of grit-like carbon that had soaked up harmful chemicals from the city’s drinking water.\n\nThe lorries took the carbon to one of the closest available ‘reactivation’ kilns, 1,200 kilometres north in Buffalo, New York. There, temperatures of nearly 1,000 °C burnt off the chemicals, breaking them into simple gas molecules, which were later turned into minerals. This month, the refreshed carbon will ride the lorries back down south.\n\nThe manager of Wilmington’s drinking-water plant, Benjamin Kearns, says he checks the weather forecast for Buffalo all winter — fearing disruptions to his water-purifying operations, which depend on a carefully timed supply of fresh carbon every month. “If there’s a snowstorm, I am concerned,” he says.\n\nThe carbon, technically called granular activated carbon (GAC), is at the heart of a US$43-million system that began operating in 2022 to rid Wilmington’s drinking water of PFASs, or per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances. These synthetic chemicals now pervade the world — they’re used to make computer chips, lithium-ion batteries, medical devices, stain-resistant textiles and smudge-proof coatings, among many other products — and some of them endanger human health. Also known as forever chemicals, they resist natural destruction because of their strong carbon–fluorine bonds.\n\nKearns’s plant is in the vanguard of an almighty remediation effort. In April 2024, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put strict nationwide limits on the concentrations of six PFASs in drinking water. The agency estimates that the rule will reduce PFAS exposure for around 100 million US residents.\n\nHow best to get rid of PFASs is now a multibillion-dollar question. The EPA estimated that US utilities might have to spend up to $1.5 billion annually for treatment systems; an industry group that is suing the agency argues that costs could be up to $48 billion over the next 5 years. Utilities must have systems in place by 2029.\n\nEuropean nations have rules restricting PFAS levels in drinking water, too. European Union rules take effect from 2026, but allow higher concentrations than the EPA does; however, countries such as Denmark and Germany have set stricter limits.\n\nThe concern and the expectation of a booming market for cleaning up PFAS pollution has sparked a rush for better ways to capture and destroy forever chemicals. Although GAC does work — it is a porous material (or sorbent) that can trap and house pollutants — it doesn’t capture all PFASs equally well. Trucking carbon around so that the collected PFASs can be destroyed in reactivation kilns also exacerbates climate change, adds Frank Leibfarth, a polymer chemist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nDrinking water is filtered through nearly 4 metres of granular activated carbon in huge tanks at the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant.Credit: Cape Fear Public Utility Authority\n\nAnd although the EPA has focused on drinking water, scientists want to stop PFASs from ever reaching the water by removing them from other environmental sources. The industrial facilities that produce and use PFASs, ranging from fluorochemical manufacturers to paper and textile mills, often send their waste to municipal wastewater (sewage treatment) plants. But these aren’t usually equipped to remove PFASs, so their outflow adds forever chemicals into rivers. From there, the PFASs can reach drinking water directly or do so indirectly by infiltrating soils.\n\nThe sludge that is left over from sewage treatment also accumulates PFASs. In some parts of the world, this nutrient-rich sludge, known as biosolids, has been spread onto farmland as fertilizer. In states such as Maine, farms that yield PFAS-tainted food have shut down. And a type of fire-fighting foam that is formulated with PFASs has contaminated soils and seeped into groundwater around military bases and airports worldwide, because of its frequent past use in fire-training exercises there.\n\nWith looming deadlines, academic researchers and companies are developing methods to gather and destroy PFASs from these sources. “Loads of evolving techniques are out there,” says PFAS specialist Ian Ross at CDM Smith, an engineering firm in Boston, Massachusetts, that works on PFAS remediation.\n\nCapturing contaminants\n\nOn the second floor of Kearns’s facility — the Sweeney Water Treatment Plant — drinking water held in up to eight concrete tanks sinks silently through nearly four metres of GAC. “It’s amazing how much carbon you need to treat for PFAS,” says Orlando Coronell, an engineer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is collaborating with Leibfarth to test a new sorbent at the facility.\n\nOperated by the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority (CFPUA), this plant serves 200,000 people in the coastal city of Wilmington. It draws water from the Cape Fear River, which in 2017 was shown to have high levels of one of the six EPA-regulated PFASs, called GenX (see ‘Cape Fear and PFAS pollution’). The molecules had come from 160 kilometres upstream, where fluorochemical manufacturer Chemours makes PFASs for electronics and battery manufacturing, among other uses, and had discharged them into the river.\n\nSource: RTI International (Adapted from https://go.nature.com/429E3DL)\n\nAfter the CFPUA installed the sorbent system, levels of GenX and several other PFASs fell (and are below the new EPA limits). While the system was being designed and constructed, North Carolina’s state environmental agency sued Chemours, and a local non-profit group added pressure by suing both organizations together. The parties agreed to settle: Chemours denied wrongdoing, but installed better controls on its PFAS emissions, including a 1.6-kilometre-long underground barrier wall paired with a GAC filtering system that collects surface and groundwater near the plant and removes PFASs. The firm says it has invested more than $400 million at its plant to remediate PFAS emissions and limit future ones. The CFPUA is currently suing Chemours to pay for the Sweeney filtration system.\n\nGAC is generally effective, but it is a ‘broad-spectrum’ sorbent that traps everything it attracts into its hydrophobic (water-repellent) pores, not just PFASs, says Coronell. The Sweeney plant receives water with much higher levels of dissolved organic matter than of PFASs, which compete for space in GAC’s pores. The six molecules on the EPA’s list stick well enough, but any PFAS with a shorter, hydrophobic fluorine-bearing tail does not. As GAC’s pores fill up, short-chain PFASs can break through the pores and re-enter drinking water.\n\nIn particular, ultrashort-chain PFASs (those with a three-carbon fluorinated tail or shorter) are worrying researchers(see ‘PFAS pollutants’), because the molecules are being found in waters downstream of Chemours and near semiconductor manufacturing facilities1. After the CFPUA detected two ultrashort PFASs in its drinking water after treatment, it began switching out the GAC about every 200 days, instead of the roughly 300 days it had used when capturing GenX. That has almost doubled its carbon-regeneration costs.\n\nOther established ways to capture PFASs have pros and cons. A type of sorbent called ion-exchange resin traps contaminants broadly through electrostatic interactions: the six EPA-regulated PFASs all carry a negative charge, and they stick by trading places with a negatively charged component on the resin.\n\nLess resin is needed to treat the same amount of water than with GAC, but it costs five to six times more, says Detlef Knappe, an environmental scientist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Nitrate salt ions in the water can clog the resin and reduce its cost-effectiveness, and the resins are used just once in drinking-water facilities, because cleansing them often involves washing in methanol, an unacceptably toxic solvent.\n\nAnother method uses membranes to separate contaminants from water. In reverse osmosis, mechanical pressure forces water through a membrane with tiny pores: water that is almost pure passes through, while everything else stays on the other side in a gradually saltier mix. Membrane systems are more expensive to build — reverse osmosis was three times the cost of a sorbent system when the CFPUA evaluated the options. (But if sorbents had to be changed more frequently, then membrane systems would become cost-effective, says Knappe.) Reverse osmosis also generates massive volumes of a watery, PFAS-laced brine that is difficult to manage.\n\nTargeted PFAS traps\n\nMany researchers are inventing sorbents that can trap PFASs more selectively, often involving multiple chemical interactions at once. On the first floor at the Sweeney plant, beneath the GAC tanks, Coronell and Leibfarth are testing a proprietary sorbent. So far, it has lasted three times as long as the CFPUA’s GAC and 40% longer than a top-performing ion-exchange resin before the short-chain molecules have broken through. One possibility, says Kearns, is to add a layer of a new sorbent to capture escapees from GAC, thereby lengthening the time between trips to the reactivation kiln.\n\nSome researchers are testing their sorbents on dirtier, more complex PFAS sources, such as wastewater. The dirtiest of all is the liquid that pools at the bottom of a landfill (landfill leachate), which must be pumped out and treated, often by being transported to the nearest wastewater treatment plant by lorry. “It’s pretty gross,” says William Dichtel, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who plans to test a sorbent on the leachate.\n\nIn general, sorbents capture long-chained PFASs better than short-chained ones. Costly membrane systems might prove necessary for waters enriched in short-chained PFASs: one study2 found that nanofiltration, which uses membranes with slightly larger pores and produces less waste than reverse osmosis, captured more than 90% of ultrashort-chain PFASs from semiconductor wastewater.\n\nAnother idea is to reconfigure GAC itself. The material’s pores are irregularly shaped, but carbon chemist Pan Ni at the University of Missouri in Columbia and his colleagues have reported preliminary work at a conference suggesting that the pores could be aligned into nano-sized channels instead. With the right channel diameters, GAC might begin targeting just the short-chained molecules.\n\nDestroying captured PFASs\n\nEvery sorbent eventually becomes full. How best to destroy the accumulated PFASs is now a key question and a billion-dollar market.\n\nUtilities that choose to clean their water using GAC could follow the Sweeney example and drive it to a reactivation kiln. An alternative is incineration, which is also a common way to dispose of spent single-use resins. Incineration simply destroys materials by burning them in the presence of oxygen — “a runaway reaction”, says Knappe — whereas GAC reactivation is controlled and works without oxygen.\n\nIdeally, both kinds of treatment would break every carbon–fluorine bond and release fluorine as hydrogen fluoride gas. The gas could then pass through ‘scrubbers’ containing alkaline reagents similar to baking soda to convert it into harmless minerals such as sodium fluoride.\n\nBut it is not clear that the PFASs are completely mineralized, because some laboratory studies can’t match up the mass of the fluorine going in with that recovered from the products3. This suggests that some PFASs might have been broken up only into smaller gaseous PFAS molecules, which are harder to capture and might be spread into the air.\n\nSuch gases can, however, be captured with the types of filter already installed at incinerator facilities that routinely deal with hazardous waste, says AnnieLu DeWitt, an analytical chemist at Clean Harbors, a waste-management firm headquartered in Norwell, Massachusetts, that specializes in hazardous-waste incineration and landfill.\n\nTests in which PFASs were incinerated with added calcium minerals suggest that fluorine gets locked effectively into calcium fluoride. In Australia, some PFAS-containing wastes have been fed to cement kilns, which run at high temperatures and contain lots of calcium. However, total mineralization remains unproven.\n\nBecause of questions over the effectiveness of incineration, the US Department of Defense has temporarily forbidden its facilities from incinerating fire-fighting foam that has high concentrations of PFASs. The department is working with the EPA and Clean Harbors to check whether incineration produces some PFAS gases. If not, the expectation is that incineration will become the go-to technique, says Ross. In the meantime, a bevy of start-up firms, often spun out of academic labs, have developed alternative ways to destroy PFASs. Many of these use high-energy conditions to rip the molecules apart. The firms say that the techniques can treat fire-fighting foam and PFAS-laced brines or biosolids that aren’t suitable for incineration.\n\nVials of samples containing GenX, a PFAS chemical, in an EPA analysis lab in Cincinnati.Credit: Joshua A. Bickel/AP/Alamy\n\nA Pennsylvania start-up firm called OnVector uses plasmas (ionized gases) to break the molecules apart, while the company 374Water in Morrisville, North Carolina, uses supercritical water (water that behaves like a gas and a liquid, owing to high pressure and temperature). A technique being commercialized by Aquagga, a firm in Washington state, uses water at a lower temperature and pressure than other firms do, but adds an alkali chemical to kick-start the PFAS destruction.\n\nMilder destruction methods",

The officials allege, in many instances, that the detainees’ involvement in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza constitutes a threat to national security.\n\n‘Anxiety is palpable’: detention of researchers at US border spurs travel worries\n\nMultiple organizations representing university faculty members filed a lawsuit on 25 March challenging the actions, which include high-profile cases that have landed several student researchers in jail and sent others into hiding. Professors and students who spoke to Nature say they have already begun brushing up on their legal rights and taking precautions.\n\n“People are living in fear, if not for their lives, then certainly for their liberty and safety,” says Michael Thaddeus, a mathematician at Columbia University in New York City. He stresses that the detentions are just one part of a broader attack by the government of US President Donald Trump on scientists and academics that includes the cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants at Columbia and other universities.\n\nOne graduate student who studies public health tells Nature that they are crafting contingency plans on how to reunite with their children and spouse if they are detained returning from a pending research trip abroad. “These are insane things to be thinking about in the United States,” says the scientist, who recently had their primary research grant terminated by the Trump team and who asked for anonymity out of fear that they would be targeted by the administration.\n\nThe Trump White House and the US Department of State did not respond to Nature’s requests for comment.\n\nTaking away visas\n\nTrump set the stage for the current detentions by signing an executive order on 30 January that called on US immigration officials to deport alleged student “sympathizers” of Hamas, which attacked Israel in October 2023 and is designated as a terrorist group by the United States. Many students and professors reject that charge, arguing that most protestors were not supporting Hamas but opposing Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry.\n\nProtests over Israel–Hamas war have torn US universities apart: what’s next?\n\nMarco Rubio, head of the US Department of State, confirmed at a press event last week that his agency has revoked visas for at least 300 students, with more to come. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,” Rubio said.\n\nIn nearly a dozen cases that have attracted media attention, officials with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency have detained or sought to detain students and scholars who have been living legally in the United States either on visas or ‘green cards’ that provide permanent residency status. The list includes several well-known pro-Palestinian activists such as Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, and Rümeysa Öztürk, a PhD student studying social-media use among youth at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Both are being held in a detention center in Louisiana.\n\nAlthough the US state department has broad latitude over visas and green cards, the lawsuit filed by faculty organizations in a federal court in Boston last week alleges that, in many instances, these actions violate students’ constitutional right to free speech, which scholars say applies to everybody, not just US citizens.\n\nSigns decorate a tree in Somerville, Massachusetts, where ICE agents arrested Tufts University PhD student Rümeysa Öztürk.Credit: Scott Eisen/Getty\n\n“This is ideological deportation,” says Ramya Krishnan, an attorney at Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute and counsel on the lawsuit. She raises particular concern with the Trump administration’s argument that many of the arrested scholars pose a threat to US foreign policy because of the opinions they have voiced about the war in Gaza. What’s to stop the administration from saying that opinions on climate policy or other issues are threats?, she asks. “There really is no limit to the government’s theory here, and that is part of what is so disturbing.”\n\nAlready, multiple cases seem to hinge on issues other than students’ involvement in the Gaza war protests. For instance, on 16 February, Kseniia Petrova, a bioinformatician at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was arrested at the US border after failing to declare frog embryos she was bringing to her laboratory from France. She is also being detained in Louisiana.\n\nThe White House and the state department did not respond to questions from Nature about the reasons for various detentions.",

          "authors": "Alexandra Witze",
          "abstract": "The magnitude-7.7 earthquake that hit Myanmar on 28 March has killed at least 2,700 people, with the final death toll expected to be much higher. The quake appears to have been a rare type known as supershear — in which the energy of a rupture moves exceptionally fast through the ground, amplifying the destruction.\n\nThese labs have prepared for a big earthquake — will it be enough?\n\nThis kind of rupture is “the earthquake equivalent of a supersonic jet”, wrote Frederik Tilmann, a seismologist at the GFZ Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, Germany, in an analysis on LinkedIn. The work is preliminary, but multiple research teams are converging on the supershear scenario.\n\nIf that explanation is correct, then the geological fault that broke during the quake — the massive Sagaing fault, which runs north–south through the heart of Myanmar — might have ruptured over 400 kilometres or more. In the coming days, researchers might be able to confirm this by looking at satellite imagery of the region taken before and after the quake.\n\nIn supershear earthquakes, the ground rupture travels faster than the seismic waves it produces. That effect can concentrate seismic energy ahead of the rupture, leading to greater damage at greater distances than would be expected from a non-supershear quake. Bangkok, for instance, saw at least one high-rise building that was under construction collapse during the quake, even though it is located around 1,000 kilometres from the epicentre.\n\nWidespread damage\n\nDamage is widespread across Myanmar and, to a lesser extent, in neighbouring Thailand. Search-and-rescue efforts in Myanmar are being hampered by the country’s ongoing civil war, which began after the military seized power in 2021. The coup also reduced the ability of scientists in Myanmar to monitor the country’s seismic activity — a capability that expanded in the 2010s, in part because of international collaborations1.\n\nNow, there are fewer seismometers than before to feed information into Myanmar’s Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH). Last year, for instance, the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) removed two-thirds of its seismic monitoring network in Myanmar, “due to the coup, pandemic and consequent logistic difficulties”, says EOS seismologist Shengji Wei. The remaining ten stations were donated to the DMH, where researchers are now trying to see what data they can retrieve from them.\n\nAt least two seismic stations in Myanmar that had been upgraded in a collaboration with the US Geological Survey (USGS) did capture measurements during the quake, says Susan Hough, a USGS seismologist in Pasadena, California. Researchers are also using data from the national seismic network in Thailand to better understand what happened during the quake, and especially to monitor aftershocks.",

          "abstract": "Activists rally for the rights of transgender people at the National Mall in Washington DC last month.Credit: Kayla Bartkowski/Getty\n\nAs the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) continues to defund nearly every research project on transgender health, the White House has directed the agency to focus on studying “regret” after a person transitions to align their body with their gender identity. Several NIH employees, who were granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press, confirmed the directive to Nature.\n\n‘Mind-boggling’: US CDC orders gender-related terms cut from scientific papers\n\nTwo weeks ago, Matthew Memoli, who was acting NIH director at the time, sent an e-mail to the directors of several NIH institutes. It said that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is the NIH’s parent agency, “has been directed to fund research on a few specific areas” related to what it calls “chemical and surgical mutilation” of children and adults — a reference to gender-affirming care and surgery. “This is very important to the President and the Secretary” of the HHS, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the e-mail added.\n\nBased on its priorities, the White House sometimes directs the NIH — the world’s largest public funder of biomedical science — to study certain broad topics, such as cancer or women’s health, but the latest directive’s specificity, inflammatory language and focus on a hyper-polarizing topic are unprecedented, the NIH employees say. Although the White House can sometimes “push us on various different things, we normally get to chart out the approach”, a staff member says.\n\nMany scientists, reeling from the abrupt cancellation of more than US$180 million in NIH funding for research on transgender health, slammed the proposed studies as ideologically driven.\n\n“It’s really pigeonholing trans people into this medical lens where the only thing important to know about them is that they seek medical transition” and regret it, says Harry Barbee, who studies the health of people from gender and sexual minorities (LGBT+) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, and identifies as non-binary and queer. “When ideology is prioritized over scientific merit, that threatens the entire scientific enterprise.”\n\nThe NIH and the White House did not respond to Nature’s queries about the new research priorities or scientists’ concerns with their apparent ideological bent. The HHS said that the “NIH is prioritizing research that serves the best interests of public health, not ideological agendas, and will continue to support studies that provide clear, objective data — particularly regarding the long-term effects of gender transitions.”\n\nShifting focus\n\nEstimates suggest that 1.6 million people in the United States identify as transgender, and about one-quarter of them obtain gender-affirming surgeries. Research suggests1 that access to these procedures can reduce anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation in transgender people.\n\nExclusive: NIH to cut grants for COVID research, documents reveal\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office on 20 January that directed the US government to stop acknowledging that gender can differ from sex at birth. The cancellation of many trans-health research grants quickly followed, and now the agency seems to be shifting the type of research it funds. The e-mail from Memoli, obtained by Nature, specifies two areas of research that the Trump administration wishes to fund about “social transition”, which is when a person changes how they express their gender to others — for example, by changing their name or appearance.\n\nThese include “regret and detransition following social transition as well as chemical and surgical mutilation of children and adults” and “outcomes from children who have undergone social transition and/or chemical and surgical mutilation”, the e-mail says.\n\nMore research on the experience of trans people — including understanding reasons for dissatisfaction after transition — is direly needed, Barbee says. But they worry that the sole focus on negative consequences is misplaced: fewer than 1% of transgender people who undergo gender-affirming surgery regret it, according to an analysis published by Barbee and their colleagues2. By comparison, 14.4% of the broader population reports regret after any kind of surgery3.\n\nSo far, about 187 NIH grants funding trans-health research have been terminated, according to an online effort to track the Trump team’s research cuts by Brittany Charlton, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who studies LGBT+ health, and her colleagues. In 2023, the NIH funded about 180 projects in this field, according to another NIH employee.\n\nIf these proposed studies move forwards, it will create a “a distorted research ecosystem where only politically favourable findings are permitted to exist” and an “evidence vacuum for clinicians who are trying to do right by their patients”, Barbee says.",

          "authors": "Smriti Mallapaty",
          "abstract": "The inner structures of the brain are difficult to investigate without surgery.Credit: K H Fung/Science Photo Library\n\nNeuroscientists have observed for the first time how structures deep in the brain are activated when the brain becomes aware of its own thoughts, known as conscious perception1.\n\nThe brain is constantly bombarded with sights, sounds and other stimuli, but people are only ever aware of a sliver of the world around them — the taste of a piece of chocolate or the sound of someone’s voice, for example. Researchers have long known that the outer layer of the brain, called the cerebral cortex, plays a part in this experience of being aware of specific thoughts.\n\nThe involvement of deeper brain structures has been much harder to elucidate, because they can be accessed only with invasive surgery. Designing experiments to test the concept in animals is also tricky. But studying these regions would allow researchers to broaden their theories of consciousness beyond the brain’s outer wrapping, say researchers.\n\n“The field of consciousness studies has evoked a lot of criticism and scepticism because this is a phenomenon that is so hard to study,” says Liad Mudrik, a neuroscientist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. But scientists have increasingly been using systematic and rigorous methods to investigate consciousness, she says.\n\nAware or not\n\nIn a study published in Science today1, Mingsha Zhang, a neuroscientist at Beijing Normal University, focused on the thalamus. This region at the centre of the brain is involved in processing sensory information and working memory, and is thought to have a role in conscious perception.\n\nParticipants were already undergoing therapy for severe and persistent headaches, for which they had thin electrodes injected deep into their brains. This allowed Zhang and his colleagues to study their brain signals and measure conscious awareness.\n\nThe participants were asked to move their eyes in a particular way depending on whether they noticed an icon flash onto a screen in front of them. The icon was designed so that the participants would be aware of its appearance only about half of the time.\n\nDuring the tasks, the researchers recorded neural activity in multiple regions of the brain, including the thalamus and the cortex. This is the first time that such simultaneous recordings have been made in people doing a task that is relevant to consciousness science, says Christopher Whyte, a systems neuroscientist at the University of Sydney in Australia. The work “is really pretty remarkable”, he says, because it allowed the team to look at how the timing of neural activity in different regions varied.\n\nGatekeeper",

          "title": "Where do proteins go in cells? Next-generation methods map the molecules’ hidden lives",
          "authors": "Ariana Remmel",
          "abstract": "The average human cell contains roughly 10,000 different proteins. Existing as several to millions of copies in each cell, proteins mediate all manner of tasks, including chemical transformations, communication and intracellular trafficking. To execute these crucial functions, each protein must cosy up with designated partners, says Emma Lundberg, a bioengineer at Stanford University in California. If you want to understand how cells function, you have to work out what proteins interact with — and where.\n\nTo coordinate the mass of moving parts, eukaryotic cells evolved membrane-bound organelles and other subcellular compartments that gather protein networks together in controlled environments, each with a distinct function. By working out the sites at which a protein operates, researchers can infer something about its job. “It’s like a person in a house: if you are in the kitchen or in your laundry room, I can make a pretty good guess of what you’re doing,” says Lundberg.\n\nBut, like people, proteins aren’t restricted to one place; as researchers such as Lundberg in the fast-growing field of spatial proteomics have discovered, more than half of our proteins have more than one hangout spot. Many have multiple functions and moonlight in different roles depending on their position. By the same token, cellular processes falter when proteins show up to the wrong job site. “It really shows that this notion of ‘one gene, one protein, one function’ is really not correct,” Lundberg says.\n\nWith advances in high-resolution imaging, mass spectrometry and machine-learning-assisted data analysis, spatial-proteomics researchers are mapping and tracking proteins with increasing detail at multiple scales, from subcellular compartments to tissues. The work is challenging and data-intensive, but findings have yielded insights into cellular biology and disease progression — not to mention, potential therapeutic strategies.\n\nCellular cartography\n\nProteomics is to proteins what transcriptomics is to RNA. By counting the RNA-based messages that the cell writes to direct its protein-making machinery, transcriptomics practitioners hope to deduce what the cell is doing. But the expression level of a given transcript doesn’t necessarily match the abundance of its corresponding protein. And cells often edit their transcripts and modify proteins after translation to create different variants, called proteoforms.\n\nEnter proteomics, which provides concrete data to explain how the ‘parts list’ of possible proteins in our genes is assembled to build the cell types in the body. By mapping protein abundances to their physical locations, spatial proteomics highlights how those proteins — and cells — are organized in tissues. There are two basic approaches: the imaging method fluorescence microscopy and quantitative mass spectrometry. The methods are complementary, and two large-scale atlas projects demonstrate the power of using them together.\n\nA tissue sample is prepared for highly multiplexed proteoform imaging.Credit: Lisa La Vallee\n\nIn 2017, Lundberg and her collaborators used a mix of both methods to build a subcellular atlas of more than 12,000 proteins in 22 cell types called the Cell Atlas, which is part of the Sweden-based Human Protein Atlas project1. The team stained a library of cells with fluorescently labelled antibodies for each target protein alongside markers for notable structures, such as the nucleus and mitochondria. These cellular landmarks helped the researchers to assign each protein to one or more of 30 subcellular locations, from major organelles to more esoteric options, such as cell junctions and lipid droplets.\n\nImmunofluorescence works well when researchers know what proteins they are looking for and have suitable antibodies that can tag them, says Kathryn Lilley, a biochemist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Newer methods that combine repeated cycles of staining and imaging — such as co-detection by indexing (CODEX) and iterative bleaching extends multiplexity (IBEX) — can visualize tens to hundreds of labelled proteins in a single sample. But even these multiplexed methods overlook most of the proteome. Mass spectrometry can help to complete the picture, Lilley says.\n\nLilley and her colleagues developed a suite of mass-spectrometry-based techniques for subcellular mapping that are broadly called ‘localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging’ (LOPIT). To validate the Cell Atlas’s image-based assignments, the researchers applied a variant called hyperLOPIT that works by carefully breaking cells open, separating their contents across a density gradient and digesting the proteins from each sample using enzymes. Next, they label each sample with a different isotope tag, recombine them and analyse the resulting mixture using tandem mass spectrometry — a quantitative approach that allows them to identify, quantify and assign thousands of proteins back to their original subcellular compartments.\n\nThe team used these and other methods to demonstrate that more than half of the proteins in human cells could be found in more than one location, and a subset could be found in at least three. About one-third of the proteins were present in every cell type, suggesting that they have generic ‘housekeeping’ roles that keep our cells running.\n\nIn 2022, Manuel Leonetti at the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco, California, working with Matthias Mann at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich, Germany, and their colleagues on the OpenCell project generated a library of 1,310 lines of human embryonic kidney cells, each of which fused a genetically encoded fluorescent protein tag to a different protein target. The team then used fluorescence microscopy to manually annotate the distribution of the tagged protein in living cells of each type and to train a machine-learning algorithm to carry out the same assignments. At the same time, the genetically encoded tags provided an antigen with which Mann’s team could perform immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry experiments. These allow the researchers to grab hold of a protein and its interaction partners and then train a second machine-learning algorithm to systematically build up a ‘social network’ for these proteins. Users can explore each protein’s whereabouts and known associates on the OpenCell web portal.\n\nTake, for example, FAM241A, an ‘orphan’ protein of previously unknown function. When Leonetti and his colleagues looked at cells engineered to express FAM241A with a fluorescent tag, they found it in the endoplasmic reticulum, an organelle that, among other things, affixes chemical modifications to proteins. From those snapshots, the project’s machine-learning algorithm predicted that FAM241A might interact with two enzymes from the OpenCell library that add a specific type of sugar molecule to proteins. Further investigation confirmed that FAM241A is part of the same pathway, revealing its function2.\n\nMoving molecules\n\nLiving cells are dynamic, ceaselessly building and breaking biomolecules, and shuffling them from one location to another. Detailed descriptions of where proteins typically congregate — and how they move from place to place — can help researchers to understand the significance of protein movements when cells are stressed or during disease.\n\nIn one study3, for instance, Lilley and her colleagues measured how the proteome of lung cancer cells responds to radiotherapy — a common treatment for this disease. Using a LOPIT-based workflow, the team measured the proteomes of cultured lung cancer cells exposed to X-rays and those of untreated controls. Of the several hundred proteins that differed between the two conditions, most changed in either abundance or location, but rarely in both, Lilley says. Focusing on those proteins that seemed to migrate after exposure to radiation, the researchers identified several key players in an iron-dependent cell-death pathway called ferroptosis that might contribute to radiotherapy resistance in some cancers. Although the work is preliminary, the pathway is a potential therapeutic target, Lilley says.\n\nMethod of the year 2024: spatial proteomics\n\nSimilarly, Mikko Taipale, a functional geneticist at the University of Toronto in Canada, and his colleagues coaxed human cell cultures to produce 3,448 fluorescently tagged proteins in which a single-letter alteration to the coding sequence changes one amino acid for another. Such ‘missense mutations’ can sometimes disable a protein, he notes; at other times, “it leads to this rewiring of cellular networks so that the protein ends up in the wrong place and interacts with the wrong partners”. In this case, manual analysis of the microscopy data showed that 16% of variants that were known or likely to be pathogenic also congregated in the wrong place in cells, suggesting a link between protein location and disease4. “I don’t think I would have guessed that it’s that common,”Taipale says.\n\nIn fact, misplaced proteins in cancer and neurodegenerative disease “seems sufficiently widespread that an approach to fixing that mislocalization would be quite powerful”, says Stanford chemical biologist Steven Banik. Scientists have developed tools to study these processes either by reuniting estranged interaction partners5 or by sequestering crucial components in distant parts of the cell6. Now, they are attempting to exploit this information for therapeutic benefit.\n\nBanik and his colleagues, for instance, have created a chemical ‘tow hitch’ called targeted relocalization-activating molecules (TRAMs) that latch on to a shuttle protein at one end and a designated cargo on the other7. In one demonstration of this technology, Banik’s team used an RNA-binding protein called FUS as cargo. This protein is normally present in the nucleus but can form toxic granules in the cytoplasm of neurons in some cases of the neurodegenerative condition motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). In cells that are manipulated to express both the faulty form of FUS and a protein that shuttles cargo from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, treatment with the matching TRAM effectively dissolved the troublesome granules by carting away the errant variants. With further development, Banik is hopeful that such molecular tools will uncover the rules that govern logistical networks in cells and even serve as medicinal compounds themselves.\n\nSpatial conundrum\n\nDespite these advances, significant knowledge gaps remain — even to seemingly obvious questions. For instance, just how big is the human proteome? Between variations in gene splicing, post-translational modification and folding, every protein-coding gene can give rise to multiple proteoforms, each of which might have a different function and location, says Neil Kelleher, a protein biochemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.\n\nTo survey the proteoform landscape of cells and tissues, Kelleher and his collaborators combined an existing imaging system called nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) and a new instrument for individual ion mass spectrometry, which is being commercialized by biotechnology company Thermo Fisher Scientific. Kelleher and his collaborators call the resulting platform ‘proteoform imaging mass spectrometry’ (PiMS); it can measure hundreds of proteoforms at the tissue level with a resolution of the order of a few cells. In one analysis of ovarian cancer biopsies, Kelleher and his colleagues identified 303 proteoforms that were expressed differently in healthy tissue and tumours8. Now, they are drilling down to the scale of isolated organelles such as nuclei.\n\nA section of brain hippocampus from an individual with Alzheimer’s disease highlights proteins in different cell types: neurons (orange, magenta and green), astrocytes (cyan) and microglia (yellow).

Every month, my team and I come by boat to retrieve the data, as I am doing in this picture with my student Joel Lopez (I’m on the right).\n\nIn this project, we tagged 30 individual birds with GPS data-loggers, including 10 that live in the local mangrove trees, which host around 500 breeding pairs. Catching these birds is tricky, so we do it at night when they’re less active; we can dazzle an individual with a light and avoid disturbing others.\n\nThe GPS tracking revealed that frigatebirds cross the Baja California Peninsula up to three times per day, an unusual behaviour for a seabird. On average, foraging trips last 14 hours and birds fly about 30 kilometres from the colony, with males venturing farther than females. One male even reached Clipperton Island in the Pacific Ocean, more than 1,500 km away, returning after a few days. Then he did it again exactly one year later.",

In particular, it is unclear how plateaus resist early termination by hyperpolarizing current noise. Here, we present a computational model of pharyngeal plateaus against a noisy background. We propose that an unusual, rapidly inactivating potassium conductance confers exceptional noise robustness on the system. We further investigate the possibility that a similar mechanism in other systems permits switching between plateau and spiking behavior under noisy conditions.",

          "abstract": "The brain criticality hypothesis postulates that brain dynamics are set at a phase transition where information processing is optimized. Long-range temporal correlations (TCs) characterizing the dissipation of information within a signal have been shown to be a hallmark of brain criticality. However, the experimental link between cognitive performance, criticality, and thus TCs has remained elusive due to limitations in recording length and spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we investigate multiday invasive EEG recordings of 104 persons with epilepsy (PwE) together with an extensive cognitive test battery. We show that short TCs predict cognitive impairment. Further, we show that heterogeneous factors, including interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), antiseizure medications (ASMs), and intermittent periods with slow-wave activity (SWSs), all act directly to perturb critical dynamics and thus cognition. Our work suggests critical dynamics to be the setpoint to measure optimal network function, thereby providing a unifying framework for the heterogeneous mechanisms impacting cognition in conditions like epilepsy.",

          "abstract": "Auxin Response Factor (ARF) plant transcription factors are the key effectors in auxin signaling. Their DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) contains a B3 domain that allows base-specific interactions with Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs) in DNA target sites. Land plants encode three phylogenetically distinct ARF classes: the closely related A- and B-classes have overlapping DNA binding properties, contrasting with the different DNA-binding properties of the divergent C-class ARFs. ARF DNA-binding divergence likely occurred early in the evolution of the gene family, but the molecular determinants underlying it remain unclear. Here, we show that the B3 DNA-binding residues are deeply conserved in ARFs, and variability within these is only present in tracheophytes, correlating with greatly expanded ARF families. Using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha , we confirm the essential role of conserved DNA-contacting residues for ARF function. We further show that ARF B3–AuxRE interfaces are not mutation-tolerant, suggesting low evolvability that has led to the conservation of the B3–DNA interface between ARF classes. Our data support the almost complete interchangeability between A/B-class ARF B3 by performing interspecies domain swaps in M. polymorpha , even between ARF lineages that diverged over half a billion years ago. Our analysis further suggests that C-class ARF DNA-binding specificity diverged early during ARF evolution in a common streptophyte ancestor, followed by strong selection in A and B-class ARFs as part of a competition-based auxin response system.",

This mechanism can be overwhelmed in those with hearing loss, resulting in cognitive fatigue in adults and potentially impeding language acquisition in children. However, the neural mechanisms that support listening effort are uncertain. Evidence from human studies suggests that the cingulate cortex is engaged under difficult listening conditions and may exert top–down modulation of the auditory cortex (AC). Here, we asked whether the gerbil cingulate cortex (Cg) sends anatomical projections to the AC that facilitate perceptual performance. To model challenging listening conditions, we used a sound discrimination task in which stimulus parameters were presented in either “Easy” or “Hard” blocks (i.e., long or short stimulus duration, respectively). Gerbils achieved statistically identical psychometric performance in Easy and Hard blocks. Anatomical tracing experiments revealed a strong, descending projection from layer 2/3 of the Cg1 subregion of the cingulate cortex to superficial and deep layers of the primary and dorsal AC. To determine whether Cg improves task performance under challenging conditions, we bilaterally infused muscimol to inactivate Cg1 and found that psychometric thresholds were degraded for only Hard blocks. To test whether the Cg-to-AC projection facilitates task performance, we chemogenetically inactivated these inputs and found that performance was only degraded during Hard blocks. Taken together, the results reveal a descending cortical pathway that facilitates perceptual performance during challenging listening conditions.",

To resolve this overlap, we demonstrate optogenetic reactivation with a red-shifted opsin, ChrimsonR. We then conduct dual-color calcium imaging in CA1 during memory reactivation in DG. In addition to measuring population dynamics in CA1, CA1 cells tagged during the original experience were identified. In the fear-conditioned animals (FC+), nontagged cells in CA1 decreased their firing rate during stimulation, while tagged cells maintained their activity level. In the FC+ animals, as the behavioral effect of stimulation decreased across days, so did the changes in neural activity during stimulation.

Since the underlying mechanism of these immune-desert tumors has yet to be unraveled, there is a pressing need to transform such immune-desert tumors into immune-inflamed tumors and thereby enhance their responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy. Here, we present a systems framework for identifying immuno-oncotargets, based on analysis of gene regulatory networks, and validating the effect of these targets in transforming immune-desert into immune-inflamed tumors.

We show that SIVmus is not resistant to ZAP inhibition. Instead, these Cercopithecus monkey hosts differ from other primate species by a splice site mutation and express the poorly active extralarge XL rather than the highly active L isoform of ZAP. Similarly, higher CpG levels in endogenous prosimian lentiviruses were associated with low activity of the corresponding host lemur ZAPs. In addition, lemur genes also show lower CpG suppression than other primates.

Here, we developed a dual recombinase–mediated genetic system to specifically trace and ablate Brachyury + Sox2 + NMPs. Our genetic tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses revealed that NMPs consist of three distinct unipotent and bipotent progenitor populations that progressively differentiate into neural and mesodermal fates. Genetic depletion of NMPs demonstrated their critical role in trunk and tail formation. This study provides in vivo genetic evidence supporting the heterogeneity of NMPs in terms of cell fate determination and their functional roles in the developing embryo.",

Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study (N = 9,082, female = 4,327), we found extensive cross-sectional associations with lower white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and streamline count in the brains of 9- and 10-y-old children exposed to a range of experiences, including prenatal risk factors, interpersonal adversity, household economic deprivation, and neighborhood adversity. Lower values of FA were associated with later difficulties with mental arithmetic and receptive language. Furthermore, white matter FA partially mediated the detrimental relationship between adversity and cognition later in adolescence. These findings advance a white matter-based account of the neural and cognitive effects of adversity, which supports leading developmental theories that place interregional connectivity prior to gray matter maturation.",

Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as desirable platforms for photocatalytic applications by virtue of their structural diversity and functional adjustability. Herein, we report that we have synthesized a stable and photosensitive zirconium-based MOF (Zr-MOF) with a photoactive tetrathienylethene-based organic linker, Zr-TSS-1. Compared with all-carbocyclic Zr-MOF counterparts, Zr-TSS-1 shows a substantial improvement in visible-light harvesting and free-carrier generation, enabling it to be a promising candidate for photocatalytic antibacterial applications. In order to validate the advantages of this framework as an antibacterial protective material, a composite was fabricated by incorporating robust Zr-TSS-1 onto sustainably accessible bacterial cellulose (BC) using an in situ growth method. This composite exhibits near-complete lethality toward typical Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus within 1 h under mild irradiation and preserves outstanding antibacterial capability after five cycles of reutilization. In addition, the high biocompatibility is confirmed by the low cytotoxicity toward human skin fibroblast, suggesting its potential for biomedical and healthcare applications. This research demonstrates the efficacious integration of a purposely designed photosensitive porous framework onto a sustainable substrate for synergistic functionality, paving a practical way for the development of the next-generation high-efficiency antimicrobial technology.",

Lmx1b is a master transcriptional regulator of postmitotic Pet1 neurons that give rise to mature serotonin (5-HT) neurons; over two hundred pathogenic heterozygous mutations have been discovered in human LMX1B, yet their impact on brain development has not been investigated. Here, we developed mouse models with different LMX1B DNA-binding missense mutations. Missense heterozygosity broadly altered Pet1 neuron transcriptomes, but expression changes converged on axon and synapse genes. Missense heterozygosity effected highly specific deficits in the postnatal maturation of forebrain serotonin axon arbors, primarily in the hippocampus and motor cortex, which was associated with spatial memory defects. Digital genomic footprinting (DGF) revealed that missense heterozygosity caused complete loss of Lmx1b motif protection and chromatin accessibility at sites enriched for a distal active enhancer/active promoter histone signature and homeodomain binding motifs; at other bound Lmx1b motifs, varying levels of losses, gains, or no change in motif binding and accessibility were found. The spectrum of footprint changes was strongly associated with synapse and axon genes. Further, Lmx1b missense heterozygosity caused wide disruption of Lmx1b-dependent GRNs comprising diverse TFs expressed in Pet1 neurons. These findings reveal an unanticipated continuum of Lmx1b missense-forced perturbations on Pet1 neuron regulatory element TF binding and accessibility. Our work illustrates DGF’s utility for gaining unique insight into how expressed TF missense mutations interfere with developing neuronal GRNs.",

We set out to investigate the lipid transfer between MlaA and MlaC using native mass spectrometry, with the aim of determining the lipid preferences of MlaC and whether MlaA preselected lipids for MlaC. First, we characterized the lipids that copurified with overexpressed MlaC, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and following delipidation noted a headgroup-independent enrichment of cyclopropane lipids. Under native expression conditions, we found that PG is three-fold enriched on MlaC compared to its abundance in the membrane. Next, we isolated and characterized OmpF 3 –MlaA complexes and demonstrated their ability to enhance loading of delipidated MlaC with bacterial and nonbacterial phospholipids. We then captured the intact ternary lipid shuttle (OmpF 3 –MlaA–MlaC) and demonstrated that PG dissociates this transient complex, releasing lipid-bound MlaC. Together our results point to a high population of endogenous PG on periplasmic MlaC, which likely arises from disassembly of the lipid shuttle to maintain lipid asymmetry for cell viability.",

LEN binds to a hydrophobic pocket between neighboring capsid (CA) proteins in hexamers and stabilizes the capsid lattice, but its effect on HIV-1 capsids is not fully understood. Here, we labeled HIV-1 capsids with green fluorescent protein fused to CA (GFP-CA) or a fluid-phase GFP content marker (cmGFP) to assess LEN’s impact on HIV-1 capsids. HIV-1 cores labeled with GFP-CA, but not cmGFP, could be immunostained with an anti-GFP antibody and were less sensitive to the capsid-binding host restriction factor MX2, demonstrating that GFP-CA is incorporated into the capsid lattice and is a marker for capsid lattice stability, whereas cmGFP is an indicator of core integrity. LEN treatment of isolated HIV-1 cores resulted in a dose-dependent loss of cmGFP signal while preserving the GFP-CA signal, indicating that LEN disrupts core integrity but stabilizes the capsid lattice. In contrast, capsid inhibitor PF-3450074 (PF74) induced loss of core integrity and the capsid lattice. Electron microscopy of LEN- or PF74-treated viral cores revealed frequent breakage at the narrow end of the capsid and other morphological changes. Our results suggest that LEN treatment does not prevent nuclear envelope docking but inhibits nuclear import of cores with or without loss of core integrity. In contrast, PF74 treatment blocks nuclear import by inhibiting the nuclear envelope docking of viral cores, highlighting their different mechanisms of nuclear import inhibition.",

In this study, we identified HEATR3, an LC3-interacting region (LIR)-containing protein, as a factor involved in this defense mechanism using quantitative mass spectrometry analysis. HEATR3 localizes intracellularly invading Salmonella , and HEATR3 deficiency promotes Salmonella proliferation in the cytoplasm. HEATR3 also localizes to lysosomes damaged by chemical treatment, suggesting that Salmonella recognition is facilitated by damage to the host cell membrane. HEATR3 deficiency impairs LC3 recruitment to damaged membranes and blocks the delivery of the target to the lysosome. These phenotypes were rescued by exogenous expression of wild-type HEATR3 but not by the LIR mutant, indicating the crucial role of the HEATR3–LC3 interaction in the receptor for selective autophagy. HEATR3 is delivered to lysosomes in an autophagy-dependent manner. Although HEATR3 recruitment to the damaged membrane was unaffected by ATG5 or FIP200 deficiency, it was markedly impaired by treatment with a calcium chelator, suggesting involvement upstream of the autophagic pathway.

          "abstract": "Historical trends suggest the decline in the importance of land as a production factor, as evidenced by the decline in the employment and gross domestic product (GDP) shares of land-intensive industries. However, land continues to be a prominent store of value, as over half of household wealth in major countries is real estate. To explain this apparent disconnection between land output and land value, in a plausible economic model with land and aggregate risk, we theoretically study the long-run behavior of land prices and identify economic conditions under which land becomes overvalued relative to the fundamentals defined by the present value of land rents. Unbalanced growth together with the elasticity of substitution between production factors plays a critical role. We establish the Land Overvaluation Theorem: When the elasticity of substitution between land and nonland factors exceeds 1 (which is natural because we can create more space by constructing taller buildings with fixed land) and technological progress is faster in nonland sectors, land overvaluation necessarily emerges. As applications of the Theorem, we present three examples: i) land overvaluation emerges along the long-run transition from the Malthusian agricultural economy to the modern knowledge- and service-based economy; ii) with aggregate uncertainty, land prices exhibit recurrent stochastic fluctuations around the trend, with expansions and contractions in the size of land overvaluation; and iii) in modern economies, land use is also changing and urban land has high value. We present a model of urban land prices and show that land overvaluation emerges in the process of urban formation characterized by unbalanced growth.",

          "abstract": "The mature mammalian auditory sensory organ, the organ of Corti (OC), lacks the capacity for regenerating hair cells, leading to permanent hearing impairment. In contrast, the vestibular system has a limited capacity for hair cell regeneration, which we have shown to be further enhanced by inhibiting the Hippo pathway. Here, we demonstrate that, despite similar transcriptional responses, only vestibular and not auditory supporting cells proliferate as a result of Yap activation following Hippo inhibition. Mechanistically, we identify p27 Kip1 , a cell cycle kinase inhibitor encoded by Cdkn1b , as an additional barrier preventing cell cycle reentry specifically in the OC. We show that while in both systems Yap stimulates p27 Kip1 degradation through activation of its direct target gene Skp2 , this protein-level control is antagonized by an unusually high level of Cdkn1b transcription in the cochlea. Consequently, p27 Kip1 activity is maintained in the OC even in the presence of constitutively active Yap5SA, counteracting its mitogenic effects. Supporting this model, inactivation of the Hippo pathway in the Cdkn1b -deficient background is sufficient to induce adult auditory supporting cell proliferation in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the synergistic interaction between Hippo and p27 Kip1 is conserved in the retina where inhibition of both pathways potently induces Müller glia proliferation and initiates neuronal regeneration. Our work uncovers the molecular mechanism preventing quiescent adult sensory progenitor cells, supporting cells in the ear and Müller glia in the eye, from reentering the cell cycle after damage—the key step toward sensory receptor regeneration blocked in mammals.",

          "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) currently causes about one million infections and 240,000 deaths worldwide each year. To reach the goal set by the World Health Organization of global HCV elimination by 2030, it is critical to develop a prophylactic vaccine. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) target the E1E2 envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface, can neutralize a broad range of the highly diverse circulating HCV strains, and are essential tools to inform vaccine design. However, bNAbs targeting a single E1E2 epitope might be limited in neutralization breadth, which can be enhanced by using combinations of bNAbs that target different envelope epitopes. We have generated 60 immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) that can simultaneously target two distinct epitopes on E1E2. We combine non- or partially overlapping E1E2 specificities into three types of bsAbs, each containing a different hinge length. The majority of bsAbs shows retained or increased potency and breadth against a diverse panel of HCV pseudoparticles and HCV produced in cell culture compared to monospecific and cocktail controls. Additionally, we demonstrate that changes in the hinge length of bsAbs can alter the binding stoichiometry to E1E2. These results provide insights into the binding modes and the role of avidity in bivalent targeting of diverse E1E2 epitopes.This study illustrates how potential cooperative effects of HCV bNAbs can be utilized by strategically designing bispecific constructs. These HCV bsAbs can guide vaccine development and unlock novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against HCV and other (flavi)viruses.",

Clostridioides difficile toxins use allosteric binding by the endogenous cofactor myo -inositol hexakisphosphate to orchestrate self-cleavage from within the target cell. This binding event induces a conformational shift, primarily effecting a lever-like β -flap region, with two known orientations. We uncovered a mechanism for this allosteric transition using extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and computational and experimental mutagenesis. The mechanism relies on a switchable interaction network. The most prominent interaction pair is K600-E743, with K600 interactions explaining ∼70% of the allosteric effect. Rather than gradually morphing between two end states, the interaction network adopts two mutually exclusive configurations in the active and inactive state. Similar switchable networks may explain allostery more broadly. This mechanism in particular could aid in drug development targeting the C. difficile toxins autoproteolysis.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of retrovirus replication is the translation of two different polyproteins from one RNA through programmed –1 frameshifting. This is a mechanism in which the actively translating ribosome is induced to slip in the 5′ direction at a defined codon and then continues translating in the new reading frame. Programmed frameshifting controls the stoichiometry of viral proteins and is therefore under stringent evolutionary selection. Forty years ago, the first frameshifting stimulatory element was discovered in the Rous sarcoma virus. The ~120 nt RNA segment was predicted to contain a pseudoknot, but its 3D structure has remained elusive. Now, we have determined cryoEM and X-ray crystallographic structures of this classic retroviral element, finding that it adopts a butterfly-like double-pseudoknot fold. One “wing” contains a dynamic pyrimidine-rich helix, observed crystallographically in two conformations and in a third conformation via cryoEM. The other wing encompasses the predicted pseudoknot, which interacts with a second unexpected pseudoknot through a toggle residue, A2546. This key purine switches conformations between structural states and tunes the stability of interacting residues in the two wings. We find that its mutation can modulate frameshifting by as much as 50-fold, likely by altering the relative abundance of different structural states in the conformational ensemble of the RNA. Taken together, our structure–function analyses reveal how a dynamic double pseudoknot junction stimulates frameshifting by taking advantage of conformational heterogeneity, supporting a multistate model in which high Shannon entropy enhances frameshifting efficiency.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we expand the repertoire of biological catalysts by showing that a halogen bond (X-bond) can functionally replace the magnesium (Mg 2+ ) cofactor in mouse endonuclease G ( m EndoG). We mutated the metal coordinating glutamate E136 in m EndoG to a meta- halotyrosine ( m X Y, X = chlorine or iodine) to form a m X Y- m EndoG construct that is both acid and base catalyzed. Under basic conditions, the enzyme is inactivated by the metal chelator ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), indicating that the halogen substituent facilitates deprotonation of the tyrosyl hydroxyl group, allowing recruitment of Mg 2+ to restore the metal-dependent catalytic center. At low pHs, we observe that the m X Y- m EndoG is resistant to EDTA inactivation and that the iodinated constructed is significantly more active than the chlorinated analogue. These results implicate a hydrogen bond (H-bond) enhanced X-bond as the catalyst in the m X Y- m EndoG, with asparagine N103 serving as the H-bond donor that communicates the protonation state of histidine H104 to the halogen. This model is supported by mutation studies and electrostatic potential (ESP) calculations on models for the protonated and unprotonated m X Y···N103···H104 system compared to the Mg 2+ coordination complex of the wild type. Thus, we have designed and engineered an enzyme that utilizes an unnatural catalyst in its active site—a catalytic X-bonding enzyme, or cX- Zyme—by controverting what constitutes a metal catalyst in biochemistry.",

          "abstract": "Signal duration and subcellular location are emerging as important facets of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) function. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a clinically relevant class B1 GPCR, stimulates production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) upon activation by the native hormone, GLP-1. cAMP production continues after the hormone–receptor complex has been internalized via endocytosis. Here, we report GLP-1 analogues that induce prolonged signaling relative to GLP-1. A single β-amino acid substitution at position 18, with the residue derived from ( S , S )- trans -2-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid (ACPC), enhances signaling duration with retention of receptor endocytosis. Pairing ACPC at position 18 with a second substitution, α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) at position 16, abrogates endocytosis, but prolonged signaling is maintained. Prolonged signaling is sensitive to the structure of the β residue at position 18. Cryoelectron microscopy structures of two GLP-1 analogues bound to the GLP-1R:Gs complex suggest substantial alterations to bound peptide structure and dynamics compared to the GLP-1:GLP-1R:Gs complex. These structural findings strengthen an emerging view that agonist dynamics in the receptor-bound state influence signaling profiles. Our results advance understanding of the structural underpinnings of receptor activation and introduce tools for exploring the impact of spatiotemporal signaling profiles following GLP-1R activation.",

Chronic exposure to allergens and other airborne antigens can result in the formation of lymphocyte aggregates in the lung, which can harbor ectopic germinal centers (GCs). After allergen exposure, GCs that form in the lung are much smaller and less densely packed with B cells than lymph node GCs. Despite this, ectopic lung GCs support somatic hypermutation and affinity-based maturation as in lymph node GCs, and export memory B cells (MBCs) directly into the lung tissue.

According to art theory, different forms of art—ranging from the representational to the abstract—challenge these interpretive processes in different ways. Yet, much remains unknown about how art is subjectively interpreted. In this study, we sought to elucidate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the subjective interpretation of art. Using brain imaging and written descriptions, we quantified individual variability in responses to paintings by the same artists, contrasting figurative and abstract paintings. Our findings revealed that abstract art elicited greater interindividual variability in activity within higher-order, associative brain areas, particularly those comprising the default-mode network. By contrast, no such differences were found in early visual areas, suggesting that subjective variability arises from higher cognitive processes rather than differences in sensory processing. These findings provide insight into how the brain engages with and perceives different forms of art and imbues it with subjective interpretation.",

Cellulose has slender crystallite units referred to as microfibrils or elementary fibrils, and these crystallites form a dense network skeleton in the cell walls. In this study, we assessed the morphology and crystallinity of individually dispersed microfibrils isolated from the cell walls of wood, cotton, and ramie celluloses. It is well known that microfibrils in higher plants exhibit structural diversity, and these three plants, in particular, have distinct differences in the morphology and crystallinity of microfibrils. Our structural analyses combining atomic force microscopy (AFM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), solid-state 13 C NMR spectroscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed the uniformity in the cross-sectional dimensions and crystallinity of the dispersed microfibrils, irrespective of the plant species. The majority of the microfibrils were dispersed as structural units with widths of approximately 2 to 3 nm, and their crystallite sizes and crystallinity degrees were approximately 2 nm and 20%, respectively. These structural profiles were in agreement with the simulation results; here, the model assumed that a single microfibril consisted of 18 cellulose molecules. These results from the direct dimensional assessments support a recent hypothesis in biophysics that a single biosynthesis system of cellulose, referred to as the terminal complex (TC), consisted of 18 synthases. Some of the dispersed microfibrils had bundled sizes of two or three microfibrils. We also demonstrated that this bundling was stabilized by the fusion of several crystallites.",

Here, we inoculated a symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) model cnidarian ( Exaiptasia diaphana : “Aiptasia”) with either its native symbiont Breviolum minutum or one of three non-native symbionts: Symbiodinium microadriaticum , Cladocopium goreaui, and Durusdinium trenchii . We then measured and compared host AP, host AU, symbiont EX, and symbiont cell-cycle phase for up to a year with these different symbionts and used these discrete measurements to inform comparative models of symbiont population regulation. Our models showed a general pattern, where regulation through AP and AU is reduced after onset, followed by an overshoot of the symbiont population that requires a strong regulatory response, dealt with by strong CC and increased EX. As colonization progresses into symbiosis maintenance, CC remains crucial for achieving steady-state symbiont populations, with our models estimating that CC regulates 10-fold more cells (60 to 90%) relative to the other mechanisms. Notably though, our models also revealed that D. trenchii is less tightly regulated than B. minutum , consistent with D. trenchii’s reputation as a suboptimal partner for this cnidarian. Overall, our models suggest that single regulatory mechanisms do not accurately replicate observed symbiont colonization patterns, reflecting the importance of all mechanisms working concomitantly. This ultimately sheds light on the cell biology underpinning the stability of this ecologically significant symbiosis.",

Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing TME dynamics is essential for developing new treatment strategies for this devastating disease. In this study, we uncover an oncogenic role for Galectin-1 (Gal1), a glycan-binding protein abundantly expressed by activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), a key component of the PDAC TME that orchestrates tumor progression. Our findings reveal that Gal1 expression is elevated in the nucleus of human PSCs in both tissue samples and cultured cell lines. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis (ChIP-seq), we identify Gal1 occupancy at the promoters of several cancer-associated genes, including KRAS , a pivotal oncogene involved in PDAC pathogenesis. We demonstrate that Gal1 binds to the KRAS promoter, sustaining KRAS expression in PSCs, which, in turn, maintains PSC activation and promotes the secretion of protumorigenic cytokines. Mechanistically, Gal1 is required to preserve histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation levels and to recruit the histone methyltransferase MLL1 to target promoters. Collectively, our findings define a nuclear function of Gal1 in modulating the transcriptional landscape of cancer-associated genes in PSCs within the PDAC TME, mediated through an epigenetic mechanism. These insights enhance our understanding of PDAC pathology and open potential avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting intracellular Gal1.",

          "abstract": "Zinc (Zn 2+ ) homeostasis is essential for gametogenesis and reproduction, and its deficiency causes infertility. Oocytes contain higher Zn 2+ levels than somatic cells, and Zn 2+ concentrations in oocytes are far higher than those of other transition metals and increase even more during maturation in preparation for fertilization. Remarkably, it is unknown what transporter(s) or channel(s) mediate Zn 2+ influx in oocytes and whether they are expressed uniformly throughout folliculogenesis. Here, we showed that the functional expression of a member of the t ransient r eceptor p otential family, vanilloid 3, TRPV3, closely follows the dynamics of intracellular Zn 2+ during oocyte maturation, raising the prospect that these events may be functionally linked. Using microfluorometry, we monitored in oocytes of Trpv3 null females the expected rise in Zn 2+ concentrations during maturation. Surprisingly, Zn 2+ levels did not climb, and the overall FluoZin3 signal in Trpv3 null eggs was lower than in control eggs. Electrophysiological recordings showed a large TRPV3 current induced by the agonist 2-APB in WT eggs supplemented with extracellular Zn 2+ that was absent in Trpv3 null eggs; TRPV3 showed a clear preference for Zn 2+ over Ca 2+ . Trpv3 null eggs displayed features associated with Zn 2+ deficient conditions, such as lower IP 3 R1 function, abnormal cortical granule distribution, and disturbed cytoskeletal organization with distinct actin nucleation disorders. Notably, Trpv3 null eggs demonstrated undisturbed Zn 2+ sparks. Our results suggest that TRPV3 is a pivotal member of the Zn 2+ toolkit, mediating Zn 2+ intake during maturation. They also indicate that distinct transporters or channels mediate Zn 2+ influx throughout folliculogenesis.",

          "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) encompasses various cell types, blood and lymphatic vessels, and noncellular constituents like extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytokines. These intricate interactions between cellular and noncellular components contribute to the development of a malignant TME, such as immunosuppressive, desmoplastic, angiogenic conditions, and the formation of a niche for cancer stem cells, but there is limited understanding of the specific subtypes of stromal cells involved in this process. Here, we utilized p16-Cre ERT2 -tdTomato mouse models to investigate the signaling networks established by senescent cancer stromal cells, contributing to the development of a malignant TME. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) allograft models, these senescent cells were found to promote cancer fibrosis, enhance angiogenesis, and suppress cancer immune surveillance. Notably, the selective elimination of senescent cancer stromal cells improves the malignant TME, subsequently reducing tumor progression in PDAC. This highlights the antitumor efficacy of senolytic treatment alone and its synergistic effect when combined with conventional chemotherapy. Taken together, our findings suggest that the signaling crosstalk among senescent cancer stromal cells plays a key role in the progression of PDAC and may be a promising therapeutic target.",

          "abstract": "Interest in the biological actions of alcohols, ethanol in particular, dates back to the earliest historical texts. Alcohol research is now a highly active field with roots in physiology, pharmacology, toxicology, and neuroscience. But at what point did interest and speculation evolve into bona fide science? Here, we set out to identify the earliest systematic empirical investigations into the biological actions of alcohols and unearthed a surprisingly rigorous literature which included a fundamental insight with significant implications for modern research and policy. Through manual backward citation mapping of archived texts, much of which was digitally inaccessible, we outline the origins of alcohol research beginning with a transcribed lecture from Benjamin Ward Richardson in 1869. In the years immediately following, the field of alcohol research was legitimized around what came to be briefly known as “Richardson’s law.” Richardson’s law states that the acute toxicity of straight-chain monohydroxy alcohols is directly proportional to the carbon chain length of the molecule. This law was recognized only briefly not because it was disproven, but rather because it was simply forgotten during the decades that passed between its inception and the advent of systematic bibliographic databases which paved the way for digital archiving. Quantitative analysis of studies spanning a century revealed that across monohydroxy alcohols with one (methanol) to thirteen (tridecanol) carbons, there is a near-deterministic relationship between chain-length and lethal dose (R 2 = 0.96). Richardson’s law of alcohol potency has silently stood the test of time and is among functional biology’s oldest and least challenged scientific laws.",

          "abstract": "The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a major regulator of cell and organismal growth. Consequently, hyperactivation of PI3K and its downstream effector kinase, Akt, is observed in many human cancers. Pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat-containing protein phosphatases (PHLPP), two paralogous members of the metal-dependent protein phosphatase family, have been reported as negative regulators of Akt signaling and, therefore, tumor suppressors. However, the stoichiometry and identity of the bound metal ion(s), mechanism of action, and enzymatic specificity of these proteins are not known. Seeking to fill these gaps in our understanding of PHLPP biology, we unexpectedly found that PHLPP2 has no catalytic activity in vitro. Instead, we found that PHLPP2 is a pseudophosphatase with a single zinc ion bound in its catalytic center. Furthermore, we found that cancer genomics data do not support the proposed role of PHLPP1 or PHLPP2 as tumor suppressors. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an ancestral phosphatase that arose more than 1,000 Mya, but that lost activity at the base of the metazoan lineage. Surface conservation indicates that while PHLPP2 has lost catalytic activity, it may have retained substrate binding. Finally, using phylogenomics, we identify coevolving genes consistent with a scaffolding role for PHLPP2 on membranes. In summary, our results provide a molecular explanation for the inconclusive results that have hampered research on PHLPP and argue for a focus on the noncatalytic roles of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2.",

          "abstract": "Chiral structures assembled from colloids are of great interest for applications in metamaterials and micromachines. However, similar to their molecular counterparts, these assemblies often result in racemic mixtures. Achieving homochirality by breaking the symmetry remains a significant challenge. Here, we report an approach to obtain single-handed clusters from colloidal dimers using orthogonal electric and magnetic fields. Applying an alternating-current electric field perpendicular to the substrate generates a mixture of chiral clusters with both handedness. However, symmetry is broken by superimposing a planar rotating magnetic field, favoring one chirality over the other. The cluster’s chirality can be precisely controlled in situ by adjusting the magnetic field’s direction and strength, as well as the electric field frequency. Remarkably, this method also induces uniform chirality in initially achiral clusters when exposed solely to the electric field. Both experimental and numerical analyses reveal that the stability of specific handedness depends on the competition between forces and torques generated by the magnetic field, electric field, and electrohydrodynamic flow. Furthermore, we propose a strategy for producing colloidal clusters with uniform sizes and single-handedness through dynamic tuning of the electric and magnetic fields. This work not only demonstrates the potential of integrating external fields but also provides a viable way to create reconfigurable chiral colloidal structures.",

To replicate an excitotoxic event, we investigated the long-term effects of kainate application in gerbil cochleae. Surprisingly, despite persistent synapse loss, the compound action potential of the auditory nerve fully recovered. This functional retrieval was associated with a phenotypic change in auditory nerve fibers. Thresholds were improved along the tonotopic axis. High-spontaneous rate (SR) fibers largely populated the apical region, while low-SR fibers from the basal region exhibited sound-driven activity indistinguishable from control high-SR fibers. This functional phenotype change may support the full recovery of neural response thresholds and amplitudes after excitotoxicity.

Despite its importance, no PT-neutralizing epitopes have been characterized structurally. To define neutralizing epitopes and identify key structural elements to preserve during PT antigen design, we determined a 3.6 Å cryoelectron microscopy structure of genetically detoxified PT (PTg) bound to hu11E6 and hu1B7, two potently neutralizing anti-PT antibodies with complementary mechanisms: disruption of toxin adhesion to cells and intracellular activities, respectively. Hu11E6 binds the paralogous S2 and S3 subunits of PTg via a conserved epitope but surprisingly did not span the previously identified sialic acid–binding site implicated in toxin adhesion. Hu11E6 specifically prevented PTg binding to sialylated N-glycans and a sialylated model receptor, as demonstrated by high-throughput glycan array analysis and ELISA, while a T cell activation assay showed that it blocks PTg mitogenic activities to define its neutralizing mechanism. Hu1B7 bound a quaternary epitope spanning the S1 and S5 subunits, although functional studies of hu1B7 variants suggested that S5 binding is not involved in its PT neutralization mechanism. These results structurally define neutralizing epitopes on PT, improving our molecular understanding of immune protection from B. pertussis and providing key information for the future development of PT immunogens.",

Conventional space-variant polarization manipulation in optical systems only results in broadband geometric phases. Recently emerged nonlocal metasurfaces show an ability to compress the operating bandwidth through modulations of wavelength-dependent amplitudes. However, their geometric phases are still broadband and not linear, posing severe challenges to realize ultra narrowband metadevices. Here, we propose and demonstrate the generation of ultra narrowband and spatially variable geometric phases in resonant metasurfaces. We find that an array of perturbed Mie resonators is able to simultaneously preserve its global symmetry and local transformation. Local transformation provides a pixel-level geometric phase, whereas global symmetry yields an ultranarrow operation bandwidth. We further reveal that this geometric phase can be well pinned to the resonant mode by introducing additional perturbations to individually define the phase at nonresonant wavelengths. Consequently, we realize experimentally pixelated phase-gradient metasurfaces and metalenses with record-breaking Q factors and high confidentiality. We believe that our general approach and demonstrated results will open a paradigm of multiplexed metasurfaces and information encryption.",

In contrast, basal expression at uninduced promoters is considered to be a dynamically inert mode of nonfunctional “promoter leakiness,” merely a byproduct of transcriptional regulation. Here, we investigate the basal expression mode of the mar operon, the main regulator of intrinsic multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli , and link its dynamic properties to the noncanonical, yet highly conserved start codon of marR across Enterobacteriaceae . Real-time, single-cell measurements across tens of generations reveal that basal expression consists of rare stochastic gene expression pulses, which maximize variability in wildtype and, surprisingly, transiently accelerate cellular elongation rates. Competition experiments show that basal expression confers fitness advantages to wildtype across several transitions between exponential and stationary growth by shortening lag times. The dynamically rich basal expression of the mar operon has likely been evolutionarily maintained for its role in growth homeostasis of Enterobacteria within the gut environment, thereby allowing other ancillary gene regulatory roles to evolve, e.g., control of costly-to-induce multidrug efflux pumps.

          "abstract": "Influenza remains a significant public health threat. Both monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors can target the influenza surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) for prevention and treatment of influenza. Here, we combine the strengths of anti-influenza antibodies and small molecules by site-specific conjugation of the NA inhibitor zanamivir to MEDI8852, an HA-specific fully human monoclonal antibody. MEDI8852 targets the conserved stem region of HA and inhibits HA-mediated fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Elimination of virus-infected cells involves Fcγ receptor–mediated effector functions. The efficacy of MEDI8852 is limited to influenza A viruses. Zanamivir, on the other hand, binds to the active site of NA in both influenza A and B viruses to inhibit NA activity and virus release. However, because of its small size, zanamivir has a short half-life and requires repeated dosing at high concentrations. We produced a MEDI8852–zanamivir antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) that engages Fc-mediated effector functions and benefits from neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)-mediated recycling. The MEDI8852–zanamivir conjugate extends the circulatory half-life of zanamivir, targets both influenza HA and NA, and shows enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) compared to MEDI8852 alone. The MEDI8852–zanamivir conjugate protected mice from a lethal (10 × LD 50 ) challenge with influenza A and B viruses at a dose similar to that required for broadly neutralizing anti-NA antibodies, with the added advantage of simultaneously targeting NA (influenza A and B) and HA (influenza A).",

Despite the tremendous potential of “knocking-in” genes at desired sites, the mechanisms underlying DNA binding and transposition remain elusive. In this system, a conformational change of the Cas8 protein is essential for DNA binding, yet how it occurs is unclear. Here, structural modeling and free energy simulations reconstruct the Cas8 helical bundle and reveal an open–closed conformational change that is key for the complex’s function. We show that when Cascade–TniQ binds RNA, the Cas8 bundle changes conformation mediated by the interaction with the Cas7.1 protein. This interaction promotes the bundle’s transition toward the open state, priming the complex for DNA binding. As the target DNA binds the guide RNA, the opening of the Cas8 bundle becomes more favorable, exposing positively charged residues and facilitating their interaction with DNA, which ultimately leads the DNA-binding process to completion. These outcomes provide a dynamic representation of a critical conformational change in one of the largest CRISPR systems and illustrate its role at critical steps of the Cascade–TniQ biophysical function, advancing our understanding of nucleic acid binding and transposition mechanisms.",

This process is crucial for maintaining stable brain function and has been implicated in memory consolidation during sleep. While scaling of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses plays an important role during homeostatic synaptic plasticity, molecules coordinating these processes are unknown. In this study, we investigate the role of miR-218-5p as a regulator of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in the context of picrotoxin (PTX)-induced homeostatic synaptic downscaling (HSD) in rat hippocampal neurons. Using enrichment analysis of microRNA-binding sites in genes changing upon PTX-induced HSD, we bioinformatically predict and experimentally validate increased miR-218-5p activity upon PTX treatment. By electrophysiological recordings and confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting miR-218-5p activity exerts a dual effect during HSD: It occludes the downscaling of excitatory synapses and dendritic spines, while at the same time attenuating inhibitory synapse upscaling. Furthermore, we identify the Neuroligin2 interacting molecule Mdga1 as a direct miR-218-5p target which potentially mediates the effect of miR-218-5p on homeostatic upscaling of inhibitory synapses. By performing long-term electroencephalographic recordings, we further reveal that local inhibition of miR-218-5p in the somatosensory cortex reduces local slow-wave activity during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. In summary, this study uncovers miR-218-5p as a key player in coordinating inhibitory and excitatory synapses during homeostatic plasticity and sleep.

          "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common cause of inherited retinal degeneration worldwide. It is characterized by the sequential death of rod and cone photoreceptors, the cells responsible for night and daylight vision, respectively. Although the expression of most RP genes occurs only in rods, there is a secondary degeneration of cones. One possible mechanism of cone death is metabolic dysregulation. Photoreceptors are highly metabolically active, consuming large quantities of glucose and producing substantial amounts of lactate. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) mediates the transport of glucose from the blood to photoreceptors and, in turn, removes lactate, which can influence the rate of consumption of glucose by the RPE. One model for metabolic dysregulation in RP suggests that following the death of rods, lactate levels are substantially diminished causing the RPE to withhold glucose, resulting in nutrient deprivation for cones. Here, we present adeno-associated viral vector-mediated delivery of monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2, Slc16a7 ) into the eye, with expression limited to RPE cells, with the aim of promoting lactate uptake from the blood and encouraging the passage of glucose to cones. We demonstrate prolonged survival and function of cones in rat and mouse RP models, revealing a possible gene-agnostic therapy for preserving vision in RP. We also present the use of fluorescence lifetime imaging-based biosensors for lactate and glucose within the eye. Using this technology, we show changes to lactate and glucose levels within MCT2-expressing RPE, suggesting that cone survival is impacted by changes in RPE metabolism.",

          "abstract": "Increased differentiation or activity of osteoclasts is the key pathogenic factor of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP). N4‐acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification, catalyzed by Nat10, is a novel posttranscriptional mRNA modification related to many diseases. However, its impact on regulating osteoclast activation in PMOP remains uncertain. Here, we initially observed that Nat10-mediated ac4C positively correlates with osteoclast differentiation of monocytes and low bone mass in PMOP. The specific knockout of Nat10 in monocytes and remodelin, a Nat10 inhibitor, alleviates ovariectomized (OVX)-induced bone loss by downregulating osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, epitranscriptomic analyses reveal that the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (Nfatc1) is the key downstream target of ac4C modification during osteoclast differentiation. Subsequently, translatomic results demonstrate that Nat10-mediated ac4C enhances the translation efficiency (TE) of Nfatc1, thereby inducing Nfatc1 expression and consequent osteoclast maturation. Cumulatively, these findings reveal the promotive role of Nat10 in osteoclast differentiation and PMOP from a novel field of RNA modifications and suggest that Nat10 can be a target of epigenetic therapy for preventing bone loss in PMOP.",

          "abstract": "The study of bacterial metabolism holds immense significance for improving human health and advancing agricultural practices. The prospective applications of genomically encoded bacterial metabolism present a compelling opportunity, particularly in the light of the rapid expansion of genomic sequencing data. Current metabolic inference tools face challenges in scaling with large datasets, leading to increased computational demands, and often exhibit limited inter-relatability and interoperability. Here, we introduce the Integrated Biosynthetic Inference Suite (IBIS), which employs deep learning models and a knowledge graph to facilitate rapid, scalable bacterial metabolic inference. This system leverages a series of Transformer based models to generate high quality, meaningful embeddings for individual enzymes, biosynthetic domains, and metabolic pathways. These embedded representations enable rapid, large-scale comparisons of metabolic proteins and pathways, surpassing the capabilities of conventional methodologies. The examination of evolutionary and functionally conserved metabolites across diverse bacterial species is facilitated by integrating the predictive capabilities of IBIS into a graph database enriched with comprehensive metadata. The consideration of both primary and specialized metabolism, combined with an embedding logic for enzyme discovery, uniquely positions IBIS to identify potential novel metabolic pathways. With the expansion of genomic data necessitating transformative approaches to advance molecular metabolism research, IBIS delivers an AI-driven holistic investigation of bacterial metabolism.",

The invasion history of these translocations remains uncertain for most species, limiting our understanding of their future adaptive potential and historical roles as vectors for coinvaded species. We provide a framework for filling this gap in invasion biology using the widely transplanted Pacific oyster as a case study. A two-dimensional summary of population-level variation in single nucleotide polymorphisms in native Japan reflected the geographical map of Japan and allowed identification of the source regions for the worldwide expansion. Pacific oysters proliferate in nonnative areas with environmental temperatures similar to those areas where native lineages evolved. Using Approximate Bayesian Computation, we ranked the likelihood of historical oyster or shipping vectors to explain current-day distribution of genotypes in 14 coinvaded algal and animal species. Oyster transplants were a more likely vector than shipping for six species, shipping activity was more likely for five species, and a vector was ambiguous for three species. Applying this approach to other translocated species should reveal similar legacy effects, especially for economically important foundation species that also served as vectors for nonnative species.",

          "abstract": "T cells have emerged as orchestrators of pain amplification, but the mechanism by which T cells control pain processing is unresolved. We found that regulatory T cells (T reg cells) could inhibit nociception through a mechanism that was not dependent on their ability to regulate immune activation and tissue repair. Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal T reg cells (mT reg cells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mT reg cells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD + sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for T reg cell–mediated immunosuppression. Thus, our findings uncovered a sexually dimorphic immunological circuit that restrains nociception, establishing T reg cells as sentinels of pain homeostasis.",

          "abstract": "Whether a gut-joint axis exists to regulate osteoarthritis is unknown. In two independent cohorts, we identified altered microbial bile acid metabolism with reduced glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in osteoarthritis. Suppressing farnesoid X receptor (FXR)—the receptor of GUDCA—alleviated osteoarthritis through intestine-secreted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in mice. GLP-1 receptor blockade attenuated these effects, whereas GLP-1 receptor activation mitigated osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis patients exhibited a lower relative abundance of Clostridium bolteae , which promoted the formation of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a precursor of GUDCA. Treatment with C. bolteae and Food and Drug Administration–approved UDCA alleviated osteoarthritis through the gut FXR–joint GLP-1 axis in mice. UDCA use was associated with lower risk of osteoarthritis-related joint replacement in humans. These findings suggest that orchestrating the gut microbiota–GUDCA–intestinal FXR–GLP-1–joint pathway offers a potential strategy for osteoarthritis treatment.",

In this work, using methods borrowed from distributional semantics, we investigated compositionality in wild bonobos and found that not only does each call type of their repertoire occur in at least one compositional combination, but three of these compositional combinations also exhibit nontrivial compositionality.

Both intact adaptive immunity and metabolic niche competition are necessary for efficient vaccine-enhanced competition.

Archaeal tissues undergo a multinucleate stage followed by tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. After cellularization, tissue junction elasticity becomes akin to that of animal tissues, giving rise to two cell types—peripheral (Per) and central scutoid (Scu) cells—with distinct actin and protein glycosylation polarity patterns.

Using electrochemical probes, we found that heterogeneous, nanoparticulate Pd(0) serves as an active oxygen reduction electrocatalyst to furnish the high potential required for corrosion to form homogeneous Pd(II), which then catalyzes selective ethylene acetoxylation with reformation of heterogeneous Pd(0). Inhibiting the corrosion of Pd(0) to Pd(II) by galvanic protection results in reversible poisoning of catalysis, evincing the essential role of phase conversion in this catalytic cycle.

          "abstract": "Cyclic creep, or ratcheting, is a severe form of fatigue deformation caused by cumulative unidirectional plastic strain under asymmetrical stress cycling with a nonzero mean stress. It often causes premature failure of structural materials, and enhancing ratcheting resistance is a challenge in materials engineering. We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells. The progressively refined microstructure mitigates cyclic softening and suppresses strain localization during stress cycling, thus reducing ratcheting strain. The gradient dislocation architecture represents a promising design for high-strength, ratcheting-resistant materials.",

          "abstract": "Human high-order thalamic nuclei activity is known to closely correlate with conscious states. However, it is not clear how those thalamic nuclei and thalamocortical interactions directly contribute to the transient process of human conscious perception. We simultaneously recorded stereoelectroencephalography data from the thalamic nuclei and prefrontal cortex (PFC), while patients with implanted electrodes performed a visual consciousness task. Compared with the ventral nuclei and PFC, the intralaminar and medial nuclei presented earlier and stronger consciousness-related activity. Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the θ phase of the intralaminar and medial nuclei during conscious perception. The intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei thus play a gate role to drive the activity of the PFC during the emergence of conscious perception.",

We report that lattice strain locks Rb ions into the α-phase of the lattice of a triple-halide WBG perovskite, preventing phase segregation into a nonperovskite Rb-cesium–rich phase. This process cooperates with chloride accommodation and promotes halide homogenization across the entire film volume. The resulting 1.67–electron volt WBG perovskite exhibits photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 14% under 1-sun-equivalent irradiation, corresponding to a quasi–Fermi level splitting of ~1.34 electron volts. A WBG perovskite solar cell with an open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 1.30 volts was prepared, corresponding to 93.5% of the radiative V OC limit and representing the lowest photovoltage loss relative to the theoretical limit observed in WBG perovskites.",

          "abstract": "Exogenous messenger RNAs (mRNAs) require cellular machinery for delivery and translation but also encounter inhibitory factors. To investigate their regulation, we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens with in vitro–transcribed mRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) were identified as mediators of LNP uptake and endosomal escape, respectively. TRIM25—an RNA binding E3 ubiquitin ligase—emerged as a key suppressor inducing turnover of both linear and circular mRNAs. The endoribonucleases N4BP1 and KHNYN, along with the antiviral protein ZAP, act redundantly in TRIM25-dependent surveillance. TRIM25 specifically targets mRNAs delivered by endosomes, and its RNA affinity increases at acidic pH, suggesting activation by protons released from ruptured endosomes. N 1 -methylpseudouridine modification reduces TRIM25’s RNA binding, helping RNAs evade its suppressive effect. This study comprehensively maps cellular pathways regulating LNP-mRNAs, offering insights into RNA immunity and therapeutics.",

Conceptually, our system is analogous to a DNA transposition reaction but uses orthogonal pairs of engineered split inteins to mediate the editing process. This “protein transposition” reaction is applied to several systems, including folded protein complexes, allowing the efficient introduction of a variety of noncoded elements. By carrying out a molecular “cut and paste” under native protein-folding conditions, our approach substantially expands the scope of protein semisynthesis.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain conditions frequently coexist and share common genetic vulnerabilities. Despite evidence showing associations between pain and depression, the additive effect of co-occurring pain conditions on depression risk and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Leveraging data from 431,038 UK Biobank participants with 14-year follow-up, we found a significantly increased risk of depression incidence in individuals reporting pain, irrespective of body site or duration (acute or chronic), compared with pain-free individuals. The depression risk increased with the number of co-occurring pain sites. Mendelian randomization supported potential causal inference. We constructed a composite pain score by combining individual effects of acute or chronic pain conditions across eight body sites in a weighted manner. We found that depression risks increased monotonically in parallel with composite pain scores. Moreover, some inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, partially mediated the association between composite pain scores and depression risk. Considering the high prevalence of comorbid depression and pain, pain screening may help identify high-risk individuals for depression.",

          "abstract": "Autocatalytic reactions driving the self-assembly of biological polymers are important for the origin of life, yet few experimental examples of such reactions exist. Here we report an autocatalytic assembly pathway that generates a chimeric, amino acid–bridged aminoacyl-RNA synthetase ribozyme. The noncovalent complex of ribozyme fragments initiates low-level aminoacylation of one of the fragments, which, after loop-closing ligation, generates a highly active covalently linked chimeric ribozyme. The generation of this ribozyme is increasingly efficient over time due to the autocatalytic assembly cycle that sustains the ribozyme over indefinite cycles of serial dilution. Because of its trans activity, this ribozyme also assembles ribozymes distinct from itself, such as the hammerhead, suggesting that RNA aminoacylation, coupled with nonenzymatic ligation, could have facilitated the emergence and propagation of ribozymes.",

To this end, cold (≈50 K) antihydrogen will traverse a two-grid moiré deflectometer before annihilating onto a position-sensitive detector, which shall determine the vertical position of the annihilation vertex relative to the grids with micrometric accuracy. Here, we introduce a vertexing detector based on a modified mobile camera sensor and experimentally demonstrate that it can measure the position of antiproton annihilations within 0.62 − 0.22 + 0.40 μm, a 35-fold improvement over the previous state of the art for real-time antiproton vertexing. These methods are directly applicable to antihydrogen. Moreover, the sensitivity to light of the sensor enables in situ calibration of the moiré deflectometer, substantially reducing systematic errors. This sensor emerges as a breakthrough technology toward the AEḡIS scientific goals and will constitute the basis for the development of a large-area detector for conducting antihydrogen gravity measurements.",

While water is rich in hydrogen, its hydrogen-bonded structure exhibits only moderate NQEs. Simulations ascribe this to competing zero-point energies (ZPEs): Intermolecular ZPEs stabilize hydrogen-bonds, while intramolecular ZPEs destabilize them. However, experimental validation has been lacking due to the difficulty in quantifying NQEs. The air/water interface provides an ideal platform to quantify NQEs in liquid water using surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy. By analyzing the excess/depletion of interfacial HOD, H 2 O, and D 2 O molecules with one free OH/OD group and the other H-bonded OH/OD group, we found that the intermolecular ZPE destabilizes the hydrogen-bonds by 0.74 ± 0.20 kilojoule per mole upon isotope substitution from H to D, while the intramolecular ZPE stabilizes them by 0.78 ± 0.33 kilojoule per mole. This near-complete cancellation explains the overall moderate NQE in liquid water. The interface thus allows for quantifying NQEs in water.",

          "abstract": "Anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains, composed of IFT-B, IFT-A, and BBSome subcomplexes, are responsible for transporting ciliary proteins into the cilium. How IFT subcomplexes reach the ciliary base and assemble into IFT trains is poorly understood. Here, we perform quantitative single-molecule imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans chemosensory cilia to uncover how IFT subcomplexes arrive at the base, organize in IFT trains, and enter the cilium. We find that BBSomes reach the base via diffusion where they either associate with assembling IFT trains or with the membrane surrounding the base. In contrast, IFT-B and IFT-A reach the base via directed transport most likely on vesicles that stop at distinct locations near the base. Individual subcomplexes detach from the vesicles into a diffusive pool and associate to assembling trains. Our results show that IFT-B is first incorporated into IFT trains, followed by IFT-A, and finally BBSomes, indicating that the assembly of IFT trains is a highly regulated, step-wise process.",

Upon mtDNA replication stress, the mitochondrial genome transfers to endosomes for degradation. Using proximity biotinylation, we found that mtDNA stress leads to the rewiring of the mitochondrial proximity proteome, increasing mitochondria’s association with lysosomal and vesicle-related proteins. Among these, the retromer complex, particularly VPS35, plays a pivotal role by extracting mitochondrial components. The retromer promotes the formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles shuttled to lysosomes. The mtDNA, however, directly shuttles to a recycling organelle in a BAX-dependent manner. Moreover, using a Drosophila model carrying a long deletion on the mtDNA (ΔmtDNA), we found that ΔmtDNA activates a specific transcriptome profile to counteract mitochondrial damage. Here, Vps35 expression restores mtDNA homoplasmy and alleviates associated defects. Hence, we demonstrate the existence of a previously unknown quality control mechanism for the mitochondrial matrix and the essential role of lysosomes in mtDNA turnover to relieve mtDNA damage.",

Our continuous tree-ring δ 18 O record reveals a significant long-term drying trend over much of the Holocene ( P  &lt; 0.001), which is in line with orbital forcing and independent evidence from proxy reconstructions and model simulations.

          "abstract": "Despite 40 years of conservation of the critically endangered Chinese alligator ( Alligator sinensis ), the genomic underpinnings of its status remained uncharted. Genome sequencing data of 244 individuals uncovered relatively low overall genomic diversity/heterozygosity and long runs of homozygosity, with captive populations exhibiting higher heterozygosity and smaller inbreeding coefficients compared to wild individuals. The decreased level of inbreeding in the captive population demonstrates the contribution of the large captive breeding population. The estimated recent effective population size was around a few dozen. To combat challenges of inbreeding depression and reduced adaptability, we used genome-wide SNP-based kinship analysis on captive populations to enable a genome-informed breeding program that minimizes inbreeding. Long-term field monitoring revealed that the Chinese government greatly advanced the conservation of A. sinensis through conservation measures and reintroduction programs. Our research enriches the understanding of the Chinese alligator’s genetic landscape, offering invaluable genomic resources for breeding and conservation strategies.",

We developed a mouse model overexpressing a mutated transfer RNA synthetase in muscle fibers, enabling specific protein labeling using an artificial methionine substitute, which can be revealed through click chemistry. This model revealed that denervation increases protein labeling in oxidative muscle fibers through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, while deleting the mTORC1 scaffold protein Raptor reduces labeling in glycolytic fibers. On the other hand, increased muscle activity acutely decreases protein synthesis, accompanied by reduced mTORC1 signaling, glycogen depletion, and adenosine 5′-monophosphate kinase activation.

Using this approach, we are able to realistically reconstruct large and irregular areas of missing data and to reproduce known historical events, such as strong El Niño or La Niña events, with very little given information. Our method outperforms the widely used statistical kriging method, as well as other recent machine learning approaches. The model generalizes to higher resolutions than the ones it was trained on and can be used on a variety of climate fields.

Acid-rich concentration spikes matched the distribution of high-temperature fumaroles, whereas CO 2 is emitted broadly from high- and low-temperature fumaroles. The CO 2 flux was 15 to 41 kilograms per second from hot fumaroles and 61 to 131 kilograms per second for the overall plume. The typical CO 2 flux calculation of multiplying CO 2 /SO 2 ratio with SO 2 flux underestimates total CO 2 flux by at least threefold. We quantified substantial magmatic gas scrubbing by the hydrothermal system, with 56 to 79% of initial HCl and 33 to 68% of initial SO 2 lost. This study highlights the importance of precise acid-gas measurements for detecting heterogeneous degassing and suggests that traditional CO 2 flux measurements may substantially underestimate contributions from cold CO 2 degassing, leading to underestimated global volcanic fluxes.",

Here, we showed that dogs with Shank3 mutations exhibited behavioral and attentional avoidance of faces, contrasting with wild-type controls. Moreover, neural responses specific to faces (versus objects) recorded from the electrodes over the temporal cortex were significantly decreased and delayed in Shank3 mutants compared to wild-type controls. Cortical responses in the frontal/parietal region underlying categorization of faces by species/breeds were reduced in Shank3 mutants.

To reduce these biases, we propose FairDiffusion, an equity-aware latent diffusion model that improves both image quality and the semantic alignment of clinical features.

The flow pathway on the lyophilic TELD can be conveniently managed by regulating the competition forces along orthogonal directions at the liquid front, which is instantly realized by adjusting the mechanical strain in TELD (mode 1 regulation) or inserting extra forces at the liquid front (mode 2 regulation). Furthermore, TELD can serve as a logic gate, stress valve, microfluidic reactor, and fog collector.

Various voltage responses in the charge/discharge curves are well correlated to the nucleation, growth, and refilling of single voids. Notably, two distinct modes of Li stripping, namely, void-growth stripping and void-free stripping, are experimentally identified. We unveil the roles of stack pressure and current density on void evolutions, which suggests a mechanism of void suppression without involving plastic deformation of Li metal.

We posit that the ecologically adaptive value of alcohol attraction has not been fully explored. Here, we assert a simple yet vital biological rationale for this alcohol preference. Flies display attraction to fruits rich in alcohol, specifically ethanol and methanol, where contact results in a rapid amplification of fatty acid–derived pheromones that enhance courtship success. We also identify olfactory sensory neurons that detect these alcohols, where we reveal roles in both attraction and aversion, and show that valence is balanced around alcohol concentration. Moreover, we demonstrate that methanol can be deadly, and adult flies must therefore accurately weigh the trade-off between benefits and costs for exposure within their naturally fermented and alcohol-rich environments.",

Following and ongoing investigations of reversed Cherenkov radiation considered it impossible to occur from a homogeneous isotropic slab with a positive refractive index. Here, we break this long-held belief by finding the emergence of reversed Cherenkov radiation from a positive-index isotropic slab by exploiting optical gain. We find precise conditions under which the backward-propagating Cherenkov radiation is maintained while the forward-propagating one is suppressed. Counterintuitively, the intensity and the angular spread of reversed Cherenkov radiation can be made robust to the slab thickness.

We have three strategies to improve robustness and accuracy: pseudotemporal learning, spatial multisampling, and dynamic probability map. We achieved 83% specificity, 50% improvement in symmetric best dice (SBD) compared to literature, and outperformed baseline U-net, and achieved 91% precision with 71% sensitivity. We have demonstrated tracing individual vessel trees from fundus images, and simultaneously retain vessel hierarchy information. InSegNN paves a way for subsequent analysis of vascular morphology in relation to retinal diseases.",

This study presents a multistage machine learning (ML) approach to streamline the discovery and optimization of complex multimetallic catalysts. Our method integrates data mining, active learning, and domain adaptation throughout the materials discovery process. Unlike traditional trial-and-error methods, this approach systematically narrows the exploration space using domain knowledge with minimized reliance on subjective intuition. Then, the active learning module efficiently refines element composition and synthesis conditions through iterative experimental feedback. The process culminated in the discovery of a promising Ru-Mn-Ca-Pr oxide catalyst. Our workflow also enhances theoretical simulations with domain adaptation strategy, providing deeper mechanistic insights aligned with experimental findings. By leveraging diverse data sources and multiple ML strategies, we demonstrate an efficient pathway for electrocatalyst discovery and optimization. This comprehensive, data-driven approach represents a paradigm shift and potentially benchmark in electrocatalysts research.",

          "abstract": "Dexterous manipulation remains an aspirational goal for autonomous robotic systems, particularly when learning to lift and rotate objects against gravity with intermittent finger contacts. We use model-free reinforcement learning to compare the effect of curriculum (i.e., combinations of lift and rotation tasks) and haptic information (i.e., no-tactile versus 3D-force) on learning with a simulated three-finger robotic hand. In addition, a novel curriculum-based learning rate scheduler accelerates convergence. We demonstrate that the choice of curriculum biases the progression of learning for dexterous manipulation across objects with different weights, sizes, and shapes—underscoring the robustness of our learning approach. Unexpectedly, learning is achieved even in the absence of haptic information. This challenges conventional thinking about task “complexity” and the necessity of haptic information for dexterous manipulation for this task. This work invites the analogy of curriculum learning as a malleable developmental process from a pluripotent state driven by the nature of the learning experience.",

However, existing tools for inhibiting HGT are limited in their modes of delivery, efficacy, and scalability. Here, we present a versatile denial-of-spread (DoS) strategy to target and eliminate specific conjugative plasmids. Our strategy exploits retrotransfer, whereby an engineered DoS plasmid is introduced into host cells containing a target plasmid. Acting as a predatory gene drive, DoS propagates itself at the expense of the target plasmid, through competition or active elimination. Once the target plasmid is eradicated, DoS is removed via induced plasmid suicide, resulting in a community containing neither plasmid. The strategy is tunable and scalable for various conjugative plasmids, different mechanisms of plasmid inheritance interruption, and diverse environmental contexts. DoS represents a new tool for precise control of gene persistence in microbial communities.",

This effect is explained by intra- and intervalley scattering processes mediated by E 2g and A ′ 1 phonon modes, which we directly observe via ultrafast electron diffraction and identify via ab initio calculations. Conversely, smaller electron-hole pockets (Δ q ≃0.7 Å −1 ) result in the renormalization of in-plane plasmons, which can only be partially explained by phonon-mediated scattering and thermal expansion.

To address these limitations, we synthesized over 10 fluorophore-labeled samples to probe the conformational changes of the riboswitch at the single-molecule level. By integrating these dynamic findings with steady-state fluorescence titration, mutagenesis, in vivo assays, and strand displacement strategy, we transformed the natural aptamer into a c-di-AMP biosensor. This engineered biosensor reversed its genetic output from \"OFF\" to \"ON\" upon c-di-AMP binding, exhibiting a 50-fold improvement in the c-di-AMP detection limit. Leveraging this refined biosensor, we developed a robust strategy for high-throughput in vivo evolution of c-di-AMP synthases.",

We showed that the pseudouridine-free ribosomes have decreased thermostability and high sensitivity to aminoglycosides. When presented with a model internal ribosomal entry site RNA, elongation factor eEF2, GTP (guanosine triphosphate), and sordarin, hygromycin B preferentially binds to the pseudouridine-free ribosomes during initiation by blocking eEF2 binding, stalling ribosomes in a nonrotated conformation. The structures captured hygromycin B bound at the intersubunit bridge B2a enriched with pseudouridine and a deformed codon-anticodon duplex, revealing a functional link between pseudouridine and aminoglycoside inhibition.

Notably, we discovered that dopants with high electronegativity reduce the electron density on Cu and induce a selectivity shift toward multicarbon (C 2+ ) products.

This resolution enables the direct observation of left-handed helical DNA structures with pitches ranging from 1.59 to 2.20 nm, depending on the DNA sequence and nanotube chirality. These findings provide structural insights into the mechanisms by which DNA differentiates the chirality of SWCNTs, and governs the sensitivity, dynamic response range, and analyte differentiability of SWCNT sensors.

Here, we demonstrate formation of an unprecedented superlayer cocrystal phase via a unique smectic LC phase in the equimolar melt mixture of symmetrically distinct molecules.

Thermal analyses show that the superlayer cocrystal is exclusively induced at the equimolar mixture via melt crystallization from the LC phase. X-ray structure analysis reveals a reversible C n -(π-core)-C n ···(π-core)-C n stacking arrangement in the superlayer cocrystal, where π-cores and alkyl chains form nearly independent layers.

Here, we show that hippocampal CA1 astrocytes exhibit de novo Ca 2+ dynamics during fear extinction. Inhibition of these astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics impairs, while their activation facilitates, fear extinction. In this regulation of fear extinction, the posterior basal forebrain (pBF) cholinergic input to hippocampus drives CA1 astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics through the activation of α4 and α7 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Clinically used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil increases CA1 astrocytic Ca 2+ dynamics and facilitates fear extinction. Thus, our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized and crucial pathway from pBF cholinergic neurons to CA1 astrocytes that governs natural fear extinction.

Chiral SHG is found to be proportional to spin chirality and spin-canting-induced electric polarization, while intrinsic MSHG is proportional to the Néel vector, demonstrating their different physical mechanisms. Additionally, we reveal a unique interference effect between these two types of MSHG under the reversal of spin-canting direction, generating a giant modulation of SHG signals.

This protocol uses commercially available Ellman sulfinamide, tert -butanesulfinamide ( t BS), as the exclusive chiral source to selectively produce all possible stereoisomers. Sequential formation of contiguous α-amino chiral carbons is achieved by chirality induction and transfer mechanisms that are both enabled by t BS, the stereoselective imine functionalization and alkyne-participated rearrangement reaction.

          "abstract": "Determinants regulating sorting of host transmembrane proteins at sites of enveloped virus assembly on the plasma membrane (PM) remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the PM acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) regulates this sorting into an enveloped virus, HIV-1. Incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles has profound effects on viral spread; however, the mechanisms promoting their incorporation were unknown. We found that depletion of cellular PIP 2 blocks incorporation of CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 into HIV-1 particles. Expansion microscopy revealed that PIP 2 depletion diminishes nanoscale coclustering between viral structural protein Gag and the three transmembrane proteins at the PM and that Gag induces PIP 2 enrichment at its vicinity. CD43, PSGL-1, and CD44 also increased local PIP 2 density, revealing their PIP 2 affinity. Together, these results support a previously unknown mechanism where local enrichment of an acidic phospholipid drives coclustering between viral structural and cellular transmembrane proteins, thereby modulating the content, and hence the fate, of progeny virus particles.",

Cardiomyocytes demonstrated the most heterogeneous expression landscape among cell types caused by metabolic perturbation, and pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed dynamic cellular states transitioning from compensation to severe compromise.

Herein, we proposed a hybrid microscale biomatter coassembly strategy that leverages the interactions between the inherent microarchitectures of waste cotton fiber and pollen particles. With minimal preprocessing, they form a castable slurry that can spontaneously organize into a dense fiber-laminate bioplastic network, exhibiting high mechanical properties (52.22 megapascals and 2.24 gigapascals) without using toxic organic chemicals or heavy machinery. The resulting bioplastic features controlled hydration-induced microstructural disassembly/reassembly, enabling water-based processability into complex, dynamic architectural systems. In addition, it demonstrates good biodegradability, closed-loop recyclability, and satisfactory environmental benefits, outperforming most common plastics.

Following a prolonged withdrawal period, EtOH-exposed male rats exhibited deficits in adaptability and exploratory behavior, with aberrant outcome-driven value updating that heightened preference for chosen action. These behavioral changes were linked to altered neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), where EtOH increased outcome-related encoding and decreased choice-related encoding. In contrast, female rats showed minimal behavioral changes with distinct EtOH-evoked alterations of neural activity, revealing significant sex differences in the impact of chronic EtOH.

We report that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ligand spin immobilization demonstrate superior chemispintronic sensitivity and selectivity toward nitric oxide. Tetrathiafulvalene radical cations (TTF· + ) within the MOF lattice considerably enhance the nitric oxide recognition via spin exchange interactions, leading to a five–order of magnitude reduction in the limit of detection (LOD), as compared to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via carrier-doping mechanism.

We introduce SHINE, the Self-supervised High-throughput Image denoising Neural network for Electron microscopy, accelerating minimally invasive low-dose EM of diverse material systems. SHINE uses only a single raw image dataset with intrinsic noise, which makes it suitable for limited-size datasets and eliminates the need for expensive ground-truth training datasets.

Trpm7 deletion in MuSCs reduced Mg 2+ influx, impairing myofiber regeneration and leading to decreased MuSC numbers and cell cycle arrest during regeneration. These changes were linked to disrupted mTOR signaling, which drives the transition of MuSCs from G 0 to G Alert phase. In addition, Trpm7 -deficient MuSCs exhibited impaired early responses, including quiescent projection retraction and AP-1 induction. Mg 2+ supplementation rescued these defects, restoring normal MuSC activation.

Here, we present spectroscopic evidence for a magnonic SRPT in ErFeO 3 , where the role of the photonic mode (two-level atoms) in the photonic SRPT is played by an Fe 3+ magnon mode (Er 3+ spins). The absence of the diamagnetic term in the Fe 3+ -Er 3+ exchange coupling ensures that the no-go theorem does not apply. Ultrabroadband terahertz and gigahertz magnetospectroscopy experiments revealed the signatures of the SRPT in thermal equilibrium, a kink and a softening, respectively, of two spin-magnon hybridized modes at the critical point.

We determine the structure of the holo insertase complex, where SurA binds BAM for substrate delivery. High-resolution cryo–electron microscopy structures of four different states and a three-dimensional variability analysis show that the holo insertase complex has a large motional spectrum. SurA bound to BAM can undergo a large swinging motion between two states. This motion is uncoupled from the conformational flexibility of the BamA barrel, which can open and close without affecting SurA binding. Notably, we observed conformational coupling of the SurA swing state and the carboxyl-terminal helix grip domain of BamC.

          "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the rapidly growing neurodegenerative diseases, affecting more than 10 million people worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis of PD is highly desirable for therapeutic interventions but remains a substantial challenge. We developed a soft, portable intelligent keyboard leveraging magnetoelasticity to detect subtle pressure variations in keystroke dynamics by converting continuous keystrokes into high-fidelity electrical signals, thus enabling the quantitative analysis of PD motor symptoms using machine learning. Relying on a fundamental working mechanism, the intelligent keyboard demonstrates highly sensitive, intrinsically waterproof, and biocompatible properties, with the successful demonstration in a pilot study on patients with PD. To facilitate the potential continuous monitoring of PD, a customized cellphone application was developed to integrate the intelligent keyboard into a wireless platform. Together, the intelligent keyboard system’s compelling properties position it as a promising tool for advancing early diagnosis and facilitating personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches to PD healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Developing artificial systems with autonomous motion is essential for creating devices that emulate nature’s adaptive mechanisms. Here, we introduce a light-driven liquid crystalline network snapper that integrates both sensing and actuation capabilities, enabling adaptive responses to environmental conditions. Under constant light illumination, the snapper undergoes spontaneous snap-through transformation driven by the elastic instability embedded within the material. The snapper achieves out-of-equilibrium motion through continuous energy transfer with the environment, enabling it to sustain dynamic, reversible cycles of snapping without external control. We demonstrate the ability of the liquid crystalline network snapper to detect environmental changes—such as shifts in temperature, surface roughness, and color—demonstrating a form of embodied intelligence. This work offers a distinctive strategy for designing biomimetic devices that merge embodied intelligence with autonomous motion, opening pathways for advanced, adaptive systems for soft robotics.",
