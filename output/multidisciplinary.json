          "abstract": "Ferrous iron (Fe2+) is essential in all eukaryotic cells for various oxidoreductase reactions, including the demethylation of DNA and proteins. Histone demethylation is required for normal epigenetic regulation of the Y-chromosomal sex-determining gene Sry in developing gonads during male sex determination1,2. Here we investigate the potential connection between iron metabolism, histone demethylation and sex determination in mammals. We found that Fe2+-producing pathways are substantially activated in mouse embryonic gonads during the sex-determining period. Chelation of iron in cultured XY gonads reduced the level of KDM3A-mediated H3K9 demethylation of Sry, mostly abolished Sry expression and caused the gonads to express ovarian markers. In vivo, conditional deletion of the gene Tfrc—which is required for iron incorporation—in fetal XY gonadal somatic cells, or acute pharmaceutical suppression of available iron in pregnant mice, resulted in male-to-female gonadal sex reversal in a proportion of offspring, highlighting the pivotal role of iron metabolism in male sex determination. Finally, long-term feeding of pregnant mice with a low-iron diet, when combined with a heterozygous variant of Kdm3a that by itself has no observable effect, suppressed Sry expression and caused male-to-female sex reversal in some of the progeny, revealing a connection between maternal dietary iron and fetal developmental outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons (DANs) signal reward-prediction errors that teach recipient circuits about expected rewards1. However, DANs are thought to provide a substrate for temporal difference (TD) reinforcement learning (RL), an algorithm that learns the mean of temporally discounted expected future rewards, discarding useful information about experienced distributions of reward amounts and delays2. Here we present time–magnitude RL (TMRL), a multidimensional variant of distributional RL that learns the joint distribution of future rewards over time and magnitude. We also uncover signatures of TMRL-like computations in the activity of optogenetically identified DANs in mice during behaviour. Specifically, we show that there is significant diversity in both temporal discounting and tuning for the reward magnitude across DANs. These features allow the computation of a two-dimensional, probabilistic map of future rewards from just 450 ms of the DAN population response to a reward-predictive cue. Furthermore, reward-time predictions derived from this code correlate with anticipatory behaviour, suggesting that similar information is used to guide decisions about when to act. Finally, by simulating behaviour in a foraging environment, we highlight the benefits of a joint probability distribution of reward over time and magnitude in the face of dynamic reward landscapes and internal states. These findings show that rich probabilistic reward information is learnt and communicated to DANs, and suggest a simple, local-in-time extension of TD algorithms that explains how such information might be acquired and computed.",

          "abstract": "Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) describe a broad range of phenomena in condensed matter and particle physics. A prominent example is confinement, responsible for bounding quarks inside hadrons such as protons or neutrons1. When quark–antiquark pairs are separated, the energy stored in the string of gluon fields connecting them grows linearly with their distance, until there is enough energy to create new pairs from the vacuum and break the string. Although these phenomena are ubiquitous in LGTs, simulating the resulting dynamics is a challenging task2. Here we report the observation of string breaking in synthetic quantum matter using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays3,4,5. We show that a (2 + 1)-dimensional LGT with dynamical matter can be efficiently implemented when the atoms are placed on a Kagome geometry6, with a local U(1) symmetry emerging from the Rydberg blockade7. Long-range Rydberg interactions naturally give rise to a linear confining potential for a pair of charges, allowing us to tune both their masses and the string tension. We experimentally probe string breaking in equilibrium by adiabatically preparing the ground state of the atom array in the presence of defects, distinguishing regions within the confined phase dominated by fluctuating strings or by broken string configurations. Finally, by harnessing local control over the atomic detuning, we quench string states and observe string-breaking dynamics exhibiting a many-body resonance phenomenon. Our work provides opportunities for exploring phenomena in high-energy physics using programmable quantum simulators.",

However, accurately resolving the local metal coordination environments remains challenging, hindering the advancement of structure–activity relationships needed to optimize their design for diverse applications 1,2 . Although electron microscopy reveals atomic dispersion, conventional spectroscopic methods used in heterogeneous catalysis only provide average structural information. Here we demonstrate that 195 Pt solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing atomically dispersed Pt sites on various supports, so called single-atom catalysts (SACs). Monte Carlo simulations allow the conversion of NMR spectra into SAC signatures that describe coordination environments with molecular precision, enabling quantitative assessment of Pt-site distribution and homogeneity. This methodology can track the influence of synthetic parameters, uncovering the impact of specific steps and support types, and can also monitor changes upon reaction. It offers critical insights for the reproducible development of SACs with targeted structures. Beyond SACs, this approach lays the foundation for studying more complex architectures, such as dual-atom or single-cluster catalysts, containing various NMR-active metals.",

          "abstract": "Microangiopathy is a major complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes to the acute and chronic complications of the disease1. Endotheliopathy and dysregulated blood coagulation are prominent in COVID-19 and are considered to be major causes of microvascular obstruction1,2. Here we demonstrate extensive endothelial cell (EC) death in the microvasculature of COVID-19 organs. Notably, EC death was not associated with fibrin formation or platelet deposition, but was linked to microvascular red blood cell (RBC) haemolysis. Importantly, this RBC microangiopathy was associated with ischaemia–reperfusion injury, and was prominent in the microvasculature of humans with myocardial infarction, gut ischaemia, stroke, and septic and cardiogenic shock. Mechanistically, ischaemia induced MLKL-dependent EC necroptosis and complement-dependent RBC haemolysis. Deposition of haemolysed RBC membranes at sites of EC death resulted in the development of a previously unrecognized haemostatic mechanism preventing microvascular bleeding. Exaggeration of this haemolytic response promoted RBC aggregation and microvascular obstruction. Genetic deletion of Mlkl from ECs decreased RBC haemolysis, microvascular obstruction and reduced ischaemic organ injury. Our studies demonstrate the existence of a RBC haemostatic mechanism induced by dying ECs, functioning independently of platelets and fibrin. Therapeutic targeting of this haemolytic process may reduce microvascular obstruction in COVID-19, and other major human diseases associated with organ ischaemia.",

          "abstract": "To thrive in complex environments, animals and artificial agents must learn to act adaptively to maximize fitness and rewards. Such adaptive behaviour can be learned through reinforcement learning1, a class of algorithms that has been successful at training artificial agents2,3,4,5 and at characterizing the firing of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain6,7,8. In classical reinforcement learning, agents discount future rewards exponentially according to a single timescale, known as the discount factor. Here we explore the presence of multiple timescales in biological reinforcement learning. We first show that reinforcement agents learning at a multitude of timescales possess distinct computational benefits. Next, we report that dopaminergic neurons in mice performing two behavioural tasks encode reward prediction error with a diversity of discount time constants. Our model explains the heterogeneity of temporal discounting in both cue-evoked transient responses and slower timescale fluctuations known as dopamine ramps. Crucially, the measured discount factor of individual neurons is correlated across the two tasks, suggesting that it is a cell-specific property. Together, our results provide a new paradigm for understanding functional heterogeneity in dopaminergic neurons and a mechanistic basis for the empirical observation that humans and animals use non-exponential discounts in many situations9,10,11,12, and open new avenues for the design of more-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.",

          "abstract": "Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere 1,2 . Until now, CO 2 and CH 4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration 3–6 . Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO 2 and CH 4 . Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 ± 17% of global river CO 2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 ± 0.3 Pg C year −1 , similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models.",

          "abstract": "RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters1,2,3,4,5,6,7. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)8,9,10,11 and elongation complex (EC)12,13,14,15,16 have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4–13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6–13). Together with KMnO4 footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC–EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA–DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC–EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation–elongation transition for an RNA polymerase.",

          "abstract": "North Atlantic Ocean circulation and temperature patterns profoundly influence global and regional climate across all timescales, from synoptic 1 to seasonal 2–4 , decadal 5 , multidecadal 6,7 and beyond 8,9 . During 2023, an extreme and near-basin-scale marine heatwave developed during Northern Hemisphere summer, peaking in July. The warming spread across virtually all regions of the North Atlantic, including the subpolar ocean, where a cooling trend over the past 50–100 years has been linked to a slowdown in the meridional overturning circulation 10,11 . Yet the mechanisms that led to this exceptional surface ocean warming remain unclear. Here we use observationally constrained atmospheric reanalyses alongside ocean observations and model simulations to show that air–sea heat fluxes acting on an extremely shallow surface mixed layer, rather than anomalous ocean heat transport, were responsible for this extreme ocean warming event. The dominant driver is shown to be anomalously weak winds leading to strongly shoaling (shallowing) mixed layers, resulting in a rapid temperature increase in a shallow surface layer of the North Atlantic. Furthermore, solar radiation anomalies made regional-scale warming contributions in locations that approximately correspond to some of the region’s main shipping lanes, suggesting that reduced sulfate emissions could also have played a localized role. With a trend towards shallower mixed layers observed over recent decades, and projections that this will continue into the future, the severity of North Atlantic marine heatwaves is set to worsen.",

In tumours, epithelial LOY is also associated with poor survival4,5,6,7. This raises several fundamental questions, such as why LOY in PBMCs drives cancer mortality and whether there is a relationship between LOY in PBMCs, PBMC-derived immune cells and cancer cells (and, if so, what its consequences are). We sought to answer these questions through a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data from 29 human tumour types, along with autochthonous and syngeneic mouse models. In human and mouse tumours, malignant epithelial cells had the highest LOY prevalence, yet LOY was also present in tumour stromal and immune cells, with LOY in malignant epithelial cells predicting LOY in benign cells. LOY also correlated between paired tumour and PBMC samples from patients. Among benign cells, LOY induced the strongest shift in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with both showing transcriptomic signatures of immunosuppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of LOY in epithelial cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells independently predicts survival, with tumours exhibiting concurrent epithelial and T cell LOY having the worst outcomes. Here we establish a model that links LOY in immune cells to LOY in malignant cells, which may explain in part why LOY in PBMCs is associated with increased cancer mortality.",

Here, by developing an ensemble of high-resolution global drought datasets for 1901–2022, we find an increasing trend in drought severity worldwide. Our findings suggest that AED has increased drought severity by an average of 40% globally. Not only are typically dry regions becoming drier but also wet areas are experiencing drying trends. During the past 5 years (2018–2022), the areas in drought have expanded by 74% on average compared with 1981–2017, with AED contributing to 58% of this increase. The year 2022 was record-breaking, with 30% of the global land area affected by moderate and extreme droughts, 42% of which was attributed to increased AED. Our findings indicate that AED has an increasingly important role in driving severe droughts and that this tendency will likely continue under future warming scenarios.",

In Drosophila , visual projection neurons (VPNs) 3,4 perform this visuomotor transformation by converting retinal positional information into synapse number in the brain 5 . The molecular basis of this phenomenon remains unknown. We addressed this issue in LPLC2 (ref. 6 ), a VPN type that detects looming motion and preferentially drives escape behaviour to stimuli approaching from the dorsal visual field with progressively weaker responses ventrally. This correlates with a dorsoventral gradient of synaptic inputs into and outputs from LPLC2. Here we report that LPLC2 neurons sampling different regions of visual space exhibit graded expression of cell recognition molecules matching these synaptic gradients. Dpr13 shapes LPLC2 outputs by binding DIP-ε in premotor descending neurons mediating escape. Beat-VI shapes LPLC2 inputs by binding Side-II in upstream motion-detecting neurons. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments show that these molecular gradients act instructively to determine synapse number. These patterns, in turn, fine-tune the perception of the stimulus and drive the behavioural response. Similar transcriptomic variation within neuronal types is observed in the vertebrate brain 7 and may shape synapse number via gradients of cell recognition molecules acting through both genetically hard-wired programs and experience.",

          "abstract": "Topological insulators were originally discovered for electron waves in condensed-matter systems. Recently, this concept has been transferred to bosonic systems such as photons1 and phonons2, which propagate in materials patterned with artificial lattices that emulate spin-Hall physics. This work has been motivated, in part, by the prospect of topologically protected transport along edge channels in on-chip circuits2,3. In principle, topology protects propagation against backscattering, but not against loss, which has remained limited to the dB cm−1 level for phononic waveguides, whether topological4,5,6,7 or not8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19. Here we combine advanced dissipation engineering20—in particular, the recently introduced method of soft clamping21—with the concept of valley-Hall topological insulators for phonons22,23,24,25,26. This enables on-chip phononic waveguides with propagation losses due to dissipation of 3 dB km−1 at room temperature, orders of magnitude below any previous chip-scale devices. The low losses also allow us to accurately quantify backscattering protection in topological phononic waveguides, using high-resolution ultrasound spectroscopy. We infer that phonons follow a sharp, 120° bend with a 99.99% probability instead of being scattered back, and less than one phonon in a million is lost. Our work will inspire new research directions on ultralow-loss phononic waveguides and will provide a clean bosonic system for investigating topological protection and non-Hermitian topological physics.",

          "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are thought to create subcellular microenvironments that have different physicochemical properties compared with their surrounding nucleoplasm or cytoplasm 1–5 . However, probing the microenvironments of condensates and their relationship to biological function is a major challenge because tools to selectively manipulate specific condensates in living cells are limited 6–9 . Here, we develop a non-natural micropeptide (that is, the killswitch) and a nanobody-based recruitment system as a universal approach to probe endogenous condensates, and demonstrate direct links between condensate microenvironments and function in cells. The killswitch is a hydrophobic, aromatic-rich sequence with the ability to self-associate, and has no homology to human proteins. When recruited to endogenous and disease-specific condensates in human cells, the killswitch immobilized condensate-forming proteins, leading to both predicted and unexpected effects. Targeting the killswitch to the nucleolar protein NPM1 altered nucleolar composition and reduced the mobility of a ribosomal protein in nucleoli. Targeting the killswitch to fusion oncoprotein condensates altered condensate compositions and inhibited the proliferation of condensate-driven leukaemia cells. In adenoviral nuclear condensates, the killswitch inhibited partitioning of capsid proteins into condensates and suppressed viral particle assembly. The results suggest that the microenvironment within cellular condensates has an essential contribution to non-stoichiometric enrichment and mobility of effector proteins. The killswitch is a widely applicable tool to alter the material properties of endogenous condensates and, as a consequence, to probe functions of condensates linked to diverse physiological and pathological processes.",

          "abstract": "Studies of ancient DNA from cemeteries provide valuable insights into early human societies, and have strongly indicated patrilocality 1–10 . Here, we analysed ancient DNA alongside archaeological contexts and multiple stable isotopic data from 60 individuals in 2 separate cemeteries at the Fujia archaeological site in eastern China, dating between 2750 and 2500 bce . Our findings suggest the existence of an early-described matrilineal community in the Neolithic period, characterized by high endogamy and a population practicing millet agriculture near the coast. Evidence of intermarriage between individuals in the two cemeteries and the presence of both primary and secondary burials, organized strictly according to maternal clans, underscore a strong sense of social cohesion and identity at Fujia. Bayesian modelling of radiocarbon dates indicates that the two cemeteries were used for approximately 250 years, implying a stable matrilineal lineage spanning at least 10 generations. This study contributes to the ongoing debate in anthropology and archaeology 11 , not only suggesting the existence of a matrilineal society in early human history but also revealing a pair of Neolithic cemeteries organized around two matrilineal clans, furthering our understanding of the early evolution of human societies through kinship systems.",

          "abstract": "Clot-induced blockage in arteries or veins can cause severe medical conditions1. Mechanical thrombectomy is a minimally invasive technique used to treat ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism and peripheral vascular disease2,3,4 by removing clots through aspiration5, stent retriever6 or cutting mechanisms7. However, current mechanical thrombectomy methods fail to remove clots in 10–30% of patients8,9,10, especially in the case of large, fibrin-rich clots11. These methods can also rupture and fragment clots12, causing distal emboli and poor outcomes13. To overcome these challenges, we develop the milli-spinner thrombectomy, which uses a simple yet innovative mechanics concept to modify the clot’s microstructure, facilitating its removal. The milli-spinner works by mechanically densifying the clot’s fibrin network and releasing red blood cells through spinning-induced compression and shear forces. It can shrink the clot volume by 95% for easy and fast removal. In vitro tests in pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in vivo experiments in swine models demonstrate that the milli-spinner achieves ultrafast clot debulking and high-fidelity revascularization, outperforming aspiration thrombectomy. The milli-spinner thrombectomy directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, improving mechanical thrombectomy success rates compared with current methods that rely on clot rupture or cutting. This approach offers a promising new direction for mechanical thrombectomy devices, especially for treating ischaemic stroke, pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombosis.",

Gottesman–Kitaev–Preskill (GKP) states1 offer one of the most attractive classes of such qubit encodings, as they enable the implementation of universal gate sets with straightforward, deterministic and room temperature-compatible Gaussian operations2. Existing pioneering demonstrations generating optical GKP states3 and other complex non-Gaussian states4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 have relied on free-space optical components, hindering the scaling eventually required for a utility-scale system. Here we use an ultra-low-loss integrated photonic chip fabricated on a customized multilayer silicon nitride 300-mm wafer platform, coupled over fibre with high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors, to generate GKP qubit states. These states show critical mode-level features necessary for fault tolerance, including at least four resolvable peaks in both p and q quadratures, and a clear lattice structure of negative Wigner function regions, in this case a 3 × 3 grid. We also show that our GKP states show sufficient structure to indicate that the devices used to make them could, after further reduction in optical losses, yield states for the fault-tolerant regime. This experiment validates a key pillar of bosonic architectures for photonic quantum computing2,12, paving the way for arrays of GKP sources that will supply future fault-tolerant machines.",

Here we used fluorescent tracers in Prox1–GFP lymphatic reporter mice to map the pathway of CSF outflow through lymphatics to superficial cervical lymph nodes. CSF entered initial lymphatics in the meninges at the skull base and continued through extracranial periorbital, olfactory, nasopharyngeal and hard palate lymphatics, and then through smooth muscle-covered superficial cervical lymphatics to submandibular lymph nodes. Tracer studies in adult mice revealed that a substantial amount of total CSF outflow to the neck drained to superficial cervical lymph nodes. However, aged mice had fewer lymphatics in the nasal mucosa and hard palate and reduced CSF outflow to cervical lymph nodes. Superficial cervical lymphatics in aged mice had increased endothelial cell expression of Nos3, encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), but had less eNOS protein and impaired nitric oxide signalling. Manipulation of superficial cervical lymphatics through intact skin by a force-regulated mechanical device doubled CSF outflow and corrected drainage impairment in aged mice. This manipulation increased CSF outflow by compressing superficial cervical lymphatics while having little effect on their normal spontaneous contractions. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of superficial cervical lymphatics for CSF outflow and the potential for reversing CSF drainage impairment by non-invasive mechanical stimulation.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CAR-NK cell activity remain unclear. Here we identify the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) as a crucial regulator of NK cell function. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant induction of CREM in CAR-NK cells during the peak of effector function after adoptive transfer in a tumour mouse model, and this peak coincided with signatures of both activation and dysfunction. We demonstrate that both CAR activation and interleukin-15 signalling rapidly induce CREM upregulation in NK cells. Functionally, CREM deletion enhances CAR-NK cell effector function both in vitro and in vivo and increases resistance to tumour-induced immunosuppression after rechallenge. Mechanistically, we establish that induction of CREM is mediated by the PKA–CREB signalling pathway, which can be activated by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif signalling downstream of CAR activation or by interleukin-15. Finally, our findings reveal that CREM exerts its regulatory functions through epigenetic reprogramming of CAR-NK cells. Our results provide support for CREM as a therapeutic target to enhance the antitumour efficacy of CAR-NK cells.",

Deconstruction of materials from multiple sectors demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, providing clean fibres from 2 h reactions. The optimal conditions were scaled to 80.0 g of post-consumer CFRPs, and demonstrative composites were fabricated from the recycled carbon fibres, which were recycled two more times, maintaining their strength throughout. Process modelling and techno-economic analysis, with feedstock cost informed by wind turbine blade waste generation8, indicates this method is cost effective, with a minimum selling price of US$1.50 per kg for recycled carbon fibres whereas life cycle assessment shows process greenhouse gas emissions around 99% lower than virgin carbon fibre production.

Cryo-electron microscopy structures of SMARCAD1 bound to the nucleosome and hexasome provide mechanistic insights into the substrate selectivity. SMARCAD1 binds to the hexasome through multiple family-specific elements that are essential for the functions in vitro and in cells. The enzyme binds to the canonical nucleosome in an inactive conformation, which accounts for its diminished activity towards the nucleosome. Notably, the histone chaperone FACT complex acts synergistically with H2A–H2B to promote the activity of SMARCAD1 in nucleosome remodelling. Together, our findings reveal an avenue for chromatin regulation, whereby subnucleosomes are remodelled through an ATP-dependent process.",

Combined analysis of chromatin accessibility and enhancer mapping identified impairment of activity of the colonic lineage-specifying transcription factor HNF4A as a key mediator of these observed phenotypes.

Studying dynamical properties of emergent phases can be challenging, as it requires solving many-body problems that are generally beyond perturbative limits8,9,10. Here we investigate the dynamics of local excitations in a \\({{\\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}\\) LGT using a two-dimensional lattice of superconducting qubits. We first construct a simple variational circuit that prepares low-energy states that have a large overlap with the ground state; then we create charge excitations with local gates and simulate their quantum dynamics by means of a discretized time evolution. As the electric field coupling constant is increased, our measurements show signatures of transitioning from deconfined to confined dynamics. For confined excitations, the electric field induces a tension in the string connecting them. Our method allows us to experimentally image string dynamics in a (2+1)D LGT, from which we uncover two distinct regimes inside the confining phase: for weak confinement, the string fluctuates strongly in the transverse direction, whereas for strong confinement, transverse fluctuations are effectively frozen11,12. We also demonstrate a resonance condition at which dynamical string breaking is facilitated.

          "abstract": "Credit: MirageC/Getty\n\nA few years ago, I was contacted by someone I had studied with as an undergraduate. He was leading a large team at a marketing and communications agency and invited me to chat. He introduced me to the agency’s chief executive, who was planning an event and wanted me to give a seminar inspired by one of my publications on how stress and anxiety can spread from leaders to their team members. Her tone was enthusiastic and genuine, and the connection felt personal. I agreed to help shape the session.\n\nWe had three meetings. I adjusted the content to fit the audience. I drafted an outline. And although I mentioned a fee during the first two calls, I waited until the final exchange to send an actual quote in writing. It was a symbolic amount, far below market rate — and more of an honorarium, given the personal connection.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nI followed up.\n\nNot a word.\n\nNo pushback. No negotiation. No ‘thanks but no thanks’. Just silence.\n\nThat silence was the clearest message possible: my time was valuable to the agency only if it was free.\n\nThe greater good\n\nExperiences like this are common in academia. Corporations and public-sector organizations routinely reach out to academics across disciplines, asking for expertise, insights or participation. The offer is framed as an ‘opportunity’. Sometimes the organizations mention visibility; sometimes they dangle the vague possibility of future collaboration, or free or discounted services. What’s almost never on the table?\n\nMoney.\n\nCollection: Time management\n\nLet’s be clear, this is unpaid labour. And, in many cases, the offer is structured that way deliberately. Yes, researchers often conduct unpaid work that serves our academic community: the scholarly ecosystem depends on everyone to pitch in, from serving on committees to peer review (which can raise issues related to, but slightly separate from, the ones I'm highlighting here). Plus, many of us have a romanticized idea that we should share our knowledge freely, as part of some higher mission. That the work is its own reward.\n\nAnd so we overcommit. We publish, teach, mentor, review, advise, engage and serve, all while chasing grant money to justify our existence. Especially for early-career researchers, the pressure to be ‘seen’ can be intense. Saying no feels like self-sabotage. Worse, many researchers worry that asking for payment will make them look difficult or entitled.\n\nBut every time we accept unpaid external work, we reinforce a broken norm. We teach organizations that academic insight is free. We lower the bar for what counts as professional respect. And we participate, whether we realize it or not, in the erosion of our own boundaries. Plus, there’s the opportunity cost of the time we’ve given away — the loss of the chance to do something else with that time.\n\nNot all unpaid work is bad. There are causes worth supporting and people worth helping. But researchers should be selective and support causes that align with their values. Unpaid work should be the exception, not the rule.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to shift the narrative, which have helped me to protect my time and value as a professional.\n\nSet clear fees or ‘rate sheets’\n\nEven if it’s just a short document outlining what you charge for a lecture, workshop or advisory session, having a tangible list of services and fees forces you and any prospective partner to treat your labour as professional work. Adjust rates as needed for non-profit organizations or public-interest endeavours. But don’t let your default be ‘free’.\n\nCollection: Work-life balance",

The main challenge is keeping the lab sterile to make sure that the plant material we culture is not contaminated, which is why I’m wearing disposable clean-room overalls.\n\nIn Asia, ginseng is valued for its restorative properties. Work in recent years has shown that it contains around 200 bioactive compounds. Some of those are known as ginsenosides, which can interact with ion channels and cell receptors. These ginsenosides show anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal activity in humans. There are even studies showing anti-tumour activity (S. Kim et al. Processes 9, 1344; 2021).\n\nMy research, however, focuses less on ginseng’s medical background and more on how to grow a greater amount of it. The plant is not found in Indonesia’s tropical climate — it only grows in the subtropics — and typically takes four to six years to be ready to harvest. We are using plant tissue culture to produce a local source that we can grow in eight weeks. To do this, we use a method known as hairy-root culture, which uses the soil bacterium Rhizobium rhizogenes to infect plant roots, causing them to grow abnormally fast in artificial media without producing stems or leaves. The photo shows cultivation in 18-litre bioreactors that produce 2.5 kilograms of ginseng root, starting from only 150 grams. We are using a similar technology to grow red ginger (Zingiber officinale), one of Indonesia’s native herbal plants.",

          "abstract": "After Hurricane Helene hit the United States in September 2024, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) implemented standard disaster-response measures. Many of Florida’s residents are familiar with FEMA, because of their state’s long collaboration with the agency. But many people living in North Carolina and Tennessee were not. False claims that FEMA was confiscating land and diverting funds from affected residents to migrants gained traction on social media. These prompted community members to be suspicious of FEMA workers, triggering violence and delaying aid and recovery in these areas.\n\nThe erosion of trust in public institutions is a pressing problem for governments. It hinders their ability to respond to challenges, such as extreme weather and pandemics, and to coordinate collective action during crises. Misinformation spread during disasters further undermines people’s confidence in official guidance.\n\nScience’s big problem is a loss of influence, not a loss of trust\n\nThe message for public agencies is clear: engage with communities long before a crisis occurs, so that they know what to do. Trust must be built through participatory processes. Collaboration with trusted local sources can help to strengthen both disaster-risk knowledge and preparedness. Local and national authorities, including weather agencies, must proactively develop transparent communication channels, making their services known and accessible, so that people can distinguish official information from disingenuous claims in times of crisis.\n\nToo often, governments assume that there is universal trust in the public establishment — overlooking how experiences of injustice and discrimination have created deep divisions between some communities and the institutions meant to serve them. Black communities in the United States, for instance, have long been facing health inequities.\n\nMisinformation gains traction when people feel their voices are not heard. This means that listening to local populations and addressing their concerns is key to establishing trusting relationships. Yet, as a social scientist working with communities in crisis situations, I’ve seen how often communities’ needs and experiences are overlooked.\n\nMisinformation poses a bigger threat to democracy than you might think",

          "title": "The polar regions hold crucial scientific secrets — and the time to study them is running out",
          "authors": "Marc Macias-Fauria",
          "abstract": "Ends of the Earth: Journeys to the Polar Regions in Search of Life, the Cosmos, and Our Future Neil Shubin Dutton (2025)\n\nOn his first fossil-hunting expedition to the Arctic regions of Greenland in 1988, evolutionary biologist and science writer Neil Shubin felt utterly disoriented. It was daylight around the clock, with the sun sweeping a great ellipse across the sky. Life’s rhythm was determined not by light, but by sound; glacially fed rivers roared at midday but, by 3 a.m., had faded to quiet trickles.\n\nAs the Arctic and Antarctica grow warmer, the fragile window available to us for understanding these icy outposts and the planetary processes they control is rapidly closing, writes Shubin in Ends of the Earth, an ambitious and far-reaching introduction to the polar regions. He explores polar science through the work of leading researchers and examines broader issues, such as how melting ice is beginning to expose microorganisms previously unknown to science.\n\nClimate change reveals secrets of our ancestors hidden in the ice\n\nHe weaves his own story, and those of his collaborators, into a broader narrative that touches on geopolitical issues and the lives of pioneering explorers. The book is packed with information, such as the fact that the polar ice caps have existed for only about 10% of Earth’s history. The origin and evolution of Homo sapiens, and the species’ migration out of Africa, occurred at a moment when Earth’s physical geography — its coastlines, islands and ocean levels — was defined by “the amount of water locked in polar ice”, Shubin writes.\n\nAnd that is the book’s key insight. The polar regions drive global climate, environmental dynamics and even human evolution — and have done so for millions of years. This helps to explain why the poles are so crucial to policy debates about climate change. The permafrost holds 1,500 billion tonnes of carbon — about twice the amount in the atmosphere.\n\nA second point highlighted by the author is the unique value of the polar regions for scientific discovery, owing to their extreme and unusual physical conditions. For example, Antarctica’s dry, stable air and vast ice sheets make it one of the best places on Earth to collect interstellar dust, which settles and is preserved in the snow.\n\nLayers of history\n\nThe layered structure of polar ice acts as a natural archive of Earth’s climate history, allowing scientists to reconstruct past temperatures. And the polar regions host extraordinary forms of life. Ecosystems in Antarctic subglacial lakes — buried some 3 kilometres beneath the ice — might have evolved in complete isolation for millions of years, and some microbes in the pitch-dark conditions can metabolize minerals to survive. Research into these habitats can offer rare insights into life in extreme environments, Shubin writes.\n\nHowever, by focusing so much on ice sheets, the author unintentionally reinforces the idea that the polar regions are defined by glacial ice. This might apply to Antarctica, a whole continent covered by ice, but is not true of the Arctic, whose landscapes include tundra and, by most reckonings, forests. Much of that region remained unglaciated even in the last ice age.\n\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914–17), led by Ernest Shackleton, aimed to make the first land crossing of Antarctica.Credit: Smith Archive/Alamy\n\nShubin notes how a definition of the Arctic is elusive. It has been framed over the centuries by various markers, including the northern tree line, the Arctic Circle and political or cultural boundaries. Yet, in the book, the Arctic is widely portrayed mainly as Greenland and the heavily glaciated high Arctic archipelagos — regions that most resemble Antarctica.\n\nFrom crevasse falls to polar bears, train fieldwork leaders for emergencies",

          "title": "How do I choose a principal investigator for my next postdoc?",
          "authors": "Nikki Forrester",
          "abstract": "Illustration: David Parkins\nThe problem\n\nDear Nature,\n\nI am a postdoc working at an academic institute. I admire my principal investigator (PI) and am working on a project that fits my skill set and interests. However, before this position, I had two difficult experiences in consecutive postdoc jobs that led me to leave both labs. During my interviews, the PIs and I discussed working on projects that I was passionate about, but when I joined each lab, I was assigned to other projects that didn’t align with my interests. The PIs were also unclear about where my funding came from. For instance, after working in my first postdoc position for several months, I found out that my salary was being paid by another PI in the department. At the time, I felt misled. These positions weren’t what I signed up for.\n\nI tried to discuss my concerns with both PIs, but ultimately felt that my only option was to look for new positions. I’m now in my third postdoc role in three years, which doesn’t look great for job applications. My new PI has been transparent about funding, and the projects I’m working on are what I expected, but I’m still having a hard time trusting him. How does someone choose the right PI? — An uncertain computer scientist\n\nThe advice\n\nNature’s careers team reached out to two academics and two career coaches for advice.\n\n“You did exactly the right thing by moving on,” says Emma Williams, founder of the Nerd Coach, an academic coaching business in Cambridge, UK. The relationship between a PI and postdoc “is so key to everything in your career going forwards”.\n\nIn terms of choosing the right PI for a postdoc, all four said the first step is self-reflection. “Start by identifying what you want to get out of your postdoc,” says LaShan Hendrix, a biomedical engineer at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. “Do you want to get more papers? Do you want to take on a new role? Do you want teaching or grant-writing experience?”\n\nNine books to help shape your science career in 2025\n\nThen, Hendrix suggests, explore what mentoring style you like. Do you prefer a mentor who is hands-on, or someone who is less involved? If you had issues with your PhD adviser, Hendrix recommends looking for a PI for your postdoc who can provide you with a different personality and mentoring style.\n\nNext, consider what laboratory environment you need to thrive. For instance, in a large lab group, you might have the opportunity to take on a leadership role and collaborate with graduate students. In a smaller lab, it might just be you and the PI working closely on a project. “It can feel quite claustrophobic, or the two of you could be a brilliant team,” Williams says.\n\nNavigating interviews\n\nUnderstanding what you want as a researcher isn’t enough on its own, however. The next step is interviewing potential PIs. Keep in mind that this process isn’t just about the PI questioning you — you’re also interviewing them to see whether they will be the right fit. All of the specialists Nature spoke to said that it’s important to discuss ongoing research projects as well as where the funding comes from and what the PI expects of you. Williams suggests asking for written documentation about the project you’ll be working on, and for a copy of the grant that will support your work. If the PI is unwilling to provide those documents, that could be a warning sign, she says.\n\nWilliams also says that the way you phrase your questions can affect the type of information you receive. For instance, instead of asking a hypothetical question about how the PI will support your career, ask how they have supported their postdocs’ careers in the past, which encourages them to provide you with evidence of their previous efforts. Looking into how long researchers have stayed in the lab for can also be helpful. “If people are only staying six months, that would be a big red flag for me,” says Williams.\n\nHendrix says it’s crucial to clarify which intellectual ideas from your postdoc research you will be able to take with you after you move on, and which aspects will stay with the lab. For example, if your PI works on the 3D microenvironment in breast cancer, maybe you can go on to study the 3D microenvironment in lung cancer instead. Another example could be examining different pathways in the same disease.\n\nHow do I tell someone that I can't write them a strong letter of recommendation?\n\n“A red flag would be if they make it clear that they don’t want you to take anything,” she says. “Another thing to look out for is whether your future research interests are exactly what that PI is working on, because then they might see you as competition. You want to have some separation in your research interests.”\n\nIf you want to do independent research, it’s important to ask whether you can work on it during the postdoc. “I usually encourage young fellows or postdocs to look for their own small grants, which can help them to establish themselves,” says Adesola Ogunniyi, a retired neurologist who worked at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria.\n\nTalk to other postdocs\n\nAlong with speaking to the PI, all four experts recommend talking to current and previous postdocs. “It’s important to be professional and respectful, but also to get the information you need,” says Claartje van Sijl, who owns the academic coaching practice Van Sijl Counseling & Training in Utrecht, the Netherlands. As part of your due diligence while exploring the role’s suitability, she recommends framing questions using language such as: ‘I’ve learnt from experience how crucial the working relationship is, so I’d love to hear more about how things unfolded over time in this group. What made it work and what would you advise for someone new?”\n\nThe other specialists recommend asking what day-to-day life looks like in the lab, and how current and previous postdocs would define the lab’s culture. This can help you to determine whether the lab environment will suit you.\n\nThe ‘PhD influencers’ logging lab life on TikTok and Instagram",

          "abstract": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that the US government would ‘aggressively’ revoke visas for Chinese students.Credit: Andrew Harnik/Getty\n\nGraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and science laboratory leaders are reeling after an announcement last week that the US government will revoke visas for Chinese students — and they are contacting lawyers.\n\nInternational PhD students make emergency plans in fear of US immigration raids\n\nIn a statement on 28 May, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said that the policy will apply to students studying in “critical fields” and those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party. Rubio also said that the government will revise visa criteria to “enhance scrutiny” for all future visa applications submitted by students from China and Hong Kong.\n\nIt is not clear which Chinese students the policy applies to, or what criteria will be used to determine who is subject to the policy. But the order could affect tens of thousands of students. In the 2023–24 academic year, 122,778 graduate students from China held positions at US universities, out of a total of 502,291 international graduate students, according to data from the Institute of International Education (IIE) in New York City. The IIE conducts an annual census of international students with funding from the US government.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Department of State did not respond to Nature’s request for clarification on what counts as a critical field. But in a statement, they wrote that the policy is aimed at averting “theft of U.S. research, intellectual property, and technologies”. They added that visa adjudication is a national-security decision, and prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to national security or public safety is key to protecting US citizens.\n\nLegal action ahead\n\nResearchers and graduate students who spoke to Nature — most of whom did so on the condition of anonymity, out of fear of reprisals — say that Rubio’s order could devastate their research groups and upend the careers of talented young scientists.\n\nScientific conferences are leaving the US amid border fears\n\nKen Ono, a mathematician at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, says that he has colleagues and students who are upset. Referring to Rubio’s announcement, Ono says: “That is a statement that if you’re from a certain country, you’re just not welcome … and that message is devastating.”\n\nIn his department, some research groups are made up mostly of students from China. These groups could be utterly decimated, Ono adds. But he is hopeful it won’t come to that. Ono says that he expects legal injunctions will be filed to stop visas from being revoked — although he doesn’t know who will file these injunctions or at which institutions.\n\nA materials scientist at another university described Rubio’s order as “human-rights abuse”, adding that it would set his research back three or more years and that, overall, it would devastate US science and its standing in the world.\n\nHe has reached out to his students to tell them that their institution will do its best to protect them, he says. “I still hope that law and due process will hold,” he adds.\n\nA Chinese postdoctoral researcher in biological physics who has been in the United States for more than six years told Nature that she feels “troubled and upset” by Rubio’s announcement. She always wanted to stay in the United States and find a job as a full-time researcher, but at the start of this year, around the time that US President Donald Trump took office, she started looking for options in other countries, such as Japan and nations in Europe.\n\nHer academic supervisor says that she is looking for a pro bono lawyer to represent her students in case their visas are revoked. She has five international students in her research group, and they are all nervous — not just those from China — she says. “This policy will discourage everyone, not just Chinese students, because they will think it could be them next,” she adds.",

          "title": "How a mysterious epidemic of kidney disease is killing thousands of young men",
          "authors": "Carrie Arnold",
          "abstract": "For years, Oscar has greeted dawn with the rhythmic swing of his machete as he chops sugar cane in fields near his home in El Salvador. On a typical morning, the 33-year-old begins work long before sunrise in a futile attempt to escape the suffocating heat and humidity. But one morning in December, Oscar clutched his wife’s hand instead of his steel machete. The pair sat in a waiting room of a clinic in the small town of Tierra Blanca. Oscar, a pseudonym being used to protect his privacy, had gone with his wife to find out whether his kidneys were failing.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, a mysterious epidemic of chronic kidney disease began emerging in Bajo Lempa, a region on the Pacific coast of El Salvador where Tierra Blanca is located. The disease, which researchers have dubbed chronic kidney disease of unknown cause (CKDu), often affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. Many are agricultural workers or labourers without other known risk factors for kidney disease. As many as one in four adult men in Bajo Lempa have kidney disease, whether CKDu or another form, compared with an estimated one in ten men globally. Roughly 17% of men in Bajo Lempa live with kidney failure1.\n\nAlthough the epidemic of this perplexing kidney disease was first recognized in this region, more than half a dozen hotspots have since appeared elsewhere in Central America and around the world. Hard data on the number of people with CKDu globally have yet to be tallied. However, occupational-medicine specialist Emmanuel Jarquín says that tens of thousands of people have probably died from the disease, and the number continues to grow.\n\nExtreme heat is a huge killer – these local approaches can keep people safe\n\n“This is the biggest story in the world about kidney disease,” says Jarquín, who is on the front line of the epidemic in El Salvador. In 2007, Jarquín founded the Agency for Development and Agricultural Health (AGDYSA), a scientific research organization based in San Salvador that aims to protect agricultural workers from kidney disease and other work-related conditions. There were so many cases of kidney failure in the district of Bajo Lempa that AGDYSA opened a satellite office in Tierra Blanca in 2023.\n\n“People here are aware of their illness, but when they reach for treatment, they don’t receive anything,” says Jarquín. Not prevention, not dialysis, not anything. As a result, people get sicker, and fast. “It’s a vicious cycle,” he says.\n\nAlthough the cause of the epidemic hasn’t been definitively determined, most scientists agree that, at least among sugar-cane workers, intense labour in extreme heat is one of the major drivers of this condition. Elsewhere, CKDu shows up among other labourers, including rice farmers, construction workers and miners.\n\nMany researchers expect the effects of climate change to increase the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which is already a growing health concern globally. In May, the governing body of the World Health Organization adopted a resolution to recognize kidney disease as a major cause of death and disability and to strengthen disease-prevention efforts.\n\nKidney disease is an example of the damage that prolonged, incessant heat can do to the body, says Ollie Jay, a heat physiologist at the University of Sydney in Australia. For the epidemic of CKDu, the agricultural workers of Bajo Lempa were an early warning sign.\n\nAn emerging epidemic\n\nMore than two decades ago, when otherwise healthy young men in Bajo Lempa began to grow fatigued and anaemic, they chalked it up to long hours of intense and exhausting work. Sugar-cane cutters are “marathon workers”, says Fabiano Amorim, a physiologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Furthermore, “they sometimes don’t have the proper food for the work they are doing. They don’t have water available.”\n\nTaking time off to rest wasn’t an option. The men depended on their work to provide food and shelter for their families. So the workers swallowed ibuprofen and got back to their machetes.\n\nBut for many, the fatigue worsened until they could no longer get out of bed. With local physicians unable to help, some of the men managed to make the two-hour drive to Rosales National Hospital in San Salvador. When they arrived, the men learnt that their kidneys had failed. Their bodies could no longer filter certain types of toxin, such as uric acid, from the blood or eliminate excess water. When this happens, fluid accumulates in the body until the lungs can no longer fill with air and the heart struggles to beat. Without dialysis to clean and filter the blood, death is inevitable.\n\nSugar-cane cutters in Nicaragua wear dust monitors as part of an effort to evaluate labour practices and reduce the effects of heat stress.Credit: Ed Kashi/VII/Redux/eyevine\n\nWhen the men arrived at Rosales National Hospital, nephrologist Ricardo Leiva and his then-trainee Ramón García-Trabanino were puzzled about why these seemingly healthy young men’s kidneys had abruptly crashed. The textbooks that both physicians had pored over in medical school taught them that kidney failure was usually the result of untreated diabetes and high blood pressure or certain rare autoimmune and genetic conditions. The men from Bajo Lempa had none of these.\n\n“They were so young … I had no answers,” says García-Trabanino, who now helps to run a private dialysis clinic in San Salvador. “It was a massacre.”\n\nYet, with the hospital flooded with people from Bajo Lempa, neither had much time to work it out. “I started work at 5 a.m. every day,” Leiva says. “And I didn’t get home until after it was dark.”\n\nEven moderate heat strains the human heart\n\nWhen Leiva, García-Trabanino and a team of researchers published the first account of the mysterious kidney disease in a public-health journal in 20022, the condition seemed like a local kidney anomaly — what biologists call an endemic nephropathy. But then papers began identifying other hotspots of CKDu, including in the sugar-cane-growing region of Nicaragua3.\n\n“Nobody believed us that we were seeing a new form” of chronic kidney disease, says Marvin Gonzalez Quiroz, a physician and epidemiologist from Nicaragua, who is now at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “Nobody believed the prevalence that we were reporting.” Other research documented similar problems in Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, India and Sri Lanka4.\n\nNone of the early studies could pin down a cause, but several leading hypotheses have emerged, including exposure to pesticides and heavy metals, as well as pathogens, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic heat stress. Researchers now say that CKDu could have multiple causes that vary between individuals, and across locations and time. Still, epidemiological and animal studies point to heat stress as an important factor.\n\nHow we keep cool\n\nHumans maintain their core body temperature in a narrow range of 36–37 °C, says Daniel Vecellio, a biometeorologist at the University of Nebraska Omaha, and expend a lot of energy to keep it there. When our bodies heat up, blood vessels in the limbs and extremities dilate in a process called vasodilation, shunting blood away from major organs and to the surface of the skin, allowing heat to dissipate. As the core body temperature creeps up, glands in the skin begin pumping out sweat, further cooling the body. A fan or breeze amplifies this cooling; high humidity makes the process less effective, says Vecellio. When vasodilation and sweating are inadequate and the body temperature gets too high, muscles cramp, nausea takes hold and people can become confused and faint. In extreme cases, seizures and death can follow.\n\nThe kidneys are some of the first organs to feel the strain as body temperature rises. Sending more blood to the body’s surface means that the kidneys and other major organs receive less oxygen and nutrients. This often happens while water is lost through sweating, forcing the kidneys to kick into overdrive to preserve the body’s fluid balance. That effort can lead to drops in kidney function, even in healthy adults.\n\nThe entire heat response is a finely tuned physiological symphony that leaves little room for error, says Catharina Giudice, an emergency-medicine physician at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. “The kidneys are more vulnerable than other organs. They have a very intense metabolic demand, so small changes in blood flow tend to be more harmful,” she says.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, exposure to pesticides could be behind an epidemic of chronic kidney disease.Credit: Ed Kashi/VII/Redux/eyevine\n\nPeople working in construction and agriculture don’t just get hot from being outside in the Sun — they also generate heat through physical labour. Sweating a lot can leave them dangerously dehydrated at the end of a workday, even if they drink water as usual, says Giudice.\n\nExcept in the most severe cases, researchers thought that the kidneys could quickly bounce back from heat stress with no long-term damage. The emergence of CKDu instead hints that small, repeated injuries — even those that don’t result in a hospital visit — can build up over time. Compounded and amplified by other exposures, these small insults can lead to end-stage kidney failure, says Giudice.\n\n“You’re having this acute kidney injury day after day,” she says. “Then you progress to a state where the cells can’t recover fully.”\n\nBiopsies from people with CKDu show damage to specific parts of the kidney called the tubules, which reabsorb and return water and other useful substances to the blood. The problem, says Zachary Schlader, a physiologist at Indiana University Bloomington, is working out how to detect this damage before kidney function drops drastically. Typical tests spot a problem only when there are elevated levels of a waste product called creatinine in the blood and protein in the urine.\n\nNearly ten years ago, Schlader decided to look for molecular distress signals that could be early indicators of declines in kidney function. In one study of sugar-cane cutters in Nicaragua, Schlader and his colleagues found that markers of tubule injury changed as blood creatinine increased throughout the harvest season5. Another study by some of the same researchers, looking at workers during harvest, found that increased levels of white blood cells in urine (a marker of inflammation) and a decrease in haemoglobin in red blood cells (the production of which depends on the hormone erythropoietin secreted by the kidneys) could predict declines in kidney function across the harvest season6.\n\n“The hotter people got, the more dehydrated people got, these signals went up,” says Schlader. Importantly, he says, there are biomarkers that can be measured easily, and can be detected before more commonly used markers of kidney injury, such as creatinine.\n\n“And it’s not just the kidney that’s being affected; the whole body is,” says Schlader. “Heat stress causes systemic inflammation, and CKDu is likely some combination of what’s happening within the kidneys and what’s happening systemically.”\n\nResearch by Schlader’s team and others has shown that kidney damage can accumulate much more quickly than anyone thought.\n\n“It affirmed a lot of what we hear anecdotally, which is that people start working when they’re young, they’re healthy. They have good kidney function, and then bang, they have stage-four kidney disease and will need dialysis soon,” says Madeleine Scammell, an environmental-health scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, who studies CKDu.",

          "abstract": "Kári Stefánsson’s genomics firm deCODE became an early leader in conducting genome-wide association studies.Credit: Halldor Kolbeins/AFP via Getty\n\nIt’s been a month since Kári Stefánsson, the founder and former chief executive of the pioneering Icelandic genomics company deCODE genetics, says he was summarily fired by deCODE’s parent company, the biotechnology giant Amgen, and Stefánsson is his usual candid — some have said abrasive — self.\n\n“The possibility certainly exists that I’m simply a dislikable individual that they wanted to get rid of,” he says. “A significant proportion of my old friends would agree with that.”\n\nStefánsson, a neurologist and neuroscientist, left a faculty position at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, to found deCODE in 1996. The company convinced a large proportion of Icelanders to share their genomic data, and a controversial 1998 law enabled deCODE to create a national database containing medical records from Iceland’s healthcare system.\n\nHow a trove of cancer genomes could improve kids’ leukaemia treatment\n\nThe firm was an early leader in conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that linked common single-letter DNA variations to people’s risk of developing complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes1 and schizophrenia2 , as well as other traits (I attended a talk in the 2000s at which Stefánsson said the team had even found a gene variant associated with enjoying crossword puzzles). Thanks mainly to deCODE’s efforts, Icelanders accounted for 11.5% of GWAS participants between 2007 and 2017, one study found3.\n\n“The amazing thing is that in this tiny little country with a population of about 390,000 people, we managed to build up a genetics organization that was second to none,” Stefánsson says.\n\nThe importance of chaos\n\nAfter financial troubles forced deCODE into bankruptcy in 2009 and a subsequent takeover by private investors, Amgen bought the firm in late 2012 for US$415 million. Stefánsson says that deCODE has operated more or less autonomously from Amgen for most of the past 12 years.\n\n“We have had a very free-spirited atmosphere where people have worked on the assumption that chaos is a very important beginning point to all research you do,” Stefánsson says.\n\nStefánsson attributes his downfall to a recent shift in deCODE’s relationship with Amgen, which, he says, sought closer integration between the two. “When you are working in a very goal-oriented work environment to serve drug discovery and development, this is a very noble activity, but you lose some of that freedom.”\n\nWhat went wrong at 23andMe? Why the genetic-data giant risks collapse\n\nStefánsson says he was blindsided when, on 1 May, while he was visiting Amgen’s headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California, the company’s vice-president for research and development, Jay Bradner, told him his services were no longer needed at deCODE.\n\n“I was asked to come to another building, put into a room where Jay Bradner sat in front of me and said, ‘You are fired’, basically. Before I arrived back in Iceland, they had sent out a press release announcing my departure from deCODE,” he says. “I think it is not a graceful way of parting with the founder of the company who had run it for 29 years.”\n\nAmgen declined to comment on Stefánsson’s characterization of his dismissal. But in a statement to Nature, a representative said the decision “reflects a strategic evolution in the way our deCODE and other Amgen scientists work together to advance research in service of patients”.\n\nThe ‘free spirit’ of deCODE",

          "abstract": "Up to one in 50 scientific papers ought to be retracted, according to one estimate.Credit: Brazzo/Getty\n\nThe Center for Scientific Integrity — the non-profit organization that runs Retraction Watch — has launched a project aimed at rounding up flawed and fake medical-research papers and neutralizing their impact on health guidelines. The Medical Evidence Project will be run by James Heathers, a science-integrity consultant and self-described “data thug” based in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nMedicine is plagued by untrustworthy clinical trials. How many studies are faked or flawed?\n\n“I don’t think anything is more of an immediate threat to people than bad medical research,” Heathers says. “We’re going to find the bad medical evidence that is a threat to quality of life and tell everyone.”\n\nThe project, which has a US$900,000 grant from funder Open Philanthropy in San Francisco, California, to run for two years with a team of three to five people, aims specifically to root out flawed papers that have a serious impact on medical guidelines by skewing meta-analyses — reviews that combine the results of multiple similar studies to come to a statistically more powerful conclusion. “It is a great idea to take a very detailed look at such papers,” says Elisabeth Bik, a data sleuth in San Francisco who is not involved with the project. Earlier this year, the Center for Scientific Integrity (CSI) set up a fund for grants under Bik’s name after she donated $200,000 to the organization.\n\nIvan Oransky, executive director of the CSI, says that the centre has “been expanding and embracing the sleuth movement” by helping to fund and support work that is usually done on a volunteer basis.\n\nFlaws and fakery\n\nResearch papers marred by innocent mistakes, misconduct or outright fakery are a serious problem in science. Oransky estimates that one in every 50 papers published by scientific journals should probably be retracted. That amounts to tens of thousands of papers among the roughly three million published each year.\n\nGiant study finds untrustworthy trials pollute gold-standard medical reviews\n\nOther projects have already sought to root out bad data. One trawled through 50 high-profile medical reviews and found serious concerns with about 6% of the papers that fed into them1. The team that ran that project is working on a tool to help check papers for trustworthiness. The historical examples of papers such as these affecting health policy “are terrifying”, Heathers says.\n\nFor example, a 2009 guideline from the European Society of Cardiology2 recommended the use of blood-pressure-lowering medicines called beta-blockers to protect the heart during non-cardiac surgery, based heavily on a series of studies that began in 1999. However, a few years later, concerns were raised about those studies. The guideline was amended in 2013 with an ‘expression of concern’3, but a 2014 investigation was unable to “confirm or dispel doubts” about the work. Other researchers reported their own analysis4 of the literature that year and suggested that adherence to that guideline might have caused up to 10,000 deaths per year in the United Kingdom alone.\n\nThe Medical Evidence Project, which launched on 1 June, wants to provide a secure platform for whistle-blowers who are daunted by the idea of publishing their concerns about influential medical papers on public platforms such as PubPeer, or find that route ineffective. “I would like to be a resource for those people,” Heathers says. The project’s website will provide a mechanism to supply anonymous tips. People can also e-mail the project’s tip line.\n\nThe team plans to develop its own computational methods for finding bad papers — perhaps similar to the Problematic Paper Screener, a tool that looks for red flags such as papers that cite retracted works or that use ‘tortured phrases’, hinting that they have been written by automatic means. But the team will fine-tune its tools for their own purposes.",

          "abstract": "International waters, also known as the high seas, make up 61% of the ocean and cover 43% of Earth’s surface — amounting to two-thirds of the biosphere by volume. They have been exploited since the seventeenth century for whales, and from the mid-twentieth century for fish, sharks and squid, depleting wildlife. Now, climate change is reducing the productivity of the high seas through warming and through depletion of nutrients and oxygen. Proposals to fish for species at greater depths and mine the sea bed threaten to wreak yet more damage, putting the ocean’s crucial role in maintaining the stability of Earth’s biosphere at risk.\n\nLess than 1% of the area of the high seas is protected, however. This is because there has been no globally accepted mechanism to do so beyond Antarctica. The United Nations High Seas Treaty was agreed in 2023 to fill this governance gap and expand the number of marine protected areas in international waters. It is crucial to protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, as agreed under the Global Biodiversity Framework in 2022.\n\nTo save the high seas, plan for climate change\n\nBut the High Seas Treaty could take years to come into force. Sixty countries are required to ratify it; as this article was published, only 28 had done so. Processes and mechanisms are yet to be set up. And its implementation is likely to be hampered by a lack of data, disagreements about divisions of responsibilities and the perennial problems associated with multilateralism.\n\nGiven the urgency of addressing the climate and biodiversity crises, the world can’t wait another decade to fix the problems humans have created. Ocean life is too precious and important to lose, and shifts in the chemical and physical environments of the sea, once made, will be irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia.\n\nAs world ocean specialists and policymakers convene this week at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, we make a case for permanent protection of all international ocean waters from fishing, sea-bed mining, and oil and gas exploitation.\n\nOceans store carbon and nutrients\n\nThe high seas are home to an immense diversity of wildlife, including megafauna, such as cetaceans, turtles, tuna and sharks that migrate over vast distances. They also play a crucial part in Earth’s carbon cycle, which is essential for life and the balance of gases in the atmosphere. Indeed, with an average depth of 4,100 metres, the high seas are the planet’s largest and most secure carbon sink.\n\nThe crucial role of marine life in the high seas influences the global carbon cycle through two mechanisms: the biological pump and the nutrient pump. In the biological pump, fish and invertebrates living in the twilight ‘mesopelagic’ zone (at depths of 200–1,000 metres) comprise billions of tonnes of biomass and undertake daily vertical migrations, feeding by night near the surface and returning by day to the deep, where they deposit carbon-rich faeces. Without this cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could be 200 parts per million higher, and Earth possibly 3 °C warmer, than under pre-industrial conditions1.\n\nThe nutrient pump is important because dead plants, animals and their faeces sink from shallower to deeper layers of the ocean. Much of the high seas experiences limited mixing — warmer surface waters float on top of colder, denser and darker water — so marine life in the sunlit upper 200 metres is limited by low nutrients. Marine megafauna, such as bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), dive deep to feed and return to the surface to breathe, thermoregulate or digest their prey. Faeces and urine produced near the surface transfer nutrients from deep to shallow water, boosting production of biomass, which takes up dissolved CO22.\n\nKrill fishing in the Southern Ocean.Credit: Associated Press/Alamy\n\nThis upward nutrient pump has been slowed by centuries of intensive exploitation, beginning with the whaling industry, which resulted in the collapse of cetacean populations across the entire ocean by the mid-twentieth century. Fishing of the high seas came later, beginning with Japanese long-distance tuna fisheries in the 1930s, expanding to longline fishing for billfish (Istiophoridae) and sharks in the 1950s, deep-sea bottom trawling of seamounts and continental slopes from the 1960s and 1970s, and squid ‘jigging’ (using lights to attract squid) from the 1990s.\n\nFive priorities for a sustainable ocean economy\n\nEncouraged by government subsidies3, fishing in the high seas has intensified — involving an estimated 3,500 boats in 20184. This has depleted many fished species and caused serious collateral damage to wildlife and habitats, driving iconic and vulnerable species, such as some albatrosses (Diomedeidae), oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) and leatherback turtles, to become critically endangered.\n\nPressure is now mounting to fish at greater depths, despite very limited understanding of the structure and function of deep-sea ecosystems. Although mesopelagic species are mostly small and unsuitable for direct human consumption, government- and industry-sponsored researchers are looking for new sources of fishmeal and oil to supply the burgeoning aquaculture industry.\n\nExpansion of fisheries to deeper waters could reduce the amount of carbon that the oceans take up and deplete a key source of food for species such as tuna, sharks and dolphins. For these reasons, conservationists have argued for a moratorium on fishing in the mesopelagic zone5, helping to safeguard the estimated 59% of ocean carbon sequestration that happens in the high seas6.\n\nNo need to fish in the high seas\n\nHigh-seas fisheries occur from the poles (for species such as krill, cod, Antarctic icefish and toothfish) to the tropics (for tuna, billfish, sharks and opah, for example). The devastating and poorly managed impacts of fishing were among the main motivations for the High Seas Treaty (formally known as the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction Agreement). Closing the high seas to fishing has been proposed before by academics7,8 and by a high-level panel made up of former heads of state, government ministers and policy experts9. There are compelling reasons to do so (see ‘Fishery gains’).\n\nSource: Ref. 8\n\nHigh-seas catches and profits are constrained by the sparseness of biomass in these remote regions10. This means that little of the global fish catch (less than 6%) comes from the high seas3, and most of this is destined for consumption in the high-income world. Food-security arguments, therefore, do not apply. Few countries have the capital to invest in high-seas fishing. Around 80% of the high-seas catch is landed by only six regions: the Chinese mainland, Taiwan, Japan, Indonesia, Spain and South Korea3.\n\nMany of these fisheries are economically viable only because they are propped up by government subsidies. High-seas fishing generated profits of between US$3.8 billion and $5.6 billion in 2014, but with subsidies of $4.2 billion3. Costs are further ‘subsidized’ by low wages, and sometimes by forced or slave labour, with human-rights abuses prevalent.\n\nGuess how much of the ocean floor humans have explored\n\nNot fishing these remote waters would save taxpayer money and prevent publicly funded declines in endangered, threatened and protected species, as well as immense damage to the sea bed and open-water habitats. High-seas species are currently fished using destructive and polluting methods, with limited oversight, little enforcement and weak governance under international law by regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs).\n\nBy-catch, by-kill and pollution problems are often extreme. Each year, pelagic longline fisheries kill hundreds of thousands of seabirds, thousands of turtles and millions of high-seas sharks.\n\nIn the 1990s, in addition to pursuing free-swimming tuna schools, ‘purse seine’ fisheries adopted satellite-tracked drifting fish aggregation devices (dFADs), which are rafts with a net or rope structure hanging beneath. As well as tuna (mostly juveniles), the large wall of netting collects other wildlife, such as turtles, dolphins, whale sharks and manta rays, which are often killed.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2021, upwards of 120,000 dFADs were deployed annually and drifted across 37% of the ocean11. Depending on the fishery, up to 90% of dFADs are lost or abandoned at sea12. Many RFMOs have taken steps to regulate their use, but the regulations are insufficient and poorly enforced12.\n\nFrozen tuna for sale at a fish market in Tokyo.Credit: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty\n\nThe sustainability of high-seas fishing is being placed at further risk by deoxygenation from warming and stratification. The global ocean has lost around 2% of its oxygen content over the past 50–60 years13. Deep-water deoxygenation is reducing the habitat volume for oxygen-demanding species, such as sharks and tuna, pushing them closer to the surface, where they are more easily caught. Lower levels of dissolved oxygen also lead to slower growth and smaller body size, reducing productivity and reproduction14 — effects that will be amplified by interactions between fisheries, deep-sea mining, climate change and habitat destruction.\n\nClosing the high seas to fishing would support population recoveries of targeted species7. Fishers would have access to healthier, more productive stocks that spill into national waters, where they could be exploited with better governance and oversight — 98.6% of exploited high-seas fish straddle national waters8. Remote regions such as the high seas, when highly protected, generate greater conservation benefits for ocean wildlife relative to areas that are closer to humans15.\n\nFishing in national waters would be more equitable, expanding beneficiaries to include most fishing nations, many of them low- and middle-income countries. Sustainable catch volumes are potentially greater than present high-seas catches8. And population recoveries of ocean-going megafauna would help to compensate for deoxygenation-driven declines in productivity, as well as boosting the upward nutrient pump.\n\nDeep-sea mining is unnecessary",

Small-scale fishing, with its low ecological impact, selective methods and knowledge passed down through generations, is a model of sustainability. This is a ‘blue economy’ that respects life.\n\nSmall-scale fisheries\n\nIn Senegal, fishers have voluntarily closed certain fisheries to preserve species. Fishers in Nianing stop catching octopuses for part of the year and immerse clay and shell pots in the sea to help the creatures to reproduce. Others are experimenting with community-led tracing systems. Identifying which canoes have fished, where they have fished and the species caught adds value to local products for consumers.\n\nBut our future is under threat. Industrial overfishing scrapes our sea beds; coastal urbanization eats away at our workspaces; plastic pollution invades our nets; climate change alters fish-migration routes, erodes beaches through rising seas and destroys fishing nets in storms.\n\nWomen are the heart of the sector: they process and sell the catch. Without them, there are no fish on the table. Yet, they remain invisible in public policy.\n\nI did not learn about these problems from books. I’ve lived them. I have seen canoes banned from beaches where they have historically been based. I have seen women excluded from their fish-processing sites. I have seen young people leave the trade because it lacked prospects. But I have also seen success stories: villages creating their own community fishing zones, women innovating in fish processing and young people developing mobile applications for tracking catches and fish sales.\n\nSustainable small-scale fisheries can help people and the planet\n\nEvery bit of aquatic space, every fish, every right, matters. That’s why, for more than 30 years, I have worked to defend the rights and improve the living conditions of those who rely on the sea to survive. Today, I am president of the African Confederation of Professional Organizations of Artisanal Fisheries, based in Mbour, Senegal, which links 27 organizations from 29 African countries. I also coordinate a network of small-scale fishing and aquaculture representatives — the Pan African Platform of Non-State Actors in Fisheries and Aquaculture, which is a partner in the African Union. And I lead the Association for the Promotion and Empowerment of Marine Small-Scale Fisheries Actors.",

He was older, obviously, and was wearing a tweed suit way smarter than anything he’d had when we shared an office. None of this moderated the fact that I was very surprised to see him.\n\nGrabbing my own drink, I wheeled my case over to his small marble-topped table. Outside, the lights on the station concourse winked on suddenly and cast extra light across his face. I paused, and he looked up from his phone. He smiled, the same slightly asymmetrical smile that I remembered. “John! Great to see you, it must be years!”\n\nOver a decade, probably, I thought as I shook his hand. “Longer than that, I think the Mountain View conference was our last outing …” He laughed, and looked suddenly younger. “That was a good weekend!

God knows how much beer we drank trying to sort out the effects of that chilli … Then, that’s right, we tried to get the bus back to the hotel in Palo Alto and ended up in San Jose! Ha!

It’s just that … Well, this is awkward … You see, I thought you were dead …”\n\nHe laughed again, at first. Then realized that I meant it.\n\n“I’d say that reports to that effect may have been exaggerated,” he smiled. “But tell me, why did you think I’d expired?”\n\n“Well, I wrote your bloody obituary, for one thing. Nature got in touch and asked me if I’d contribute something — that would have been about a week after the accident. I’ve probably still got the PDF on my phone.

Credit: Artur Plawgo/Science Photo Library\n\nThe cancer cells of some men feature a striking mutation: their Y chromosome is missing altogether. Now, tantalizing research suggests that this mutation can spread ‘contagiously’ from tumour cells to immune cells, which lose their cancer-fighting prowess after their Y chromosome disappears.\n\nThe evidence for the contagion mechanism is not definitive. But the work provides strong evidence that losing the Y chromosome makes cancer cells more aggressive — and that immune cells that lack y chromosomes are less effective. These findings could explain the authors’ observation that tumours missing the Y chromosome tend to be deadlier than those retaining it. The results are published on 4 June in Nature1.\n\n“One thing is clear,” says Dan Theodorescu, a co-author of the paper and a cancer biologist at the University of Arizona, Tucson. “If you take cells and you knock out the Y chromosome, bad stuff happens.”\n\nThe question of Y\n\nScientists have known for decades that cancer cells often lose their Y chromosome, but the effects of this loss were unclear. In 2023, Theodorescu’s group showed that the Y-loss mutation raises bladder cancer’s aggressiveness in humans2. The Y chromosome can also disappear from immune cells as men age, raising the risk of death from cancer3.\n\nCancer cells ‘poison’ the immune system with tainted mitochondria\n\nTheodorescu and his team began the latest study by analysing gene-expression data from a massive repository of cancer-cell genomes. They found that men — across multiple types of cancer — died sooner if their tumours had lost their Y chromosome than men whose tumours still had it.\n\nThe group then showed that the Y-loss mutation occurs in both the cancer cells themselves and in the immune cells that invade tumours to defend the body. The mutation’s effects on gene expression indicated that, in cancer cells, it increases the number and severity of other mutations. It also causes changes that probably make the cancers less detectable by the immune system.\n\nBut the lack of a Y chromosome has a different effect on immune cells: it pushes them towards non-active and immune-suppressing states, rendering them less able to fight cancers. “If you put those two together,” says Theodorescu, “that’s really bad”.\n\nA ‘contagious’ mutation\n\nStrikingly, the researchers observed a correlation between the extent of Y loss in malignant cells and the extent of Y loss in immune cells inside the same tumour.\n\nOne possibility, says Theodorescu, is that “some weird chemoattraction” selectively draws Y-less immune cells from the blood into the tumour. The more provocative possibility is that malignant cells with the Y-loss mutation cause the same defect in nearby immune cells.",

          "abstract": "Manual reconstructions, such as this image of the extinct Australian bird Genyornis newtoni, can depict prehistoric creatures with more detail and veracity than artificial intelligence can produce, says illustrator Jacob Blokland.Credit: Jacob C. Blokland\n\nLast year, a figure generated by artificial intelligence (AI) made it past peer review despite featuring gibberish text and a rat with enormous testes1. The scientific community took to social media to pan the paper, leading the journal concerned to retract it2. Yet scientists continue to turn to bots to make cover art and figures, and professional illustrators are expressing concern over the hasty adoption of AI.\n\nJournals have different policies on publishing AI images. Owing to ethical and copyright concerns, Nature and Science do not permit them, barring specific cases, such as articles about AI. Elsevier adopts similar policies for its publications but allows AI images to be used for cover art, as long as all rights have been cleared. The American Chemical Society family of journals allows AI images in publications or cover art so long as the use of AI is explicitly acknowledged.\n\nWhen the American Chemical Society launched this policy late last year, Rita Clare, a scientific illustrator in Boston, Massachusetts, voiced her frustration on the professional-networking platform LinkedIn. Clare argued that AI images don’t succinctly or accurately communicate scientific concepts and could undermine public trust in science. She says that certain inaccuracies wouldn’t fly if they were created by a person, “but for some reason, having this sheen of fake polish that comes with AI kind of erases all of those standards”.\n\nResearchers rushing to meet a deadline might be drawn to inexpensive or free text-to-image tools, such as Midjourney or Stable Diffusion, that can swiftly produce cover art. Clare already feels the impact of AI on her career. “I’ve seen a decline in the number of people who have been reaching out to me,” she says, adding that she’s had to lower her fees to remain competitive. “It’s becoming increasingly more difficult to convince people to pay for art when they can just get it for free.”\n\nAI also affects Ella Maru’s career as a scientific illustrator. Her studio, in Charleston, South Carolina, receives artwork requests from researchers who provide AI mock-ups of what they are looking for. “We treat these the same way we handle hand-drawn sketches — they help us understand the idea, but we always draw everything from scratch,” she says. Maru isn’t nervous that AI will put illustrators out of work, because, she says, AI-generated images still don’t live up to human-made ones. “We often create images to visualize new discoveries — and those are especially hard for generative AI to capture correctly,” she says. This is partly because AI is trained on existing publications and lacks the capacity to generate depictions of new concepts.\n\nClare says that the work of professional illustrators is more likely to meet customer expectations. “I send them sketches, I take all of their ideas into account, and I try to really bring to life what they have in mind,” she says. Clare adds that it is usually obvious when scientific artwork is generated using AI, and that this undermines the value of the study. Telltale signs of an AI image include oversaturated colours, a cinematic feel or hyper-realistic details. Clare’s view is that if researchers are prepared to spend thousands of dollars submitting manuscripts to prestigious journals, they ought to invest in professional cover art, too.\n\n2024 Research Leaders\n\nAlthough illustrators generally recommend against relying on AI for scientific artwork, some argue that it could make be a useful tool. Alexey Chizhik, a freelance scientific illustrator and a physicist at the Georg August University of Göttingen in Germany, says he sometimes cannot work out how to improve an illustration, and AI-generated images help him with brainstorming.\n\nMaru says she might consider adding AI image generators to her toolkit one day. “Right now, we avoid all AI tools in our actual illustrations to fully follow journal guidelines, but if journals create clear rules in the future and allow certain uses, we’d be happy to explore that,” she says.\n\nClare plans to avoid using AI tools altogether. She experimented with Midjourney when it first came out and included an AI-generated background of a forest in a cover image for the journal Joule. Although she liked the result at the time, looking back, “it’s pretty obvious that it’s AI-generated”, she says. “I wish that I had just taken the time to make it myself.”\n\nPrehistory and AI don’t mix\n\nAI-generated imaginings of extinct species show how training data — many of which have no basis in actual science — can lead AI astray. In 2023, science-news website Earth.com reported on the discovery of an extinct animal, Mambachiton fiandohana, and seems to have used bot-made art to depict it. The image, which more closely resembled Godzilla than a real animal, was posted on social-media platform X by the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh.\n\nThe move was widely criticized by researchers, who said the species would have more closely resembled a crocodile, as was depicted by artist and physicist Nobu Tamura in San Francisco, California.",

But in 2022, Johnson was finally able to hear her voice through an avatar, thanks to a brain implant.\n\nThe implant is an example of the neurotechnologies that have entered human trials during the past five years. These devices, developed by research teams and firms including entrepreneur Elon Musk’s Neuralink, can alter the nervous system’s activity to influence functions such as speech, touch and movement. Last month, they were the topic of a meeting in Paris, hosted by the United Nations scientific and cultural agency UNESCO, at which delegates finalized a set of ethical principles to govern neurotechnologies.\n\nThe rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know\n\nThe recommendations focus on protecting users from technology misuse that could infringe on their human rights, including their autonomy and freedom of thought. The delegates, who included scientists, ethicists and legal specialists, decided on nine principles. These include recommendations that technology developers disclose how neural information is collected and used, and that they ensure the long-term safety of a product on people’s mental states.\n\n“This document clarifies how to protect human rights, especially in relation to the nervous system,” says Pedro Maldonado, a neuroscientist at the University of Chile in Santiago who was one of 24 experts who drafted the recommendations in 2024. The principles are not legally binding, but nations and organizations can use them to develop their own policies. In November, UNESCO’s 194 member states will vote on whether to adopt the standards.\n\nConsumer devices\n\nThe meeting considered a range of neurotechnology applications, including devices designed to be implanted into the body and non-invasive devices, which are being explored in medicine, entertainment and education.\n\nLegislation already exists for implanted brain–computer devices in regions including the United States and the European Union.\n\nThe brain-reading devices helping paralysed people to move, talk and touch\n\nBut non-medical consumer devices, such as wearables, are less regulated. These devices raise ethical concerns owing to their potential to be rapidly scaled up, says Nataliya Kosmyna, a neurotechnologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who helped to draft the recommendations. “It’s very critical to understand the infrastructure and scalability of these devices,” she says.\n\nEach application raises specific concerns. For example, in educational settings, the delegates recommended prohibiting the use of neurotechnology to evaluate students’ or educators’ performance in ways that might enforce inequalities.\n\nAnother concern about non-invasive devices is that information such as eye movement and tone of voice could be used to infer neural data, including someone’s state of mind or brain activity. One potential application that the delegates want to govern concerns neuromarketing, whereby a person’s neural processes can be manipulated to influence decisions on commercial advertisements or political messaging. The experts were concerned that this activity could occur without proper consent when users are unaware it is happening — when they are asleep, for example.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Joel Robine/AFP via Getty\n\nYvonne Choquet-Bruhat was a giant of the mathematical study of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Her theorem establishing the existence of solutions to Einstein’s equations is central to how mathematicians and physicists think about general relativity today, from simulating black holes to interpreting observations of gravitational waves.\n\nChoquet-Bruhat, who was born Yvonne Bruhat in Lille, France, in 1923, passed away aged 101 in Bordeaux. She grew up in an intellectual household, her mother a teacher and her father a theoretical physicist. After the family moved to Paris when she was three years old, she excelled academically and enrolled in 1943 — during German occupation — at the École Normale Supérieure des jeunes filles in the Paris suburb of Sèvres. Her adolescence was scarred by her father’s death in 1945 at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany; he had been imprisoned for refusing to give information about students involved in the resistance to Nazism.\n\nFive new ways to catch gravitational waves — and the secrets they’ll reveal\n\nAfter hesitating over whether to study medicine, physics or mathematics, it was maths that won Yvonne over. She wanted to do research, rather than go into teaching, which was more usual for women at the time. She eschewed trends in mathematics towards abstraction, preferring to stay closer to physics and her desire to understand nature. This drew her to the mathematical study of Einstein’s general relativity.\n\nNewly married (she married twice and used her married names as well as Bruhat), by 1947 she embarked on a PhD supervised by mathematical physicist André Lichnerowicz. She was mentored by Jean Leray, a towering figure in the theory of partial differential equations, who had also spent time in German captivity. Leray suggested that Yvonne attempt the ambitious problem of proving the ‘well-posedness’ of the notoriously difficult equations of Einstein’s theory. That result became the centrepiece of her thesis.\n\nGeneral relativity is governed by a set of complicated equations that were written down by Einstein in 1915 to replace Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity. The equations describe the dynamics of a 4D warped space-time geometry, curving in response to the motion of matter. In Newtonian theory, one can, in principle, completely predict the trajectories of moons, planets or stars, given their initial conditions, using Newton’s laws alone. When Einstein formulated his theory, it wasn’t at all clear that the analogous property would still hold.\n\nDo black holes explode? The 50-year-old puzzle that challenges quantum physics\n\nYvonne’s 1952 landmark paper (Y. Fourès-Bruhat Acta Math. 88, 141–225; 1952) showed precisely this. Corresponding to any initial state of the Universe, a resulting space-time geometry arises and is determined by Einstein’s equations alone. This mathematical predictability of the Universe is the well-posedness of Einstein’s theory.\n\nHer theorem also resolved another long-standing puzzle. In 1917, Einstein had recognized that his theory contained solutions in the form of waves in space-time — gravitational waves. But he wasn’t confident that these waves had any intrinsic physical meaning rather than being mere changes in co-ordinates that could propagate at arbitrary speeds. Yvonne’s theorem gives intrinsic meaning to finite propagation of gravitational waves and shows that the waves propagate at the speed of light, just like electromagnetic waves.",

It might all have been for nothing.\n\nGupta’s trial has been ensnared by a US National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy announced on 1 May that bans ‘foreign subawards’, which are funds that a US grant recipient can give to an international collaborator to help complete a project. Since the policy was disclosed, NIH employees have been forbidden from issuing grants involving such awards, according to internal documents that Nature has obtained.\n\nAs a result, funding will abruptly cease for dozens, if not hundreds, of ongoing trials of experimental drugs and treatments. The change puts thousands of trial participants, as well as the scientists running the trials, in limbo. Gupta, an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says she will have to start winding down her trial on 1 June unless she finds alternative funding.\n\nNIH killed grants on orders from Elon Musk’s DOGE\n\nTo understand the policy’s impact, Nature spoke to nine affected researchers who have been scrambling to find funding quickly to avoid shutting down their work. On top of the impact on research, scientists say that the policy could do tremendous harm to trial participants, who might suddenly find themselves without care. And it is a waste of taxpayers’ money, says Amy Conroy, a behavioural scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is studying the effectiveness of a programme in Malawi to reduce alcohol use in people with HIV.\n\n“This trial is the product of five years of formative work that American taxpayers have invested in, and they will never know the results of this study that they’ve paid for,” says Conroy, whose grant supporting this programme has a foreign subaward.\n\nThe NIH, which has cited national-security concerns and a lack of transparency as the rationale for the change, did not respond to Nature’s queries about the policy, its impacts on clinical trials or scientists’ frustrations. The NIH has said that direct funding for foreign sites will not be affected and that it will announce an alternative funding mechanism by October.\n\nCollateral damage\n\nThe NIH is the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research, and typically gives multi-year awards that are doled out in one-year increments contingent on researchers making reasonable progress. The new policy, which took effect on the day it was announced, requires that ongoing projects that include foreign subawards no longer receive funding when they come up for their next allotment.\n\nThis affects a large chunk of the agency’s portfolio: in 2024, the NIH funded about 1,800 projects with a combined value of more than $10 billion that include at least one foreign subaward, according to the US government website USAspending.gov.\n\nCaught in the crossfire are participants of trials funded by these foreign subawards. Many are members of vulnerable populations, such as those living with HIV. If their trials end, they will lose access to treatments and care.\n\nNIH turmoil sparks anxiety over future of its global grants\n\n“You can imagine how a participant from rural Africa is going to feel one day when they realize we have disappeared, we’ve gone back to the US and we’ve collected all this information about them,” Conroy says. “There’s the potential for medical mistrust and anti-democratic beliefs to flourish.”\n\nThat scenario worries grantees such as Prasanna Jagannathan, a malaria epidemiologist at Stanford University in California. Since 2022, he and his colleagues have been running a trial involving nearly 1,000 infants in Uganda to test a drug cocktail that could boost immunity to malaria. The researchers administered the drugs monthly for up to two years. Now the trial is in a crucial phase: after participants stop taking the drug, the scientists will monitor them for infection.\n\nThere’s a possibility that, post-treatment, malaria cases will be more serious than if the children had not received the therapy, because participants were not infected with the disease naturally while they were taking the drugs. “If we put them at an increased risk by giving them this drug, we’re obligated to continue to provide care for them,” Jagannathan says. “That’s what they signed up for.”\n\nConroy fears that she could face disciplinary action from the Malawi government for abandoning participants in the middle of a trial. “They don’t care why it was pulled — they just know this was not ethical.”\n\nJoin the queue\n\nThe NIH says it will allow research projects involving human participants to receive limited funds for “orderly shutdowns”, but researchers who spoke to Nature were unclear on what this means or how much funding is available for this purpose. And their other options are limited.",

And the next day, on 31 May, Trump withdrew his nomination for NASA chief, the businessman and commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman.\n\nAll of this has left the space agency in turmoil, and the scientists who normally participate in NASA’s missions split over whether they support the push for the red planet.\n\nA budget shortfall\n\nNASA has wanted to put people on Mars for decades, but both technological and budget limitations mean that probably will not happen until the 2040s under current plans. Trump wants to accelerate that timeline. On 30 May, the White House proposed to spend some US$1 billion in 2026 on Mars plans, including research into new spacesuits and an astronaut landing system. “These investments will provide the technologies necessary for future Mars exploration and eventual crewed missions to Mars,” the NASA budget plan said.\n\nTrump proposes unprecedented budget cuts to US science\n\nIf the space agency really does want to focus on sending humans to Mars, space-policy specialists say, it will need to massively ramp up its spending. A human mission to Mars is likely to cost hundreds of billions of dollars spread over a number of years; the agency currently spends $25 billion a year on all of its programmes, and Trump has proposed cutting that to under $19 billion. “Right now, with the budgets that are proposed, we can’t afford to send people to Mars,” says John Grunsfeld, an astrophysicist and former NASA astronaut who led the agency’s science programmes from 2012 to 2016.\n\nTrump’s latest rhetoric on Mars echoes decisions he made during his first term as president, when, in 2017, he announced that NASA would send astronauts back to the Moon. In 2022, the agency tested a mega-rocket that is intended to achieve that objective, but that mission, Artemis I, was uncrewed. Many technical challenges remain before people can be put on the lunar surface — a goal currently slated for 2027.\n\nOne challenge is achieving success with the giant Starship vehicle, built by the aerospace company SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. Once NASA’s mega-rocket has propelled astronauts into lunar orbit, they will rendezvous with Starship, which will fly them to the Moon’s surface. But Starship has yet to orbit Earth successfully, much less demonstrate the frequent launches and in-space refuellings needed for the Moon landing; its most recent test flight ended in an explosion on 27 May.\n\nDays after that blow-up, Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of SpaceX who has advised Trump, said he still hoped to launch the first Starship to Mars next year. Some scientists have been put off the idea of landing humans on Mars by Musk’s involvement. The technology entrepreneur has long talked of colonizing the red planet, but with little consideration of societal ethics or international norms. In recent months, he led the Trump administration’s efforts to downsize the US government and slash its science funding, even as SpaceX is likely to compete for billions of dollars’ worth of government contracts on the quest for Mars.\n\nA tough environment\n\nOthers are more excited about the prospect of landing people on the red planet. NASA has overseen missions to Mars many times, sending a series of robotic spacecraft, including the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers. Some researchers say that astronauts could explore more quickly and gain better insight into whether Mars has ever hosted extraterrestrial life. “If we definitively want to answer the question of whether Mars had life or has life today, I think we have to send humans,” says Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist with the Outer Space Institute who is based in Ottawa, Canada.\n\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has drilled numerous rock cores on Mars that are now awaiting collection and delivery back to Earth.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Del-4Ri\n\nBut even those in favour caution that a journey to Mars would not only be costly — taking funding away from numerous other research programmes — but would also pose many physical risks. On the way to Mars, astronauts would face extreme isolation and higher doses of deadly space radiation over longer periods than they have ever been exposed to on the Moon or on space stations. If they were to land successfully on Mars, they would have to get out of their capsule without collapsing after the zero-gravity voyage; begin working in a frigid environment where the soil is full of toxic chemicals and there is almost no air to breathe; and deal with abrasive dust storms1.\n\nThere are solutions, such as living inside an underground lava tube that was created by volcanic activity, which could offer protection against radiation and dust storms. But visiting Mars will be like visiting Antarctica — another hostile, perilous environment — with vastly greater risks, scientists say. “I want to disabuse people of the assumptions that they have that humans are going to be fine,” Erik Antonsen, a researcher in space physiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said at conference on human space exploration on 28 May.\n\nScience at the table",

Compared with standard treatments, the immunotherapy lengthened survival of people with cancer1.\n\nThe phase II clinical trial in China tested chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in people with advanced gastric cancer or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer, which are solid tumours. To create CAR-T-cell therapies, T cells are collected from a person with cancer and tweaked to produce proteins that target cancer cells. The T cells are then infused back into the same person. CAR-T-cell therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but has been most successful against blood cancers.\n\n“Solid tumours generally don’t respond well to CAR-T-cell therapy,” says Lisa Mielke, a cancer researcher at the Olivia Newton John Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg, Australia. The trials are among the first in which CAR-T-cell therapy has had promising results against solid tumours. They provide “evidence that there is potential for CAR T cells to be further optimized for future treatment of patients with solid tumours”, adds Mielke.\n\nLast resort\n\nThe treatment, called satricabtagene autoleucel (satri-cel), targets CLDN18.2, a molecule expressed in large quantities in gastrointestinal tumours.\n\nThe trial included 156 participants, aged 18–75, who had received at least two unsuccessful treatments for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer and had tumour-tissue samples that were positive for CLDN18.2. Satri-cel was given to 88 people up to 3 times over the study period, along with a regimen that removed non-specific immune cells to make the treatment more effective. The remaining 52 people formed the control group, receiving standard therapies such as nivolumab, paclitaxel or rivoceranib.\n\nOf the people treated with satri-cel, 35% responded to it, compared with just 4% of people receiving standard care. Those receiving CAR-T-cell therapy also lived an average of 2.4 months longer and were 31% less likely to die than the people in the control group.",

          "authors": "Jane Qiu",
          "abstract": "The reporting was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.\n\nIn the bustling Jatinegara market in Jakarta, cages are stacked three metres high, holding creatures from all corners of Indonesia and beyond. Bats, raccoon dogs, macaques and songbirds — sold as pets or food — are crammed together, their musky odours mingling with the stench of urine and faeces in the damp tropical air.\n\nFor decades, public-health experts have warned about the risks of infectious diseases jumping from animals to humans in markets such as Jatinegara, which are part of a global industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually. These markets remain “the best way of transmitting diseases”, says James Wood, a veterinary epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Jatinegara’s location, in an international travel hub with a population of 11 million people, increases that risk considerably.\n\nWill bird flu spark a human pandemic? Scientists say the risk is rising\n\nThe world is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, which many researchers say probably started, or was at least amplified, at a market selling live animals in Wuhan, China1,2. Yet the wildlife trade still thrives in many parts of the globe. China banned the farming and trading of most wildlife species for food in 2020, but these practices have simply gone underground. “We are back to business as usual,” says Vincent Nijman, a conservation biologist at Oxford Brookes University, UK, with “millions and millions of animals being traded on a daily basis”.\n\nThe wildlife trade acts as a vast global network of unregulated natural laboratories, through which potential pathogens freely circulate, evolve and ultimately congregate in urban centres, says Andrew Cunningham, a wildlife epidemiologist at the Institute of Zoology in London. “It’s the scariest thing we are doing,” he says.\n\nBefore the pandemic, there was a strong emphasis on identifying new viruses in the wild. These efforts were driven by the idea that it might be possible to predict which viruses could spark major disease outbreaks. But many researchers now say that this assumption was flawed.\n\nIncreasingly, scientists are looking to human–wildlife interfaces — including markets and the trade networks that supply them — as crucial sites for the study of zoonoses, human diseases caused by pathogens that normally infect other species. A handful of research groups are now working to understand how pathogens jump between species, why some jumps cause outbreaks and others don’t, and what kinds of intervention can reduce the risks. But such work is costly, can be dangerous and demands sustained support, which has become increasingly hard to secure.\n\nWithout investing in such research, “you’re really flying blind”, says Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. “You’re making recommendations that may not be the most appropriate.”\n\nPoster child\n\nIn the veterinary room of Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, Tran Nam Trieu carefully lifts a Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) onto an examination table. The creature is curled into a ball, its scales subtly rising and falling with each breath. Confiscated near the border with China in early 2023, it is now in the care of Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, a non-profit conservation organization that runs a rescue centre at the park. Delicately unrolling it, Trieu, a veterinary surgeon, reveals its soft pink belly and the wound from an amputation; its left hind leg was damaged in a snare.\n\nThe enormous demand in China for pangolin meat and scales — believed, without evidence, to cure a wide range of ailments — has made these creatures the poster child of the illegal wildlife trade. And studies of confiscated pangolins in China have detected several types of coronavirus that share up to 92% of their genome with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-193. Although too distantly related to have given rise to SARS-CoV-2, the viruses sometimes cause COVID-19-like symptoms in these animals and might have the potential to infect humans.\n\nOther coronaviruses found in these pangolins are relatives of those that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The virus spike proteins have a feature known as a furin cleavage site4, thought to be crucial for the viruses to replicate efficiently in the respiratory tract. The presence of a similar feature in SARS-CoV-2 has contributed to the suspicion that the virus might have been engineered by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology — although it could also have arisen naturally.\n\nA live pangolin seized by the Malaysian wildlife department was probably on its way to a market in China.Credit: Bazuki Muhammad BM/JS via Reuters\n\nWood recognizes the “small possibility” that research-associated activities could have triggered the pandemic. But that “should not prevent us from focusing on the bigger picture”, he says: the wildlife trade poses a much greater zoonotic risk than do lab accidents.\n\n25 million deaths: what could happen if the US ends global health funding\n\nTo gauge those risks, Nguyen Thi Thanh Nga, a researcher at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Hanoi, and her colleagues are working to identify potential pathogens circulating in trafficked pangolins in Vietnam — a major transit hub for moving wildlife into China — and exploring how these microorganisms relate to those found in source and destination countries. Of 246 pangolins confiscated across Vietnam between 2015 and 2018 — many from the rescue centre in Cuc Phuong — 7 were infected with coronaviruses, although none had signs of respiratory or other systemic illnesses5. Partial sequences of these viruses closely resemble those of viruses found in pangolins seized in China.\n\nPangolins further upstream in the supply chain, however, seemed unaffected: none of the 334 pangolins confiscated from smugglers or rescued from the wild in Malaysia between 2009 and 2019 tested positive for coronaviruses6.\n\nThe increasing detection rate of coronaviruses along the supply chain is consistent with another study by WCS researchers, on rats captured and sold for food in Vietnam7. The team found that the proportion of rats that tested positive for coronaviruses was tenfold higher at the markets and restaurants where they’re sold than in the fields where they’re caught.\n\nTrade routes\n\nSome researchers are working to get a better handle on the human behaviours that help zoonotic viruses to thrive and spread. In 2017, Jusuf Kalengkongan, a behavioural scientist and founder of the Sulawesi Bat Conservation organization in Airmadidi, Indonesia, spent months living among wildlife hunters in villages in the province of Southeast Sulawesi. Capturing and handling bats can be dangerous work, he says, and some hunters develop fevers when wounds from a scratch or bite become infected. Rather than seeking hospital care, they typically take herbs and over-the-counter medications, he says. Village elders recalled a mysterious disease outbreak in which dozens of people died in a few weeks, Kalengkongan says.\n\nHung Nguyen-Viet, an animal-health specialist at the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, is leading a similar project in Vietnam. Researching trade networks, he says, is sensitive work that requires significant trust-building. A key question his team seeks to answer is: what do people do when the wild animals they capture fall ill? Some people choose to eat them, whereas others try to sell them to unsuspecting customers at a market far away, says Nguyen-Viet. Few, he says, would report it to the authorities, for fear of consequences to their livelihoods.\n\nFur farming a ‘viral highway’ that could spark next pandemic, say scientists\n\nMedical anthropologist Hannah Brown at the University of Durham, UK, says that attempts to regulate the wildlife trade need to take these fears seriously, or risk pushing the activity further underground. This happened when the consumption of wild-animal meat was banned in West Africa during the 2014–16 Ebola epidemic, which was suspected — but never proved — to have been caused by the eating of bats. Ten years on, says Brown, people there are still negatively affected by the policy and remain suspicious of the authorities and international researchers.\n\nSome scientists have managed to cultivate the trust of wildlife traders in Indonesia. At the Langowan market in North Sulawesi, which sells both wild-animal meat and live animals, Tiltje Ransaleleh asks vendors about their supplies, the species they’ve sold and their origins. Beneath a canopy of red fabric that wards off the tropical Sun, Ransaleleh, a zoologist at Sam Ratulangi University in Manado, Indonesia, and her colleagues collect swab samples from bats lining the wooden stalls.\n\nHer team has mapped an intricate network of supply chains and identified the intermediaries — who purchase wild animals (including up to one million bats a year) from hunters and transport them to markets — as a potential vehicle for disease transmission8. One insight gleaned, she says, is that festive periods are the riskiest, when sales can surge to 5 times their usual volume, with more than 10,000 bats sold in a single day at Langowan.\n\nSea change\n\nThese in-depth studies of trade networks and human behaviour are essential for tracking the movement of wild animals and the potential pathogens they carry, says Stephen Luby, a disease ecologist at Stanford University in California.",

          "authors": "Diana Kwon",
          "abstract": "Some websites have been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of bot traffic. Credit: Marco VDM/Getty\n\nIn February, the online image repository DiscoverLife, which contains nearly three million photographs of different species, started to receive millions of hits to its website every day — a much higher volume than normal. At times, this spike in traffic was so high that it slowed the site down to the point that it became unusable. The culprit? Bots.\n\nThese automated programs, which attempt to ‘scrape’ large amounts of content from websites, are increasingly becoming a headache for scholarly publishers and researchers who run sites hosting journal papers, databases and other resources.\n\nOpen-source AI chatbots are booming — what does this mean for researchers?\n\nMuch of the bot traffic comes from anonymized IP addresses, and the sudden increase has led many website owners to suspect that these web-scrapers are gathering data to train generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as chatbots and image generators.\n\n“It’s the wild west at the moment,” says Andrew Pitts, the chief executive of PSI, a company based in Oxford, UK, that provides a global repository of validated IP addresses for the scholarly communications community. “The biggest issue is the sheer volume of requests” to access a website, “which is causing strain on their systems. It costs money and causes disruption to genuine users.”\n\nThose that run affected sites are working on ways to block the bots and reduce the disruption they cause. But this is no easy task, especially for organizations with limited resources. “These smaller ventures could go extinct if these sorts of issues are not dealt with,” says Michael Orr, a zoologist at the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History in Germany.\n\nA flood of bots\n\nInternet bots have been around for decades, and some have been useful. For example, Google and other search engines have bots that scan millions of web pages to identify and retrieve content. But the rise of generative AI has led to a deluge of bots, including many ‘bad’ ones that scrape without permission.\n\nThis year, the BMJ, a publisher of medical journals based in London, has seen bot traffic to its websites surpass that of real users. The aggressive behaviour of these bots overloaded the publisher’s servers and led to interruptions in services for legitimate customers, says Ian Mulvany, BMJ’s chief technology officer.\n\nSocial scientists battle bots to glean insights from online chatter\n\nOther publishers report similar issues. “We’ve seen a huge increase in what we call ‘bad bot’ traffic,” says Jes Kainth, a service delivery director based in Brighton, UK, at Highwire Press, an Internet hosting service that specializes in scholarly publications. “It’s a big problem.”\n\nThe Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) reported in April that more than 90% of 66 members it surveyed had experienced AI bots scraping content from their sites — of which roughly two-thirds had experienced service disruptions as a result. “Repositories are open access, so in a sense, we welcome the reuse of the contents,” says Kathleen Shearer, COAR’s executive director. “But some of these bots are super aggressive, and it’s leading to service outages and significant operational problems.”\n\nTraining data\n\nOne factor driving the rise in AI bots was a revelation that came with the release of DeepSeek, a Chinese-built large language model (LLM). Before that, most LLMs required a huge amount of computational power to create, explains Rohit Prajapati, a development and operations manager at Highwire Press. But the developers behind DeepSeek showed that an LLM that rivals popular generative-AI tools could be made with many fewer resources, kick-starting an explosion of bots seeking to scrape the data needed to train this type of model.",

Such carbon is cycled swiftly into soils as litter and root detritus, broken down by microorganisms into smaller organic fragments and CO2, and ultimately carried by water through the ‘veins’ of the landscape into rivers3–5. But in a paper in Nature, Dean et al.6 show that much of the CO₂ escaping from rivers today comes not from modern biomass, but from carbon that is thousands of years old, or older.

          "title": "How to keep astronauts healthy in deep space",
          "authors": "Farhan M. Asrar",
          "abstract": "Space exploration is entering a new era. NASA’s Artemis programme, and related Artemis Accords (an international cooperation involving more than 50 nations), aims to take humans to the Moon as soon as 2026 and, eventually, to Mars. China plans to send its own crewed missions to the Moon by 2030 and to build a lunar base.\n\nMissions involving public–private partnerships are also transforming the space sector1. For example, in 2024, Polaris Dawn, a private mission by space-technology firm SpaceX, saw US entrepreneur Jared Isaacman — who is nominated for the role of NASA administrator — and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis become the first civilians to perform a spacewalk. But there are many challenges ahead. Assuring astronauts’ health is one.\n\nEthics in outer space: can we make interplanetary exploration just?\n\nHumans are building a future in space. But we are not built for space. Even the most fit and healthy person can find space disabling2.\n\nOutside Earth’s protective atmosphere, the human body is subjected to high levels of radiation. According to the European Space Agency, an astronaut travelling to Mars would receive the equivalent of one year’s exposure to radiation on Earth for each day of their months-long journey. This would be likely to increase astronauts’ risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases, for instance3.\n\nMoreover, the combination of radiation and time spent in microgravity can cause a range of health conditions. Weight-bearing bones lose, on average, around 1% of their mineral density per month during space flight4, increasing the risk of fractures. Fluid shifts in the eyes can increase pressure and affect vision5. There’s even an increased risk of kidney-related illnesses6.\n\nOn top of the physical hurdles is the possibility that the isolation will affect astronauts’ mood and productivity, taking a toll on their mental health.\n\nAs humanity sets its eyes on the Moon and Mars, these and other challenges must be addressed using innovative technology and research2,7,8. Such innovations should also benefit people on Earth. Here are four key strands of space medicine and health research that, in my view, are both crucial for mission success and likely to improve human health more broadly.\n\nRemote health care\n\nTelemedicine is integral to human space flight, allowing physicians to remotely monitor and support the mental and physical well-being of astronauts through telecommunications technologies7,8.\n\nHowever, because deep-space missions focus on travelling huge distances, telecommunication delays can introduce potentially life-threatening waits — for instance, it can take 20 minutes each way for astronauts on Mars to receive medical advice from Earth. That’s a long time if, say, someone has a heart attack and the crew needs support to treat them.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) applications are being developed to help astronauts to get medical support quickly — similar to how AI-driven medical diagnosis and advice technologies can aid physicians and patients on Earth. This would help to make health care in space autonomous. But using AI in space brings operational challenges. Who will fix the system if it breaks, for instance, and how can a device be updated during a mission to keep pace with emerging medical knowledge and guidelines and the crew’s changing needs.\n\nResearchers test the solar array of NASA’s BioSentinel spacecraft.Credit: Dominic Hart/ARC/NASA\n\nEnsuring that adequate medications are available is another big challenge, especially for long missions. One study found that, on the International Space Station (ISS), each crew member studied had taken an average of four routine drugs a week9 — such as analgesics for pain relief and headaches, sleeping aids10 and decongestants. Essential medicines, including antibiotics and drugs to treat cardiac emergencies, are also stocked on board.\n\nHowever, according to one estimate11, more than half of the medications on the ISS have a shelf life of less than three years, and some expire in less than two. That’s too short for a crewed mission to Mars, which would last at least three years. Between 60% and 98% of the medications could expire before a Mars mission’s end11. Resupplying drugs across such huge distances is unfeasible.\n\nIs there life on Mars? What a cave on Earth can teach us\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has demonstrated that — on Earth — medications can be effective for years after their expiry dates12. However, taking drugs past their expiry date can be risky and their effectiveness can diminish. Their strength can decrease, their chemical composition might change and there’s a risk of bacterial growth (see go.nature.com/4mkqbeb). Moreover, many pharmaceutical ingredients degrade under extreme conditions, such as radiation13.\n\nSome evidence suggests that storing medicines at their optimal temperature and preventing exposure to light and heat can extend the period during which they are effective12. But with this research having been conducted on Earth, it’s not clear whether the same applies to space.\n\nEven recommended doses might change in space. One study exploring the use of sleep medications on the ISS and in space shuttles, for instance, noted that in 17–19% of cases in which an astronaut took a sleep drug, a second dose was taken on the same night10. Whether this was attributable to the small number of astronauts studied, a difference in the way the medicines degraded over time or something else remains unclear.\n\nResearchers thus need to establish what the optimal dose and storage conditions of drugs are and ascertain medicines’ rates of degradation in space — findings that could also help to improve medications on Earth. Similarly, medical technologies developed for space or using space know-how can be adapted for use on Earth. Cardiovascular surgeon Michael DeBakey’s left ventricular assist device — a titanium pump used to keep blood flowing in people with heart conditions awaiting transplants — is one such space-technology spin-off. The design was honed in collaboration with NASA engineers using simulations of fluid flow similar to those moving through rocket engines.\n\nMental health\n\nEnsuring the crew’s mental health is a concern for any space mission, from a stint on the ISS to a long-term trip to Mars, with crew confined to limited quarters, few companions and communication delays that restrict conversations with loved ones. Fatigue and disturbed sleep — brought about by stress, noise, being away from home and sleeping in an unusual environment — are common in space and could exacerbate mental-health problems. In any extreme environment, the whole crew might be affected, as illustrated by reports in March that a researcher stationed at a remote base in Antarctica threatened to kill colleagues.\n\nThe crew members of the Polaris Dawn were the first civilians to perform a spacewalk.Credit: UPI/Alamy\n\nOver decades of supporting astronauts, NASA and other space agencies have accumulated expertise around mental health in extreme environments involving isolation and confinement — knowledge that has proved invaluable to resolve crises on Earth. For example, the Chilean government reached out to NASA for guidance and support in 2010 during the efforts to rescue 33 Chilean miners trapped and isolated underground8.\n\nEarth-based analogue missions — which simulate the challenges of being in space — can help researchers to anticipate the issues that might arise from isolation and confinement. Other lessons can be learnt once astronauts have established themselves on the lunar surface and in orbit around the Moon, offering further opportunities to prepare for going to Mars.\n\nResearch is needed to find ways to improve mental health in space. For example, the European Space Agency is testing initiatives such as a lighting system to maintain more-conventional circadian rhythms, exploring how daily circadian rhythms change during long space missions and using virtual-reality headsets to provide astronauts with mental relaxation.\n\nFood production\n\nSystems for producing food sustainably are needed for deep-space missions. Travel to Mars could take between seven and ten months, making it impractical to rely solely on food shipped from Earth.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Life on white/Alamy\n\nMale mouse fetuses can develop female organs in utero if their mother is iron deficient during pregnancy, a study in Nature reports1.\n\nThis is the first-known example of a dietary mineral affecting sex determination, says Vincent Harley, a molecular geneticist at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, Australia. This “presents an exciting new area of study”, he adds.\n\nIn mammals, biological sex is initially determined primarily by chromosomes — females typically have XX chromosomes whereas males typically have XY ones — and a primary gene then usually triggers formation of the corresponding sexual organs. Mice, for instance, with XY chromosomes usually develop testes if a gene called Sry is activated and ovaries if it is not.\n\nThe researchers behind this latest study had previously shown that Sry is activated by an enzyme called histone demethylase2, which needs iron to function, says co-author Makoto Tachibana, an epigeneticist at Osaka University in Japan. The team speculated that altering how iron is metabolized by cells could affect histone demethylase activity, which would in turn alter Sry expression.\n\nIron-deficient diet\n\nTachibana and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments to test the theory. First, they gave mice an iron-deficient diet for a month before pregnancy, and for two weeks during pregnancy, and compared them with mice that were fed a control diet. The levels of haemoglobin and red blood cells were lower among iron-deficient mice than in the control-diet mice. The embryos also showed signs of anaemia, but had the sexual characteristics expected from the genes.\n\nWhen the team repeated the experiment with embryos that had a genetic susceptibility to compromised histone demethylation, 2 of 43 XY offspring carried by iron-deficient mothers developed female-typical sex organs. All the control mice grew sex organs typical of their chromosomes.\n\nTo test the effect of iron deficiency that isn’t caused by diet, the researchers gave pregnant mice an oral iron chelator — molecules that bind to iron and reduce its levels in the body — between days six and ten of embryonic development, when sexual determination typically occurs. The 72 embryos from these mice, which all had XY chromosomes, showed signs of anaemia. Four being born with two ovaries and one with one ovary and one testis.",

Longo\n\nScientists have discovered an ancient protein that has the rare property of being ‘ambidextrous’ — it can function in mirror-image forms. The molecule could be a relic of a time when life based on mirror-image molecules existed on Earth.\n\nMany chemicals have a handedness, or chirality, and can exist in two mirror-image forms. But the building blocks of life tend to stick to one or the other. Sugars in nucleic acids such as DNA are right-handed — causing the DNA double helix to twist to the right, if you were looking down its axis — whereas the amino acids that build proteins are left-handed.\n\nI told AI to make me a protein. Here’s what it came up with\n\nScientists think that a preference for right-handed DNA and left-handed proteins could have helped to maintain the stability and function of biomolecules early in life’s evolution.\n\nLiam Longo, a protein historian at the Tokyo Earth-Life Science Institute, was examining a protein fragment, or peptide, that recognizes nucleic acids and is commonly found in DNA-repair enzymes. He noticed that the structure was symmetrical around a central axis, and suspected that both left- and right-handed versions of the protein could bind DNA.\n\nThe symmetrical segment — called a helix–hairpin–helix motif — is common in proteins that can manipulate and bind DNA and RNA and is found across the tree of life, suggesting that it existed in an early ancestor of all cells, says Longo.\n\nForwards, backwards, this way, that way\n\nTo test his hunch about the molecule’s ambidexterity, Longo and his colleagues created ‘right-handed’ versions of the peptide, including an ‘ancestral’ form potentially similar to the one found in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of today’s cells.\n\nThe mirror-image peptides bound to DNA nearly as well as their twins, and the normal, left-handed versions were able to bind mirror-image DNA. Further experiments showed that both left- and right-handed versions grabbed DNA molecules in similar ways. A study describing the phenomenon is published1 in Angewandte Chemie.",

Here we call for psychology to become a historical and geographical science, a transformation we term the chronospatial revolution. We list four barriers to this shift in psychology: problems in scope, data, synergy and theory. We discuss the need for psychology to adopt a more holistic lens and propose a research agenda that integrates historical processes, cultural dynamics and ecological variations into psychological inquiry. Such an integrated approach not only enriches our microscopic understanding of Homo sapiens but also draws a more telescopic map of human psychology that encapsulates the human journey. By embedding psychology within time and space, we can better account for cross-cultural psychological diversity, historical change and evolved psychological mechanisms, ultimately fostering a more globally representative, historically enriched and theoretically robust discipline.",

The process of habit formation in humans is commonly studied in the context of learning an arbitrary association between stimuli and responses. Assessing whether or not this association becomes habitual usually involves testing either whether participants can withhold certain responses or whether participants can generate different responses to certain stimuli. However, studies using these two methods have yielded conflicting findings. Here we propose that this discrepancy arises because these approaches target distinct forms of habit associated with different components of action control: response initiation and response preparation, respectively. Through a series of experiments (total n = 215), along with computational models, we show that these two approaches indeed measure dissociable forms of habit. Our results illustrate that a given behaviour can become habitual in multiple, qualitatively different ways, with important implications for how habits can best be promoted or eliminated.",

Here we propose a method to study the nuanced interplay between thousands of beliefs by leveraging online user debate data and mapping beliefs onto a neural embedding space constructed using a fine-tuned large language model. This belief space captures the interconnectedness and polarization of diverse beliefs across social issues. Our findings show that positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals and estimate cognitive dissonance on the basis of the distance between existing and new beliefs.

We created an online quiz game, Tango (letstango.org), where Republicans and Democrats partner and communicate in real time. Across five experiments (N = 4,493, four preregistered), we find that an hour of gameplay with an outparty partner can reduce negative partisanship, with increased self-reported warmth, more equitable economic allocations and more favourable outparty meta-perceptions persisting for up to four months.

Nature Human Behaviour https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-023-01659-w (2025)\n\nIn a recent study, Webb, Holyoak and Lu1 (henceforth WHL) demonstrated that a large language model (GPT-3, text-davinci-003) could match or even exceed human performance across several analogical reasoning tasks. This result led to the compelling conclusion that LLMs such as GPT-3 possess an emergent ability to reason by analogy. However, the findings were based on a single, proprietary model for which the releasing company provided limited public details and progressively restricted access to the internal probability distributions. Furthermore, text-davinci-003 was deprecated on 4 January 2024, and is no longer available through the OpenAI API. This poses a challenge to replicability in two ways. First, the lack of open access to the model and its recent deprecation make it difficult—if not impossible—for other researchers to verify or build upon the findings. Second, relying on a single model leaves open the question of whether the results can be extended to LLMs as a broader class of objects of scientific investigation. Without testing a diverse range of models, it is unclear whether the observed behaviours are specific to GPT-3 or represent a general property of comparable contemporary LLMs. Replicating experimental results based on proprietary models with public alternatives is thus crucial to ensure that the findings can be reproduced in the future2, generalized to new model instances, and, more generally, to adhere to transparency principles that are of paramount importance in scientific research3.",

Understanding where and how agricultural frontiers emerge is thus important. Yet, existing monitoring approaches typically focus on mapping deforestation and do not capture the shifts in land access and ownership that lay the ground for agricultural expansion, thereby missing early stages of frontier development. We develop an approach that captures these early dynamics and apply it to the entire 1,1 million km 2 of the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot. Through the detection of linear features indicative of land claims and the analysis of their spatial–temporal dynamics, we reveal that the footprint of agricultural frontiers in the region extends far beyond that of deforestation. Most of the Chaco shows signs of land claiming, and although claiming activity is especially concentrated close to active deforestation, emergent claiming in remote parts of the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco indicates rapidly growing interest in land in these regions. Finally, the strong spatial correlation between land claiming and the disappearance of smallholder homesteads points to the social repercussions of early agricultural frontier expansion in the Chaco. By offering a transferable template to map land-control indicators at scale, our approach enables a better understanding of frontier processes and more accurate targeting of policy interventions in emerging agricultural frontiers globally.",

Redressing the unequal distribution of environmental pollution is thus a question of environmental justice and public health that requires policy solutions. However, data on pollutants for many locations and time periods are limited because environmental monitoring is largely reactive—i.e., pollutants are monitored only after they are recognized as harmful and are circulating in the environment at elevated levels. Without comprehensive historical pollution data, it is difficult to understand the full, intergenerational consequences of pollutants on environmental and human health. We assert that biological specimens in natural history collections are an underutilized source of quantitative pollution data for tracking environmental pollutants over two centuries to inform justice-centered policy solutions. Specifically, we: 1) discuss the need for quantitative pollution data in environmental research and its implications for public health and policy, 2) examine the capacity of biological specimens as tools for tracking environmental pollutants through space and time, 3) present a framework for integrating pollution datasets from specimens with spatially and temporally matched human health datasets to inform and evaluate policy, and 4) identify challenges and research directions associated with the use of quantitative pollution datasets. Biological specimens present a unique opportunity to fill critical gaps that address environmental challenges relevant to public health and policy.

The authors administered a survey adapted from the Dutch Functional Abilities List to a nationally representative sample of US adults ages 22 and older, finding that nearly three-quarters of working adults report at least one functional limitation, with an average of nearly six functional limitations per working adult. The most common limitations were in upper body strength and torso range of motion, and with respect to the ambient environment. The study also found that mental illness, arthritis, and substance use disorder are associated with the greatest number of functional limitations in working adults. The findings have implications for economic performance, workforce planning, and social policies to support displaced and vulnerable workers with significant functional limitations. Identifying the occupations and industries with large numbers of workers with functional limitations is critical to addressing short-term labor supply disruptions (e.g., public health crises) and preparing for longer-term workforce needs (e.g., long-term care workers for an aging population).",

          "abstract": "The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are trained on massive datasets before being adjusted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are n -consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underlie the synchronization of a system’s units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the Caenorhabditis elegans backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal’s motor periphery, providing testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a door to exploring the structure–function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals.",

          "abstract": "Collective cell migration is a key driver of tissue morphogenesis and cancer invasion. Here, we identified the tumor suppressor Ras association domain-containing protein 8 (RASSF8) as a WAVE interactor required for border cell migration. RASSF8 colocalizes with F-actin and cell adhesion molecules at border cell– border cell contacts. Loss of RASSF8 function results in border cell cohesion defects, a phenotype associated with changes in the localization of the Echinoid (Ed) and Coracle (Cora). Cell-type-specific RNA interference (RNAi) experiments suggest that cohesion defects are caused by changes in localization of Ed rather than E-cadherin. Gain-of-function experiments further revealed reciprocal functional interactions between RASSF8 and WAVE controlling collective border cell movement. Thus, we propose a dual function of RASSF8 in coordinating border cell cluster behavior. RASSF8 is thought to regulate the collective movement of border cells by restricting WAVE function, while it controls the epithelial cluster integrity by regulating cell–cell adhesion and septate junction molecules such as Ed and Cora.",

          "abstract": "While symmetry breaking in 2D ferroelectrics is obviously linked to the single-layer structure, layered (van der Waals) ferroelectrics can have a multitude of underlying mechanisms, making their identification nontrivial and often controversial. This complexity is exemplified by tin chalcogenides whose equilibrium structure, the orthorhombic α-phase with space group Pnma , includes an inversion center and which therefore should not be ferroelectric. Yet, recent work demonstrated polarization switching and ferroelectric domains in few-layer SnS and SnSe. Here, we use in situ electron microscopy and diffraction to determine the mechanism and characteristics of ferroelectricity across the SnSe 1-x S x system. We identify two distinct phases of synthetic SnSe 1-x S x : nonpolar (centrosymmetric) equilibrium (α-phase) crystals and metastable crystals adopting a distorted monoclinic structure, which are in-plane ferroelectrics with Curie temperatures of 320 to 420 °C. A surprising structural plasticity of the ferroelectric crystals during heating/cooling indicates a shallow energy landscape. This in turn suggests absence of a pronounced driving force for conversion to the α-phase that can explain the formation of the nonequilibrium crystals and their stability even after transfer to other supports. Our results highlight opportunities for the discovery of novel ferroelectrics among nonequilibrium van der Waals crystals.",

Cryo-electron tomography of EGFR-containing EVs reveals that EGFR forms clusters in both the presence and absence of EGF with a ~3 nm gap between the inner membrane and cytoplasmic density. EGFR extracellular region (ECR) dimers do not form regular arrays in these clusters. Subtomogram averaging of the 150 kDa EGF-bound EGFR ECR dimer yielded a 15 Å map into which the crystal structure of the ligand-bound EGFR ECR dimer fits well.

          "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an easy to use, noninvasive brain stimulation technique that gained prominence for its potential in cognitive rehabilitation. Electroencephalography (EEG), which records electrical brain activity with a high temporal resolution, is well suited to quantify tDCS-induced neuromodulation in humans. However, most studies relying on scalp EEG recordings or event-related potentials showed low reliability and only indirect correlations. Here, we combined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings with a sham-controlled tDCS experiment during fast periodic visual stimulation. Anodal (+2 mA) tDCS was applied over the right occipito-temporal cortex for 20 min using two small ring high-definition electrodes. Through the analysis of iEEG signals of 947 intracerebral contacts in 11 drug-resistant epileptic patients, we quantified the neuromodulation of iEEG cognitive evoked responses during (P2 phase) and after (P3 phase) tDCS by comparison to a control phase before tDCS (P1 phase). Significant neuromodulations of face-selective iEEG activity in anterior &amp; posterior temporal lobe and in the occipital lobe were found, with amplitude increases of 3% and 4%, 16% and 13%, and 36% and 33%, during and after tDCS, respectively. Interestingly, despite a unique tDCS session, the face-selective neuromodulation in the right visual occipito-temporal cortex remained significant ( P = 0.015) after tDCS (P3 vs. P1). This iEEG study demonstrates that using low intensity tDCS and small ring electrodes can induce significant electrophysiological effects on a selective cognitive function in humans.",

We describe the CRISPR-Cas9-based method TUNE YALI that enables high-throughput tuning of gene expression in the common industrial yeast Yarrowia lipolytica . The method is based on replacing the promoters of the target genes with native Y. lipolytica promoters of varying strengths or removing the promoters entirely. To demonstrate the method’s capabilities, we created a plasmid library that targets 56 transcription factors (TFs) and changes the expression of each TF to seven different levels. We transformed this library into reference and betanin-producing strains of Y. lipolytica and screened the resulting clones for changes in morphology, thermotolerance, or improved betanin production. The genetic markup of the yeast clones with the desired phenotypic changes was determined by sequencing the inserted plasmids. We identified multiple TFs whose regulatory changes increased thermotolerance, two TFs that eliminated pseudohyphal growth, and several TFs that increased betanin production. Analogous libraries can be designed to target any chosen group of genes and even all the genes. The libraries can be shared and reused, accelerating applied strain development projects and fundamental functional genomics research (TUNE YALI -TF kit and TUNE YALI -TF library are available via AddGene under catalog numbers #1000000255 and #217744).",

Here, we report the finding and characterization of M606, a selective small molecule inhibitor of MYCN, which was identified by screening a diverse chemical library. M606 reduced MYCN protein levels in neuroblastoma cell lines and upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A). Using siRNA-mediated knockdown of MYCN , c-Myc , or HIF1A in HepG2 and BE(2)-C cells followed by M606 treatment, we demonstrated that Myc downregulation and HIF1A upregulation were two independent effects of M606 treatment. M606 selectively targeted neuroblastoma cell lines expressing higher levels of MYCN protein and delayed neuroblastoma development in the TH-MYCN transgenic mouse model. Metabolomic analysis showed that M606 modulated glucose metabolism, consistent with a hypoxic response and iron deprivation. Biochemical characterization of M606 not only confirmed its iron-chelating properties but also revealed its ability to downregulate MYCN promoter activity, which could be rescued by the addition of iron. Luciferase assays identified the minimal MYCN promoter region required for the M606 response, which contained overlapping E2F transcription factor binding sites. Further evaluation defined a key role for E2F3 in the M606-mediated response. The finding of a potent cell-permeable iron chelator that can chelate iron to directly downregulate MYCN transcription via an E2F3-mediated response represents a potentially valuable therapeutic approach in the treatment of cancers overexpressing Myc oncoproteins.",

          "abstract": "A universal response of plants to environmental stresses is the activation of plasma membrane (PM) phospholipase C, which hydrolyzes phosphoinositides to produce soluble inositol phosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Because of their conical shape, DAG amounts have to be tightly regulated or they can destabilize membranes. We previously showed that upon stress, Synaptotagmin1 (SYT1) transports DAG from the PM to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ER–PM Contact Sites (CS). Here, we addressed the fate of the incoming DAG in the ER. We show that diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) DGK1 and DGK2 form a module with SYT1 functionally coupling DAG transport and phosphorylation at ER–PM CS. Although SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 do not show exclusive ER–PM CS localization, their interaction occurs specifically at ER–PM CS and the removal of ER–PM CS abolishes the interaction. Lipidomic analysis of a dgk1dgk2 double mutant supports that DGK1 and DGK2 phosphorylate DAG at the ER and transcriptomic and phenotypic analyses indicate that SYT1 and DGK1/DGK2 are functionally related. Taken together, our results highlight a mechanism at ER–PM CS that coordinates the transfer of DAG from the PM to the ER by SYT1 upon stress and the concomitant phosphorylation of DAG by DGK1 and DGK2 at the ER. These findings underscore the critical role of spatial coordination in lipid metabolism during stress-induced membrane remodeling.",

          "abstract": "Lineages that have invaded subterranean environments have repeatedly evolved remarkable adaptations to life in darkness. However, observational and experimental studies in additional natural systems are needed to further our understanding of repeated evolution and convergence. In Texas, a radiation of groundwater salamanders (genus Eurycea ), with independent invasions of subterranean karstic environments, offers an opportunity to investigate phenotypic convergence, parallel evolution, and the enhancement and regression of sensory systems. Adaptations to a troglobitic life in this clade include morphological, behavioral, and physiological changes within and among species. Intraspecific and interspecific variation in morphology in response to the selective pressures of life underground allows for detailed examination of physical, behavioral, and physiological changes associated with subterranean adaptation within a comparative phylogenetic framework. We find a correlated change between two sensory systems repeated across multiple subterranean Eurycea lineages: the degeneration of the eye and the expansion of the mechanosensory lateral line. The increase in anterior neuromast organs in subterranean lineages was positively correlated with the expression of pax6 (Paired-box 6), a conserved transcription factor important for vertebrate neurogenesis. Our results show a decreasing trend of PAX6 labeling in the neuromasts of adult surface salamanders ( Eurycea nana ) relative to the maintained labeling in subterranean species ( Eurycea rathbuni ). These lateral line enhancements are correlated with reductions in the development of optic systems in subterranean salamander lineages. Altogether, our findings provide a starting point for future evolutionary developmental investigations examining the genetic underpinnings of adaptive, repeated evolution in a novel system.",

Inhibition of macropinocytosis suppressed HIV-1 internalization into and subsequent fusion with primary CD4 + T cells regardless of the viral coreceptor usage.

Here, we use a synthesis of the sensitivity of coral reef calcification to climate change, alongside reef distribution products to estimate alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon fluxes resulting from reductions in reef calcification. Using a global ocean biogeochemical model, we simulate the impact on ocean carbon uptake under different emissions scenarios, accounting for uncertainty in present-day calcification rates. Reductions in net coral reef carbonate production can enhance the ocean carbon sink by up to 1.25 GtCO 2 y −1 by midcentury (0.48 GtCO 2 y −1 median estimate) with cumulative ocean carbon uptake up to 13% greater by 2300 (7% median estimate).

Here, we model the strongly coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wave packets, in a manner distinctively different from tight-binding or discrete hopping-based approaches. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wave packet evolution and the formation of acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables—including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy—over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, and high effective masses. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into nontrivial transport behavior in quantum materials.",

However, the conditions under which this material formed and its subsequent incorporation into growing planetesimals remains a subject of vigorous debate. Here, we show that C isotope variations among these organics in most carbonaceous chondrites are strongly correlated with mass-independent O isotope anomalies exhibited by their host meteorites. As the latter signature has been argued to track abundances of nebular water generated from photochemical processing of CO gas, the C isotope variability of refractory organic solids may relate to this same process. We propose a framework in which CO photolysis simultaneously produces H 2 O and generates a pool of C + ions that serve as precursors for C-rich organic solids, with their C isotope compositions suggesting formation over a relatively narrow and warm range of temperatures in the protoplanetary disk (~200 to 400 K). Two populations of organic precursors with different C isotope compositions became associated with distinct dust reservoirs prior to their delivery to the carbonaceous-chondrite-forming region, which likely resided at lower temperatures (&lt;170 K). This finding places detailed constraints on the location and distribution of chemical reactions that generated both water and organic-rich reservoirs in the early Solar System.",

In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) to investigate the effects of five BPA substitutes [bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol B, bisphenol F (BPF), tetramethyl BPF, and 4,4′-(Perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl)diphenol] at pathophysiologically relevant exposure levels during aging and examined the underlying mechanisms using a mouse model. Our results indicated that, among the five BPA substitutes, exposure to pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of BPS (300, 450, and 600 nM) accelerated aging in C. elegans . In mice, exposure to a pathophysiologically relevant concentration of BPS (125 μg/kg/day, from 4 to 20 mo of age) similarly reduces the life and health span and accelerates aging phenotypes in multiple tissues. Further investigations demonstrated that long-term BPS exposure resulted in a significantly higher accumulation of BPS in brown adipose tissue (BAT) than in other organs. RNA sequencing analysis of BAT revealed that BPS accelerates BAT aging through multiple pathways. Importantly, transplantation of BAT from BPS-exposed mice into BPS-naive mice accelerated aging in recipients. Conversely, transplantation of BAT from unexposed mice into BPS-exposed mice significantly improved their metabolic status and delayed aging. These findings elucidate the impact of pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of BPS on the aging process and suggest that these effects are likely mediated through the disruption of BAT function.",

          "abstract": "How brain structure relates to function is a critical and open question in neuroscience. Here, we characterize regional variation in structure–function coupling, capturing the degree to which a cortical region’s structural connections relate to patterns of coordinated neural activity in healthy, term-born neonates ( n = 239). Regional structure–function coupling is heterogeneously patterned across the cortex, with higher coupling in the auditory, lateral prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices. Average structure–function coupling is negatively associated with age during the first month of life, with age-associated decreases seen in primary sensory systems, specifically in auditory and somatomotor regions. Age-associated “decoupling” of structure and function reflects increasingly segregated patterns of functional connectivity and increasingly integrated patterns of white matter connectivity with age. Notably, higher structure–function coupling after accounting for age in the dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, and visual systems at birth is associated with faster visuospatial attention to faces at one year of age. These results yield valuable insight into the development of structural and functional connectivity across the cortex, including how interregional variation in structure–function coupling during the first month of life might shape later attention.",

Various purpose-built analysis tools and statistical algorithms have been developed, but often rely on redundant instrumentation and computationally intensive procedures. Here, we propose using the variance of the capacity difference between 0.2C and 1C, Var(Δ Q 0.2C-1C (V) ), based on the strong correlation between the interfacial state of the anode and mode of capacity degradation, as a measure of the health state of individual cells. A single-point “off-board” measurement of Var(Δ Q 0.2C-1C (V) ) indicates whether a particular cell is experiencing self-limiting or accelerating degradation and is thus near a knee point in its cycle life. This assessment additionally provides a quantitative criterion for differentiating used cells for reuse or recycling.

Active conservation management to reduce extinction risk includes increasing habitat connectivity, translocations from captive populations, or intensive surveillance of highly protected closed populations. Advances in sequencing technology mean that it is now possible to consider the genomic impacts of such strategies, as a proxy for variation in individual fitness. Using whole genome sequences from critically endangered eastern black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis michaeli ), we compare the consequences of different types of conservation efforts, based on cohorts of offspring resulting from parents from different sources. Based on the fraction of the genome in runs of homozygosity (ROH) of different lengths, we found lower inbreeding in offspring of individuals that had either been translocated from ex-situ populations (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.047) or dispersed between proximate native populations (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.065) compared to the intensively managed closed population from which the migrant moved (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.112). However, the benefit of such movement was removed after only a few generations of closed breeding (F ROH&gt;1Mb = 0.149). Although sample size restricted power to detect significance of differences, the relative abundance of highly deleterious mutations was higher for offspring resulting from translocation compared to the other cohorts and this load was sheltered by higher heterozygosity, which could increase risks of inbreeding depression if inbreeding subsequently occurs. In contrast, native dispersers reduced the negative effects of inbreeding without compromising the benefits of past purging of deleterious mutations. Our study highlights the importance of natural dispersal and reiterates the importance of maintaining habitat corridors between populations.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering attenuates widespread sensory and motor processing, both of which are mediated by phase coherence. However, it remains unclear i) whether mind wandering impacts both sensory input and motor output processing by modulating ii) neural entrainment to external stimuli, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC), and specifically iii) whether task difficulty with different degrees of attentional demands moderates the impact of mind wandering on phase coherence. Using the thought-probe method, we assessed participants’ attentional states during different sensory and motor tasks with varying task difficulty. We found that mind wandering decreased ITPC exclusively in less demanding tasks but not in difficult ones, regardless of whether the tasks involved visual input or motor output processing. Our results suggest that external task difficulty may modulate the balance between external and internal cognitive processing (e.g., mind wandering), with simpler tasks facilitating internally oriented cognition and increasing mind wandering. This balance between internal mind wandering and external task difficulty is mediated, in part, by phase coherence, which serves as an underlying neural mechanism. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that phase coherence and its dynamics (ITPC) play a key role in mediating the reciprocal balance of internal and external cognition—this suggests their partly shared cognitive-executive resources as entailed by the recently proposed Baseline model of cognition.",

These pumps are known to be activated by calmodulins to maintain Ca 2+ homeostasis in plants and animals. Here, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved copine protein BON1 is critical for maintaining low cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations by directly regulating two plasma membrane-localized Ca 2+ pumps ACA8 and ACA10 in Arabidopsis . BON1 interacts with a region within the N-terminal domain of ACA8 and ACA10, preceding the calmodulin binding sites, and stimulates ACA8 activity. This activation can occur without calmodulin binding, indicating that BON1 and calmodulin independently regulate the Ca 2+ pump. Loss of BON1 function results in elevated basal cytosolic Ca 2+ concentrations, which can be partially rescued by overexpressing hyperactive ACA8 or ACA10. Furthermore, we show that BON1 has one high-affinity Ca 2+ binding site in the VWA domain that is critical for activation of ACA8 as well as for BON1 function, suggesting a feedback mechanism for Ca 2+ homeostasis at resting concentrations. Our findings suggest that this Ca 2+ responsive regulatory mechanism extends beyond Arabidopsis , as we show interactions between ACA and BON proteins from algae to flowering plants, pointing to an ancient regulatory mechanism for maintaining low basal cytosolic Ca 2+ . Notably, a human plasma membrane-localized autoinhibited Ca 2+ pump can also be activated by a human BON protein in a yeast functional assay system, suggesting evolutionary conservation in Ca 2+ regulation across species.",

          "abstract": "Characterizing the conformational ensemble of biomolecular systems is key to understand their functions. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) captures two-dimensional snapshots of biomolecular ensembles, giving in principle access to thermodynamics. However, these images are very noisy and show projections of the molecule in unknown orientations, making it very difficult to identify the biomolecule’s conformation in each individual image. Here, we introduce cryo-EM simulation-based inference (cryoSBI) to infer the conformations of biomolecules and the uncertainties associated with the inference from individual cryo-EM images. CryoSBI builds on simulation-based inference, a merger of physics-based simulations and probabilistic deep learning, allowing us to use Bayesian inference even when likelihoods are too expensive to calculate. We begin with an ensemble of conformations, templates from experiments, and molecular modeling, serving as structural hypotheses. We train a neural network approximating the Bayesian posterior using simulated images from these templates and then use it to accurately infer the conformation of the biomolecule from each experimental image. Training is only done once on simulations, and after that, it takes just a few milliseconds to make inference on an image, making cryoSBI suitable for arbitrarily large datasets and direct analysis on micrographs. CryoSBI eliminates the need to estimate particle pose and imaging parameters, significantly enhancing the computational speed compared to explicit likelihood methods. Importantly, we obtain interpretable machine learning models by integrating physics-based approaches with deep neural networks, ensuring that our results are transparent and reliable. We illustrate and benchmark cryoSBI on synthetic data and showcase its promise on experimental single-particle cryo-EM data.",

          "abstract": "Circuit complexity, defined as the minimum circuit size required for implementing a particular Boolean computation, is a foundational concept in computer science. Determining circuit complexity is believed to be a hard computational problem. Recently, in the context of black holes, circuit complexity has been promoted to a physical property, wherein the growth of complexity is reflected in the time evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (“wormhole”) connecting the two sides of an anti-de Sitter “eternal” black hole. Here, we are motivated by an independent set of considerations and explore links between complexity and thermodynamics for functionally equivalent circuits, making the physics-inspired approach relevant to real computational problems, for which functionality is the key element of interest. In particular, our thermodynamic framework provides an alternative perspective on the obfuscation of programs of arbitrary length—an important problem in cryptography—as thermalization through recursive mixing of neighboring sections of a circuit, which can be viewed as the mixing of two containers with “gases of gates.” This recursive process equilibrates the average complexity and leads to the saturation of the circuit entropy, while preserving functionality of the overall circuit. The thermodynamic arguments hinge on ergodicity in the space of circuits which we conjecture is limited to disconnected ergodic sectors due to fragmentation. The notion of fragmentation has important implications for the problem of circuit obfuscation as it implies that there are circuits of same size and functionality that cannot be connected via a polynomial number of local moves. Furthermore, we argue that fragmentation is unavoidable unless the complexity classes NP and coNP coincide, a statement that implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy of computational complexity theory to its first level.",

          "abstract": "Regnase-1 is a ribonuclease that regulates inflammation in immune cells by degrading cytokine mRNA. Regnase-1 was identified as one of the frequently mutated genes in the inflamed colorectal epithelium of patients with ulcerative colitis; however, its significance in intestinal epithelial cells during the tumorigenic process remains unknown. Therefore, we developed an Apc Min/+ mouse model lacking Regnase-1 in intestinal epithelia. Regnase-1 deletion significantly enhanced colon tumor growth accompanied by elevated levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in tumor tissues. Transcriptome analysis of the tumor tissues revealed that Nfkbiz , a mediator of the interleukin (IL)-17 signaling pathway, was the primary degradative target of Regnase-1 in enterocytes and that Regnase-1 deficiency enhanced IL-17 signaling. The treatment with antibiotics or IL-17-neutralizing antibody canceled the proliferative effect of colon tumors due to Regnase-1 deletion, suggesting the protective role of Regnase-1 against colon tumor growth was dependent on IL-17 signaling triggered by gut microbes. Analysis of the Nfkbiz knockout mouse model demonstrated that the tumor-suppressive effect of Regnase-1 depended on Nfkbiz expression. Remarkably, oral treatment of dimethyl fumarate, a potential inhibitor of Regnase-1 protein inactivation, suppressed tumor growth, downregulated Nfkbiz , and suppressed ERK activation. Furthermore, TCGA data analysis revealed that low Regnase-1 expression in colorectal cancer tissue was related to poor prognosis. Therefore, Regnase-1 represses colon tumor growth by regulating IL-17 signaling via Nfkbiz mRNA degradation. Regnase-1 could be a potential therapeutic target in colon tumors.",

The precise mechanisms that determine the luminal pH of each organelle are not fully understood. This study investigated the mechanisms that regulate luminal pH to ensure optimal enzymatic activity. We identified Oxr1 and its paralog Ncoa7, which regulate the vacuolar-type proton pump ATPase (V-ATPase) at the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network (TGN). Oxr1 and Ncoa7 were predominantly localized at the Golgi and TGN membranes, dependent on their binding to various GTP-bound Rab proteins. In vitro experiments using purified recombinant proteins indicated that Oxr1 and Ncoa7 directly bind to the catalytic subunit of V-ATPase, inhibiting its ATP hydrolytic activity via their TLDc domains. We observed significant acidification of the Golgi/TGN lumen in Oxr1- and Ncoa7-depleted cells. Lectin blot analysis demonstrated that depletion of Oxr1 and Ncoa7 led to a defect in protein glycosylation, a major enzymatic posttranslational modification in the Golgi and TGN. Furthermore, depletion of Oxr1 and Ncoa7, along with drug-induced inhibition of glycosylation, increased lysosomal pH and sensitivity to silicon dioxide-induced membrane damage. This apparent lysosomal dysfunction suggested that, in addition to the Golgi and TGN, Oxr1 and Ncoa7 also contribute to the integrity of other organelles. Our findings indicate that Oxr1 and Ncoa7 protect the Golgi and TGN lumen from excess acidification by inhibiting V-ATPase activity and providing an optimal environment for enzymatic activity in the Golgi and TGN.",

A notable aspect of such membraneless organelles is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here, we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation of highly charged disordered proteins and polypeptides that span about two orders of magnitude in bulk viscosity. We find that their viscosity is highly correlated with protein translational diffusion and nano- to microsecond chain dynamics. Remarkably, analytical relations from polymer physics can predict condensate viscosity from diffusivity and chain dynamics, and vice versa, even for more hydrophobic disordered proteins and for synthetic polyelectrolytes, indicating a mechanistic link across several decades of length- and timescales. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction—a key quantity underlying these relations—reflect differences in interresidue contact lifetimes as a function of arginine content and salt concentration, leading to the vastly different dynamics among condensates. The rapid exchange of interresidue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.",

Here, we use machine-learning models trained with biome-resolved global observations to simulate seawater DMS concentrations (1850 to 2100) using physico-chemical and biological predictors from eight CMIP6 models. The scatter in current projections is largely reduced, and globally averaged seawater DMS concentrations are predicted to decrease in the coming decades. However, global DMS emissions will increase due to rising surface wind speeds and sea surface temperatures which contradicts the current AR6 assessment that the DMS flux will reduce in the future.

Patients exhibit short stature, dysmorphic bones, and severe growth plate abnormalities, as well as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia, and reduced plasma PTH levels. Humanized PTH1R (hPTH1R) mice expressing the H223R-hPTH1R JMC mutation die early without breeding. We therefore generated and characterized a stable mouse line expressing the T410R-hPTH1R allele, which confers a milder disease phenotype in patients. Mutant mice show near-normal longevity and reproductive capacity yet exhibit a profound skeletal phenotype characteristic of the disease. The long bones of T410R mice are markedly misshapen and have expanded metaphyses with disarrayed chondrocyte zones in growth plates and reduced primary spongiosa. PET/CT scanning revealed diminished uptake of [ 18 F]-sodium fluoride in the growth plate area, consistent with reduced mineralization and vascularization. Genetic ablation of Hdac4 rescued the growth plate abnormalities in T410R mice, thereby establishing the PTH1R-Gαs-cAMP-PKA-SIK3-HDAC4/5 pathway as the main mediator of growth plate abnormalities in JMC. Serum calcium was elevated and endogenous PTH was suppressed in T410R mice, and both parameters could be normalized by acute injection of an optimized PTH inverse agonist peptide. The T410R mouse thus represents a stable animal model of JMC that recapitulates the abnormalities in skeletal development and mineral ion homeostasis which characterize this disease. The mice should help efforts to further define the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the JMC phenotype and to develop a potential mode of therapy.",

Here, we demonstrate that XA21 is cleaved by the rhomboid-like protease OsRBL3b, likely within its transmembrane domain. OsRBL3b mRNA transcripts are preferentially expressed in rice spikelets. Rice plants expressing Xa21 but lacking a functional OsRBL3b displayed impaired anther dehiscence and pollen viability, resulting in male sterility and yield reduction with high levels of XA21 protein present in spikelets during anthesis. In leaves, osrbl3b mutants expressing XA21 had normal levels of this resistance protein and disease immunity.

          "abstract": "One key component of study design in population genetics is the “geographic breadth” of a sample (i.e., how broad a region across which individuals are sampled). How the geographic breadth of a sample impacts observations of rare, deleterious variants is unclear, even though such variants are of particular interest for biomedical and evolutionary applications. Here, in order to gain insight into the effects of sample design on ascertained genetic variants, we formulate a stochastic model of dispersal, genetic drift, selection, mutation, and geographically concentrated sampling. We use this model to understand the effects of the geographic breadth of sampling effort on the discovery of negatively selected variants. We find that samples which are more geographically broad will discover a greater number of variants as compared to geographically narrow samples (an effect we label “discovery”); though the variants will be detected at lower average frequency than in narrow samples (e.g., as singletons, an effect we label “dilution”). Importantly, these effects are amplified for larger sample sizes and fitness effects. We validate these results using both population genetic simulations and empirical analyses in the UK Biobank. Our results are particularly important in two contexts: the association of large-effect rare variants with particular phenotypes and the inference of negative selection from allele frequency data. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of considering geographic breadth when designing and carrying out genetic studies, especially at biobank scale.",

          "abstract": "Genomic diversity in pathogen populations is foundational for evolution and adaptation. Understanding population-level diversity is also essential for tracking sources and revealing detailed pathways of transmission and spread. For bacteria, culturing, isolating, and sequencing the large number of individual colonies required to adequately sample diversity can be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. While sequencing directly from a mixed population will show variants among reads, they cannot be linked to reveal allele combinations associated with phylogenetic inheritance patterns. Here, we describe the theory and method for using population sequencing directly from a mixed sample, along with a minimal number of individually sequenced colonies, to describe the phylogenetic diversity of a population without haplotype reconstruction. To demonstrate the utility of population sequencing in capturing phylogenetic diversity, we compared isogenic clones to population sequences of Burkholderia pseudomallei from sputum of a single patient. Our results point to the pathogen population being highly structured, suggesting that for some pathogens, sputum sampling may preserve structuring in the lungs and thus present a noninvasive alternative to understanding colonization, movement, and pathogen/host interactions. We also analyzed population sequences of Staphylococcus aureus derived from different people and different body sites to reveal directionality of transmission between hosts and across body sites, demonstrating the power and utility for characterizing the spread of disease and identification of reservoirs at the finest levels. We anticipate that population sequencing and analysis can be broadly applied to accelerate research in a wide range of fields reliant on a foundational understanding of population phylogenetic diversity.",

However, Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS) of rare target cells from highly heterogeneous systems has remained largely conceptual. Here, we present a positive dielectrophoresis-induced deterministic lateral displacement (pDEP-DLD)-based RACS (pDEP-DLD-RACS), in which a modulated pDEP-DLD force is applied to focus, trap, and functionally sort fast-moving single cells in a wide channel. For pigment- and oil-producing yeasts, pDEP-DLD-RACS shows high sorting accuracy (&gt;90%), high throughput (~600 events min −1 ), high yield (&gt;85%), and long stable running time (~10 h), and can sort rare cells while preserving full cellular vitality. Moreover, label-free sorting directly from a genome-wide random mutagenesis library with &gt;10 5 Aurantiochytrium sp. Mutants, based on intracellular docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content, produces mutant cells with 58% higher DHA productivity in just two RACS runs over two days, representing two-orders-of-magnitude higher time- and cost-efficiency than conventional approaches. This superior trait arises from global remolding of transcriptomes, including enhanced carbon metabolism, reduced intracellular NADPH synthesis rates, and increased triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. By enabling direct screening of metabolic traits from genome-wide mutagenesis libraries, pDEP-DLD-RACS is a powerful platform for synthetic biology.",

While substantial progress has been made, current magnetic programming techniques are inherently tied to template-based and sequential fabrication processes. These processes limit scalability, precision, and programmability. Here, we present a template-free, integrative strategy that leverages interlayer stress-induced 3D shape morphing in xerogel-PDMS bilayer materials triggered by temperature variations. This process induces preprogrammed deformation and fixes the 3D structure via interlayer stress and solid–liquid phase transition. It is akin to an insect encased in amber, resulting in a soft machine with precisely tailored magnetic domains upon saturated magnetization. The approach eliminates the need for predesigned molds, which offers scalable, template-free programmable magnetization, reducing time and labor costs. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through reconfigurable mechanical behavior in kirigami metamaterial structures, information encryption, and multilegged millirobots. Moreover, by incorporating a nonmagnetic PDMS layer, laser-based engraving and ablation allow simultaneous control of interlayer stress and material properties. This facilitates precise regulation of stress-induced deformation and magnetically responsive regions with 20 μm resolution and over 1.8 T magnetization strength. This template-free 3D magnetization strategy significantly enhances design flexibility, machining precision, and mass production. It paves the way for advanced multiscale and programmable soft magnetic devices.",

It has been extensively studied as a prototype of a biomolecular condensate whose assembly is driven by phase separation. While the steady-state size of the nucleolus is quantitatively accounted for by the thermodynamics of phase separation, we show that experimental measurements of the assembly dynamics are inconsistent with a simple model of a phase-separating system relaxing to its equilibrium state. Instead, we show that the dynamics are well described by a model in which the transcription of ribosomal RNA actively drives nucleolar assembly. We find that our model of active transcription-templated assembly quantitatively accounts for the rapid kinetics observed in early embryos at different developmental stages, and for different RNA interference (RNAi) perturbations of embryo size. Our model predicts a scaling of the time to assembly with the volume of the nucleus to the one-third power, which is confirmed by experimental data. Our study highlights the role of active processes such as transcription in controlling the placement and timing of assembly of membraneless organelles.",

          "abstract": "T cells display the remarkable ability to detect single foreign peptides displayed on target cells, while ignoring highly abundant self-peptides. This selectivity has been explained by kinetic proofreading in the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, which prevents responses to short-lived binding events regardless of their abundance. However, the biochemical mechanisms that drive kinetic proofreading have remained unclear. Here, using computational modeling, we show that these key signaling properties of the TCR pathway can emerge from the dynamics of linker for activation of T cells (LAT) phosphorylation, diffusion, and condensation following TCR–peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) binding. In this model, time delays in LAT condensate nucleation underlie kinetic proofreading, enabling selective signaling responses to high-affinity pMHC ligands. The cooperativity in the nucleation and growth of LAT condensates also provides a mechanism to amplify weak signals from single high-affinity peptides and for condensates to grow with increasing antigen numbers. In contrast to other models, condensate-nucleation proofreading predicts a dependence of signal strength on pMHC spacing at fixed number, a prediction we validated experimentally using a protein scaffold to present pMHCs at defined intervals. Our results suggest that nucleation-condensation proofreading underlies the remarkable antigen detection capabilities of the TCR signaling pathway.",

By creating a marine bacteria–mediated RNA interference approach, we show that myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), a critical immune adaptor for Toll-like receptor and interleukin pathways, is necessary for the stimulation of metamorphosis in response to bacteria. In addition to a developmental role, we show that MyD88 is necessary for survival during exposure to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , showing that Hydroides utilizes MyD88 during both development and an immune response.

          "abstract": "Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are a class of plant hormones that regulate various aspects of plant growth and development, and several key GA deactivation enzymes have been identified. In rice, non-13-hydroxylated GAs have been shown to be deactivated via 16α,17-epoxidation by a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE (EUI/CYP714D1). Although 16,17-dihydro-16α,17-epoxyGA 4 (16α,17-epoxyGA 4 ), the product of EUI from bioactive GA 4 , has shown weak bioactivity on rice seedlings, how 16α,17-epoxyGAs are further deactivated remains elusive. Here, we identify the EUI2 gene, which regulates internode elongation in rice, using a map-based cloning strategy. EUI2 encodes an epoxide hydrolase that hydrolyzes 16α,17-epoxyGAs to 16,17-dihydro-16α,17-dihydroxyGAs. The eui2 mutants are taller than wild-type plants but are shorter than the eui mutants. However, the levels of known bioactive GAs in the uppermost internodes are not significantly increased in the eui2 mutants. Instead, we show that the eui2 mutants accumulate 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 to high levels. We also show that exogenously applied 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 is significantly active in elongating the uppermost internode, although not as potent as GA 4 . Furthermore, we demonstrate that 16α,17-epoxyGA 4 can directly interact with the rice GA receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1, in vitro. Taken together, the sequential action of EUI and EUI2 results in the stepwise deactivation of GAs during internode elongation in rice. Our data also suggest that the accumulation of a weakly active GA contributes to the mildly tall phenotype of the eui2 mutants.",

Through extensive first-principles calculations, we identified key intermediates in the early stages of the decomposition process, resulting from C–C and C–N bond cleavage which leads to the opening of the internal cage structure. A detailed analysis of spectral trends and fingerprints provided evidence supporting N–NO 2 homolytic cleavage as the primary initial decomposition pathway. The combination of advanced core-level spectroscopy methods and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations enabled a comprehensive characterization of the molecular changes induced by controlled radiation dose exposures.

The very end of the Heinrich stadial (HS) characterizing Termination IV (T-IV, ca. 343 to 333 ka ago) shows a 250-y-long jump in greenhouse gas concentrations, followed by a 1.3 ka gradual decline back to the initial concentration. During this so-called overshoot, CO 2 and CH 4 reach their highest levels (about 303 ppm and 800 ppb, respectively) over the past 800 ka prior to industrialization. The jump in CO 2 is not accompanied by a change in δ 13 C–CO 2, suggesting that multiple mechanisms contributed to the exceptionally elevated CO 2 values. Following the jump, a slow 0.2‰ enrichment in δ 13 C–CO 2 occurs. We propose that during the jump, the sudden resumption of deepwater formation in the North Atlantic (NA) triggered an amplified release of CO 2 from the Southern Ocean (SO) by a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the SO westerlies, potentially in combination with a rapid land carbon release. The latter is expected from temporally enhanced wildfire activity related to higher fuel load and regionally changing weather conditions in connection to the ITCZ shift. A combination of marine proxy records and box model simulation suggests that the δ 13 C–CO 2 decrease expected from these processes is compensated by a net temperature increase in global sea surface temperature (SST) at the time of the AMOC resumption.",

However, the environmental cues that activate EnvZ/OmpR to trigger pathogenicity have remained unclear, limiting our understanding of host–pathogen interactions. Here, we demonstrate that in Vibrio parahaemolyticus , a major etiological agent of seafood-associated gastroenteritis, EnvZ functions as a direct ferric iron (Fe 3+ ) sensor governing virulence programs. Fe 3+ -EnvZ interaction triggers kinase phosphorylation and activation, enabling transcriptional control of biofilm formation, swarming motility, and type 3/6 secretion systems. An iron-binding-deficient EnvZ mutant (EnvZ Q103A ) abrogated Fe 3+ responsiveness and downstream signaling pathways. In an infant rabbit infection model, Fe 3+ enhanced V. parahaemolyticus intestinal colonization and virulence through EnvZ/OmpR signaling.

Due to a worldwide rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), phages have been proposed as a promising alternative to antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacterial infections. Up to this point in history, phage use in preclinical animal studies, clinical trials, and emergency-use compassionate care cases has centered around the original observation from 1915 showing phage as lytic agent, and thus a treatment that kills bacteria. Here, we describe an activity associated with phage therapy that extends beyond lytic activity that results in long-term protection against reinfection. This activity is potent, providing almost complete protection against a second lethal infection for animals treated with phage therapy. The activity also reduced infection burden an astounding billion-fold over the control. Reinfection protection requires phage lytic killing of its target bacterium but is independent of additional phage therapy. The effect is not driven by phage alone, lingering phage resistors, or a sublethal inoculum. In vitro phage-lysed bacteria provide partial protection, suggesting a combination of phage-induced lytic activity and immune stimulation by phage treatment is responsible for the effect. These observations imply certain phages may induce host adaptive responses following the lysis of the infecting bacteria. This work suggests phage therapy may contain a dual-action effect, an initial treatment efficacy followed by a long-term protection against reoccurring infection, a therapeutic-vaccination mechanism of action.",

Close membrane-to-membrane contact (≤13 nm) has been proposed as a key mechanism of TcE function. To investigate this and identify potential additional mechanisms, we compared four immunoglobulin G1-based (IgG1) TcE Formats (A–D) targeting CD3ε and Her2, designed to create varying intermembrane distances (A &lt; B &lt; C &lt; D). Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and modeling of the conformational states of isolated TcEs and TcE–antigen complexes predicted close contacts (≤13 nm) for Formats A and B and far contacts (≥18 nm) for Formats C and D. In supported lipid bilayer (SLB) model interfaces, Formats A and B recruited, whereas Formats C and D repelled, CD2–CD58 interactions. Formats A and B also excluded bulky Quantum dots more effectively. SAXS also revealed that TcE–antigen complexes formed by Formats A and C were less flexible than complexes formed by Formats B and D. Functional data with Her2-expressing tumor cells showed cytotoxicity, surface marker expression, and cytokine release following the order A &gt; B = C &gt; D. In a minimal system for IS formation on SLBs, TcE performance followed the trend A = B = C &gt; D. Addition of close contact requiring CD58 costimulation revealed phospholipase C-γ activation matching cytotoxicity with A &gt; B = C &gt; D. Our findings suggest that when adhesion is equivalent, TcE potency is determined by two parameters: contact distance and flexibility. Both the close/far-contact formation axis and the low/high flexibility axis significantly impact TcE potency, explaining the similar potency of Format B (close contact/high flexibility) and C (far contact/low flexibility).",

However, the thermodynamic mechanism and dynamics of nanoparticle growth have yet to be understood. Addressing these issues, we tracked hundreds of in-situ growth trajectories of a nanoparticle ensemble using liquid-phase TEM and found that the nanoparticle growth, including coalescence, exhibits nanoparticle size-dependent multiphasic dynamics, unexplainable by current theories. Motivated by this finding, we developed a model and theory for an ensemble of growing nanoparticles, providing a unified, quantitative understanding of the time-dependent mean and fluctuation of nanoparticle size and size-dependent growth rate profiles across various nanoparticle systems and experimental conditions. Our work reveals that the chemical potential in a small nanoparticle strongly deviates from the Gibbs–Thomson equation, shedding light on how it governs the size-dependent growth dynamics of nanoparticles.",

          "abstract": "Partial melting of metasedimentary rocks is generally accepted as the source of peraluminous Himalayan leucogranites—they are commonly considered as pure “S-type” (sedimentary source) granites. Here, a uniquely comprehensive geochronological and geochemical dataset shows that partial melting of metaigneous rocks in the eastern Himalaya produced peraluminous leucogranites—these supposed S-type leucogranites have I-type (igneous) sources. Inherited magmatic zircons from leucogranites and metaigneous rocks have indistinguishable ages, trace element compositions, and Hf isotope compositions, distinct from zircons in metasedimentary rocks. Experimentally, partial melting of metagranitic rocks rather than metapelites predicts alkali major element chemistry of these leucogranites better. High δ 18 O, high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, and low ε Nd (t) for Himalayan leucogranites have been used to argue for a metasedimentary rock source, but overlapping values occur in metaigneous rocks. Although sediment-sourced leucogranites also occur, igneous-sourced leucogranites are likely common in large hot orogens. A survey of leucogranite geochemistry across the Himalaya suggests that ~20% might be I-type, with no apparent spatial or temporal bias. I-type leucogranites appear to be rare-metal poor, however. Unlike prior assertions that I-type granites represent juvenile additions to orogens, metaigneous-sourced Himalayan granites more likely represent crustal reworking.",

          "abstract": "Coherent superposition of electronic states, created by ionizing a molecule, can initiate ultrafast dynamics of the electron density. Correlation between nuclear and electron motions, however, typically dissipates the electronic coherence in only a few femtoseconds, especially in larger and more flexible molecules. We, therefore, use ab initio semiclassical dynamics to study decoherence in a sequence of analogous organic molecules of increasing size and find, surprisingly, that extending the carbon skeleton in propynal analogs slows down decoherence and prolongs charge migration. To elucidate this observation, we decompose the overall decoherence into contributions from individual vibrational modes and show that: 1) The initial decay of electronic coherence is caused by high- and intermediate-frequency vibrations via momentum separation of nuclear wavepackets evolving on different electronic surfaces. 2) At later times, the coherence disappears completely due to the increasing position separation in the low-frequency modes. 3) In agreement with another study, we observe that only normal modes that preserve the symmetry of the molecule induce decoherence. All together, we justify the enhanced charge migration by a combination of increased hole-mixing and the disappearance of decoherence contributions from specific vibrational modes—CO stretching in butynal and various H rockings in pentynal.",

          "abstract": "Recent approvals of polymeric adenosine diphosphate ribose (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) for BRCA-mutant metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer necessitate an understanding of the factors that shape sensitivity and resistance. Reversion mutations that restore homologous recombination (HR) repair are detected in ~50 to 80% of BRCA-mutant patients who respond but subsequently relapse, but there is currently little insight into why only ~50% of BRCA-mutant patients display upfront resistance. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genomic determinants of PARPi resistance in murine Brca2 Δ/Δ prostate organoids genetically engineered in a manner that precludes the development of reversion mutations. Remarkably, we recovered multiple independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting three different members ( Cdt1, Cdc6, and Dbf4 ) of the DNA prereplication complex (pre-RC), each of which independently conferred resistance to olaparib and the next-generation PARP-1 selective inhibitor AZD5305. Moreover, sensitivity to PARP inhibition was restored in Brca2 Δ/Δ , Cdc6-depleted prostate cells by knockdown of geminin, a negative regulator of Cdt1, further implicating the critical role of a functional pre-RC complex in PARPi sensitivity. Furthermore, ~50% of CRPC tumors have copy number loss of pre-RC complex genes, particularly CDT1 . Mechanistically, prostate cells with impaired pre-RC activity displayed rapid resolution of olaparib-induced DNA damage as well as protection from replication fork degradation caused by Brca2 loss, providing insight into how Brca2-mutant cancer cells can escape cell death from replication stress induced by PARP inhibition in the absence of HR repair. Of note, a pharmacologic inhibitor that targets the CDT1/geminin complex (AF615) restored sensitivity to AZD5305, providing a potential translational avenue to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition.",

Here, we show that pallidocortical neurons project to diverse motor and nonmotor cortical regions, are organized topographically in the GPe, and segregate into at least two distinct electrophysiological and molecular phenotypes. In addition, we find that the GPe receives direct synaptic input from deep layers of diverse motor and nonmotor cortical regions, some of which form reciprocal connections onto pallidocortical neurons.

Its analgesic effect is mainly attributed to its metabolite, AM404, acting on cannabinoid receptors or TRPV1 channels in central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Here, we show that AM404 is produced by primary sensory neurons. It inhibits sodium current in nociceptor neurons, blocking action potential (AP) generation and reducing nocifensive behavior in naïve and inflamed rats. We demonstrated that this analgesic effect of AM404 is mediated by its direct inhibition of nociceptive voltage-gated sodium channels (Na V ) 1.8 and 1.7 via the local anesthetic binding site. The Na V 1.8 and 1.7 inhibition was specific for AM404 and not observed with other metabolites of paracetamol. Our findings suggest that the analgesic effect of paracetamol is mediated mainly by direct AM404-induced inhibition of nociceptive sodium channels at the peripheral nociceptor neurons.

Surprisingly, although the expression of synaptic scaling and IHP was dependent on overlapping signaling pathways, they could be independently recruited by manipulating spiking activity or NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, respectively. Further, we found that changes in visual experience that affect NMDAR activation but not mean firing selectively trigger IHP, without recruiting synaptic scaling.

Across four expeditions to the North Pacific transition zone, we document a repeated supply of isotopically light iron from an atmospheric source in spring, reflecting an estimated 39 ± 9 % anthropogenic contribution to the surface ocean iron budget. Expression of iron-stress genes in metatranscriptomes, and evidence for colimitation of ecosystem productivity by iron and nitrogen, indicates that enhanced iron supply should spur spring phytoplankton blooms, accelerating the seasonal drawdown of nitrate delivered by winter mixing. This effect is consistent with regional trends in satellite ocean color, which show a shorter, more intense spring bloom period, followed by an earlier arrival of oligotrophic conditions in summer. Continued iron emissions may contribute to poleward shifts in transitional marine ecosystems, compounding the anticipated impacts from ocean warming and stratification.",

Exploring tessellation at the molecular scale is pivotal for gaining profound insights into the effects of tessellation on materials and elucidating the essential design principles for supramolecular tessellation. In this study, we develop a dynamic fullerene host ( 1 ) with three consecutive heptagons, which promotes diverse supramolecular tessellation via hierarchical assembly. In the solid state, molecule 1 arranges itself into a layered square-shaped tessellation in the crystal superstructure. Interestingly, the co-crystal structures of 1 with C 60 and C 70 exhibit highly ordered triangular and rhombic tessellation patterns, respectively, due to the adaptive regulation of heptagons with different curved guests, demonstrating the first series of layered tessellated framework in supramolecular fullerene chemistry.

We performed a Bayesian genome-wide association study and selection analyses in this naturally occurring canine model to elucidate underlying genetic risk factors for gastric cancer and identified 15 associated loci. Variant filtering revealed germline putative regulatory variants for the EPAS1 ( HIF2A ) and PTEN genes and a coding variant in CD101 .

          "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a cell death mechanism distinguished by its dependence on iron-mediated lipid oxidation. Cancer cells highly resistant to conventional therapies often demonstrate lipid metabolic and redox vulnerabilities that sensitize them to cell death by ferroptosis. These include a unique dependency on the lipid antioxidant selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), that acts as a ferroptosis inhibitor. Synthetic high-density lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (HDL NP) targets the high-affinity HDL receptor scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) and regulates cell and cell membrane lipid metabolism. Recently, we reported that targeting cancer cell SR-B1 with HDL NP depleted cell GPx4, which is accompanied by increased cell membrane lipid peroxidation and cancer cell death. These data suggest that HDL NP may induce ferroptosis. Thus, we conducted an unbiased CRISPR-based positive selection screen and target validation studies in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cell lines to ascertain the mechanism through which HDL NP regulates GPx4 and kills cancer cells. The screen revealed two genes, acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), whose loss conferred resistance to HDL NP. Validation of ACSL4 supports that HDL NP induces ferroptosis as the predominant mechanism of cell death, while validation of TXNRD1 revealed that HDL NP reduces cellular selenium and selenoprotein production, most notably, GPx4. Accordingly, we define cancer cell metabolic targets that can be simultaneously actuated by a multifunctional, synthetic HDL NP ligand of SR-B1 to kill cancer cells by ferroptosis.",

Biomass burning emissions (BBEs) over the boreal region have strongly increased during the last decade and are expected to continue increasing as the climate warms. Climate models simulate aerosol processes, yet historical and future Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) simulations have no active fire component, and BBEs are prescribed as external forcings. Here, we show that CMIP6 used future boreal BBEs scenarios with unrealistic near-zero trends that have a large impact on climate trends. By running sensitivity experiments with ramped up boreal emissions based on observed trends, we find that increasing boreal BBEs reduces global warming by 12% and Arctic warming by 38%, reducing the loss of sea ice. Tropical precipitation shifts southward as a result of the hemispheric difference in boreal aerosol forcing and subsequent temperature response. These changes stem from the impact of aerosols on clouds, increasing cloud droplet number concentration, cloud optical depth, and low cloud cover, ultimately reducing surface shortwave flux over northern latitudes. Our results highlight the importance of realistic boreal BBEs in climate model simulations and the need for improved understanding of boreal emission trends and aerosol–climate interactions.",

Recently however, single-cell technologies have uncovered heterogeneity within these populations, indicating that individual cells may operate as independently regulated units. Using high-resolution tools such as single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (sm-FISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we investigated the contributions of individual and the collective of fetal Leydig cells to androgen production over time during mouse testis development. Temporal profiles of intratesticular androgens alongside the expression of steroidogenic pathway genes ( Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd3b1 ) from prenatal to perinatal testes demonstrated that the peak in gene expression preceded the peak in androgen production. Spatially, steroidogenic cells were initially observed to be concentrated toward the anterior–posterior poles along the center of the dorsal–ventral axis of the fetal testis at embryonic day (E) 13 and then expanded to a uniform distribution by E16. Next, sm-FISH using probes for individual steroidogenic pathway genes exposed the following findings: gene transcription and processing of individual and combinations of steroidogenic pathway genes are not synchronized among fetal Leydig cells; and some fetal Leydig cells express incomplete sets of genes. Further, sm-FISH and scRNA-seq data corroborated the presence of fetal Leydig and other interstitial cell types harboring incomplete sets of steroidogenic pathway genes throughout developmental stages. Taken together, these findings highlight that fetal steroidogenic gene expression is tightly regulated and that transcript presence among interstitial cell types promotes the possibility that optimal androgen biosynthesis results from a cooperative effort among neighboring steroidogenic cells.",

However, despite the high affinity of α-syn for membranes, evidence that the α-helical form is adopted inside cells has been indirect. DNP-assisted solid-state NMR on frozen cellular samples can report directly on the entire conformational ensemble. By controlling the distribution of the DNP agent throughout the cellular biomass, such experiments can provide quantitative information upon the entire structural ensemble or provide information about spatially resolved subpopulations. When the polarization agent is dispersed homogeneously throughout the cell, a minority of the α-syn inside HEK293 cells adopts a highly α-helical-rich conformation. When the polarization agent is peripherally localized, the α-helical-rich conformation predominates, indicating that it is preferentially adopted near the cellular periphery. This demonstrates how selectively altering the spatial distribution of the DNP agent can be a powerful tool to observe spatially distinct structural ensembles.

          "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation (NT) is induced in Vibrio cholerae upon attachment to chitin surfaces in the aquatic environment. Here, we show that free environmental DNA adsorbs to chitin surfaces under physiologically realistic conditions. Using live-cell imaging and a fluorescent NT reporter, we demonstrate with cellular resolution microscopy that V. cholerae utilizes chitin-bound DNA as a reservoir for genetic exchange. Additionally, we demonstrate that uptake of DNA from this chitin-bound reservoir requires the forceful retraction of competence type IV pili. These findings uncover a role for retraction force in driving pilus-dependent NT and suggest that chitin particle surfaces can act as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer.",

          "abstract": "The Earth system model CLIMBER-2 has been used in past work to successfully reproduce the glacial/interglacial cycles of the Plio–Pleistocene and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) from predominantly 40 to 100 ky timescale oscillatory behavior as a function of declining volcanic outgassing and regolith removal. In this study, we further examine the sensitivity of this previous work to varying prescribed levels of volcanic outgassing and regolith extent and the long-term dynamics of the global carbon cycle, affecting the exchange and partitioning of carbon between different Earth system reservoirs and therefore global atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. As volcanic outgassing decreases, CO 2 and land carbon storage decrease, while ocean carbon storage, including CaCO 3 sediment, increases. At volcanic outgassing levels below a threshold value of roughly 5.7 Tmol C yr −1 , sea level decreases due to land ice formation, leading to increased carbon accumulation in the ocean and decreased carbon in the CaCO 3 sediment reservoir. Our previous finding of strong hysteresis and path dependence in the glacial/interglacial alternation history [J. Carrillo et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 121, e2322926121 (2024)] appears to be a tenuous climate feature, dependent on the precise representation of carbon cycle processes and, specifically, the numerical precision used in the calculation of certain key state variables in the model’s carbon cycle.",

          "abstract": "What is the neural substrate that enables the cerebral cortex to control a single mystacial vibrissa and orchestrate its movement? To answer this question, we injected rabies virus into the intrinsic muscle that protracts the rat C3 vibrissa and used retrograde transneuronal transport to identify the cortical neurons that influence the muscle. A surprisingly diverse set of cortical areas is the origin of disynaptic control over the motoneurons that influence the C3 protractor. More than two thirds of these layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) are dispersed in frontal and parietal areas outside the primary motor cortex (vM1). This observation emphasizes the importance of descending motor commands from non-primary motor areas. More than a third of the L5PNs originate from somatosensory areas, such as the barrel field (vS1). The barrel field has been long considered a prototypic model system for studying sensory processing at the level of the cerebral cortex. Even so, we find that the number of L5PNs in vS1, and even their peak density, rivals the number and peak density of L5PNs in vM1. Thus, our results emphasize the importance of the barrel field in processing motor output. The distribution of L5PNs in vM1 and vS1 leads us to propose a model of vibrissa protraction in which vM1 output results in protraction, and vS1 output results in reciprocal inhibition (suppression) of protraction. This paired initiation and suppression of complementary movements may be a general feature of the descending output from the rodent M1 and S1.",

When convergent traits emerge on the tree of life, they are sometimes driven by the same underlying gene families, while other times, many different gene families are involved. Conversely, a gene family may be repeatedly recruited for a single trait or many different traits. To understand the general rules governing convergence at both genomic and phenotypic levels, we systematically tested associations between 56 binary metabolic traits and gene count in 14,785 gene families from 993 Saccharomycotina yeasts. Using a recently developed phylogenetic approach that reduces spurious correlations, we found that gene family expansion and contraction were significantly linked to trait gain and loss in 45/56 (80%) traits. While 595/739 (81%) significant gene families were associated with only one trait, we also identified several “keystone” gene families that were significantly associated with up to 13/56 (23%) of all traits. Strikingly, most of these families are known to encode metabolic enzymes and transporters, including all members of the industrially relevant MAL tose fermentation loci in the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These results indicate that convergent evolution on the gene family level may be more widespread across deeper timescales than previously believed.",

In this work, we report structures of imitation switch (ISWI) bound to the nucleosome during active ATP hydrolysis and remodeling, revealing conformational transitions of the remodeling motor across the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycle. The DNA strands were distorted accordingly, showing one full base-pair bulge and a loss of histone contact at the site of motor binding in the adenosine diphosphate* (ADP*) and apo* (unbound) states. We also identified several important elements for regulation of the remodeling activity. Notably, an enzyme conformation exiting the remodeling cycle reveals a linker DNA–sensing brake mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate a multistate model of ISWI action, providing a comprehensive mechanism of DNA translocation and regulation underpinning chromatin remodeling.",

Here, we use socioeconomic and environmental datasets from Roman Western Anatolia (first c. BCE to seventh c. CE) to investigate the possible mechanisms of globalization-driven acceleration. After the Roman conquest, Anatolia experienced a rapid transition to profoundly anthropogenic landscapes, reaching hitherto unknown levels of agricultural production that remained stable for several centuries. At the socioeconomic level, as revealed by our application of social network analysis to the numismatic data, the growth dynamics continued, leading to ever greater integration. When international conflict in the seventh c. CE disrupted the connectivity, the anthropogenic landscapes rewilded. This dual-system behavior, critical transition followed by equilibrium in the socioecological realm and continued growth in the socioeconomic realm, suggests that the observed postacceleration stabilization necessitated differential balancing of negative and positive feedbacks in each domain.",

Despite its abundance, the impact of defects, particularly oxygen vacancies, on davemaoite’s properties under mantle conditions has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we use machine learning molecular dynamic simulations to examine the behavior of oxygen-deficient davemaoite structures under high pressures and temperatures. Our simulations reveal its superionic transition driven by oxygen’s diffusion, enhancing electrical conductivities. Our predicted phase diagrams demonstrate that higher oxygen vacancy concentrations expand the superionic phase region. This superionic behavior implies that defective davemaoite could play a critical role in early mantle oxidation and deep-Earth oxygen cycling, providing a potential major source of mobile oxygen in the deep mantle. These findings offer fresh insights into the geodynamic processes in Earth’s early mantle and suggest that oxygen-deficient davemaoite could primarily contribute to the electrical conductivity and oxidation state of the deep lower mantle.",

We identified compounds 5i3 and 5e2 , with robust antiviral efficacy against wild-type HIV-1 and rilpivirine-resistant strains. Encouragingly, in vitro selection of mutant strains with 5i3 took 39 passages to select resistance, with no phenotypic cross-resistance observed with known RT drugs. Co-crystal structures of wild-type and mutant RT with 5i3 and 5e2 revealed their resilience toward resistance mutations due to enhanced conformational flexibility and positional adaptability. 5i3 exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties and favorable safety profiles, without substantial cytochrome P450 inhibition, and excellent oral bioavailability.

Here, we demonstrate that secondary eggshell units in non-avian dinosaur eggshells are biogenic in nature, based on analyses using advanced microscopic techniques. The structural characteristics of these units suggest a formation mechanism similar to that of turtle and crocodile eggshells, with matrix fibers likely initiating their development. Furthermore, a diminishing presence of secondary eggshell units in non-avian maniraptoran dinosaurs points to the evolution of a more refined physiological process for eggshell formation in this lineage.

Meanwhile, snow loss is also highly asymmetric. These changes are critical for regional agriculture and water management, yet the roles of specific forcings behind them remain unclear. Based on hierarchical large-ensemble climate model simulations, ~32 ± 28% of the surface air temperature (SAT) asymmetric trend and 16 ± 13% of the snow cover asymmetric trend between Eurasia and North America are attributable to tropical Pacific variability. Single-forcing experiments reveal that anthropogenic aerosols can induce a comparable asymmetry, accounting for 34 ± 23% (24 ± 17%) of observed SAT (snow cover) asymmetric trends.

Under compression, Au 8 -C exhibits notable piezoluminescence enhancement. However, Au 8 -P presents monotonic piezoluminescence quenching. High-pressure structural characterizations confirm the existence of stacking-dependent anisotropic compression in Au 8 -C and Au 8 -P. Under high pressure, the columnar-stacked Au 8 -C shrinks faster along the a axis, increasing the aspect ratio (AR) of the fusiform Au 8 core. However, the layered Au 8 -P is compressed faster along the c axis, reducing the AR and leading to a flatter Au 8 core. High-pressure femtosecond transient absorption, time-resolved photoluminescence, and Raman spectra collaboratively confirm that differentiated anisotropic compression notably suppresses nonradiative loss caused by low-frequency vibrations of the Au 8 core, which is responsible for the piezoluminescence enhancement in Au 8 -C.",

We developed an orally administered mucin complexing polymeric (MCP) drug, designed to replicate duodenal exclusion physiology. MCPs, intended to have electrostatic and covalent cross-linkages with mucin glycoproteins, form extended network structures with resulting alteration of mucus barrier properties. Selective targeting of the duodenum is achieved via pH-based activation chemistry.

          "abstract": "Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) direct precise gene expression for development and environmental response, yet their spatial organization in crops is largely unknown. We introduce transposase-accessible chromosome conformation capture (TAC-C), a method integrating ATAC-seq and Hi-C to capture fine-scale chromatin interactions in four major crops: rice, sorghum, maize, and wheat. TAC-C reveals a strong association between chromatin interaction frequency and gene expression, particularly emphasizing the conserved roles of chromatin interaction hub anchors and hub genes across crop species. Integrating chromatin structure with population genetics data highlights that chromatin loops connect distal regulatory elements to phenotypic variation. In addition, asymmetrical open chromatin interactions among subgenomes, driven by transposon insertions and sequence variations, contribute to biased homoeolog expression. Furthermore, TaSPL7/15 regulate photosynthesis-related genes through chromatin interactions, with enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and starch content in Taspl7&amp;15 mutant. TAC-C provides insights into the spatial organization of regulatory elements in crops, especially for SPL-mediated photosynthesis regulation in wheat.",

While gallium’s high modulus tuning ratio and rapid phase transitions make it ideal for transformative electronic systems (TES), its liquid-state instability, high surface tension, and unintended phase transitions during processing pose substantial challenges. Here, we introduce STiffness-Adjustable temperature-Responsive ink (STAR ink), a chemically sinterable gallium composite electronic ink designed to overcome these obstacles. STAR ink enables high-resolution (~50 micrometers) circuit patterning, large-scale batch fabrication, and three-dimensional structure coating at room temperature. Through pH-controlled chemical sintering, STAR ink–based TES exhibits exceptional mechanical tunability (tuning ratio: 1465) and electrical conductivity (2.27 × 10 6 siemens per meter). Demonstrated applications—from multilayered variable stiffness printed circuit boards (PCBs) matching standard PCBs’ complexity to body-temperature responsive neural probe—underscore STAR ink’s potential for reconfigurable electronics across consumer electronics and biomedical devices.",

The separation of the multiplication layer controls the density of trap states while amplifying the response of conventional narrowband photodetectors by more than 215 times. The carrier dynamics were characterized by ultrafast measurement, thus verifying the mechanism of response amplification. By analyzing multiplication with different trap states energy levels under charge injection, it is shown that dopants have a wide selection space, providing a feasible path for high-performance narrowband photodetectors. As a result, the external quantum efficiency of 2259% with a 38-nanometer full width at half maximum and the specific detectivity of 4.84 × 10 12 Jones was obtained at 825 nanometers.

Its synergy with topology may yield an exotic topological phase unique to a certain magnetic order, termed antiferromagnetic topological insulators (AF TIs). A hallmark signature of AF TIs is the presence of a single surface Dirac cone—a feature typically associated with strong three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators but lacking direct observation. Here, we theoretically and experimentally discover a 3D photonic AF TI protected by the combined symmetry of time reversal and half-lattice translation. By measuring both bulk and surface states, we directly observe the symmetry-protected single-Dirac-cone surface states and their remarkable robustness against random magnetic disorders. To our knowledge, our work constitutes the first realization of photonic AF TIs and photonic analogs of strong 3D topological insulators, opening a chapter for exploring topological photonic devices and phenomena incorporating additional magnetic degrees of freedom.",

Growing evidence implicates a set of regions in the human parietal and frontal lobes [also known as the “physics network” (PN)] in such intuitive physical inferences. However, the central tenet of this hypothesis, that PN runs forward simulations to predict future states, remains untested. In this preregistered study, we first show that PN abstractly represents whether two objects are in contact with each other, a physical scene property critical for prediction (because objects’ fates are intertwined when they are in contact). We then show that PN (but not other visual areas) carries abstract information about predicted future contact events (i.e., collisions). These findings support the hypothesis that PN contains a generative model of the physical world that conducts forward simulations, serving as the brain’s “physics engine.”",

Clr4 is the sole known methyltransferase catalyzing H3K9 methylation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe . Clr4 K455/K472 automethylation and H3K14 ubiquitination (H3K14Ub) are vital activators of Clr4, ensuring appropriate heterochromatin deposition and preventing deleterious silencing. While automethylation’s activation mechanism is uncovered, the mechanism of H3K14Ub’s significantly stronger stimulation on Clr4 remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of Clr4 bound to ubiquitinated and unmodified H3 peptides at 2.60 and 2.39 angstrom, which revealed a synergistic mechanism underlying the pronounced stimulatory effect: H3K14Ub increases substrate affinity through multivalent interactions and facilitates the allosteric transition of Clr4 from an inactive apo conformation to a hyperactive “catalyzing state,” including conformational changes in the αC-SET-insertion region, autoregulatory loop, and the β9/10 loop. We finally propose a multilevel structural model for the Clr4 catalytic-regulatory cycle.

APC/C FZR-1 facilitates the degradation of MES-4 and MES-3 when GSCs transition toward differentiating into oocytes. The activity of APC/C FZR-1 is restricted by the Notch signaling pathway provided by the distal tip cell, which is responsible for maintaining the stemness of the GSC pool.

We report the experimental validation of a quantum fluctuation theorem (QFT) in a photonic system, applicable to general quantum processes with nonclassical characteristics, including quasi-probabilistic descriptions of entropy production and multiple time-reversal processes. Our experiment confirms that the ratio between the quasi-probabilities of the time-forward and any multiple time-reversal processes obeys a generalized Crooks QFT. Moreover, coherence induced by a quantum process leads to the imaginary components of quantum entropy production, governing the phase factor in the QFT. These findings underscore the fundamental symmetry between a general quantum process and its time reversal, providing an elementary toolkit to explore noisy quantum information processing.",

Taking advantage of the long lifetimes, the as-synthesized radicals are directly characterized in the real space at the single-chemical-bond scale by means of bond-resolving scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. Accompanied by the excellent stability, the radicals exhibit high chemical reactivities and facilitate the intermolecular radical transfer reactions at extreme low temperature. The preparation of persistent radicals not only favors the characterization of a surface-stabilized radical in the real space but also aids in illuminating the detailed reaction pathways of subsequent radical-assisted reactions directly.",

Our analysis revealed notable associations between heSTRs and brain- and neuron-specific distal regulatory signals. Potential target genes regulated by heSTRs, identified by incorporating distal regulations, are enriched with neuronal development–related functions and disorders, displaying neuron-specific expression enhancement in humans. Moreover, heSTRs are associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility specifically in human neurons. In addition, heSTRs show substantial association with pathogenic STR loci exhibiting abnormal copy number variations, as reported by cohort studies on schizophrenia and autism. This study underscores the role of heSTRs in both human evolution and disorders, offering valuable insights for future research on STRs from an evolutionary perspective.",

Exopolysaccharide (EPS), a major virulence factor of R. solanacearum , elicits pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in tomato, but the means by which EPS is recognized in the plant remain poorly understood. We found that tomato non-arginine-aspartate (non-RD) receptor kinase SlLYK4 mediates the perception of R. solanacearum EPS and positively regulates resistance to bacterial wilt. The RD receptor kinases SlLYK1 and SlLYK13 are required for EPS-triggered immune responses and form complexes with SlLYK4. These receptor kinase complexes have dual functions in recognizing bacterial EPS and fungal chitin. Phosphorylation of serine-320 in the juxtamembrane domain of SlLYK4 is essential in EPS- and chitin-mediated signaling, whereas phosphorylation of serine-334 or serine-634 in the C-terminal domain is required for chitin or EPS signaling, respectively.

Many Gram-negative bacteria that encode PQQ-dependent enzymes do not produce it and instead obtain it from the environment. To achieve this, Escherichia coli uses the TonB-dependent transporter PqqU as a high-affinity PQQ importer. Here, we show that PqqU binds PQQ with high affinity and determine the high-resolution structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex, revealing that PqqU undergoes conformational changes in PQQ binding to capture the cofactor in an internal cavity. We show that these conformational changes preclude the binding of a bacteriophage, which targets PqqU as a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ structure, we identify amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla occupying diverse habitats, indicating that PQQ is an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.",

We demonstrated that HDAC1-3 catalyze sorbylation upon sorbate uptake and desorbylation in the absence of sorbate both in vitro and in cells. Sorbate uptake in mice livers significantly induced histone Ksor, correlating with decreased expressions of inflammation-response genes. Accordingly, sorbate treatment in macrophage RAW264.7 cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation dose-dependently down-regulated proinflammatory gene expressions and nitric oxide production. Proteomic profiling identified RelA, a component of the NF-κB complex, and its interacting proteins as bona fide Ksor targets and sorbate treatment significantly decreased NF-κB transcriptional activities in response to LPS stimulation in RAW264.7 cells.

          "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster , olfactory encoding in the mushroom body (MB) involves thousands of Kenyon cells (KCs) processing inputs from hundreds of projection neurons (PNs). Recent data challenge the notion of random PN-to-KC connectivity, revealing preferential connections between food-related PNs and specific KCs. Our study further uncovers a broader picture—an L-shaped hybrid network, supported by spatial patterning: Food-related PNs diverge across KC classes, whereas pheromone-sensitive PNs converge on γ KCs. α/β KCs specialize in food odors, whereas γ KCs integrate diverse inputs. Such spatial arrangement extends further to the antennal lobe (AL) and lateral horn (LH), shaping a systematic olfactory landscape. Moreover, our functional validations align with computational predictions of KC odor encoding based on the hybrid connectivity, correlating PN-KC activity with behavioral preferences. In addition, our simulations showcase the network’s augmented sensitivity and precise discrimination abilities, underscoring the computational benefits of this hybrid architecture in olfactory processing.",

During subsequent rest or sleep, the activity patterns of these neurons often correlate with those observed during the preceding experience. Growing evidence suggests that these reactivations play a crucial role in memory consolidation, the process by which experiences are solidified in cortical networks for long-term storage. Here, we use longitudinal two-photon Ca 2+ imaging alongside paired LFP recordings in the hippocampus and cortex, to show that targeted manipulation of PV + inhibitory neurons in the lateral visual cortex after daily training selectively attenuates cue-specific reactivations and learning, with only minute effects on spontaneous activity and no apparent effect on normal function such as visual cue–elicited responses during training. In control mice, reactivations were biased toward salient cues, persisted for hours after training had ended, and the prevalence of reactivations was aligned with the learning process. Overall, our results underscore a crucial role for cortical reactivations in memory consolidation.",

We identify FOXO3 as a repressor of IFNS, whose abundance decreases upon PHD3 induction in response to oAß. In vivo, loss of PHD3 correlates with abrogation of the IFNS and activation of the disease-associated microglia signature, an increase in microglia proximity to Aß plaques and phagocytosis of both Aß and small plaques. PHD3 deficiency mitigated the Aß plaque–associated neuropathology and rescued behavioral deficits of an AD mouse model. Last, we demonstrate that microglial PHD3 overexpression in the absence of Aß pathology is sufficient to induce the IFNS and behavioral alterations.

While recent advances in machine learning have enabled data-driven digital twin development using discrete-time data and finite-depth models on digital hardware, these approaches face significant limitations. They struggle to capture continuous-time dynamics and model complex systems, and suffer from substantial time and energy overheads due to physically separated storage and processing as well as frequent analog-digital (A/D) conversions. Here, we propose a memristive neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver for digital twins. Our approach is intrinsically time-continuous using infinite-depth neural networks to model complex dynamics. Fully analog memristor arrays collocate storage and computation, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck and reducing A/D conversion requirements. We experimentally validate our solver on digital twins of HP variable-resistor model and Lorenz96 dynamics, demonstrating a 166.5-fold/369.3-fold speedup and a 499.0-fold/673.9-fold improvement in energy efficiency, respectively.

While the m 6 A demethylases FTO and ALKBH5 are recognized for their crucial roles in various cancers, their impact on lymphoid leukemia remains uncertain. Using T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system, we identify FTO as a unique vulnerability in T cell leukemia. Knockout of FTO , but not ALKBH5 , significantly suppresses leukemia initiation and progression. Mechanistic analysis reveals that FTO heightens ELK3 mRNA stability in an m 6 A-dependent manner. Elevated ELK3 in turn transcriptionally activates the expression of glycolytic genes. Pharmacological inhibition of FTO suppresses ELK3 expression, hampers glycolysis and manifests remarkable antileukemia efficacy. Our findings unravel the crucial role of FTO in T-ALL and highlight the FTO-ELK3 axis as a key nodule during leukemogenesis, thereby providing a fundamental basis to harness selective FTO antagonist for T-ALL therapeutics.",

However, prolonged use is associated with severe hematologic toxicity, the underlying mechanisms of which remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding the role of linezolid metabolites. Our clinical study indicates that elevated exposure to PNU142586, a primary metabolite of linezolid, is associated with an increased risk of linezolid-induced toxicity, even in the absence of renal impairment. To elucidate its mechanism, we identify DNA topoisomerase 2-α (TOP2A) and DNA topoisomerase 2-β (TOP2B) as primary targets of PNU142586 at molecular, cellular, and in vivo levels. PNU142586 disrupts replication and transcription by impeding DNA binding to TOP2A and TOP2B with a favorable conformation for cleavage and by inhibiting adenosine 5′-triphosphate hydrolysis, ultimately leading to antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects, including mitochondrial dysfunction. The present study thus provides mechanistic insight into linezolid-induced hematologic toxicity and offers a foundation for safer antibiotic development and improved clinical monitoring through biomarker identification.",

Here, we show that hair follicle SCs (HF-SCs) sense mechanical forces through cell adhesion and maintain quiescence in a PIEZO1-dependent mechanism. PIEZO1 interacts with E-cadherin in HF-SCs, and mechanical pulling of E-cadherin with a force of ~20 pN triggers PIEZO1-dependent, localized calcium flickers. Deletion of Piezo1 leads to reduced cumulative calcium influx and compromises quiescence. Single-cell genomic analyses identify a transcriptional network involving AP1 and NFATC1, which functions downstream of PIEZO1 and regulates the expression of extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton genes to reinforce the unique mechanical property of HF-SCs. These findings establish the force threshold necessary for PIEZO1 activation and reveal PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx as a key mechanism for sensing mechanical cues in the niche and regulating HF-SC activity.",

In humans, learning and memory are severely disrupted by mutations in the potassium channel Slack (KCNT1, Slo2.2). We find that pharmacological stimulation of this channel and a constitutively active Slack mutation stimulate mRNA translation of a reporter for β-actin mRNA in cell lines and increases the synthesis of β-actin in the neurites of cortical neurons. Moreover, channel activation promotes the binding of two key mRNA translation regulators, FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) and CYFIP1 (cytoplasmic FMR1–interacting protein 1), to the channel itself, releasing both from eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), where they normally inhibit initiation of translation.

Here, we theoretically introduce a previously unidentified class of non-Hermitian soliton combs that are enabled by engineering the dissipation and dispersion of a coupled resonator array with nonreciprocal couplings. We show that these non-Hermitian soliton combs allow unprecedented postfabrication agile reconfigurability of the soliton comb spectrum, where the number of comb lines, as well as their frequency spacing, can be markedly tuned by simply tuning the hopping phases between resonators.

Using a mouse gambling task with a reinforcement-learning model, we described individual decision-making profiles as a combination of three archetypal strategies: Optimizers, Risk-averse, and Explorers. These strategies reflected stable differences in the parameters generating decisions (sensitivity to the reward magnitude, to risk, or to punishment) derived from a reinforcement-learning model of animal choice. Chemogenetic manipulation showed that dorsomedial striatum (DMS) neurons substantially affect decision-making, while the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral striatum neurons (DLS) have lesser or no effects, respectively. Specifically, DMS dSPNs decrease risk aversion by increasing the perceived value of risky choices, while DMS iSPNs emphasize large gains, affecting decisions depending on decision-making profiles. Hence, we propose that striatal populations from different subregions influence distinct decision-making parameters, leading to profile-dependent choices.",

We investigated how this coupling is achieved in a bacterial phytochrome variant, Agp2-PAiRFP2. Contrary to classical protein crystallography, which only allows probing (cryo-trapped) stable states, we have used time-resolved serial femtosecond x-ray crystallography (tr-SFX) and pump-probe techniques with various illumination and delay times with respect to photoexcitation of the parent Pfr state. Thus, structural data for seven time frames were sorted into groups of molecular events along the reaction coordinate. They range from chromophore isomerization to the formation of Meta-F, the intermediate that precedes the functional relevant secondary structure transition of the tongue. Structural data for the early events were used to calculate the photoisomerization pathway to complement the experimental data. Late events allow identifying the molecular switch that is linked to the intramolecular proton transfer as a prerequisite for the following structural transitions.",

          "abstract": "Metabolic adaptations are essential for survival. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter plays a key role in coordinating metabolic homeostasis by regulating mitochondrial metabolic pathways and calcium signaling. However, a comprehensive analysis of uniporter-regulated mitochondrial pathways has remained unexplored. Here, we investigate consequences of uniporter loss and gain of function using uniporter knockout cells and fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), which we demonstrate to have elevated mitochondrial calcium levels. We find that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and the urea cycle are uniporter-regulated pathways. Reduced uniporter function boosts expression of BCAA catabolism genes and the urea cycle enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. In contrast, high uniporter activity in FLC suppresses their expression. This suppression is mediated by the transcription factor KLF15, a master regulator of liver metabolism. Thus, the uniporter plays a central role in FLC-associated metabolic changes, including hyperammonemia. Our study identifies an important role for the uniporter in metabolic adaptation through transcriptional regulation of metabolism and elucidates its importance for BCAA and ammonia metabolism.",

Here, we report a tough underwater robot that exhibits an accurate, three-dimensional, and multimodal motion. Counterintuitively, the soft robot is composed of polymers that are not photo-mechanically responsive but are powered by the ambient fluid. The unique feature notably widens the pool of material selection and allows further treatment to strengthen the polymer matrix without concerns of trade-off between the mechanical properties with the actuation capability.

In the quantum tunneling regime (realized by decreasing the gap size), by injection of carriers into a nanocavity-integrated tungsten disulfide (WS 2 ) monolayer, spectrally tunable EL (controlled by the bias polarity) is achieved with a room-temperature quantum efficiency reaching ~3.5%, showing an improvement of more than 10 3 times over previous works.",

Changing the cavity length in combination with vibron-mediated relaxation in the polymer allows us to achieve selective polariton condensation into different states of the band structure, unveiled by nonlinear emission, linewidth narrowing, energy blue shift, and extended macroscopic coherence.

          "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons influence diverse behaviors with varied firing patterns, yet the precise mechanisms remain unclear. We introduce a multiplexed genetically encoded sensor–based imaging and voltammetry method to simultaneously record synaptic, perisynaptic, and extrasynaptic dopaminergic transmission at mouse central neurons. Using this method alongside a genetically encoded sensor–based image analysis program, we found that heterogeneous dopaminergic firing patterns create various transmission modes, encoding frequency, number, and synchrony of firing pulses using neurotransmitter quantity, releasing synapse count, and synaptic and/or volume transmission. Under both tonic and low-frequency phasic activities, transporters effectively reuptake dopamine at perisynaptic sites, confining dopamine within synaptic clefts to mediate synaptic transmission. In contrast, under high-frequency, particularly synchronized firing activity or transporter inhibition, released dopamine may overwhelm transporters, escaping from synaptic clefts via one to three outlet channels, triggering volume transmission. Our study illuminates a collaborative mechanism of synaptic enclosures, properties, and transporters that defines the coding principles of activity pattern–dependent dopaminergic transmission modes.",

Our model demonstrates robust recycling of synaptic vesicles that maintains consistent synaptic release, even during sustained high-frequency firing. We also show how the cytosolic proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 cooperate to regulate recruitment of reserve pool vesicles during sustained firing to maintain transmission, as well as the potential of selective vesicle active zone tethering to ensure rapid vesicle replenishment while minimizing reserve pool recruitment. We also monitored vesicle usage in isolated hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive pHluorin, demonstrating that reserve vesicle recruitment depends on firing frequency, even at nonphysiologically high firing frequencies, as predicted by the model.",

The high glass-formation ability (GFA) in (TPG) 2 MnBr 4 provides a platform to modulate the crystallization of another molten A 2 MnBr 4 by homogeneous melting.

To further understand the low current density observed in human Na V 1.9, we created chimeras with Na V 1.5 and identified a role for the C-tail—specifically the IQ motif and EF-hand—in regulating current densities, likely due to a weak affinity for calmodulin. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated that, unlike other Na V channel subtypes, calmodulin binding to the C-tail is likely too weak to occur under physiological conditions. Markedly, the pre-IQ region did not influence channel expression but was responsible for conferring the characteristic depolarized voltage dependency of inactivation of Na V 1.9.

GATA2 low murine progenitors are hypersensitive to inflammatory mediators. We discovered that the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 conferred transcriptional activation in GATA2 low progenitors in response to Interferon-γ and Toll-Like Receptor 1/2 agonists. In a locus-specific manner, inflammation reconfigured genome activity by promoting PU.1 recruitment to chromatin or tuning activity of PU.1-preoccupied chromatin. The recruitment mechanism disproportionately required IKKβ activity. Inflammation-activated genes were enriched in motifs for RUNX factors that cooperate with GATA factors. Contrasting with the GATA2-RUNX1 cooperativity paradigm, GATA2 suppressed and RUNX1 promoted PU.1 mechanisms to endow the progenitor genome with inflammation-sensing capacity.",
