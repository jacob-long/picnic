          "abstract": "Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’ 1–6 . This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) 7–9 . However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals. Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains 10–12 . The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities. Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.",

          "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) have a central pathogenetic role in the development of liver fibrosis. However, their fibrosis-independent and homeostatic functions remain poorly understood 1–5 . Here we demonstrate that genetic depletion of HSCs changes WNT activity and zonation of hepatocytes, leading to marked alterations in liver regeneration, cytochrome P450 metabolism and injury. We identify R-spondin 3 (RSPO3), an HSC-enriched modulator of WNT signalling, as responsible for these hepatocyte-regulatory effects of HSCs. HSC-selective deletion of Rspo3 phenocopies the effects of HSC depletion on hepatocyte gene expression, zonation, liver size, regeneration and cytochrome P450-mediated detoxification, and exacerbates alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. RSPO3 expression decreases with HSC activation and is inversely associated with outcomes in patients with alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. These protective and hepatocyte-regulating functions of HSCs via RSPO3 resemble the R-spondin-expressing stromal niche in other organs and should be integrated into current therapeutic concepts.",

          "abstract": "Although learning in response to extrinsic reinforcement is theorized to be driven by dopamine signals that encode the difference between expected and experienced rewards1,2, skills that enable verbal or musical expression can be learned without extrinsic reinforcement. Instead, spontaneous execution of these skills is thought to be intrinsically reinforcing3,4. Whether dopamine signals similarly guide learning of these intrinsically reinforced behaviours is unknown. In juvenile zebra finches learning from an adult tutor, dopamine signalling in a song-specialized basal ganglia region is required for successful song copying, a spontaneous, intrinsically reinforced process5. Here we show that dopamine dynamics in the song basal ganglia faithfully track the learned quality of juvenile song performance on a rendition-by-rendition basis. Furthermore, dopamine release in the basal ganglia is driven not only by inputs from midbrain dopamine neurons classically associated with reinforcement learning but also by song premotor inputs, which act by means of local cholinergic signalling to elevate dopamine during singing. Although both cholinergic and dopaminergic signalling are necessary for juvenile song learning, only dopamine tracks the learned quality of song performance. Therefore, dopamine dynamics in the basal ganglia encode performance quality during self-directed, long-term learning of natural behaviours.",

          "abstract": "State-of-the-art climate models project a substantial decline in precipitation for the Mediterranean region in the future1. Supporting this notion, several studies based on observed precipitation data spanning recent decades have suggested a decrease in Mediterranean precipitation2,3,4, with some attributing a large fraction of this change to anthropogenic influences3,5. Conversely, certain researchers have underlined that Mediterranean precipitation exhibits considerable spatiotemporal variability driven by atmospheric circulation patterns6,7 maintaining stationarity over the long term8,9. These conflicting perspectives underscore the need for a comprehensive assessment of precipitation changes in this region, given the profound social, economic and environmental implications. Here we show that Mediterranean precipitation has largely remained stationary from 1871 to 2020, albeit with significant multi-decadal and interannual variability. This conclusion is based on the most comprehensive dataset available for the region, encompassing over 23,000 stations across 27 countries. While trends can be identified for some periods and subregions, our findings attribute these trends primarily to atmospheric dynamics, which would be mostly linked to internal variability. Furthermore, our assessment reconciles the observed precipitation trends with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model simulations, neither of which indicate a prevailing past precipitation trend in the region. The implications of our results extend to environmental, agricultural and water resources planning in one of the world’s prominent climate change hotspots10.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase heavy rainfall with concomitant increases in flooding1. Causes of increased heavy rainfall include the higher water-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns2, which may translate into future heavy rainfall increases in most of Europe3. However, gathering evidence on the time evolution of past changes has been hampered by data limitations and measurement uncertainties, in particular for short rainfall durations, such as 1 h. Here we show an 8% increase in daily and 15% increase in hourly heavy rainfall over the last four decades by analysing a new dataset comprising 883 stations in Austria from 1900 to 2023. These increases are fully consistent between two independent networks and occurred after a retarding phase between 1960 and 1980. Hourly heavy rainfall changes are aligned with temperature increases with the sensitivity of a 7% increase per 1 °C of warming, in line with Clausius–Clapeyron scaling. Daily heavy rainfall changes, however, are aligned with atmospheric circulation indices with little correlation to air temperature, which suggests a bigger role of atmospheric circulation modes than previously thought. The daily heavy rainfall changes are remarkably consistent with observed flood increases of about 8% in large catchments. The hourly heavy rainfall changes are similarly consistent with flood changes in small catchments, although the flood increase is stronger (25% over the last four decades). Climate adaptation measures in flood management may therefore be more pressing for rivers draining smaller catchment areas than for large rivers.",

          "abstract": "Antigenic variation is an immune evasion strategy used by many different pathogens. It involves the periodic, non-random switch in the expression of different antigens throughout an infection. How the observed hierarchy in antigen expression is achieved has remained a mystery 1,2 . A key challenge in uncovering this process has been the inability to track transcriptome changes and potential genomic rearrangements in individual cells during a switch event. Here we report the establishment of a highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing approach for the model protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei . This approach has revealed genomic rearrangements that occur in individual cells during a switch event. Our data show that following a double-strand break in the transcribed antigen-coding gene—an important trigger for antigen switching—the type of repair mechanism and the resultant antigen expression depend on the availability of a homologous repair template in the genome. When such a template was available, repair proceeded through segmental gene conversion, creating new, mosaic antigen-coding genes. Conversely, in the absence of a suitable template, a telomere-adjacent antigen-coding gene from a different part of the genome was activated by break-induced replication. Our results show the critical role of repair sequence availability in the antigen selection mechanism. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the power of highly sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing methods in detecting genomic rearrangements that drive transcriptional changes at the single-cell level.",

          "abstract": "Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication, primarily relies on erbium-doped fibre amplifiers (EDFAs) 1,2 . Yet, EDFAs only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibres. This has motivated the development of amplifiers operating beyond the erbium gain window. Pioneering work on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) 3,4 using intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity. OPAs offer high gain, can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers and exhibit unidirectional operation. However, power requirements for highly nonlinear fibres 3,5–8 or bulk waveguides 9,10 have impeded their adoption. By contrast, OPAs based on integrated photonic circuits offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth 11,12 . We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide 13–15 photonic integrated circuits (PICs) and attain up to 35 dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimetres long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimetres. Fibre-to-fibre net gain exceeding 10 dB across an ultra-broad bandwidth of approximately 140 nm (that is, 17 THz) is achieved, with a threefold increase in the gain window compared with C-band EDFAs. We further demonstrate a high dynamic range for input signals, spanning six orders of magnitude, while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify coherent communication signals. This marks, to our knowledge, the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a photonic chip, opening up new capabilities for next-generation integrated photonics.",

Oncogene dosage variation contributes to cell-state transitions and phenotypic heterogeneity3, thereby providing a substrate for somatic evolution. Nonetheless, the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity are still poorly understood. Here we show that extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a major source of high-level focal amplification in key oncogenes and a major contributor of MYC heterogeneity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that ecDNAs drive varying levels of MYC dosage, depending on their regulatory landscape, enabling cancer cells to rapidly and reversibly adapt to microenvironmental changes. In the absence of selective pressure, a high ecDNA copy number imposes a substantial fitness cost on PDAC cells. We also show that MYC dosage affects cell morphology and dependence of cancer cells on stromal niche factors. Our work provides a detailed analysis of ecDNAs in PDAC and describes a new genetic mechanism driving MYC heterogeneity in PDAC.",

          "abstract": "In a subset of children and adolescents, SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a severe acute hyperinflammatory shock 1 termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at four to eight weeks after infection. MIS-C is characterized by a specific T cell expansion 2 and systemic hyperinflammation 3 . The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains largely unknown. Here we show that acute MIS-C is characterized by impaired reactivation of virus-reactive memory T cells, which depends on increased serum levels of the cytokine TGFβ resembling those that occur during severe COVID-19 (refs. 4,5 ). This functional impairment in T cell reactivity is accompanied by the presence of TGFβ-response signatures in T cells, B cells and monocytes along with reduced antigen-presentation capabilities of monocytes, and can be reversed by blocking TGFβ. Furthermore, T cell receptor repertoires of patients with MIS-C exhibit expansion of T cells expressing TCRVβ21.3, resembling Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-reactive T cell clones capable of eliminating EBV-infected B cells. Additionally, serum TGFβ in patients with MIS-C can trigger EBV reactivation, which is reversible with TGFβ blockade. Clinically, the TGFβ-induced defect in T cell reactivity correlates with a higher EBV seroprevalence in patients with MIS-C compared with age-matched controls, along with the occurrence of EBV reactivation. Our findings establish a connection between SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 sequelae in children, in which impaired T cell cytotoxicity triggered by TGFβ overproduction leads to EBV reactivation and subsequent hyperinflammation.",

          "abstract": "Many natural motor skills, such as speaking or locomotion, are acquired through a process of trial-and-error learning over the course of development. It has long been hypothesized, motivated by observations in artificial learning experiments, that dopamine has a crucial role in this process. Dopamine in the basal ganglia is thought to guide reward-based trial-and-error learning by encoding reward prediction errors1, decreasing after worse-than-predicted reward outcomes and increasing after better-than-predicted ones. Our previous work in adult zebra finches—in which we changed the perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback—showed that dopamine in Area X, the singing-related basal ganglia, encodes performance prediction error: dopamine is suppressed after worse-than-predicted (distorted syllables) and activated after better-than-predicted (undistorted syllables) performance2. However, it remains unknown whether the learning of natural behaviours, such as developmental vocal learning, occurs through dopamine-based reinforcement. Here we tracked song learning trajectories in juvenile zebra finches and used fibre photometry3 to monitor concurrent dopamine activity in Area X. We found that dopamine was activated after syllable renditions that were closer to the eventual adult version of the song, compared with recent renditions, and suppressed after renditions that were further away. Furthermore, the relationship between dopamine and song fluctuations revealed that dopamine predicted the future evolution of song, suggesting that dopamine drives behaviour. Finally, dopamine activity was explained by the contrast between the quality of the current rendition and the recent history of renditions—consistent with dopamine’s hypothesized role in encoding prediction errors in an actor–critic reinforcement-learning model4,5. Reinforcement-learning algorithms6 have emerged as a powerful class of model to explain learning in reward-based laboratory tasks, as well as for driving autonomous learning in artificial intelligence7. Our results suggest that complex natural behaviours in biological systems can also be acquired through dopamine-mediated reinforcement learning.",

However, there is ongoing debate about whether such negative effects can be alleviated at the landscape scale (γ diversity) if among-patch diversity (β diversity) increases as a result of fragmentation2,3,4,5,6. This controversial view has not been rigorously tested. Here we use a dataset of 4,006 taxa across 37 studies from 6 continents to test the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity across scales by explicitly comparing continuous and fragmented landscapes. We find that fragmented landscapes consistently have both lower α diversity and lower γ diversity. Although fragmented landscapes did tend to have higher β diversity, this did not translate into higher γ diversity. Our findings refute claims that habitat fragmentation can increase biodiversity at landscape scales, and emphasize the need to restore habitat and increase connectivity to minimize biodiversity loss at ever-increasing scales.",

When and how these interfaces slide is a fundamental problem in geosciences and engineering1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. It is believed that there exists a threshold shear force, called static friction, below which the interface is stationary4,10, despite many studies suggesting that this concept is outdated1,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28. By contrast, rate-and-state friction formulations1,26,27 predict that interfaces are always sliding29, but this feature is often considered an artefact that calls for modifications30. Here we show that nominally stationary interfaces subjected to constant shear and normal loads, with a driving force that is notably below the classically defined static friction for which creep is known to occur9,27,28,29, are sliding, but with diminishingly small rates down to 10−12 m s−1. Our precise measurements directly at the interface are enabled by digital image correlation18,31,32. This behaviour contradicts classical models of friction but confirms the prediction of rate-and-state friction1,26,27. The diminishing slip rates of nominally stationary interfaces reflect interface healing, which would manifest itself in higher peak friction in subsequent slip events15,27,33, such as earthquakes and landslides, substantially modifying their nucleation and propagation and hence their hazard3,12,13,34.",

Metabolically impaired obligate intracellular parasites, such as the human pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii, can acquire ATP from their host cells through a unique ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) translocator, which mediates the import of ATP into and the export of ADP and phosphate out of the parasite cells, thus allowing the exploitation of the energy reserves of host cells (also known as energy parasitism). This type of ATP/ADP translocator also exists in the obligate intracellular endosymbionts of protists and the plastids of plants and algae and has been implicated to play an important role in endosymbiosis3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. The plastid/parasite type of ATP/ADP translocator is phylogenetically and functionally distinct from the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator, and its structure and transport mechanism are still unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of two plastid/parasite types of ATP/ADP translocators in the apo and substrate-bound states. The ATP/ADP-binding pocket is located at the interface between the N and C domains of the translocator, and a conserved asparagine residue within the pocket is critical for substrate specificity. The translocator operates through a rocker-switch alternating access mechanism involving the relative rotation of the two domains as rigid bodies. Our results provide critical insights for understanding ATP translocation across membranes in energy parasitism and endosymbiosis and offer a structural basis for developing drugs against obligate intracellular parasites.",

Yet coaxing these energy sources into useful mechanical work has proved challenging. Here we engineer active solids based on centimetre-scale building blocks that perform adaptive locomotion. These prototypes exhibit a non-variational form of elasticity characterized by odd moduli8,12,17, whose magnitude we predict from microscopics using coarse-grained theories and which we validate experimentally. When interacting with an external environment, these active solids spontaneously undergo limit cycles of shape changes, which naturally lead to locomotion such as rolling and crawling. The robustness of the locomotion is rooted in an emergent feedback loop between the active solid and the environment, which is mediated by elastic deformations and stresses. As a result, our active solids are able to accelerate, adjust their gaits and locomote through a variety of terrains with a similar performance to more complex control strategies implemented by neural networks. Our work establishes active solids as a bridge between materials and robots and suggests decentralized strategies to control the nonlinear dynamics of biological systems8,18,19,20,21,22, soft materials5,6,9,11,12,23,24,25 and driven nanomechanical devices7,26,27,28,29,30.",

They combine the exotic electronic structures of low-dimensional materials with an enhanced number of exposed edges, where phenomena including ultralong spin coherence times 1,2 , quantum confinement 3 and topologically protected states 4,5 can emerge. An exciting prospect for this material concept is the potential for both a tunable semiconducting electronic structure and magnetism along the nanoribbon edge, a key property for spin-based electronics such as (low-energy) non-volatile transistors 6 . Here we report the magnetic and semiconducting properties of phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs). We demonstrate that at room temperature, films of PNRs show macroscopic magnetic properties arising from their edge, with internal fields of roughly 240 to 850 mT. In solution, a giant magnetic anisotropy enables the alignment of PNRs at sub-1-T fields. By leveraging this alignment effect, we discover that on photoexcitation, energy is rapidly funnelled to a state that is localized to the magnetic edge and coupled to a symmetry-forbidden edge phonon mode. Our results establish PNRs as a fascinating system for studying the interplay between magnetism and semiconducting ground states at room temperature and provide a stepping-stone towards using low-dimensional nanomaterials in quantum electronics.",

          "abstract": "The eukaryote Tree of Life (eToL) depicts the relationships among all eukaryotic organisms; its root represents the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) from which all extant complex lifeforms are descended1. Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling and limited phylogenetic signal1. Here we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution on the basis of a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins that includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our analyses of a 100 taxon × 93 protein dataset with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models and an extensive evaluation of alternative hypotheses show that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ‘Opimoda+’ and ‘Diphoda+’. This position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ‘typical excavates’ are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ‘excavate’ cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study sheds light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and provides a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.",

The available palaeoanthropological information from Western Europe is limited and confined to the Iberian Peninsula1,2. Here we present most of the midface of a hominin found at the TE7 level of the Sima del Elefante site (Sierra de Atapuerca, Spain), dated to between 1.4 million and 1.1 million years ago. This fossil (ATE7-1) represents the earliest human face of Western Europe identified thus far. Most of the morphological features of the midface of this hominin are primitive for the Homo clade and they do not display the modern-like aspect exhibited by Homo antecessor found at the neighbouring Gran Dolina site, also in the Sierra de Atapuerca, and dated to between 900,000 and 800,000 years ago3. Furthermore, ATE7-1 is more derived in the nasoalveolar region than the Dmanisi and other roughly contemporaneous hominins. On the basis of the available evidence, it is reasonable to assign the new human remains from TE7 level to Homo aff. erectus. From the archaeological, palaeontological and palaeoanthropological information obtained in the lower levels of the Sima del Elefante and Gran Dolina sites4,5,6,7,8, we suggest a turnover in the human population in Europe at the end of the Early Pleistocene.",

Recent advancements have revealed the intricate immune mechanisms that plants deploy against viral pathogens3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the molecular mechanisms through which plant hosts recognize viral infections and initiate antiviral defence at disease onset have not been elucidated. Here, through the natural infection of rice by inoculation with insect vectors carrying the natural forms of viruses, we show that viral coat proteins are perceived by the RING1–IBR–RING2-type ubiquitin ligase (RBRL), initiating the first step of the natural antiviral response in rice. RBRL subsequently targets an adaptor protein of the transcriptional repression complex of the jasmonate pathway, NOVEL INTERACTOR OF JAZ 3 (NINJA3), for degradation through the ubiquitination system, inducing jasmonate signalling and activating downstream antiviral defence. We further show that this phenomenon is a universal molecular mechanism used by rice plants to perceive viral infections and initiate antiviral signalling cascades. This approach is important not only for obtaining a deeper understanding of virus–host interactions but also for further disease resistance breeding.",

The earliest individuals cluster with pre-Neolithic people of the western Maghreb (around 15,000–7,600 years before present (bp)), showing that this ‘Maghrebi’ ancestry profile had a substantial geographic and temporal extent. At least one individual from Djebba (Tunisia), dating to around 8,000 years bp, harboured ancestry from European hunter–gatherers, probably reflecting movement in the Early Holocene across the Strait of Sicily. Later Neolithic people from the eastern Maghreb retained largely local forager ancestry, together with smaller contributions from European farmers (by around 7,000 years bp) and Levantine groups (by around 6,800 years bp), and were thus far less impacted by external gene flow than were populations in other parts of the Neolithic Mediterranean.",

These qualities make them ideal for lightweight, miniaturized and multi-functional structures3,4,5,6,7,8. However, achieving high enthalpy is challenging, as it requires combining conflicting properties: high stiffness, high strength and large recoverable strain9,10,11. Here, to address this challenge, we construct high-enthalpy elastic metamaterials from freely rotatable chiral metacells. Compared with existing non-chiral lattices, the non-optimized chiral metamaterials simultaneously maintain high stiffness, sustain larger recoverable strain, offer a wider buckling plateau, improve the buckling strength by 5–10 times, enhance enthalpy by 2–160 times and increase energy per mass by 2–32 times. These improvements arise from torsional buckling deformation that is triggered by chirality and is absent in conventional metamaterials. This deformation mode stores considerable additional energy while having a minimal impact on peak stresses that define material failure. Our findings identify a mechanism and provide insight into the design of metamaterials and structures with high mechanical energy storage capacity, a fundamental and general problem of broad engineering interest.",

Here we observed a spatial and HCC recurrence-associated distribution of natural killer (NK) cells in the invasive front and tumour centre from 61 patients. Using extreme gradient boosting and inverse-variance weighting, we developed the tumour immune microenvironment spatial (TIMES) score based on the spatial expression patterns of five biomarkers (SPON2, ZFP36L2, ZFP36, VIM and HLA-DRB1) to predict HCC recurrence risk. The TIMES score (hazard ratio = 88.2, P < 0.001) outperformed current standard tools for patient risk stratification including the TNM and BCLC systems. We validated the model in 231 patients from five multicentred cohorts, achieving a real-world accuracy of 82.2% and specificity of 85.7%. The predictive power of these biomarkers emerged through the integration of their spatial distributions, rather than individual marker expression levels alone. In vivo models, including NK cell-specific Spon2-knockout mice, revealed that SPON2 enhances IFNγ secretion and NK cell infiltration at the invasive front. Our study introduces TIMES, a publicly accessible tool for predicting HCC recurrence risk, offering insights into its potential to inform treatment decisions for early-stage HCC.",

However, their understanding has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic geometries and spin Hamiltonians primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups11,12, thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group13,14,15,16,17 theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1,421 collinear spin space groups into 4 types, constructing their band representations and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines and charge-4 octuple points. On the basis of the MAGNDATA database18, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which more than 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. In addition, we evaluated the influence of the spin–orbit-coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80 per cent are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that the spin space group serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets.",

          "authors": "Jens Terhaar, Friedrich A. Burger, Linus Vogt, Thomas L. Frölicher, Thomas F. Stocker",
          "abstract": "Global ocean surface temperatures were at record levels for more than a year from April 2023 onwards, exceeding the previous record in 2015–2016 by 0.25 °C on average between April 2023 and March 2024 1 . The nearly global extent and unprecedented intensity of this event prompted questions about how exceptional it was and whether climate models can represent such record-shattering jumps in surface ocean temperatures 2 . Here we construct observation-based synthetic time series to show that a jump in global sea surface temperatures that breaks the previous record by at least 0.25 °C is a 1-in-512-year event under the current long-term warming trend (1-in-205-year to 1-in-1,185-year event; 95% confidence interval). Without a global warming trend, such an event would have been practically impossible. Using 270 simulations from a wide range of fully coupled climate models, we show that these models successfully simulate such record-shattering jumps in global ocean surface temperatures, underpinning the models’ usefulness in understanding the characteristics, drivers and consequences of such events. These model simulations suggest that the record-shattering jump in surface ocean temperatures in 2023–2024 was an extreme event after which surface ocean temperatures are expected to revert to the expected long-term warming trend.",

          "abstract": "bioRxiv, a preprint repository for biology, launched in 2013.Credit: Tom Houghton for Nature\n\nA new chapter has begun for two of the world’s most popular preprint platforms, bioRxiv and medRxiv, with the launch of a non-profit organization that will manage them, their co-founders announced on 11 March.\n\nWhat bioRxiv’s first 30,000 preprints reveal about biologists\n\nThe servers allow researchers to share manuscripts for free before peer review and have become an integral part of publishing biology and medical research. Until now, they had been managed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in New York. The new organization, named openRxiv, will have a board of directors and a scientific and medical advisory board. It is supported by a fresh US$16-million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the projects’ main financial backer.\n\n“It’s just exciting to see this key piece of infrastructure really get the attention that it deserves as a dedicated initiative,” says Katie Corker, executive director of ASAPbio, a scientist-driven non-profit organization, which is based in San Francisco, California. Preprints are “the backbone of the scientific publishing ecosystem, maybe especially at the current moment, when there’s a lot of worries about who has control of information.”\n\nThe launch of openRxiv “reflects a maturation of the projects”, which started as an experiment at CSHL, says Richard Sever, a co-founder of both servers and chief science and strategy officer at openRxiv. It has “become so important that they should have their own organization running them, which is focused on the long-term sustainability of the servers, as opposed to being a side project within a big research institution”, says Sever.\n\nThousands of submissions\n\nSince its launch in 2013, bioRxiv, which covers biological science, including neuroscience, bioinformatics and genomics — has posted about 268,000 preprints by more than 970,000 authors. Its younger sibling medRxiv — founded in 2019 to cover medical sciences — has nearly 64,000 preprints from more than 380,000 authors. Together, the repositories draw more than 11 million monthly readers and post about 4,000 and 1,000 new submissions per month, respectively.\n\nAI writes summaries of preprints in bioRxiv trial\n\nBioRxiv and medRxiv are financially supported by grants and donations from the CZI in Redwood City, California — which has contributed about $31.7 million since 2017 — and by some US and European academic and philanthropic institutions.",

          "title": "Alcohol and cancer risk: what you need to know",
          "authors": "Helen Pearson",
          "abstract": "Early this year, the US surgeon general issued a bombshell report. Before his term ended in January, Vivek Murthy warned that alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer and called for alcoholic drinks to carry cancer warning labels as cigarette packs do. The report1 triggered a flurry of headlines about a risk that many people ignore.\n\nThe link between alcohol and cancer is not new. Scientists first labelled alcohol as a carcinogen more than 35 years ago, and the evidence has only grown since. “I don’t think the relationship between alcohol and certain cancers is terribly controversial,” says Tim Naimi, an alcohol epidemiologist at the University of Victoria, Canada.\n\nWhat has been less clear is the level of drinking at which cancer risk starts to rise, and how to weigh that elevated risk against alcohol’s other impacts — in particular, the fiercely debated claim that low or moderate drinking improves heart health for some people. “Drinking a lot is absolutely bad,” says Emmanuela Gakidou, who analyses alcohol risks at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle, Washington. “It’s the low-to-moderate amount of alcohol where the debate is.”\n\nAll this information can leave people feeling confused. What exactly is low or moderate drinking? And how should people weigh up any enjoyment they might get from drinking with the risks? “A lot of people enjoy drinking, and they don’t like to be told that something they really enjoy is bad for you,” Gakidou says.\n\nThe cancer connection\n\nFor decades, scientists have been building a case that alcohol causes cancer. Because testing alcohol’s effects in randomized trials is difficult, they have instead drawn on other types of research. Several huge cohort studies that track many tens of thousands of people have found that alcohol is linked to higher rates of some types of cancer. One massive 2015 meta-analysis2 — which pooled the results of hundreds of cohort studies and other research, including more than 485,000 cancer cases — found that risks of developing several cancers rose with the level of consumption.\n\nWhy are so many young people getting cancer? What the data say\n\nBut cohort studies have weaknesses. Researchers have to control for other confounding factors that could contribute to cancer risk, such as the fact that heavy drinkers are more likely to smoke than those who drink less, and people who drink small amounts of alcohol tend to have other healthy habits. And scientists know that study participants often say they drink less than they really do. Some studies attempt to adjust for this by inflating the levels of drinking to match those expected from alcohol sales, says Peter Sarich, an epidemiologist at the Daffodil Centre, a cancer research centre in Sydney, Australia.\n\nOther evidence comes from animal experiments and from laboratory studies that have identified mechanisms by which alcohol can cause cancer. The most well-established is that ethanol is broken down into acetaldehyde, a toxin that damages DNA.\n\nScientists like to look at the sum of evidence, and there are two syntheses of research that are considered particularly definitive for alcohol and cancer. One is from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the World Health Organization’s cancer branch. The agency classed drinking alcohol as carcinogenic to humans in 1988 — putting it in the same category as tobacco smoke and asbestos — and restated that view3 in 2007.\n\nThe other synthesis is from the Global Cancer Update Programme, a continuing effort to assess the totality of evidence on links between cancer, physical activity, body weight and diet (including alcohol) using systematic reviews and a panel of specialists to assess the strength of the evidence. The programme’s most recent report4, in 2018, concluded that there is strong evidence that alcoholic drinks increase the risk of several cancers.\n\n“Because we have such a rigorous process, people have got confidence in the outcomes,” says Helen Croker, assistant director of research and policy at the World Cancer Research Fund International (WCRF) in London, which runs the project with several other cancer-research charities.\n\nOn the basis of such syntheses, researchers agree that alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer: mouth, throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx), oesophagus, breast cancer in women, colorectal and liver. Scientists suspect that other cancer types will be added as more data are collected.\n\nStudies present this risk in different ways. One complication is that, in alcohol studies and guidelines, the amount of alcohol in a ‘standard’ drink differs between countries: a standard drink in the United States contains 14 grams of ethanol, in Canada it holds 13.45 g, in Australia 10 g and the in United Kingdom 8 g.\n\nIn the surgeon general’s report, the results from a large cohort study5 led by Sarich were used to calculate the absolute risks of developing any of the seven cancer types above (see ‘Cancer risk goes up’). This showed that around 17 out of 100 women who drink either nothing or less than one standard US drink per week (14 g ethanol) would develop such a cancer in their lifetime. This was taken as the baseline level of risk. This number rose to nearly 22 out of 100 in women who have two drinks per day (28 g ethanol) on average. Therefore, five more women would develop cancer owing to the higher level of alcohol consumption.\n\nSource: Ref. 1\n\nFor men, the lifetime risk of developing one of these seven cancer types rose from a baseline of about 10 in 100 for those who don’t drink or have less than one standard drink per week, to about 13 out of 100 for those who, on average, have two drinks daily. The sex difference is because breast cancers account for a large number of cancers that are attributable to alcohol in women but not in men.\n\nRising risks\n\nBut what about people who drink very little? In the past few years, scientists have been zeroing in on the level of drinking at which cancer risk starts to rise. “We suspect that this question may have different answers for different cancer types,” says Jürgen Rehm, who studies the harms of alcohol and drugs at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, Canada.\n\nRehm says the answer is clearest for breast cancer in women thanks in part to several large cohort studies that included many people who didn’t drink much. A systematic review6 of such studies, which was published last year, found that cancer risks were raised slightly in those who had half a drink (5 g of ethanol) per day — the lowest level examined. “And frankly, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to go down further, because I mean, who drinks one-quarter of a drink?” says Rehm.\n\nAlmost half of cancer deaths are preventable\n\nIn the 2018 Global Cancer Update Programme report4, the panel concluded that any amount of alcohol increased the risk of mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophageal and breast cancer. For these conditions, “we find no lower threshold”, Croker says. The WCRF’s position, which is similar to that of the World Health Organization, is that there is no ‘safe’ level that does not increase overall cancer risk.\n\nFor some other cancer types, the panel found that elevated risks were most apparent at slightly greater levels of alcohol consumption. The risks of colorectal cancer increased above 30 g of ethanol per day (more than two US standard drinks), and liver cancer risks increased above 45 g per day (more than three US standard drinks). Lower levels of alcohol might still increase the risk of developing these cancers, but there wasn’t enough evidence to say.\n\nThe risks from low or moderate drinking can be hard to discern, partly because it is difficult for studies to define a reliable comparison group of people who don’t drink. Scientists know that some people stop drinking alcohol because their health is already declining: what researchers call sick-quitters. And some claim to be lifetime abstainers when records show they did drink in the past, says Naimi. Therefore, the ‘non-drinking’ group in a study might include unhealthy former drinkers.\n\n“The whole evidence base around moderate drinking is scientifically frail — and that would be a charitable characterization,” Naimi says.\n\nAlcohol versus smoking\n\nA few years ago, Nick Sheron, a liver physician working at the University of Southampton, UK, did a quick calculation on the comparative risks of drinking and smoking. He said he was so surprised by the result that “I spent a long time trying to prove that I was wrong”. But he couldn’t — and epidemiologists he worked with agreed the numbers were right.\n\nThe study7 they published, in 2019, estimated that for non-smokers, drinking one bottle of wine per week was associated with an increased absolute lifetime cancer risk of 1% for men and 1.4% for women. (So, if 1,000 men and 1,000 women consumed a bottle of wine each week, an estimated 10 men and 14 women would develop cancer as a consequence.) This, they found, was equivalent to men smoking five cigarettes per week and women smoking ten. (Drinking three bottles per week was equivalent to men smoking eight cigarettes and women smoking 23 — more than a pack.)\n\nThis wine bottle from 2018 includes alcohol recommendations from the UK chief medical officers. Some countries have considered adding alcohol warning labels that highlight cancer risk.Credit: Carolyn Jenkins/Alamy",

          "abstract": "Students walk across Columbia University’s campus in New York City.Credit: Luiz C. Ribeiro/New York Daily News/TNS/Alamy\n\nOn Tuesday morning this week, PhD student Daniella Fodera woke up at 7 a.m. to a call from the head of her research laboratory in Columbia University’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, delivering devastating news. Her F31 fellowship, a research training grant that provides the majority of her annual income, had been terminated.\n\n“It was traumatic,” Fodera says. “I immediately just broke into tears.”\n\nPostdocs and PhD students hit hard by Trump’s crackdown on science\n\nFodera, who studies fibroids in the uterus — non-cancerous growths that affect 70%–80% of women by the age of 50, and can cause severe pain and infertility — is just one of numerous scientists affected by the decision of US President Donald Trump’s administration to cancel US$400 million in federal grants and contracts to Columbia, located in New York City. Announced on 7 March, the move, Trump’s team said, stemmed from the university’s “continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students” and that more cancellations “are expected to follow”.\n\nMost of those affected are researchers and students whose grants and fellowships come from the US National Institutes of Health, the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. The agency announced on Monday that it was terminating more than $250 million in funding — including more than 400 research grants — to Columbia.\n\nSeveral university lab leaders, PhD students and postdocs have expressed concern to Nature about their future in science and their ability to support themselves and their families. Although a complete list of cancelled grants hasn’t been released, Nature’s reporting suggests that early-career scientists receiving NIH training grants such as F30, F31, R25 and T32 fellowships are heavily affected. Sources inside the NIH tell Nature that the lists of cancelled grants come from the agency’s Office of Extramural Research, which is in turn receiving them from the NIH’s parent agency, the US Department of Health and Human Services, in coordination with the US Department of Government Efficiency. Action on the lists is required immediately, often within the hour.\n\nA spokesperson at Columbia told Nature that the university is in the process of reviewing termination notices and “cannot confirm how many grant cancellations have been received from federal agencies since March 7”. Still, she wrote, Columbia “pledges to work with the federal government to restore Columbia’s federal funding”.\n\nLosses for the public\n\nJamie Daw, a lab leader at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health, was also taken by surprise when the grant-termination news arrived. Daw, who studies how policies affect the ability of women of reproductive age and pregnant people to access health services, got the e-mail on Monday night.\n\nUS universities curtail PhD admissions amid Trump science funding cuts\n\nThe university stated that her grant — which supported around 20 people — had been cancelled with immediate effect, and that she needed to stop her work and notify collaborators both inside and outside of Columbia.\n\n“It hurts,” Daw says. “We’re really trying to do work in the public interest — we’re working to improve the US maternal mortality crisis.” (Maternal mortality rates in the United States are high compared with other high-income nations, particularly among Black women. )\n\nSome postdoctoral fellows at Columbia are protected from losing their positions despite a lack of funding because they are part of a union that has an agreement with the university. It is therefore the responsibility of university staff members such as lab leaders to try to find funding for those postdocs that have their grants terminated, says Sherida de Leeuw, a chair of the union.\n\n“If I did not have that protection, my last pay cheque would have been two weeks ago and I would be out on the streets now,” says Columbia postdoc Gordon Petty, who was notified on Tuesday morning that his T32 training grant to study schizophrenia was cancelled. “It is hard to know what the immediate fallout of this will be, but at this point I believe my academic career is effectively over,” he says.\n\nDemonstrators barricaded themselves in a Columbia University academic building during a pro-Palestinian protest in April 2024.Credit: Alex Kent/Getty\n\nColumbia’s woes have their roots in campus protests that broke out after Israel invaded Gaza following the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas, an Islamist organization designated by some countries as a terrorist group. Twelve hundred people died in the Hamas attacks, and about 250 were taken hostage. Some students at Columbia and other universities across the United States have called Israel’s response disproportionate, pointing to more than 48,000 Palestinians who have died, according to Gaza’s health ministry. But some Jewish students have felt threatened by the protests.\n\nTrump, who has long said that he wants to rid the US education system of “left-wing indoctrination”, wrote on his social-media network Truth Social on 4 March that “All federal funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests.”\n\nBy Monday, the US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights had sent letters to 60 universities, including Columbia, warning them of potential enforcement actions if they do not “fulfill their obligations to protect Jewish students on campus”.\n\nColumbia, where protests were particularly intense and where New York City police were called in to break up demonstrations, is the first to be affected by the campaign.",

          "title": "The ‘quantum’ principle that says why atoms are as they are",
          "authors": "Olival Freire Jr, Thiago Hartz",
          "abstract": "What makes matter stable? Why are atoms as they are? Why do different materials vary in their properties, such as electrical conductivity, density, melting temperature or light-absorption spectra?\n\nSuch questions exercised physicists greatly in the decades after Dmitri Mendeleev introduced his periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869. They received new impetus around the turn of the twentieth century with J. J. Thomson’s discovery that atoms were not indivisible, but contained smaller, negatively charged entities called electrons — the first subatomic particles to be identified. Then, in 1911, came Ernest Rutherford’s discovery that atoms contain a central ‘nucleus’ of densely packed positive charge.\n\nHow quantum mechanics emerged in a few revolutionary months 100 years ago\n\nThis opened the door to a thrilling journey of discovery, to understand the rules governing subatomic structures. It reached some form of destination a century ago, at the beginning of 1925, with a principle that has underpinned our ideas of the stability of matter ever since.\n\nThis is the Pauli exclusion principle, named for the brilliant young Austrian theoretical physicist who devised it1, Wolfgang Pauli. It was a product of what is now labelled the old quantum theory — a period of ad hoc theorizing between 1900 and 1925 that led to the introduction of a consistent theory of quantum mechanics in 1925–27 by Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Max Born, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac and others. Pauli’s principle can be considered the apex of the old quantum theory and, unusually, survived to be incorporated into the new one. Its centenary is an occasion to remember the odyssey of physicists in attempting to understand, amend and test properties predicted by the periodic table, and how this principle has guided our understanding of matter — and not just the conventional stuff.\n\nBold hypotheses\n\nThe discovery of a charged substructure to atoms, which are neutral overall, created considerable difficulty for pictures of how atoms worked. In 1842, the mathematician Samuel Earnshaw showed that there is no stable, static distribution of such charges, ruling out static models of the atom. Yet, despite numerous attempts following the discovery of subatomic structure, no one could arrive at a model that achieved atomic stability and explained features such as the distinct, discrete spectral lines of light emitted by atoms of different elements.\n\nShortly after Rutherford’s discovery of the nucleus, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr began to attack this problem using quantum principles. He harnessed an idea introduced by Max Planck in 1900 to explain the spectrum of light emitted by a non-reflective ‘black body’ — that energy comes only in discrete chunks, or quanta. Bohr applied it to the spectrum of light emitted and absorbed by hydrogen atoms. The basic hydrogen atom is the simplest of all atoms, now known to consist of a single proton and a single electron.\n\nWhy even physicists still don’t understand quantum theory 100 years on\n\nBohr started with a picture in which electrons circle the atomic nucleus, rather as planets orbit a star. He postulated that there are specific values of orbital energies at which electrons do not radiate and, therefore, atoms remain stable. Light can be emitted and absorbed only at frequencies corresponding to the difference in energy between two of these stable orbits, which Bohr characterized with different values of a first, ‘principal’ quantum number2.\n\nThis bold hypothesis could explain some features of the hydrogen spectrum, but not all. Bohr’s odyssey continued, incorporating new spectroscopic data and theoretical conjectures. These were derived in part from classical mechanics, from applying the precepts of Albert Einstein’s 1905 special theory of relativity to atomic electrons, and by introducing more quantum ideas entirely at odds with classical physics. The ‘quantum of action’ introduced by Planck (now known as Planck’s constant, h, whose ‘reduced’ form when divided by 2π, ħ, is widely used), for example, suggests there is a minimum amount of energy a system can exchange. And Bohr’s own principle of correspondence stated that, when the principal quantum number is large, predictions achieved using this mixed theoretical toolkit should approach the results known from classical physics.\n\nThese efforts resulted in Bohr introducing two more quantum numbers3: an azimuthal quantum number, which represented the magnitude of the electron’s angular momentum; and the magnetic quantum number, which described the size of its magnetic moment. These additions made sense in Bohr’s picture of the atom: if the electron is moving along a circular orbit around the atomic nucleus, it would have an angular momentum; and as a charged body in circular motion, you would also expect it to have a magnetic moment.\n\nBut again, this couldn’t explain all features of the hydrogen spectrum. By 1923–24, the main puzzle was how to explain the Zeeman effect, in which new spectral lines appear when orbiting electrons interact with an external magnetic field. This is the point at which Pauli enters the story.\n\nElectron exclusion\n\nAt the turn of 1925, Pauli was just 24 years old. Already a lecturer in theoretical physics at the University of Hamburg, Germany, he was highly regarded by his peers. Since his youth in Vienna, he had been recognized as a mathematics prodigy — a mantle that he did not wear with ease, as is so often the case. He sought help through the new psychoanalysis promulgated by the psychologist Carl Jung, with whom Pauli maintained a lasting intellectual dialogue4. Pauli was a prolific correspondent, and his published letters are an important source for scientists as well as historians.\n\nWolfgang Pauli delivering a lecture in Copenhagen in 1929.Credit: Gondsmit/CERN/Science Photo Library\n\nPauli’s principle1 was informed by ideas from Edmund Clifton Stoner, but his approach was original — and unusual — in many senses. For a start, it seemed to be based mainly in numerology, with no direct connection to known physics. Pauli’s key addition to Bohr’s model was a fourth quantum number — one that, unlike Bohr’s, had no analogy with classical physics, and not even any visual representation in space-time. This new quantum number, spin, could have only two values, either +ħ/2 or −ħ/2. Electrons with opposite values of this quantum number would interact differently with an external magnetic field, leading to the splitting of spectral lines seen in the Zeeman effect.\n\nNowadays, we know that the spin quantum number cannot be interpreted visually: if you try to model an electron as a charged body spinning on its axis, you find its surface would be spinning at a velocity greater than that of light. It is the strongest indication in atomic models of just how bizarre quantum theory is, filled with features that defy classical intuitions.\n\nPauli did not formulate his exclusion principle on the basis of classical theories or dynamical principles, but stated it as a simple postulate: that no two electrons in an atom can share the same set of four quantum numbers. As characterized by historian John Heilbron, this statement was rather in the style of the biblical Ten Commandments: “It shall be forbidden for more than one electron [in the same atom] … to have the same values of [all applicable] quantum numbers”5. In this regard, Pauli anticipated the new quantum mechanics, which also — to the distress of many physicists, including Schrödinger and Einstein — abandoned intuitive visual models in the construction of the theory or in its interpretation.\n\n‘Shut up and calculate’: how Einstein lost the battle to explain quantum reality",

          "abstract": "Deforestation and the degradation of forest ecosystems are major drivers of the current crisis in loss of biodiversity1. Much of the world’s biodiversity is found in forests, particularly those in the tropics2. Over the past three centuries, deforestation has occurred at alarming rates3. As forests are cleared, what remains is often broken into small fragments that are separated by non-forest land uses, such as agricultural lands, ranch lands and areas for human development. Does this fragmentation harm biodiversity beyond that of the loss of forests? Could fragmentation instead benefit biodiversity? These questions are at the heart of a long-standing and ongoing conservation debate4–7. Writing in Nature, Gonçalves-Souza et al.8 address these crucial questions by providing insights from an analysis of more than 4,000 species from across the world.",

          "abstract": "With papers to write, grants to apply for and students to teach, cybersecurity can be a low priority for scientists. Until, that is, it all goes wrong.\n\n“Frankly, this is an awful time for science,” says Noam Ross, executive director of rOpenSci, a non-profit initiative in Berkeley, California, that provides open-source software tools for scientists. He should know. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ross, who is based in Brooklyn, New York, was working for the US non-profit organization EcoHealth Alliance, which aims to identify areas where human activity has increased the risk of disease spillover from animal sources. “EcoHealth became the subject of conspiracy theorists about the origin of COVID,” he says.\n\nThat made the organization — and anyone who worked for it — a target. “It could range from hate mail to death threats,” Ross says. “I had colleagues where some of that stuff was directed at their homes, not just the office.”\n\nAs political divides deepen, such threats are multiplying. In February, many people working for US federal health agencies found themselves ‘doxxed’ — their photograph and work information, as well as records of their political donations, were published on a website called DEI Watchlist. The site was created by the conservative, US non-profit organization American Accountability Foundation, with the purpose of “exposing the unelected career staff driving radical Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives”.\n\nSo … you’ve been hacked\n\nAriadna Gallo, a political scientist at Argentina’s national scientific and technical research council, CONICET, based in Buenos Aires, was doxxed in 2024 after being filmed at a public protest against cuts to academic funding in the country. A YouTuber featured her in a video and published her personal and academic details, triggering what Gallo calls a “torrent” of attacks in the video’s comments.\n\nAll scientists, regardless of their discipline or location, are potential targets, according to Matt Mitchell, chief executive of the Safety Sync Group in New York, which provides online and real-world advice and resources on security and safety. “This is where we are,” he says. “The problem is bigger than any one president, prime minister or leader of a totalitarian or authoritarian state.”\n\nBut there are things you can do to protect yourself, and resources that can help. Here are five steps to get started.\n\nGet help\n\nYour institution will have privacy policies and digital resources you can tap into, but there are also plenty available online. These include anti-doxxing tips from digital-rights non-profit group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) in San Francisco, California; cybersecurity risk-assessment tools from the Ford Foundation’s Grantee Safety Program in New York City; and assorted resources from the US government’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nCybersecurity for the travelling scientist\n\nWhatever you do, include your colleagues in the conversation. “This is absolutely vital,” says Thorin Klosowski, a security and privacy activist at the EFF in Los Angeles, California. “If everyone is not on board for the security steps you’re taking, it’s going to be less secure.”\n\nBouncing ideas around with colleagues outside your discipline can expose new problems and ways to fix them, he adds. “You might not think about the risk to a particular data set, or that your laptop might get stolen at a coffee shop, until you start having those conversations.”\n\nFurthermore, it’s always good to know people who will have your back if you start to garner unwanted attention online. “Find a trusted colleague, mentor or loved one that knows what your concerns might be,” says Samuel Mendez, a PhD candidate studying public-health communication at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts, who created a digital safety kit for public-health workers. That person can then be “someone you can reach out to for support if you do need help screening messages or documenting interactions at some point”, they add.\n\nScrub your online profile\n\n“An immediate step you can take right now is to search for your own information,” Mendez suggests. That can be as simple as googling yourself in combination with names of former employers, schools, places of residence and so on, to see whether you can find any contact information that you don’t want to be public. “From there, you can manually request removal,” Mendez says. Success might vary, however — whereas residents of the European Union have relatively strong privacy protections, including the right to request that personal data be erased (the ‘right to be forgotten’), that is not true everywhere, including in the United States.\n\nCyberattacks are hitting research institutions — with devastating effects\n\nSome firms will scrape your data from the Internet and sell it on, and you should definitely include these in your scrubbing. “My general recommendation is to make a request to one of the big ones, and just see what you get,” Klosowski says. Companies that scrape such data almost always give you your data set free of charge, he says; then you can decide how much you need to worry.\n\nAlternatively, you can pay for a service that will remove the information for you, such as DeleteMe, Incogni or Kanary. In professions in which doxxing has been a problem, specialist services exist. Doximity’s DocDefender, for instance, will remove details from public sites as part of its package for physicians, who might be at risk from groups such as anti-abortion campaigners.\n\nInstitutions and professional bodies could make this process easier for researchers, says Greg Wilson, a cybersecurity educator in Toronto, Canada. Academic conferences, for instance, could include hour-long ‘bring your own device’ sessions during which people are walked through the process of securing their data and devices. Indeed, Mendez has run social events, such as a ‘digital safety disco’, where this goes on in an informal setting.\n\nPractise good cybersecurity hygiene\n\nThe basics of cybersecurity are straightforward, Klosowski says: use a password manager and two-factor authentication; make sure that no two sites or apps use the same password; and remove apps and delete accounts that you rarely use.",

          "abstract": "Anthony Gagliano (left) and Marie Launay complete the final step of their protocol, preparing a DNA library from material extracted from their fish species of interest.Credit: Denis Roy\n\nOn completing my first day of preparing genetic libraries in July 2024, my team and I were confronted with rubbish bins overflowing with plastic, single-use pipette tips, tubes and gloves. As a PhD student studying fish biology at the Natural Resources Department at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, it was hard to ignore the troubling mismatch between a widespread reliance on single-use plastic and working in a research field focused on conservation.\n\nAlthough data on this issue are scarce, in 2020, researchers at a small, seven-person microbiology laboratory in Edinburgh, UK, churned out a staggering 97 kilograms of biohazardous and plastic waste in just one month1. Plastic is now showing up in some of the most remote parts of the planet; in the Beaufort Sea, a section of the Arctic Ocean to the north of Canada and Alaska, an average of 7,570 microplastic particles were recorded per square kilometre over an 12-day period in 20222. Its impact is widespread, from littering the ocean floor to infiltrating the food web.\n\nTeaming up with Anthony Gagliano, a fellow master’s student dedicated to the conservation of freshwater fish, I embarked on a conservation project studying genetic diversity in different fish populations: the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) in my case, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus x L. macrochirus) for Anthony. Although plastic pollution wasn’t the main focus of our research, safeguarding water bodies is essential to our work, and we knew we had to address the disconnect between our values and laboratory practices.\n\nResearchers have raised alarms about excessive plastic use in scientific laboratories in the past. However, few quantifiable data exist on the actual amount of plastic waste generated by common protocols. Filling that gap became our first goal.\n\nQuantifying the issue\n\nBetween June and August 2024, we extracted DNA from 518 fish and used it to produced genetic libraries for our species of interest. A genetic library consists of DNA fragments that have been cut into even smaller pieces, amplified and tagged with special labels, allowing the sequencing device to recognize and read them. By analysing the DNA sequences, we aimed to assess the adaptation potential of populations of different species, to inform conservation policies. The protocol required the use of disposable sterile materials to prevent cross-contamination.\n\nMarie Launay takes a piece of an Arctic Cod's fin ray to use in the DNA extraction process.Credit: Marie Launay\n\nTo quantify the waste produced, we set aside the plastic produced from the first batch of 96 libraries, which included items such as pipette tips, tubes, plates and packaging. Once processed, we found that our first batch had produced 7.57 kg of plastic waste, with library preparation alone accounting for around 3.85 kg.\n\nOur entire project would have produced close to 41 kg of plastic waste if we had continued with our course of action. Using this data as a baseline, it became painfully clear how big the issue was: some large-scale genetic labs process thousands of samples per year, which, if using similar procedures, would generate an astonishing amount of waste.\n\nAwareness to action\n\nSustainable practices can feel overwhelming for researchers because they require extra thought, time and funds to adopt. So, we decided to start small with practical, achievable adjustments.\n\nWe began by reusing consumables and making more-sustainable purchases. For example, we reused pipette tips by autoclaving them to clean them. By purchasing non-loaded tips with minimal packaging, and refilling the boxes ourselves, we reduced our plastic waste by almost 50%. This also saved on costs, because refill bags are more affordable than pre-loaded boxes.\n\nWe also developed a cleaning and decontamination protocol for the shearing tubes used to fragment DNA into smaller pieces for sequencing. Our protocol requires the use of ultraviolet light as well as a specialized cleaning solution to minimize contamination and allows the tubes to be safely reused.",

They analysed brain scans from 38,961 people in the UK Biobank database using a deep-learning model trained to estimate brain age. They calculated the difference between each person’s predicted brain age and their chronological age — known as the brain age gap (BAG) and used by researchers as a marker of brain ageing.\n\nThen the team performed analyses on a subset of 31,520 healthy participants who had genetic data available, to find out which genes drive their BAG differences.\n\nTo narrow down which of the BAG-linked genes are good targets for new or repurposed drugs, the authors combined their analyses with activity data for 2,682 genes in blood cells and 2,915 genes in brain tissue. This flagged 64 genes with supported links to BAG. Some of these genes are involved in blood clotting and cell death, and seven of them were shown through genetic testing to have strongest links with BAG.\n\nAnti-ageing compounds\n\nThe team also found 466 compounds, either approved as drugs or being tested in clinical studies, that target 29 of these genes and could help to reverse brain ageing. Thirteen of those compounds act on some of these 64 genes or their protein products, and have already been tested — or are being tested — in anti-ageing clinical trials.",

The World RePORT project, which tracks global health-research spending, showed that, in 2022, the NIH spent 25 times more on grants than did the next biggest funder — the London-based charity Wellcome — that reported data to the initiative (see ‘World leader’).\n\nSource: World RePORT\n\nUS biomedical science dominates the world in terms of papers, discovery and drugs, says Miriam Merad, a cancer immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who receives funding from the NIH and other sources (see ‘Publication prowess’). Merad points to a study1 that shows that NIH-funded research contributed to 354 of 356 drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010–19.\n\n“Without NIH, there would be no cancer immunotherapy, no anti-overdose medication, no anti-heart attack or stroke medication, no cutting-edge treatments,” addiction researcher Olivier George at the University of California, San Diego, tweeted in February.\n\nSource: PubMed\n\nThe cuts mean “drug discovery is going to slow down, for sure”, says Merad. She is working with colleagues on new drugs, the development of which they will have to pause if they don’t have certainty on funding soon. “This is the type of thing that’s happening across the country.”\n\nThe NIH’s approach to funding scientists is unique in the world, says Merad. NIH grants often allow researchers to focus on scientific problems for four or five years without the need to raise further funds, she says. That provides freedom and stability that is not typically available in other regions, such as Europe, or in industry. “They trust the brain, the mind, the intellect of the people they fund. In industry, you don’t have the luxury to pivot, you are constantly constrained.”\n\nThe NIH’s “support to basic biomedical research enables fundamental breakthroughs, the path to which would be considered too risky for any venture capitals or biopharmaceutical companies”, says Wang.",

          "authors": "Eric Reinhart",
          "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic has abated, mortality from other causes in the United States has kept climbing, reflecting disturbing trends not seen in any other high-income country. Despite US health-care spending being about US$13,500 per person in 2022 — twice that of peer nations — its people are more likely to die younger, of preventable and treatable causes, by suicide and drug overdose or from complications of childbirth (see go.nature.com/4i41oqc). This is not owing to any law of nature, but system-wide failure.\n\nInstead of investing in public care, US politics have prioritized market-based ideologies. This means subsidizing drug companies and private insurance while underfunding public health and social services, empowering businesses and charities to operate in their place — a process known as the privatization of public health. This generates large profits by exacerbating medical needs and costs but leaves millions without care.\n\n‘Silence is complicity’ — universities must fight the anti-DEI crackdown\n\nThe Trump administration’s dismantling of public-health systems through proposed or enacted cuts to Medicaid, the US Indian Health Service, National Institutes of Health and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as food-assistance and housing programmes, is likely to intensify these deadly dynamics. Trump has also put an anti-vaccine and anti-psychiatry activist, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, in control of the nation’s health systems.\n\nIn response, many health leaders have decried the politicization of public health, portraying it as a neutral domain under siege by political forces. But this misdiagnoses the problem and obscures the solution.\n\nThe real crisis is not that public health — which is fundamentally about policies dictating the distribution of resources required to protect human life — has been politicized. It is that it has not been politicized nearly enough.\n\nDecades of bipartisan failure set the stage for this moment. As journalist Ed Yong described in The Atlantic in 2021 (see go.nature.com/4bun7hv), public health has “willingly silenced its own political voice”. US political leaders and health officials have abandoned the once-obvious truth that political reforms to counteract poverty, inequality and inadequate social services are crucial to preventing diseases. A medical field that’s focused on treating illness as a substitute for preventing it through public policies now laments the supposed intrusion of politics into health.\n\nNIH turmoil sparks anxiety over future of its global grants\n\nBut there can never be an apolitical approach to public health. Policy choices about caregiving infrastructure, taxes and economic inequality, environmental and consumer regulations, public housing and labour rights, for example, are inherently political. They determine who lives and who dies, whose lives matter and how much.\n\nWhat has left US health so vulnerable to partisan capture is not an excess of politics but rather a depoliticizing distortion of public health that fixates on individualistic medical care and personal responsibility, rather than public responsibility to address root social and environmental causes of disease and care for those who are sick or disabled. This weakens communities, fuels resentment and social division, limits political imagination and undercuts political organizing among groups that could achieve change.\n\nThe US medical profession, which has long been conservative, bears considerable responsibility. We physicians have historically avoided engagement with politics, except for policies that might affect our compensation and power, often justifying our inaction by appealing to scientific neutrality and professionalism. But, as Trump has made clear, our refusal to engage politically has not protected public health or medical science — it has left both defenceless.",

          "abstract": "Some scientists in the United States have told Nature that they are considering leaving the country in the wake of widespread disruption to research brought in by the administration of US President Donald Trump. The researchers say they are looking for opportunities in Europe, Australia and Asia.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, his administration has cut thousands of jobs at key public-health and science agencies, frozen biomedical research funding, slashed money to cover research-overhead costs and terminated grants that don’t align with the administration’s priorities. The effects of these changes have been felt by researchers across the United States and abroad.\n\n“I’ve been really, really passionate about my work, but the situation in the US is so stressful,” says a postdoctoral researcher who studies cancer and genomics at a prestigious US institution, and who requested anonymity because she did not have permission to speak to the media. The researcher is from South Asia but has spent the past four years in the United States, and is now talking to colleagues in Europe about opportunities. As someone who is not a US citizen, she is worried about media reports describing the Trump administration’s plans to introduce travel bans affecting specific countries.\n\nAre you a researcher in the United States who is contemplating leaving the country? Are you making plans? We want to hear from you.\n\nMadhukar Pai, a tuberculosis researcher at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, says that US colleagues have been in touch looking for work, or wanting to talk. “The distress is very palpable and sad to see,” he says.\n\nReady to go\n\nA prominent infectious-diseases researcher, who is a dual national of the United States and a European Union member state, intends to move back to Europe in the coming months. This is the first time in the decade and a half since he moved to the United States that he is seriously considering job offers from colleagues across the Atlantic. “There is the case to stay and fight”, but “I have to consider what is the best decision for myself, my family, my lab, my research and my mental health”, says the researcher, who wants to remain anonymous because his plans are not finalized and to protect his team.\n\nHe says his reasons for leaving include the Trump administration’s anti-science rhetoric and leadership changes at major government agencies. He also worries about the future of funding in his field of infectious diseases and virology.\n\nLeaving the United States will require compromises, he says. Salaries in Europe are generally lower than those for researchers with his experience in the United States, and the research environment in Europe can be less interdisciplinary, he says. Funding for science across Europe also remains stagnant. But having the option to leave puts him in an “extremely privileged position”, he adds.\n\nTough job market",

          "abstract": "In Baku last November, parties to the COP29 United Nations climate summit failed to put in place enough climate finance to keep global average warming below the 1.5 °C limit established in the 2015 Paris agreement.\n\nHigh-income countries (HICs) agreed only to “take the lead” in directing at least US$300 billion to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) each year by 2035. Their own contributions were left unspecified and could be drawn from a variety of sources. Meanwhile, the Baku agreement calls on “all actors” to scale up this total financing to at least $1.3 trillion annually.\n\nAlthough these headline numbers seem to be broadly similar to those that were proposed by climate-finance experts (including some of us1) before the COP29 meeting, in reality this fudged scattershot approach falls far short of what’s needed — in terms of timing and quality.\n\nTrump will weaken climate action — the rest of the US must not follow suit\n\nIdeally, climate finance should be given in the form of public grants, or equivalents. That way, recipients don’t need to find money from elsewhere to repay loans, and the finance can be used as ‘catalytic capital’ to attract private finance that can be co-invested in renewables for LMICs. Grants can also be spent on ending the use of fossil fuels early. The broad mix of public and private, bilateral and multilateral sources allowed by COP29 is inefficient. To decarbonize the world in time, climate finance should be provided at full scale this year, instead of being delayed to 2035, specialists say (see go.nature.com/3r5dxfy).\n\nAnother big stumbling block in Baku was the requirement for unanimity among the parties. For example, the Arab Group of negotiators refused to accept any text that targeted specific sectors, including fossil fuels — even though these are the main source of emissions that climate finance is intended to abate.\n\nWithout access to climate finance at scale, LMICs cannot afford to decarbonize. And time is running out. To have even a 50% chance of holding to the Paris agreement’s 1.5 °C limit, the world has a remaining budget of only around 180 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide (see go.nature.com/4bv5mme). This is projected to be depleted by 2035 (assuming a linear rate of decline starting from estimated annual emissions of about 40 Gt in 2025) or as soon as 2029 (assuming current emissions levels continue). Exceeding this limit makes crossing planetary tipping points more likely, including collapses of ice sheets, ocean currents, coral reefs and permafrost, threatening the lives and livelihoods of billions of people.\n\nSolar panels in Indonesia. The nation will receive US$20 billion to decarbonize over the next few years under a Just Energy Transition Partnership.Credit: Marc Romanelli/Getty\n\nImmediate action is needed to phase out and replace fossil fuels, as well as to scale up CO2-removal technologies and protect and restore carbon uptake in nature. If these measures are conducted simultaneously and at scale to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, and negative emissions thereafter, only then can global warming be limited to a 1.5 °C increase or remain close to it2. This year offers a unique chance to act, because countries are required to update their declared national emissions-reduction contributions to the Paris agreement during 2025.\n\nHere, we call on nations to find an immediate solution. Taking inspiration from the idea of ‘climate clubs’ — agreements among economically self-interested nations to cut emissions through aligned policies — we propose that coalitions of willing HICs form ‘climate finance clubs’ in their own self interests3. These clubs would finance decarbonization in LMICs, sidestepping the need for a global agreement, which inevitably results in a watered-down deal.\n\nBenefits for all\n\nWhy should countries want to pay others to act? It is in their own economic interests to reduce global emissions quickly — and, from the planet’s perspective, it doesn’t matter whether those emissions are emitted domestically or elsewhere.\n\nDrill, baby drill? Trump policies will hurt climate ― but US green transition is underway\n\nFor instance, in the past 6 months, climate-related damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton in the United States, floods in Valencia in Spain and wildfires in Los Angeles, California, are estimated to exceed $500 billion. That’s already more than the annual level of climate finance that HICs currently provide (around $100 billion a year) and more than they pledged at COP29 for 2035. Such costs will only escalate until global emissions are curbed.\n\nGroups of HICs must put in place the beginnings of a climate finance framework for LMICs this year. They should offer such countries grants that complement, not offset, their own rapid decarbonization efforts.\n\nTo avoid expensive and socially unacceptable climate impacts, the only thing that matters is that emissions are reduced extremely fast, globally. To be most effective, investments should be given with the highest priority to LMICs that commit in their 2025 Paris update to credible emission reductions — those that are consistent with keeping the world within 1.5 °C of pre-industrial average temperatures. Such countries can make bolder decarbonization pledges that are conditional on receiving climate finance. As recipients decarbonize their economies, they also benefit from lower exposure to domestic climate damages and air pollution, which in turn reduces their adaptation needs.\n\nAn offshore wind farm in Vietnam.Credit: Linh Pham/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nThere are already coalitions of HICs willing to provide climate finance — even if the United States does not participate. For example, the European Union, along with other HICs and multilateral development banks, have offered climate finance through Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) to Indonesia ($20 billion) and Vietnam ($15 billion) — of which half was from private sources. Offers were also made to South Africa ($8.5 billion) and Senegal ($2.7 billion). Such deals can be expanded to other LMICs, especially ones that are large emitters, including Colombia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Mexico, Thailand and India, which together would quickly add up to a significant proportion of avoided emissions. But adjustments are needed to avoid shortcomings.\n\nSo far, JETPs have offered mainly loans instead of grants — in Indonesia, for example, only 2% of JETP funds were grants. Yet loans add to LMICs’ debts and don’t provide capital to catalyse private-sector investments in renewables, or give incentives for closing fossil-fuel infrastructures early. Plans to phase out coal in South Africa, for example, have stalled without sufficient grants and a clear strategy, raising concerns over energy security as well as slowing the transition.\n\nThe climate finance club needs to do things differently. First, it should offer larger sums than JETPs do now. It should give all the public funding in grant-equivalent form, and make receipt conditional on a credible implementation plan and on accountability of fossil-fuel phase-out and renewables phase-in.\n\nSolid returns\n\nTo illustrate how a climate finance club might work (focusing on phasing out and replacing fossil fuels), we have examined the economic case for a group of nations that have the financial capacity and the incentive to support LMIC decarbonization. The group excludes the United States but includes the other G7 countries as well as the European Union, Norway, Switzerland, Australia and South Korea (see Supplementary information). We also excluded China and high-income Gulf states as recipients, given their ability to finance their own transition. This reduced climate-finance needs to about $500 billion per year.",

          "abstract": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an activist against vaccination, now oversees the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public-health agencies.Credit: Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nWith the epicentre of a deadly measles outbreak roughly 120 kilometres away, Katherine Wells is trying to shield her hometown from the highly contagious virus. So far, more than 250 people have fallen ill in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, and infected children who need critical care are often brought to the children’s hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where Wells is the director of public health. Each infected child brings with them the potential to spread the disease to the city’s residents.\n\nAs a result, Wells has been scrambling to expand the city’s vaccine clinics and to print flyers about measles for distribution at medical practices and day-care centres. “It’s measles 24–7,” she says. “I’m trying hard not to wear out our staff yet. This is going to be a long haul.”\n\nIt’s a scene that some US public-health researchers fear could become more common if reduced government support for vaccination leads to a surge in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases that doctors in the country now rarely see, such as measles, pertussis and rubella. An influential anti-vaccine advocate, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, now leads the US public-health system, which was already struggling to recoup lost trust and raise vaccination rates after the COVID-19 pandemic. If vaccination rates continue to drop, sporadic infections imported from abroad could spark a sustained domestic wildfire.\n\n“It’s pretty clear: once you back off from supporting vaccination, you’re going to have lower rates of it,” says Lauren Gardner, an engineer who models infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “It is so dangerous.”\n\nViral comeback\n\nMeasles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, but sporadic outbreaks still occur when unvaccinated travellers bring the virus in from abroad. This year’s outbreak has proved deadly: in February, an unvaccinated and otherwise healthy six-year-old in Texas became the first person in a decade to die from measles in the United States. Officials are evaluating another possible measles death in New Mexico.\n\nAt least 95% of a population must be vaccinated against measles to achieve herd immunity, whereby enough of a population is immune that a disease will not spread. In the United States, the level dropped just below that, to 93% during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has yet to recover. Measles is one of the most infectious human diseases, meaning that even a slight dip in vaccine coverage can make a big difference, says Ashley Gromis, a social epidemiologist at the RAND Corporation, a think tank in Santa Monica, California.\n\nPublic-health researchers worry that officials in the administration of US President Donald Trump will dial back vaccination efforts in the country.Credit: Bob Daemmrich/ZUMA Press Wire/Alamy\n\nThe 95% vaccination goal also assumes that unvaccinated individuals are evenly distributed throughout the population, she says. In practice, that is rarely the case. In Texas, about 94% of children entering kindergarten are vaccinated against measles. But in the region where the current outbreak began, only 82% are. “These pockets in which you have lots of susceptible individuals helps disease start circulating,” says Gromis.\n\nSuch numbers mean the United States is now “dangerously close” to losing ‘elimination’ status for measles, says Margaret Doll, an epidemiologist at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in New York. Given that prospect, it is particularly important for public-health officials to promote vaccines, she says. “You would like that message to be supported by our leading health authorities.”\n\nSystem in chaos\n\nYet the opposite seems to be happening. During US President Donald Trump’s first weeks in office, his administration pledged to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization and to drastically cut the US Agency for International Development. Both moves will mean more cases of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases occurring around the world, says Amy Winter, an epidemiologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. “That rise in global cases will put increased pressure on the US vaccination system,” she says.\n\nAnd that system has already been weakened: the Trump administration has fired hundreds of workers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the nation’s main public-health agency, and put a long-time opponent of vaccines in charge of the department that oversees it. Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, assured lawmakers during his confirmation hearings that he would not alter current vaccine policy, but in the weeks since he took office on 13 February, the CDC has postponed a meeting of its vaccine advisers, and Kennedy has said that he will investigate the recommended childhood vaccination schedule.\n\nWhat Trump’s election win could mean for AI, climate and health\n\nThe CDC reportedly plans to investigate whether vaccines cause autism — an idea that has been widely discredited. Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) said: “The rate of autism in American children has skyrocketed. CDC will leave no stone unturned in its mission to figure out what exactly is happening.”\n\nKennedy’s response to the Texas measles outbreak also has some public-health experts on edge. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy repeatedly said that he is not opposed to vaccination. And after initially downplaying the severity of the outbreak during a cabinet meeting, Kennedy issued a statement acknowledging the importance of vaccination in preventing measles.\n\nBut he also emphasized good nutrition and treatment with vitamin A as ways to reduce measles severity. In an interview on 4 March, he praised the benefits of cod liver oil.\n\nThis has fuelled confusion in Texas, where public-health officials are hearing stories of parents giving unvaccinated children vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses, rather than getting them vaccinated. “I personally am very concerned,” says Philip Huang, the director of Dallas County Health and Human Services in Texas. “These confusing messages are not helpful.” The US DHHS did not respond to a request for comment about Kennedy’s remarks on nutrition and vitamin A, or about worries of future outbreaks of disease.\n\nMixed messaging",

          "authors": "Niles Eldredge",
          "abstract": "Credit: Yale Univ.\n\nElisabeth Vrba’s meticulous studies of fossil and living mammals challenged the conventional view of evolution. Instead of a process of slow, continuous adaptive changes driven by natural selection, she linked episodes of rapid species extinction and formation to cataclysmic events in the environment. She is best known as a rigorous and creative contributor to the development of macroevolutionary theory — the origin and evolutionary fates of species and higher groups. She has died aged 82.\n\nVrba was born in Hamburg, Germany. After the death of her father, her family moved to a sheep farm in South West Africa (now Namibia) in 1944. She received her PhD in zoology and palaeontology at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, in 1974, with her research focusing on fossil bovids. In 1969, she began working at the Transvaal Museum, Pretoria, rising to be its deputy director from 1977 to 1986.\n\nVrba exploded onto the scientific world stage at a macroevolution meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in 1980. Until then, she was mostly unknown to US palaeontologists. A draft of her provocative paper on how life evolved (E. S. Vrba S. Afr. J. Sci. 76, 61–84; 1980), which was sent to me and at least one other researcher in the United States, prompted me — as a co-organizer — to invite her to speak. As she put it, she was “armed with the brand of punctuated equilibria here espoused”.\n\nThe theory of punctuated equilibria had been proposed by me and Stephen Jay Gould in 1972. We argued that most species in the fossil record remain unchanged for long periods, with occasional branching events involving rapid change during which new species evolve.\n\nVrba found a way to squeeze insight from the barren lines of phylogenetic diagrams into our understanding of evolutionary processes. Focusing on fossil antelopes, she contrasted two evolutionary lineages. One, impalas, has had only two species in the past six million years, since the Miocene. The other, wildebeests, hartebeests and others, has contained at least 27 species in the same time span.\n\nEstella Bergere Leopold (1927–2024), passionate environmentalist who traced changing ecosystems\n\nImpalas exploit a wide range of ecological conditions, whereas the wildebeest lineage contains numerous grassland specialists. Vrba argued that the width of the niche that a species can occupy drives rates of both speciation and extinction, with the environment being the main force underlying this evolution. Her ‘effect hypothesis’ proposed that apparent directional trends in evolution are accumulations of increasing specialization inside lineages of narrow-niched species — a phenomenon she later referred to as species sorting — and are not necessarily manifestations of species selection.\n\nBy the time she addressed the macroevolution meeting, the conference had developed into a referendum on punctuated equilibria — and she quickly became the star of the show. The science writer Roger Lewin highlighted her work, including two figures from her 1980 paper, along with an image of Charles Darwin, as illustrative aids in his five-page review of the event in Science (R. Lewin Science 210, 883–887; 1980), which he described as “one of the most important conferences on evolutionary biology for more than 30 years”.\n\n‘Exaptation’ is another original Vrba concept. An exaptation is a trait that has been co-opted to serve an extra function unrelated to that for which it originally evolved. For example, the wings of the African black heron (Egretta ardesiaca) are used not only for flight, but also to form an umbrella, casting a shadow over shallow water, where fish tend to congregate and be easy prey. The concept has captured the imaginations of many evolutionary biologists.",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS\n\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has found possible hints of ancient life on Mars ― one of the strongest signs yet of Martian life, according to planetary scientists. Dark-rimmed ‘leopard spots’ in a rock studied by the rover last year could be the remains of Martian microbial activity, researchers said at a conference today.\n\nThe announcement comes loaded with caveats. Yes, the spots look a lot like those produced by microbes on Earth. But the spots might have formed without the help of living organisms, researchers say, even if they don’t entirely understand the chemical and physical processes on Mars that would have been at work in that case.\n\nFor now, the discovery remains a 1 on the scale of 1 to 7 for evaluating claims of extraterrestrial life1: 1 represents the detection of an intriguing signal, and 7 is a slam-dunk confirmation. Jim Green, the former chief scientist at NASA who developed the scale, says he would like researchers to make more confirming measurements to move it up another notch on the scale. Doing that would require bringing the leopard-spot rock back to Earth for analysis. A sample is sitting in Perseverance’s belly, awaiting a ride off Mars for precisely that purpose.\n\nRegardless of how things play out, the discovery is a significant entry in the history of searching for extraterrestrial life — and a test of researchers’ ability to evaluate potential biosignatures on other planets.\n\nLake-side real estate\n\nToday’s talks, given at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in The Woodlands, Texas, were the first public presentation of a discovery that NASA teased in a July press release, which contained few scientific details. The agency’s caution comes from experience: decades ago, scientists claimed to have found signs of life in the Martian meteorite ALH84001, only for other researchers to find ways to explain the observations through geological, rather than biological, processes.\n\nThe data revealed today come from a rock in Jezero Crater, where the rover landed in 2021 to hunt for signs of Martian life. Aeons ago, the crater held a lake that could have been conducive to life. The rock formed in the channel of an ancient river that once flowed into the lake.\n\nMars rover makes epic climb to explore some of the oldest rocks in the Solar System\n\nThe rock contains dark peppery spots, which rover scientists nicknamed ‘poppy seeds’, and larger dark-rimmed blobs with lighter centres, dubbed ‘leopard spots’. Chemical analysis using the rovers’ instruments showed that the poppy seeds and the rims of the leopard spots are rich in iron and phosphorus. The centres of the leopard spots are rich in iron and sulfur, Joel Hurowitz, a geochemist at Stony Brook University in New York, told the conference.\n\nThese chemical enrichments suggest that the poppy seeds and leopard spots formed when carbon-containing ‘organic’ compounds in the rock reacted with iron and sulfate minerals. On Earth, such reactions are kicked off by microbes.",

Chase/Getty\n\nNASA has abruptly closed its chief-scientist office, along with 2 other offices, firing 23 employees. The 10 March action leaves the agency without a way of feeding independent science advice to its topmost leadership, at a time when it is talking about sending astronauts to the Moon and developing plans to go onwards to Mars.\n\nTrump team orders huge government lay-offs: how science could fare\n\nJanet Petro, the acting NASA administrator, said in an agency-wide e-mail that “we’re viewing this as an opportunity to reshape our workforce”. The lay-offs come days before all US federal agencies are required to submit a plan for how they would eliminate employees, as part of a radical downsizing of the federal government led by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk in the name of improving efficiency.\n\nThese are NASA’s first firings since Trump took office, and they have taken a different pattern to those at other federal agencies in the past few weeks. NASA was spared, for unknown reasons, from the extensive lay-offs of probationary employees — those with little job protection because they have been in their positions for less than two years — seen at other agencies. The move makes NASA the first agency under the current Trump administration to pre-emptively fire career employees, beginning the required ‘reductions in force’ (RIFs) sooner than many observers had anticipated. It remains unclear whether other agencies might follow NASA’s lead.\n\nThe offices closed by NASA are its Office of the Chief Scientist; its Office of Technology, Policy and Strategy; and the diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility branch of its Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity. The cutting of the last of these is a direct result of Trump’s 20 January executive order to slash diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government. But the reason for the closure of the other two offices is not as obvious.\n\nThinking about the future\n\nBoth offices advise NASA’s chief, or administrator, on scientific and technical matters. Petro is filling this position until Trump’s nominee, billionaire and private astronaut Jared Isaacman — a friend of Musk — is confirmed by the US Senate.\n\nNASA embraced diversity. Trump’s DEI purge is hitting space scientists hard\n\nThe two offices are unique in that they offer ways of connecting strategy across NASA’s departments and divisions. With their closure, “you will lose strategic thinking”, said a NASA staff member who is familiar with the structure of the offices but did not want to be named for fear of retaliation.",

          "abstract": "China’s Yangtze River is the longest in Eurasia and the third-longest on the planet, flowing more than 6,000 kilometres from the Tibetan Plateau to the East China Sea. Its basin covers almost one-fifth of China’s land area and is home to hundreds of millions of people. More than 52,000 reservoirs have been built on the Yangtze and its tributaries since the 1950s to mitigate flooding, generate hydropower, stabilize water supplies and protect ecology.\n\nThere are a host of challenges in managing this massive basin to support the sometimes-contradictory goals of developing water sources sustainably and protecting ecosystems. Population growth, development and urbanization in the region are constantly increasing the demand for water, while escalating water pollution and pressures on biodiversity. Although the Yangtze River basin’s average annual precipitation has changed relatively little in the past two decades, shifts in rainfall patterns and landscape use have led to a rise in the frequency and severity of droughts and floods.\n\nFor example, the hydropower company China Yangtze Power, based in Beijing, has found that the average drought period is now two weeks longer than it was in 2000. In 2020, unusually heavy rains led to the Three Gorges Dam in Yichang having the highest inflow rates since its construction in 2003. Management of the water flow in that reservoir helped to mitigate flooding, but this inundation still affected 45 million people, with more than 140 people dead or missing and caused an estimated US$16.5 million in damages1.\n\nAI to the rescue: how to enhance disaster early warnings with tech tools\n\nA smarter, more robust system of tracking, modelling and managing water in this basin will help to alleviate such issues, resulting in enhanced operational safety and reduced costs. To this end, the Changjiang Water Resources Commission (CJW) is spearheading the Smart Yangtze River Project (see go.nature.com/4h51xzf), under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources. This project was proposed in 2022 and now has 597 million yuan (US$82 million) of dedicated government investment, for a basin-wide, full-coverage water-monitoring system, with a planned completion date of 2035 for the preliminary design. Many hydropower companies are also contributing hundreds of millions of yuan to the initiative.\n\nAt the heart of the project is a digital twin of the Yangtze River basin. This twin consists of an advanced 3D simulation of the whole region, using data on weather, water flow, ecology, sediment properties, topography, energy demand and more, to provide real-time modelling of projected flood routing, water engineering, scheduling, shipping, ecological impacts and other outcomes.\n\nThe intuitive interface provides a reliable assessment of the impact of resource-management decisions and watershed-protection actions on sustainable development and biodiversity health. It can be used for forecasting, early warning, emergency-system rehearsals and contingency planning. A first version of this digital twin already exists and is in use (see ‘Yangtze river basin’, and go.nature.com/3wvchj1), encompassing two supplementary watersheds (of the Han and Lishui rivers) and four dams (the Three Gorges, Danjiangkou, Jiangya and Zaoshi). This will be substantially improved and expanded with more data and modelling over the coming years.\n\nSource: World Bank\n\nCurrently, nearly 2,700 water-level monitoring stations and more than 37,000 rainfall stations are collecting data in the Yangtze River basin. In April 2023, work began on new and existing hydrological-station networks in key areas such as the major tributaries of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, with enhanced monitoring methods including video and remote sensing. On completion, the Smart Yangtze River Project will also include hundreds of monitoring stations for water quality and groundwater levels, and tens of thousands of water intake points.\n\nMuch related work has been completed over the past five years — for example, China Yangtze Power now uses an intelligent decision-support system for reservoir-scheduling simulations and flood exercises. The Yangtze River Simulator, developed by the team of Xia Jun, a hydrologist at Wuhan University, China, is a tool for monitoring, simulation and analysis of flood control, power generation and biodiversity conservation2,3.\n\nHow to achieve safe water access for all: work with local communities\n\nAlthough the use of digital twins has grown in the past decade for everything from industrial manufacturing to transportation, there are relatively few digital-twin representations used for intelligent watershed management. The Yangtze project might represent the largest and most ambitious such initiative yet. This huge endeavour presents substantial challenges in terms of enhancing existing data collection and management, as well as improving models and services.\n\nResearchers have already amassed a wealth of data and experience. But the full potential of the Smart Yangtze River Project is still far from being realized. Funding shortages are an issue: numerous departments, companies and research institutions engaged in the project need to secure their own funding. More data need to be collected and digitized; data and model formats need to be standardized and shared across industry and academia.\n\nMany companies have yet to engage in the project because of cost or technological constraints, or perhaps because they fear that it might affect their profits. Further collaboration should address these challenges, so that there is adequate guidance for managers’ decision-making.\n\nHere, we recommend four steps that will help to ensure the success of the programme.\n\nUnify data and model standards\n\nA digital twin requires many types of data, taken at different time intervals and in various formats. For instance, a comprehensive and accurate rainfall and run-off model might require data on atmospheric temperature, humidity and cloud distribution from meteorological satellites and on surface vegetation coverage and land-use types from optical remote-sensing satellites. It might also need information on river morphology from drone-mounted cameras and terrain elevation from laser-based radar, or lidar. A digital twin requires enough data to drive high-resolution modelling but not so much that it creates transmission bottlenecks.\n\nA lack of universal methods, standards and specifications makes it challenging to integrate data from multiple monitoring networks. Data are often fragmented across different entities and stored in diverse formats. For example, meteorological and run-off data are held by the Chinese Bureau of Hydrology; reservoir-operation data by hydropower companies; and water resource-management data by the CJW. Inside the government, multiple data formats are used: the water-conservancy department utilizes HDF, the environmental-protection department uses CSV, the meteorological-department relies on NetCDF and the power department utilizes COMTRADE.\n\nDigital twins, such as this one of Zaoshi Dam, can help with real-time water management.Credit: Dr. Xiaopeng Wang\n\nNot all of the desired information is even digitized. Information about electricity demand, power market data, power-line restrictions and emergency information, for example, is still sometimes recorded and analysed without the use of computers. Existing reservoir dispatching regulations, projects and plans are typically documented in hand-written form rather than digitally.\n\nIt is also important to develop standards for the models used to process all these data, to ensure that they are versatile, reusable and interoperable. It is essential to create a common design and development platform for the Smart Yangtze River Project system, enabling all models to operate seamlessly. The project is creating unified data and model standards. Nevertheless, numerous areas remain inadequately compatible.\n\nThere are few global examples that show how to develop digital twins in a robust way with good standards — in general, the concept of digital twinning is more advanced in industrial manufacturing than in river management. One such example is the virtual shared workspace established by US aircraft manufacturer Boeing to facilitate collaboration among its corporate partners. The European Digital Twin Ocean project (see go.nature.com/3cdab5p) has established a data-governance framework to set standards for data and models across a wide swathe of content, including satellite observation data, ocean-model outputs, in situ measurements and data from historical, industrial and citizen-science sources.\n\nShare data and models\n\nCurrently, the Yangtze digital-twin platform is hosted by the Yangtze River Commission and several companies’ internal networks, and it is not fully accessible to scientists and others who work around the basin. The interaction between industry and academia is minimal, hindered by obstacles in accessing information and resources, often attributed to commercial confidentiality. One issue lies in data ownership. Regional water-management departments and companies are generally reluctant to share commercially sensitive information. Likewise, hydropower companies can find it hard to obtain power dispatch data from power-grid companies.",

          "abstract": "A machine running the AI model Gemini Robotics places a basketball in a hoop.Credit: Google DeepMind\n\nArtificial-intelligence company Google DeepMind has put a version of its most advanced large language model (LLM), Gemini, into robots. Using the model, machines can perform some tasks — such as ‘slam dunking’ a miniature basketball through a desktop hoop — despite never having watched another robot do the action, says the firm.\n\nThe company is among several working to harness the artificial intelligence (AI) advances that power chatbots to create general-purpose robots. The approach also comes with safety concerns, given such models’ propensity to generate wrong and harmful outputs.\n\nThe hope is to create machines that are intuitive to operate and can tackle a range of physical tasks, without relying on human supervision or being preprogrammed. By connecting to Gemini’s robotic models, a developer could enhance their robot so that it comprehends “natural language and now understands the physical world in a lot more detail than before,” says Carolina Parada, who leads the Google DeepMind robotics team and is based in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nThe model known as Gemini Robotics — announced on 12 March in a blog post and technical paper — is “a small but tangible step” towards that goal, says Alexander Khazatsky, an AI researcher and co-founder of CollectedAI in Berkeley, California, which is focused on creating data sets to develop AI-powered robots.\n\nSpatial awareness\n\nA team at Google DeepMind, which is headquartered in London, started with Gemini 2.0, the firm’s most advanced vision and language model, trained by analysing patterns in huge volumes of data.\n\nThey created a specialized version of the model designed to excel at reasoning tasks involving 3D physical and spatial understanding — for example, predicting an object’s trajectory or identifying the same part of an object in images taken from different angles.\n\nFinally, they further trained the model on data from thousands of hours of real, remote-operated robot demonstrations. This allowed the robotic ‘brain’ to implement real actions, much in the way LLMs use their learned associations to generate the next word in a sentence.\n\nThe team tested Gemini Robotics on humanoid robots and robotic arms, on tasks that came up in training and on unfamiliar activities. According to the team, robots using the model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art rivals when tested on new tasks and familiar ones in which details had been changed.\n\nFolding origami",

          "title": "Four ways COVID changed virology: lessons from the most sequenced virus of all time",
          "authors": "Ewen Callaway",
          "abstract": "Kei Sato was looking for his next big challenge five years ago when it smacked him — and the world — in the face. The virologist had recently started an independent group at the University of Tokyo and was trying to carve out a niche in the crowded field of HIV research. “I thought, ‘What can I do for the next 20 or 30 years?’”\n\nHe found an answer in SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, that was rapidly spreading around the world. In March 2020, as rumours swirled that Tokyo might face a lockdown that would stop research activities, Sato and five students decamped to a former adviser’s laboratory in Kyoto. There, they began studying a viral protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to quell the body’s earliest immune responses. Sato soon established a consortium of researchers that would go on to publish at least 50 studies on the virus.\n\nIn just five years, SARS-CoV-2 became one of the most closely examined viruses on the planet. Researchers have published about 150,000 research articles about it, according to the citation database Scopus. That’s roughly three times the number of papers published on HIV in the same period. Scientists have also generated more than 17 million SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences so far, more than for any other organism. This has given an unparalleled view into the ways in which the virus changed as infections spread. “There was an opportunity to see a pandemic in real time in much higher resolution than has ever been achievable before,” says Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Pirbright Institute, near Woking, UK.\n\nNow, with the emergency phase of the pandemic in the rear-view mirror, virologists are taking stock of what can be learnt about a virus in such a short amount of time, including its evolution and its interactions with human hosts. Here are four lessons from the pandemic that some say could empower the global response to future pandemics — but only if scientific and public-health institutions are in place to use them.\n\nViral sequences tell stories\n\nOn 11 January 2020, Edward Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney, Australia, shared what most scientists consider to be the first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence to a virology discussion board; he had received the data from virologist Zhang Yongzhen in China.\n\nBy the year’s end, scientists had submitted more than 300,000 sequences to a repository known as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). The rate of data collection only got faster from there as troubling variants of the virus took hold. Some countries ploughed enormous resources into sequencing SARS-CoV-2: between them, the United Kingdom and the United States contributed more than 8.5 million (see ‘Viral genome rally’). Meanwhile, scientists in other countries, including South Africa, India and Brazil, showed that efficient surveillance can spot worrying variants in lower-resource settings.\n\nSource: GISAID\n\nIn earlier epidemics, such as the 2013–16 West African Ebola outbreak, sequencing data came in too slowly to track how the virus was changing as infections spread. But it quickly became clear that SARS-CoV-2 sequences would arrive at an unprecedented volume and pace, says Emma Hodcroft, a genomic epidemiologist at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel. She works on an effort called Nextstrain, which uses genome data to track viruses, such as influenza, to better understand their spread. “We had developed so many of these methods that, in theory, could have been very useful,” Hodcroft says. “And all of a sudden, in 2020, we had an opportunity to put up and show up.”\n\nVaccine sceptic RFK Jr is now a powerful force in US science: what will he do?\n\nInitially, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data were used to trace the spread of the virus at its epicentre in Wuhan, China, and then globally. This answered key early questions — such as whether the virus spread largely between people or from the same animal sources to humans. The data revealed the geographical routes through which the virus travelled, and showed them much more quickly than could conventional epidemiological investigations. Later, faster-transmitting variants of the virus started appearing, and sent sequencing labs into hyperdrive. A global collective of scientists and amateur variant trackers trawled through the sequence data constantly in search of worrying viral changes.\n\n“It became possible to track the evolution of this virus in tremendous detail to see exactly what was changing,” says Jesse Bloom, a viral evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. With millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hand, researchers can now go back and study them to understand the constraints on the virus’s evolution. “That’s something we’ve never been able to do before,” says Hodcroft.\n\nViruses change more than expected\n\nBecause no one had ever studied SARS-CoV-2 before, scientists came with their own assumptions about how it would adapt. Many were guided by experiences with another RNA virus that causes respiratory infections: influenza. “We just didn’t have much information about other respiratory viruses that could cause pandemics,” says Hodcroft.\n\nInfluenza spreads mainly through the acquisition of mutations that allow it to evade people’s immunity. Because no one had ever been infected with SARS-CoV-2 before 2019, many scientists didn’t expect to see much viral change until after there was substantial pressure placed on it by people’s immune systems, either through infections or better yet, vaccination.\n\nThe emergence of faster-transmitting, deadlier variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as Alpha and Delta, obliterated some early assumptions. Even by early 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had picked up a single amino-acid change that substantially boosted its spread. Many others would follow.\n\nWhat sparked the COVID pandemic? Mounting evidence points to raccoon dogs\n\n“What I got wrong and didn’t anticipate was quite how much it would change phenotypically,” says Holmes. “You saw this amazing acceleration in transmissibility and virulence.” This suggested that SARS-CoV-2 wasn’t especially well adapted to spreading between people when it emerged in Wuhan, a city of millions. It could very well have fizzled out in a less densely populated setting, he adds.\n\nHolmes wonders, also, whether the breakneck pace of observed change was merely a product of how closely SARS-CoV-2 was tracked. Would researchers see the same rate if they watched the emergence of an influenza strain that was new to the population, at the same resolution? That remains to be determined.\n\nThe initial giant leaps that SARS-CoV-2 took came with one saving grace: they didn’t drastically affect the protective immunity delivered by vaccines and previous infections. But that changed with the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021, which was laden with changes to its ‘spike’ protein that helped it to dodge antibody responses (the spike protein allows the virus to enter host cells). Scientists such as Bloom have been taken aback at how rapidly these changes appeared in successive post-Omicron variants.\n\nHow months-long COVID infections could seed dangerous new variants\n\nAnd that wasn’t even the most surprising aspect of Omicron, says Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Shortly after the variant emerged, his team1 and others noticed that, unlike previous SARS-CoV-2 variants such as Delta that favoured the lower-airway cells of the lung, Omicron preferred to infect the upper airways. “To document that a virus shifted its biological behaviour during the course of a pandemic was unprecedented,” says Gupta.\n\nOmicron’s preference for upper airways probably contributed to its clinical mildness — its relatively low virulence — compared with previous iterations. But that shift is hard to disentangle from the fact that Omicron struck after much of the world had begun to establish some immunity, says Bloom, and there is evidence2 that Omicron was just as nasty as the version of SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in Wuhan.\n\nAnd although Omicron and its offshoots were milder than Alpha, Beta and Delta, those had all proved more virulent than the lineage they replaced, toppling the idea that the virus would evolve to be less deadly. “The idea that there’s some law of nature that says that a virus is going to rapidly lose its virulence when it jumps into a new host is incorrect,” Bloom says. It’s an idea that never had much buy-in with virologists anyway.\n\nOne of Sato’s big fears is that a drastically different SARS-CoV-2 variant will emerge and overcome the immunity that stops most people becoming severely ill. He worries that the result could be disastrous.\n\nChronic cases could reveal insights\n\nBefore Gupta turned his attention to SARS-CoV-2, his focus was HIV, which is ordinarily a lifelong infection. As a clinician, he had treated the second person ever cured of HIV through a blood stem-cell transplant. But his research group studied how antiretroviral drug resistance evolves over the course of months and years in people.\n\nMost scientists presumed that, unlike HIV or other long-term infections, respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 were acute, and those who survived their infections cleared the virus in a matter of days. Longer-term infections occur in influenza, but they seem to be an evolutionary dead end. The virus adapts to survive in the host, not to spread to others.\n\nScientists in New Delhi prepare coronavirus samples for sequencing.Credit: T. Narayan/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nBut in late 2020, Gupta characterized a 102-day SARS-CoV-2 infection in a man in his 70s with a compromised immune system. The infection was ultimately fatal3. In the man’s body, the virus developed a high number of spike-protein changes. Many of these would also be observed in worrying variants, including the Alpha variant that sent case counts rocketing and prompted another wave of lockdowns in late 2020 and early 2021.\n\nThe man’s case didn’t give rise to any widespread variant, but it gave Gupta, with his HIV evolution background, the idea that chronic infections could be a source of the drastic evolutionary leaps that characterized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. “We didn’t have the preconceptions the flu field had of what respiratory viruses do,” he says.\n\nAlex Sigal, a virologist at the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, South Africa, had a similar idea when another variant, called Beta, was identified in his country. South Africa has a high rate of HIV infections — many of which go untreated — and Sigal wondered whether it was more than a coincidence that Beta seemed to have emerged where there were high numbers of people who were immunocompromised.",

Credit: NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team (STSCI/AURA)/SPL\n\nAstronomers have announced the discovery of 128 new moons orbiting Saturn, raising questions about why the planet has such a huge number of satellites. Investigating this phenomenon could provide us with crucial knowledge about the evolution of the Solar System.\n\nThe discoveries bring Saturn’s total moon count to 274, nearly triple Jupiter’s and more than the total number of known moons around the other planets.\n\n“Saturn is the king of the moons,” says Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, whose observations provided a starting point for the finding.\n\nThe discovery is “fascinating”, says Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada, who also contributed observations that led to the finding but did not contribute to the forthcoming paper about them. “It just shows how much is out there.”\n\nMany moons\n\nThe moons, which were officially recognized this week by the International Astronomical Union, will be described in a paper led by astronomer Edward Ashton at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taipei, Taiwan. The study will be published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. Unlike our own Moon, which is 3,475 kilometres wide, these small rocks are just a few kilometres across in size. They swing around Saturn in chaotic, distant orbits, often moving in reverse relative to the planet’s major moons, such as Titan and Rhea.\n\nThe moon that made Saturn a pushover\n\nMost of the moons are new discoveries, but observations by Sheppard two decades ago hinted at their existence. From 2004 to 2007, he used the 8.2-metre Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii to examine patches of space near Saturn and detected faint light from these small, irregular moons. However, many couldn’t be confirmed as moons because their orbits could not be definitively tracked.\n\nAshton was able to revisit those findings thanks to advancements in discovery techniques and the allocation of more telescope time. From 2019 to 2021, using the 3.6-metre Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Ashton confirmed 62 new moons of Saturn by stitching together the telescope’s images to more easily see the faint moons. In 2023, he had more time on the telescope, leading to the latest 128-moon haul.\n\nSaturn’s movements also helped: from our perspective on Earth, the planet has moved out of alignment with the dense star field near the centre of the Milky Way, reducing the number of background stars in our line of sight that could masquerade as moons.\n\nClusters of satellites",

          "authors": "Davide Castelvecchi",
          "abstract": "A ‘quantum processor’ has solved a physics problem on the behaviour of magnetism in certain solids that would take the largest conventional supercomputers hundreds of thousands of years to calculate. The result is the latest claim of a machine showing ‘quantum advantage’ over classical computers.\n\nAlthough Google, headquartered in Mountain View, California, and others have claimed to have achieved quantum advantage — most recently with the Sycamore chip that Google unveiled in December — researchers at D-Wave, a company in Palo Alto, California, say that their result, published in Science1, is the first that solves an actual physics question. “We believe it’s the first time anyone has done it on a problem of scientific interest,” says D-Wave physicist Andrew King.\n\nThe team did great work — but classical computing should not be counted out quite yet, says Miles Stoudenmire, a researcher at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Quantum Physics in New York City. “We’re still in the race.”\n\nThe result also validates the approach that the company has taken to quantum computing, King says. Rather than building a ‘universal’ quantum computer — one that could run any quantum algorithm — D-Wave has limited its approach to performing certain calculations, which is easier to scale.\n\nAn early pioneer in the quantum field, D-Wave machines have long led the industry in terms of number of qubits, the quantum equivalent of classical bits of information. The latest processor has thousands of qubits. “These are results of 25 years of hardware development and research at D-Wave,” says Mohammad Amin, a physicist at the company.\n\nMagnetic problem\n\nThe problem solved by D-Wave concerns the theory of magnetism, a large field of theoretical physics. The electron spins of each atom act like magnetic needles, and the way they orient themselves inside a solid in response to their neighbours’ orientations has long provided a prototype for the study of complex systems.\n\nIn a typical permanent magnet, the spins all align in the same direction. But in general materials, neighbouring spins have conflicting influences on each other, and stable arrangements either don’t exist or are extremely difficult to predict. Quantum effects add complications.\n\nKing, Amin and their collaborators at D-Wave and several academic laboratories used the latest D-Wave machine, called Advantage2, to simulate the arrangements of spins in several 3D crystal structures. They studied a specific problem in which the temperature of the material starts at absolute zero, and quantum fluctuations let it transition from one state to another. They estimate that their machine achieved the result exponentially faster than any classical calculation could.\n\nAdvantage claims challenged\n\nThe result follows several claims of quantum advantage. Google made the first claim of a quantum advantage in a paper that caused a sensation in 20192. It used a fully programmable, or universal, quantum computer with superconducting qubits to perform a calculation that was designed to test for quantum advantage but had no practical application. Soon, IBM, headquartered in Armonk, New York, and other companies showed that by improving classical techniques, they could still run the same calculations on ordinary computers.\n\nIBM then achieved3a quantum advantage on a useful application in 2023. But last year, that claim suffered a similar fate to Google’s4: Stoudenmire and his collaborators showed their classical algorithms could solve the problem as quickly.",

          "abstract": "In March last year, researchers found that among a group of nearly 300 participants, people who had higher concentrations of plastics in deposits of fat in their arteries (arterial plaques) were more likely to experience heart attacks or strokes, and more likely to die as a result, than those in whom plastics were not detected1. Since it was published, the New England Journal of Medicine study has been mentioned more than 6,600 times on social media and more than 800 times in news articles and blogs.\n\nThe issue of whether plastics are entering human tissues and what impacts they might have on health is understandably of great interest to scientists, industry and society. Indeed, for the past few years there have been news stories almost every month about peer-reviewed articles that have reported findings of plastic particles in all sorts of human tissues and bodily fluids — including the lungs, heart, penis, placenta and breast milk. And in multiple countries, policymakers are being urged to implement measures to limit people’s exposure to nanoplastics and microplastics.\n\nA plastics treaty is urgently needed, but getting it right will take time\n\nMany of the studies conducted so far, however, rely on small sample sizes (typically 20–50 samples) and lack appropriate controls. Modern laboratories are themselves hotspots of nanoplastic and microplastic pollution, and the approaches that are being used to detect plastics make it hard to rule out the possibility of contamination, or prove definitively that plastics are in a sample. Also, many findings are not biologically plausible based on what is known — mainly from nanomedicine — about the movement of tiny particles within the human body.\n\nFor an emerging area of research, such problems are unsurprising. But without more rigorous standards, transparency and collaboration — among researchers, policymakers and industrial stakeholders — a cycle of misinformation and ineffective regulation could undermine efforts to protect both human health and the environment.\n\nPlastic, plastic everywhere\n\nSince the term ‘microplastic’ — used to describe plastic particles less than five millimetres long — was introduced in 2004, microplastics have been found not just in the oceans but also in lakes and rivers, soils, food and air. In a study published last year, researchers estimated that people in Denmark inhale about 3,400 microplastic particles every day when indoors2.\n\nAssessing how these tiny particles behave in the human body and whether they accumulate over time requires first identifying and quantifying plastics in blood and tissue samples. To do this, many researchers use pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GCMS), in which high temperatures (around 600–700 °C) break down plastics into smaller organic molecules. The resulting mix of molecules and the amount of each one provides a ‘signature’ that researchers can use to establish whether a certain plastic was in the original sample.\n\nBut there are limitations with this approach.\n\nPolyethylene is often the most common plastic that is found in human tissues.Credit: Leonard Ortiz/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty\n\nEven after samples have been treated, for instance with enzymes, to remove biological material, some residue can remain. And some compounds that indicate the presence of plastics can be produced when non-plastic substances are pyrolysed. Fatty acids, such as triglycerides, can break down into the same compounds as polyethylene3. Polyethylene is often the most commonly reported plastic in human-tissue studies using Py-GCMS4–6, although this is not the case for all studies that have used this method7,8.\n\nLikewise, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which is often used in combination with scanning electron microscopy, can reveal the presence of carbon-based molecules. But it identifies only what elements are present in a sample, not molecular structures — meaning that it can only suggest the presence of plastics.\n\nAnother issue with some of the data generated so far is that they don’t make sense biologically.\n\nIn a study9 published last month, researchers examined 91 brains from autopsied bodies and found that plastics made up 0.65% of the brain on average. That’s equivalent to saying that each person had around 4.5 polyethylene bottle caps’ worth of plastic in their brain.\n\nOther studies have reported the presence of large plastic particles, measuring up to 3 mm in length, in human blood samples10. One study that found microplastic particles 5.5–26.4 micrometres in size and synthetic fibres 19–24.5 µm in length in brain tissue, suggested that microplastics that are inhaled through the nose can travel along nerves to the olfactory bulb in the brain11.\n\nHow to stop plastic pollution: three strategies that actually work\n\nYet, previous research suggests that particles bigger than 1 µm are probably too large to pass through the lung’s air–blood barrier, and any particle bigger than 10 µm is probably too large to pass through the gut–blood barrier12,13.\n\nWithout convincing mechanistic explanations of how larger particles might bypass biological barriers, it is difficult to accept conclusions that particles larger than 10 µm have entered human tissue.\n\nEven when, say, through the use of multiple approaches, it is clear that plastics are present in a sample, there is a high possibility that the sample could have been contaminated with nanoplastics or microplastics at each stage of the research — from sampling and transportation to storage, processing and analysis. Human-tissue samples are often collected in clinical settings in which plastics are commonly used, and intravenous infusion equipment that is used to deliver medication can shed microplastics into a person’s bloodstream. Also, because different researchers use different sampling strategies, materials and analytical approaches, it is hard to compare results across studies. Some laboratories use stainless-steel chambers, for instance, and try to minimize plastic contamination; others use plastic equipment to process their samples.",

          "authors": "Tessa Montague, Shai Berman",
          "abstract": "Shai Berman and Tessa Montague need to carry their teaching materials in clear prison-issue bags when they help inmates to earn undergraduate degrees.Credit: Thomas Barlow\n\nFifty minutes north of Manhattan by train lies Sing Sing Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison for men. Sing Sing is one of the oldest and most notorious prisons in the United States. Its massive stone blocks and barbed-wire fences sit on a hill overlooking the Hudson Valley. Beyond its heavy metal gates is a group of students, largely invisible to the rest of the country, earning their undergraduate degrees. Every Monday afternoon, the two of us take the train, pass through those gates, and spend two hours teaching an “introduction to neuroscience” class to those students.\n\nTeaching in a prison comes with many challenges, but it has been one of the highlights of our professional careers. Here we describe our experience as postdoctoral fellows at New York City’s Columbia University providing instruction at Sing Sing, in partnership with Hudson Link, a non-profit organization that offers university programmes in various prisons in New York state, and Columbia’s Center for Justice, an organization that seeks to change how justice is approached through education, policy and research.\n\nThe US prison system and education\n\nThe United States is a nation of mass incarceration. There are some 1.9 million people behind bars in the country, and 14% of adults have an immediate family member who has been incarcerated for at least a year. This crisis has a disproportionate impact on low-income people, particularly in Black and Latino communities, which are affected by systemic racism and inequalities that lead to higher rates of arrest and conviction, and harsher sentences. Hudson Link and other organizations across the country are trying to disrupt the cycle and impact of incarceration in communities by providing higher-education opportunities to incarcerated individuals. Statistically speaking, education has a massive impact. In the United States, 67% of formerly incarcerated people return to prison within three years of their release, whereas less than 2% of Hudson Link graduates do.\n\nWe teach our course through Columbia University’s Prison Education Program. Official credits from this programme count towards associate’s and bachelor’s degrees. Diplomas awarded inside prison are exactly the same as those awarded outside. Thus, it is our job as instructors to provide the same quality and level of instruction to our students while working within the restrictions of the prison setting.\n\nEntering prison\n\nTo enter Sing Sing each week, we check our phones into a depot and then wait in front of the heavy gate to be called for security screening. Above us, an ornate sign reads “Through these doors pass some of the finest correctional professionals in the world”. Security is similar to that at an airport, except that our attire is inspected: only loose, professional clothing can be worn; no bold jewellery is permitted, nor anything green, which could be confused for the prison uniforms. Our possessions must be carried in prison-issue clear bags so that the contents can be inspected for contraband. We receive an ultraviolet stamp on our hand, which will be checked when we exit the prison. We then proceed to the school building in a minivan, sparing us a three-minute walk. We are assured that every step in this process is a precaution shaped by hard-learnt lessons.\n\nIn the classroom\n\nPreparation begins long before we enter the classroom. We are not allowed to take any technology into the prison. This is a challenge both for the students, who cannot use Google or ChatGPT, and for us, because we’ve grown accustomed to teaching with presentations and video demonstrations (how can you communicate flashing neurons with chalk?).\n\nFurthermore, all materials have to be submitted months in advance to be approved by prison leadership. To address these constraints, we created a custom textbook for the class, in which each chapter is a different lesson (such as the motor system, emotion and the use of animal models), and there is enough information for students to learn the material even if a class is cancelled or cut short (which they frequently are). Once we’re in the classroom, we teach everything using a blackboard, and then hand out homework, to be collected the following week. We have no means of communicating with students outside class, so the cycle of feedback is slow: by the time they receive feedback, they have already submitted another assignment. And learning about the brain tends to raise more questions than it answers — we are constantly trying to strike a balance between sticking to the planned material and going on an interesting side quest brought about by a student’s question.\n\nThe students\n\nWe have taught at both Sing Sing and Taconic Correctional Facility (a medium-security women’s prison), and the students are the best we’ve ever worked with. Students range in age from early 20s to late 60s, and their sentences probably range from less than 5 years to more than 50. One might try to guess (or actively find out) what the circumstances were that led to these long sentences. However, to us it ultimately doesn’t matter: we have found every student to be warm, laser focused and curious. There are no distractions from phones or laptops — a teacher’s dream. One of the main challenges is how to teach an intense scientific course to students with diverse educational backgrounds and lived experiences. We haven’t solved the problem, but we create homework sets that partly test the knowledge obtained in class, and partly provide the students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge and creativity to the design of experiments.",

Beyond just listing research outputs, they give us the opportunity to explain the scope and mission of our work, offer prospective lab members a sense of what the culture is like and showcase the career paths of former members. These websites are also used by journals to identify potential reviewers, authors and conference speakers.\n\nIn 2023, I began my career as a biologist at Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland. After a year of acclimatizing to my new role and the courses I would be teaching, I started up my research lab. We study the roles of microRNAs in regulating cell differentiation, development and disease.\n\nBecause I work at a mainly undergraduate institution, all of the researchers in my lab are full-time students. Although this presents unique challenges, it is an incredibly rewarding opportunity: I get to mentor and guide aspiring scientists at the beginning of their careers. While I was building my lab’s website, I sought to not only publicize our research, but also create a resource for students and trainees both inside and outside the lab.\n\nThere are many wonderful resources with tips and examples for crafting a website that creates a great first impression. Below are a few examples of resources I have built into my lab’s website. Although these can no doubt be found elsewhere, I’ve curated those that are most relevant to our research and the career stage of our lab members.\n\nFunding\n\nFinding a funding agency or opportunity that aligns with your research can be challenging, especially for early-career researchers. To make this process easier, I’ve compiled a list of relevant funding sources that students and trainees can apply for. Because the members of my lab are fee-paying students, the opportunities on the list also include sources of financial aid.\n\nI also plan to include the names of lab members who have successfully applied for specific opportunities, so future lab members can reach out to them directly for advice.\n\nConferences\n\nScientific conferences are perhaps as numerous as funding opportunities. However, just as with funding, not every conference is a good fit for your field or career interests.\n\nI’ve compiled a list of conferences that I have attended or heard about that I feel the members of my lab would find valuable. The list includes relevant funding opportunities, such as travel awards. These conferences might focus on a topic that our research is aligned with, or be designed for the professional development of trainees at earlier career stages.\n\nProfessional societies\n\nProfessional societies are an incredible way to network and form relationships with people with similar scientific and career interests. Over time, I have developed a sense of which societies are most aligned with the goals and interests of my lab.\n\nA research building at Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland.Credit: Mount St. Mary’s University\n\nFor example, our work studying RNA biology, with a previous focus in neuroscience, fits well with the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB) in Rockville, Maryland; the RNA Society in Raleigh, North Carolina; and the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) in Washington DC, which have been incredibly useful for my own training and professional development. Compiling a list of these societies helps my current and future lab members know how to get involved with the broader scientific community outside the lab.\n\nIf local branches exist for these professional societies (such as the student chapter of ASBMB on our campus and the DC Metro Area chapter of SfN), I include their information, because this can be a great way for students and trainees to gain leadership experience.\n\nEducation and professional-development resources\n\nOver the course of my career, I have discovered many useful professional-development resources. Rather than trying to remember each one, or saving them on my own computer where nobody else can access them, I have added my favourite resources and advice to the website. Because computational biology is a large component of our lab’s work, many of the resources are related to data analysis and programming languages, such as free courses and textbooks. I also include my own examples, such as my CV, posters or slide decks from past talks, and educational materials (including a podcast).",

But unlike those western Maghreb hunter-gatherers — whose ancestry was largely replaced by European farmers probably arriving through the Strait of Gibraltar — local ancestry persisted in Tunisia and Algeria long after the arrival of farmers from Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThis fits with evidence that people in the eastern Maghreb continued to hunt local animals such as land snails and forage wild plants, even while farming imported sheep, goats and cattle. Agriculture didn’t take off in the region until much later. Maybe, says Reich, the resilience of local ancestry is related to resistance to farming practices.\n\nThe genome of a man from a Tunisian site called Djebba held a major surprise: about 6% of his DNA could be traced back to European hunter-gatherers. The researchers estimate that his Maghrebi ancestors mixed with European hunter-gatherers around 8,500 years ago. There are weaker signs of these encounters in a woman from the site.\n\nCanoe voyages",

The device is used as a stopgap for people with heart failure who are waiting for a donor heart, and previous recipients of this type of artificial heart had remained in US hospitals while it was in place.\n\nThe man lived with the device for more than three months until he underwent surgery to receive a donated human heart. The man is recovering well, according to a statement from St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney in Australia, where the operations were conducted.\n\nThe Australian is the sixth person globally to receive the device, known as BiVACOR, but the first to live with it for more than a month.\n\n“This is certainly an important development in the field,” says Julian Smith, a cardiac surgeon at the Victorian Heart Institute at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n“It is incredibly innovative,” says Sarah Aitken, a vascular surgeon at the University of Sydney, but she adds that there are still many unanswered questions about the level of function that people with it can achieve and the ultimate cost of the device. “This kind of research is really challenging to do because it is very expensive” and the surgery involved is very high-risk, says Aitken.\n\nThe latest success will help researchers to understand how people cope with this device in the real world, says Joseph Rogers, a heart-failure cardiologist and president of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. “They weren’t being constantly monitored by medical teams,” says Rogers, who led the first trial of the device in the United States last year.\n\nIn all cases, the BiVACOR was used as a temporary measure until a donor heart became available. Some cardiologists say that it could become a permanent option for people not eligible for transplants because of their age or other health conditions, although the idea still needs to be tested in trials. In the United States, close to 7 million adults live with heart failure, but only about 4,500 heart transplants were performed in 2023, in part because of a shortage of donors.\n\nSuspended rotor\n\nBiVACOR was invented by biomedical engineer Daniel Timms, who founded a company named after the device, with offices in Huntington Beach, California, and Southport, Australia.\n\nThe device is a total heart replacement and works as a continuous pump in which a magnetically suspended rotor propels blood in regular pulses throughout the body. A cord tunnelled under the skin connects the device to an external, portable controller that runs on batteries by day and can be plugged into the mains at night.\n\nMany mechanical heart devices support the left side of the heart, and typically work by pooling blood in a sack, which flexes some 35 million times a year to pump blood. But these devices have many parts and often fail. BiVACOR, which only has one moving part, will in theory experience fewer problems of mechanical wear, says Rogers.\n\nUS trials",

          "authors": "Katherine Bourzac",
          "abstract": "Researchers have found a way of consistently making sheets of metal that are just atoms thick.Credit: Getty\n\nTaking inspiration from ancient techniques, researchers have forged relatively large sheets of metal that are just atoms thick, enabling them to more readily study the weird properties of these materials in the laboratory. The method can be applied to any metal with a low melting point, and the team has used it to make 2D sheets of bismuth, gallium, indium, lead and tin. The feat was reported today in Nature1.\n\nJavier Sanchez-Yamagishi, a physicist who studies 2D materials at the University of California, Irvine, likens the accomplishment to the creation of graphene, an atomically thin layer of carbon. “This is just a starting point,” he says. “Now, other people can step in and start studying” the metal sheets’ properties.\n\nThe tiniest metal forge\n\nThe properties of 2D materials are very different from those of chunks of material with the same chemical formula. For example, graphene is mechanically tougher and more conductive of heat and electricity than is the graphite in pencil tips. Since the first studies of graphene, in 20042, researchers have made many atomically thin materials. However, most of them, including graphene, are generated by peeling sheets from layered crystalline materials. “Like a book, you can pick a single page up and make a 2D sheet,” says Guangyu Zhang, who studies nanomaterials at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.\n\nMeet ‘goldene’: this gilded cousin of graphene is also one atom thick\n\nMetals don’t have this peelable layered structure, and most have been unstable when scientists have tried to shape them into ultrathin sheets. However, researchers have created small swathes of atoms-thick metals. Last year, for instance, a team reported a method3that produces flakes of gold, called ‘goldene’, that are hundreds of nanometres wide. Other methods involve depositing vaporized metal atoms onto a surface to form thin sheets4. But studying these materials has been challenging because metal atoms bind tightly to whatever they are placed on, making it difficult to isolate their properties from those of the surface material. Two-dimensional metal sheets are also unstable: metal atoms tend to clump into nanoparticles, and when exposed to air, the ultrathin sheets oxidize, so researchers have only been able to study them inside vacuum chambers using a limited set of techniques.\n\nZhang was inspired to develop the latest technique by a video of copper forging. To make sheets of copper, the metal is heated in a furnace, then hammered and squeezed on a large anvil.\n\nIt took his team seven years to adapt the concept to work at the nanoscale. The biggest challenge was finding a sufficiently flat anvil to squeeze the metal layers. The researchers eventually selected sapphire, which is very hard, and they coated it in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which is atomically flat.\n\nSource: Adapted from Figure 1a of ref. 1.\n\nTo make an ultrathin metal sheet, the team heated a droplet of the metal between two sapphire anvils, which were pressed together as the metal cooled (see ‘Putting the squeeze on’). Because MoS2 interacts more strongly with metal than with sapphire, the researchers could pry the resulting sandwich of MoS2–metal–MoS2 sheets out of the apparatus like a panini from a press.",

          "abstract": "Taxonomic incommensurability denotes the difficulty in comparing scientific theories due to different uses of concepts and operationalizations. To tackle this problem in psychology, here we use language models to obtain semantic embeddings representing psychometric items, scales and construct labels in a vector space. This approach allows us to analyse different datasets (for example, the International Personality Item Pool) spanning thousands of items and hundreds of scales and constructs and show that embeddings can be used to predict empirical relations between measures, automatically detect taxonomic fallacies and suggest more parsimonious taxonomies. These findings suggest that semantic embeddings constitute a powerful tool for tackling taxonomic incommensurability in the psychological sciences.",

          "abstract": "Sleep is thought to play a critical role in the retention of memory for past experiences (episodic memory), reducing the rate of forgetting compared with wakefulness. Yet it remains unclear whether and how sleep actively transforms the way we remember multidimensional real-world experiences, and how such memory transformation unfolds over the days, months and years that follow. In an exception to the law of forgetting, we show that sleep actively and selectively improves the accuracy of memory for a one-time, real-world experience (an art tour)—specifically boosting memory for the order of tour items (sequential associations) versus perceptual details from the tour (featural associations). This above-baseline boost in sequence memory was not evident after a matched period of wakefulness. Moreover, the preferential retention of sequence relative to featural memory observed after a night’s sleep grew over time up to 1 year post-encoding. Finally, overnight polysomnography showed that sleep-related memory enhancement was associated with the duration and neurophysiological hallmarks of slow-wave sleep previously linked to sequential neural replay, particularly spindle–slow wave coupling. These results suggest that sleep serves a crucial and selective role in enhancing sequential organization in our memory for past events at the expense of perceptual details, linking sleep-related neural mechanisms to the days-to-years-long transformation of memory for complex real-life experiences.",

Here, by using online surveys, laboratory cognitive tasks and natural language processing in diverse modern cultures across the world (n = 20,427) and ancient cultures spanning 3,000 years of history, we examined universality and cultural variability in the ways that people conceptualize relationships. We discovered a universal representational space for relationship concepts, comprising five principal dimensions (formality, activeness, valence, exchange and equality) and three core categories (hostile, public and private relationships).

However, we also discuss how some of the factors that enable prosocial behaviour can also empower malicious actors—as well as the challenge of creating prosocial behaviour that is sustainable and impactful offline. We then propose a research agenda to help scholars, policymakers and corporate leaders to identify the causal factors that shape prosocial behaviour on social media. This agenda focuses on (1) the size and shape of social networks, (2) platform affordances, (3) social norms and (4) how prosocial behaviour can be embedded within existing and future business models of social media.",

Here we report on our discoveries at Tinshemet Cave, Israel. The site yielded articulated Homo remains in association with rich assemblages of ochre, fauna and stone tools dated to ~100 ka. Viewed from the perspective of other key regional sites of this period, our findings indicate consolidation of a uniform behavioural set in the Levantine mid-MP, consisting of similar lithic technology, an increased reliance on large-game hunting and a range of socially elaborated behaviours, comprising intentional human burial and the use of ochre in burial contexts. We suggest that the development of this behavioural uniformity is due to intensified inter-population interactions and admixture between Homo groups ~130–80 ka.",

Here we investigate hippocampal theta oscillations during real-world and imagined navigation using motion capture and intracranial electroencephalographic recordings from individuals with chronically implanted medial temporal lobe electrodes. Our results revealed intermittent theta dynamics, particularly within the hippocampus, encoding spatial information and partitioning navigational routes into linear segments during real-world navigation. During imagined navigation, theta dynamics exhibited similar patterns despite the absence of external cues. A statistical model successfully reconstructed real-world and imagined positions, providing insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human navigation and imagination, with implications for understanding memory in real-world settings.",

          "abstract": "Despite legal protections, discrimination based on sexual orientation remains difficult to detect and measure in labor markets. We present evidence from a field experiment ( N = 1,128) conducted in Australia on a major gig economy platform that allows users to outsource everyday tasks. By manipulating both the sexual orientation of job posters (gay vs. straight male) and physical proximity requirements of tasks (inside vs. outside the home), we identify discrimination against gay profiles and demonstrate a specific mechanism for its emergence: physical proximity. Gay profiles received fewer offers and less engagement, and attracted workers with significantly lower quality ratings, but only for tasks requiring close physical proximity. Additional exploratory analysis further suggests that the results are driven by an anti-gay bias rather than an anti-men or pro-women bias and that discrimination is stronger for tasks with a higher degree of interaction between worker and job poster. Our findings demonstrate how digital labor platforms can perpetuate traditional forms of discrimination, while shedding light on physical proximity as one important mechanism. These results have important implications for users of the gig economy, a sector of increasing importance due to its rapid growth and comparatively lax regulatory frameworks.",

          "abstract": "Autocratic governments around the world use clandestine propaganda campaigns to influence the media. We document a decade-long trend in China toward the planting of government-authored articles in party and commercial newspapers. To examine this phenomenon, we develop an approach to identifying scripted propaganda—the coerced reprinting of lightly adapted government-authored articles in newspapers—that leverages the footprints left by the government when making media interventions. We show that in China, scripted propaganda is a daily phenomenon—on 90% of days from 2012 to 2022, the vast majority of party newspapers include at least some scripted propaganda at the direction of a central directive. On particular sensitive days, the amount of scripted propaganda can spike to 30% of the articles appearing in major newspapers. We show that scripted propaganda has strengthened under President Xi Jinping. In the last decade, the front page of party newspapers has evolved from 5% scripted articles to approximately 20% scripted. This government-authored content throughout the paper is increasingly homogeneous—fewer and fewer adaptations are done by individual newspapers. In contrast to popular speculation, we show that scripted content is not only on ideological topics (although it is increasingly ideological) and is also very prevalent in commercial papers. Using a case study of domestic coverage of COVID-19, we demonstrate how the regime uses scripting to shape, constrain, and delay information during crises. Our findings reveal the wide-ranging influence of government-authored propaganda in China’s media ecosystem.",

          "authors": "Ana Arjona, Mario Chacón, Laura García-Montoya",
          "abstract": "Although a growing literature has investigated the effects of various types of civil war violence on political behavior, no study has examined the impact of assassinations targeting politicians. This is a critical omission, as violence against local politicians is prevalent across civil war contexts and may be the most consequential form of violence for political participation by affecting both candidate supply and voter demand. Using an original dataset of nearly 2,000 killings of Colombian local politicians between 1980 and 2023, we estimate the impact of this violence on voter turnout. Taking municipalities where assassination attempts failed as a comparison group, we find that political assassinations significantly decrease voter turnout in both the short and medium terms, with effects persisting in various elections even after the signing of a peace agreement. These findings contrast with many studies suggesting that other forms of civil war violence enhance political participation during the postconflict period or after a truce or peace agreement. Our results suggest that different forms of violence can have distinct effects on political behavior, underscoring the need to theorize how the targeting, nature, and context of violence condition its effects. This echoes calls for more nuanced studies on the behavioral impacts of violence. Our findings also have implications for understanding democracy amid rising violence against political leaders in countries affected by organized crime, such as Mexico and Brazil; polarized contexts, such as the United States; and weakly institutionalized democracies, such as South Africa, Indonesia, and the Philippines.",

In the United States, the tendency to center men in concepts of people develops across middle childhood, yet the specific mechanisms that contribute to it remain unknown. Here, we investigate one subtle but potentially powerful social mechanism: the category labels that parents use to describe boys/men and girls/women in conversations with their children. Across two studies ( N = 822 parent–child dyads, predominantly from the United States), parents used gender-neutral labels like “kid” or “person” more often to describe boys/men than girls/women and, conversely, used gender-specific labels (e.g., “girl”) more often to describe girls/women than boys/men. These patterns emerged when parents were shown gender-stereotypical girls/women and boys/men (e.g., a girl painting her nails, a boy digging for worms); when parents viewed counterstereotypical stimuli (e.g., a boy painting his nails, a girl digging for worms), the patterns reversed. Our findings illuminate parents’ category label usage as a critical social mechanism that may undergird the development of a male default in a US cultural context, informing efforts to intervene on this process.",

Poverty Alleviation Resettlement (PAR) stands out as one of the few government-led resettlement programs designed to alleviate poverty, offering comprehensive follow-up support for quality of life and employment after relocation. Our study uncovered empirical evidence of the PAR program’s impact on forest quality. Through a multiperiod difference-in-differences analysis of remote sensing and household survey data, we found that the PAR program significantly curbed deforestation in the participating counties and reduced forest-clearing activities among the resettled households, even those relocating to rural villages. Mechanism analysis revealed that the program discouraged deforestation by enhancing market accessibility, fostering nonfarm employment opportunities, and elevating income levels. The study underscores that altering livelihood strategies and lifestyles is essential for resettlement programs to effectively mitigate ecological degradation.",

          "abstract": "Central emotion theories assume that during threatening and dangerous events the human face signals a prototypical, distinct, and universally recognized expression of fear which can be accurately decoded by conspecific perceivers. Due to the importance of fear expressions, an unusually large body of research has been dedicated to exploring their evolutionary origins, neurobiological mechanisms, and clinical significance. However, these studies typically utilize highly recognizable posed actor portrayals presumed to closely resemble the diagnostic physical appearance of real-life fearful faces. Here, we challenge this diagnosticity assumption. Following context-dependent frameworks (Barrett, 2017), we hypothesized that extrafacial context (e.g., situational information, body posture, etc.) plays a far greater role in fear communication than the signal of the isolated face. In 12 preregistered experiments (N = 4,180), we examined the perception of authentic, real-life videos documenting a diverse range of intense fear-inducing situations (e.g., height jumping, physical attacks, exposure to phobia triggers). Participants viewed the face alone, the context with no face, or the full video while various response methods of emotion perception were tested (forced choice, open-ended, multiple emotion scales, valence-arousal ratings). Across experiments, videos of the faces alone failed to communicate fear in a reliable manner. In sharp contrast, context with no faces, and faces with context were clearly and robustly perceived as fearful, with medium to large effect sizes. These findings suggest that despite the undisputed importance of perceiving fear reactions, facial expressions alone bear minimal diagnostic value, while context plays a critical role in real-life fear perception.",

          "abstract": "The long-term success of introduced populations depends on both their initial size and ability to compete against existing residents, but it remains unclear how these factors collectively shape colonization dynamics. Here, we investigate how initial population (propagule) size shapes the outcome of community coalescence by systematically mixing eight pairs of in vitro microbial communities at ratios that vary over six orders of magnitude, and we compare our results to neutral ecological theory. Although the composition of the resulting cocultures deviated substantially from neutral expectations, each coculture contained species whose relative abundance depended on propagule size even after ~40 generations of growth. Using a consumer–resource model, we show that this dose-dependent colonization can arise when resident and introduced species have high niche overlap and consume shared resources at similar rates. Strain isolates displayed longer-lasting dose dependence when introduced into diverse communities than in pairwise cocultures, consistent with our model’s prediction that propagule size should have larger, more persistent effects in diverse communities. Our model also successfully predicted that species with similar resource-utilization profiles, as inferred from growth in spent media and untargeted metabolomics, would show stronger dose dependence in pairwise coculture. This work demonstrates that transient, dose-dependent colonization dynamics can emerge from resource competition and exert long-term effects on the outcomes of community coalescence.",

Preclinical evidence suggests that imbalance of neuroimmune proresolving interactions within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) rather than at the site of inflammation plays mechanistic roles in persistent arthritis pain. Here, we inhibited production of proresolving lipid mediators by silencing 12/15-lipoxygenase expression in CX3CR1 + monocyte/macrophages conditional knockout (cKO) mice. In an arthritis model, hind paw mechanical hypersensitivity is exacerbated in male and female cKO mice in association with DRG infiltration of neutrophils, which migrate in response to leukotriene B 4 released by macrophages through 5-lipoxygenase conversion of arachidonic acid provided by neuron-derived vesicles. Neutrophils apoptosis promotes primary macrophage efferocytosis which is defective in cKO macrophages. In wild-type (WT) and cKO mice, intrathecal injection of MerTK activating antibody, attenuates persistent hypersensitivity and polarizes DRG macrophages toward a proresolving phenotype with production of antinociceptive lipoxin A 4 . Thus, we delineate a neuron–macrophage–neutrophil bidirectional circuit that can be exploited to reduce persistent arthritis pain.",

          "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation, pannus formation, and progressive joint destruction. The inflammatory milieu in RA drives endothelial cell activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules, thus facilitating leukocyte infiltration into the synovium. Reelin, a circulating glycoprotein previously implicated in endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment in diseases such as atherosclerosis and multiple sclerosis, has emerged as a potential upstream regulator of these processes. However, its role in RA pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin levels are markedly elevated in the plasma of both RA patients and mouse models of arthritis, with higher concentrations correlating with greater disease severity. Genetic deletion of the Reelin receptor Apoer2 conferred significant protection against serum transfer arthritis (STA), underscoring the relevance of this pathway in disease progression. Furthermore, therapeutic inhibition of Reelin using the CR-50 antibody yielded robust anti-inflammatory effects in multiple preclinical arthritis models, including STA, K/BxN, and collagen-induced arthritis. Notably, CR-50 treatment not only reduced leukocyte infiltration and synovial inflammation but also mitigated pannus formation. Importantly, these benefits were achieved without the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like diclofenac. Our findings position Reelin as a proinflammatory endothelial biomarker and therapeutic target in RA. By modulating endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment, anti-Reelin strategies offer an alternative approach to attenuate synovial inflammation and joint damage. These results provide a compelling rationale for further exploration of Reelin-targeted therapies as alternatives to conventional immunosuppressive treatments in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

          "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) signals to the striatum play critical roles in shaping and sustaining stimulus-reward associations. In primates, however, the dynamics of the DA signals remain unknown since conventional methods are not necessarily appropriate in terms of the spatiotemporal resolution or chemical specificity sufficient for detecting the DA signals. In our study, fiber photometry with a fluorescent DA sensor was employed to identify reward-related DA transients in the monkey striatum. This technique, which directly monitors local DA release, reveals a reward prediction error signal in the anterior putamen originating from midbrain DA neurons. Further, DA transients in the head of the caudate nucleus exhibit a value-based response to reward-predicting stimuli. These signals have been found to arise from two separate groups of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The present results demonstrate that fluorescence DA monitoring is applicable to detect DA signals in the primate striatum for investigating their roles.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic processes involving biomolecules are essential for the function of the cell. Here, we introduce an integrative method for computing models of these processes based on multiple heterogeneous sources of information, including time-resolved experimental data and physical models of dynamic processes. First, for each time point, a set of coarse models of compositional and structural heterogeneity is computed (heterogeneity models). Second, for each heterogeneity model, a set of static integrative structure models is computed (a snapshot model). Finally, these snapshot models are selected and connected into a series of trajectories that optimize the likelihood of both the snapshot models and transitions between them (a trajectory model). The method is demonstrated by application to the assembly process of the human nuclear pore complex in the context of the reforming nuclear envelope during mitotic cell division, based on live-cell correlated electron tomography, bulk fluorescence correlation spectroscopy–calibrated quantitative live imaging, and a structural model of the fully assembled nuclear pore complex. Modeling of the assembly process improves the model precision over static integrative structure modeling alone. The method is applicable to a wide range of time-dependent systems in cell biology and is available to the broader scientific community through an implementation in the open source Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) software.",

          "abstract": "While vegetation brings positive benefits for climate mitigation and adaptation, the impact of ongoing global greening remains controversial due to its uncertain effects on hydrological cycle. Here, we quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation dynamics on global water availability by proposing a comprehensive framework to quantify the terrestrial water sink and source scores associated with vegetation dynamics. These scores serve as indicators of whether large alterations in water resources have occurred in the lands due to either the greening or degradation of surface vegetation. We use multisource datasets from climate model projections, remote sensing, and local measurements to examine the impact of vegetation dynamics on water availability over the periods of 1982 to 2019 and 2015 to 2100. During historical observation periods, regions such as India and northern China experienced large depletion of water resources as a result of vegetation greening, leading to water scarcity. In the future, a shift is projected for India and northern China, transforming them into regions capable of meeting water demands arising from vegetation greening. This transition is largely attributed to wetting and warming climates. It indicates that trade-off effects between climate and underlying vegetation dynamics may result in strengthening regional hydrological resilience and ensuring the stable status of local water resources. Furthermore, tropical rainforests (except for the Amazon Rainforest) are experiencing greening with minimal impact on local water resources consistently. These insights are valuable for globally identifying optimal locations to implement ecological restoration, facilitating the balance of sustainable water resources and vegetation greening.",

Using high-dimensional CO-detection by indexing, a technology for spatial imaging, this study examines the cellular microenvironment of MS lesions in secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. We analyzed immune, glial, neuronal, and endothelial cell interactions within MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter across two independent cohorts. Our findings show the enrichment of EBV markers, particularly EBNA1 and LMP1, within MS lesions. EBV-positive cells interact closely with reactive astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Image analysis confirmed the presence of EBV-positive staining within neurons and glial cells, suggesting a direct role for EBV in neuronal and glial involvement in MS. Additionally, we observed altered immune cell interactions, including reduced associations with macrophages and memory T cells, and enhanced interactions with glial cells. Disruptions in blood–brain barrier integrity were also noted in regions of the MS brain. These results highlight EBV’s contribution to immune modulation, glial dysfunction, and neuronal damage in MS, particularly in progressive subtypes. The analysis of MS brain tissue suggests potential therapeutic targets, including antivirals and brain penetrant immune modulators, to address EBV’s impact on MS progression.",

          "abstract": "Positive selection at the 2q21.3 enhancer region for lactase gene ( LCT ) expression in Europeans and Africans has long been attributed to selection for lactase persistence (LP), the capacity of adults to digest lactose in milk, presumably because of the benefits associated with milk consumption. While considered a classic example of gene–culture coevolution, recently doubts have been raised about the link between selection at 2q21.3 and LP. Analysis of additional populations could shed further light; here, we demonstrate that a haplotype spanning ~467 kb at the 2q21.3 locus has risen to high frequency in East Asians (~25%) but is absent from Africans and Europeans. This haplotype likely derived from Neanderthals and has been under positive selection in East Asians. The East Asian–specific haplotype is associated with alterations in LCT expression and promoter methylation in certain cell types, similar to what is observed with LP-associated haplotypes in Europeans. Moreover, its frequency is comparable to that of LP in East Asians, suggesting a potential association with LP in East Asians. However, it is highly unlikely that selection in East Asians was related to milk-drinking habits. We find that this haplotype impacts the expression of UBXN4 , DARS1, and DARS1-AS1 in immune cells and is associated with neutrophil and white blood cell counts. Hence, the selection might be linked to certain aspects of immune function. This implies that selection on 2q21.3 has thus either occurred for different reasons in different populations or the selection observed in other populations is also not due to LP.",

Old, large-diameter trees may also be vulnerable to climate-driven mortality events, but past work on large tree populations has been geographically limited. Here, we characterize the population of large-diameter trees from two size categories, 50 to 100 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) (medium) and &gt;100 cm DBH (big), within the United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis data. Although populations of big trees are concentrated along the west coast, populations of medium trees are more evenly distributed across the nation. In the western United States, trees &gt;50 cm DBH comprise ~75% of the total carbon stored in live trees, while in the eastern United States they comprise ~20%. Plot remeasurement data indicate that populations of big trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.49% in the west and 2.9% in the east, and populations of medium trees are increasing at an annual rate of 0.5% in the west and 2.4% in the east. One exception is the Sierra Nevada region, where big trees are declining. Additionally, we observed declines for several individual species. While the overall population trend for large-diameter trees is positive, declines in these species could have localized impacts for the environments in which they occur.",

          "abstract": "Neural crest cells (NCC) comprise a heterogeneous population of cells with variable potency that contribute to nearly every tissue and organ throughout the body. Considered unique to vertebrates, NCC are transiently generated within the dorsolateral region of the neural plate or neural tube during neurulation. Their delamination and migration are crucial for embryo development as NCC differentiation is influenced by their final resting locations. Previous work in avian and aquatic species revealed that NCC delaminate via an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which transforms these progenitor cells from static polarized epithelial cells into migratory mesenchymal cells with fluid front and back polarity. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms facilitating NCC delamination in mammals are poorly understood. Through time-lapse imaging of NCC delamination in mouse embryos, we identified a subset of cells that exit the neuroepithelium as isolated round cells, which then halt for a short period prior to acquiring the mesenchymal migratory morphology classically associated with delaminating NCC. High-magnification imaging and protein localization analyses of the cytoskeleton, together with measurements of pressure and tension of delaminating NCC and neighboring neuroepithelial cells, revealed that round NCC are extruded from the neuroepithelium prior to completion of EMT. Furthermore, cranial NCC are extruded through activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel, PIEZO1. Our results support a model in which cell density, pressure, and tension in the neuroepithelium result in activation of the live cell extrusion pathway and delamination of a subpopulation of NCC in parallel with EMT, which has implications for cell delamination in development and disease.",

          "abstract": "Rapid and accurate detection of DNA from disease-causing pathogens is essential for controlling the spread of infections and administering timely treatments. While traditional molecular diagnostics techniques like PCR are highly sensitive, they include nucleic acid amplification and many need to be performed in centralized laboratories, limiting their utility in point-of-care settings. Recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnostics (CRISPR-Dx) have demonstrated the potential for highly specific molecular detection, but the sensitivity is often constrained by the slow trans-cleavage activity of Cas enzymes, necessitating preamplification of target nucleic acids. In this study, we present a CRISPR-Cascade assay that overcomes these limitations by integrating a positive feedback loop that enables nucleic acid amplification-free detection of pathogenic DNA at atto-molar levels and achieves a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1.3 within just 10 min. The versatility of the assay is demonstrated through the detection of bloodstream infection pathogens, including Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli , and Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) spiked in whole blood samples. Additionally, we introduce a multiplexing OR-function logic gate, further enhancing the potential of the CRISPR-Cascade assay for rapid and accurate diagnostics in clinical settings.

Our strategy yielded multiple nanobody ligands for the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), a prototypical GPCR and important drug target. We found that nanobodies readily act as allosteric modulators, encoding selectivity for both the receptor and chemical features of GPCR ligands. We then used structure-guided design to convert two nanobodies from allosteric ligands to competitive AT1R inhibitors through simple mutations.

The long PT is fired out of the microsporidian spore over the course of just a few hundred milliseconds. Once fired, the PT is thought to pierce the plasma membrane of a target cell and act as a conduit for the transfer of the parasite into the host cell, which initiates infection. The PT architecture and its association with neighboring organelles within the parasite cell remain poorly understood. Here, we use cryoelectron tomography to investigate the structural cell biology of the PT in dormant spores from the human-infecting microsporidian species, Encephalitozoon intestinalis . Segmentation and subtomogram averaging of the PT reveal at least four layers: two protein-based layers surrounded by a membrane layer and filled with a dense core. Regularly spaced protein filaments form the structural skeleton of the PT. Combining cryoelectron tomography with cellular modeling, we propose a model for the three-dimensional organization of the polaroplast, an organelle that surrounds the PT and is continuous with the outermost, membranous layer of the PT.

However, the causation and mechanism of liver fibrosis triggered by chronic HEV infection remain poorly understood. Here, we found that the viral multiple-domain replicase (ORF1) undergoes unique ubiquitin–proteasomal processing leading to formation of the H EV- D erived S MAD A ctivator (HDSA), a viral polypeptide lacking putative helicase and RNA polymerase domains. The HDSA is stable, non-HSP90-bound, localizes to the nucleus, and is abundant in G3 HEV-infected hepatocytes of various origins. Markedly, the HDSA in hepatocytes potentiates the fibrogenic TGF-β/SMAD pathway by forming compact complexes with SMAD3 to facilitate its promoter binding and coactivator recruitment, leading to significant fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils. Virus infection–induced liver fibrosis in HEV-susceptible gerbils could be prevented by mutating the residues P989C, A990C, and A991C (PAA-3C) within ORF1, which are required for proteasomal processing. Thus, we have identified a viral protein derived from host proteasomal processing, defined its notable role in liver fibrosis and highlighted the nature of an unanticipated host–HEV interaction that facilitates hepatitis E pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a debilitating chronic condition mainly caused by peripheral nerve injury. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this condition remain unclear. Transient receptor potential canonical 3 (TRPC3), a TRP channel that is activated by downstream of the Gq-phospholipase C (PLC) axis, is expressed in the somatosensory system. Therefore, the present study investigated its pathophysiological role in neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Here, partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL) elicited mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in wild-type mice, which was suppressed in TRPC3-KO mice. In situ hybridization revealed that TRPC3 is predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn. Furthermore, spinal dorsal horn neuron-specific downregulation using miRNA attenuated pSNL-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Spinal TRPC3 activation elicited acute mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, its genetic ablation reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity caused by spinal NK 1 R or PLC activation. These findings demonstrate that TRPC3 in spinal dorsal horn neurons facilitates the development of neuropathic pain. Therefore, TRPC3 may be a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain caused by peripheral nerve injury.",

          "abstract": "Mixed-species plantations are increasingly recognized for their potential to maintain forest biodiversity and soil health; however, a comprehensive assessment of their global effectiveness is lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 7,045 paired observations between mixed-species and monoculture plantations, derived from 311 studies across diverse forest ecosystems worldwide. Our results show that mixed-species plantations significantly increased understory plant biomass, cover, and species richness by 32.6%, 55.4%, and 32.2%, respectively, compared to monocultures. Furthermore, the Shannon and Pielou diversity indices increased by 28.2% and 8.6%, respectively, and the Simpson index increased by 9.6%. When understory shrub and herbaceous species were considered separately, species mixing had significantly positive effects on shrub diversity but had no effect on herbaceous diversity. Moreover, mixed-species plantations markedly improved soil physical and chemical properties compared to monocultures. These improvements include increases in soil nutrient content (9.6 to 17.8%) and nutrient availability (14.7 to 33.5%), soil microbial biomass (17.2 to 28.8%), and soil carbon sequestration (7.2 to 19.9%). These enhancements were particularly pronounced in plantations that included legumes. Our findings reveal that the benefits of species mixing are influenced by climatic conditions, geographic location, and stand age, with the most substantial effects observed in temperate regions and mature stands. This study underscores the critical role of mixed-species plantations in promoting sustainable forest management and mitigating the ecological limitations of monocultures.",

          "abstract": "Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a devastating condition that leaves many undergoing fertility treatment childless. The human endometrium is receptive to a blastocyst for a brief period, the window of implantation. Critical knowledge underpinning biological processes leading to RIF, essential for effective treatment, is lacking. We employed spatial transcriptomics to define region- and cell-type-specific differences in endometrial gene expression in luteinizing hormone timed biopsies between women with RIF (n = 8) and fertile controls (FC) (n = 8). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing endometrial regions between FC and RIF (685 luminal epithelium, 293 glandular epithelium, 419 subluminal stroma, 264 functionalis stroma, 1,125 subluminal stromal CD45 + leukocytes, and 1,049 functionalis stromal CD56 + leukocytes). Only 57 DEGs were common to all subregions and cell types, which highlights that multiple DEGs are lost when the endometrium is examined as a single entity. When RIF-specific DEGs were leveraged against knowledge from mouse genetic models, genes associated with aberrant embryo implantation phenotypes were observed, mostly in immune cell populations. Dysregulated pathways in specific endometrial regions included the “WNT signaling pathway,” altered in the functionalis and subluminal stroma. “Response to estradiol” and “ovulation cycle” pathways were dysregulated in the subluminal stroma. In silico drug screening identified potential compounds that can reverse the RIF gene expression profile (e.g., raloxifene, bisoprolol). Our findings, in a well-characterized cohort, highly endorse consideration of each endometrial region and cell type as separate entities. Ignoring individual regions and composite cell populations will overlook important aberrations, forego potential treatment targets, and lead to research waste pursuing clinically irrelevant treatment options.",

We identified five transcriptionally distinct subsets of LepR + cells, all of which expressed the highest levels of Scf and Cxcl12 in bone marrow throughout adult life. In aging bone marrow, SCF from LepR + cells, but not endothelial cells, continued to be necessary for the maintenance of HSCs and early restricted progenitors. However, arteriolar endothelial cells and other periarteriolar cells expressed increasing levels of interferon during aging. This increased the numbers of periarteriolar Sca1 + Cxcl9 + LepR + cells with an inflammatory gene signature and depleted lymphoid progenitors, at least some of which are also periarteriolar.

While prokaryotic phytoplankton showed little or positive responses to high CO 2 , small (&lt;20 µm) eukaryotic phytoplankton which are primarily limited by low ambient nitrogen drove the observed decrease in community primary production.

          "abstract": "Understanding how ecosystems respond to ubiquitous microplastic (MP) pollution is crucial for ensuring global food security. Here, we conduct a multiecosystem meta-analysis of 3,286 data points and reveal that MP exposure leads to a global reduction in photosynthesis of 7.05 to 12.12% in terrestrial plants, marine algae, and freshwater algae. These reductions align with those estimated by a constructed machine learning model using current MP pollution levels, showing that MP exposure reduces the chlorophyll content of photoautotrophs by 10.96 to 12.84%. Model estimates based on the identified MP-photosynthesis nexus indicate annual global losses of 4.11 to 13.52% (109.73 to 360.87 MT·y −1 ) for main crops and 0.31 to 7.24% (147.52 to 3415.11 MT C·y −1 ) for global aquatic net primary productivity induced by MPs. Under scenarios of efficient plastic mitigation, e.g., a ~13% global reduction in environmental MP levels, the MP-induced photosynthesis losses are estimated to decrease by ~30%, avoiding a global loss of 22.15 to 115.73 MT·y −1 in main crop production and 0.32 to 7.39 MT·y −1 in seafood production.

These observations suggest that neurocomputational mechanisms for spatial knowledge and semantic concepts are related in the brain. However, the exact relationship remains to be understood. Here, we show a mathematical correspondence between a value function for goal-directed spatial navigation and an information measure for word embedding models in natural language processing. Based on this relationship, we integrate spatial and semantic computations into a neural representation model called “disentangled successor information” (DSI). DSI generates biologically plausible neural representations: spatial representations like place cells and grid cells, and concept-specific word representations which resemble concept cells. Furthermore, with DSI representations, we can perform inferences of spatial contexts and words by a common computational framework based on simple arithmetic operations. This computation can be biologically interpreted by partial modulations of cell assemblies of nongrid cells and concept cells. Our model offers a theoretical connection of spatial and semantic computations and suggests possible computational roles of hippocampal and entorhinal neural representations.",

          "abstract": "Variability in predator–prey interactions can modulate population dynamics with impacts scalable to entire ecosystems. As notorious corallivores, crown-of-thorns sea stars (CoTS; Acanthaster spp.) have caused extensive losses of coral habitat during unexplained population outbreaks across the Indo-Pacific. While predation of adult CoTS may help to suppress their outbreaks, it does not sufficiently explain their profound boom-bust dynamics and so remains equivocal. Factors influencing early postsettlement mortality are generally more impactful on population size, thus lower trophic interactions involving juvenile CoTS may better contribute to outbreak prevention. We evaluated the impact of key predatory decapods that interact with juvenile CoTS in their coral rubble nursery before they emerge as destructive corallivores. Decapod density was influenced by habitat complexity and varied regionally, inverse to spatial trends in CoTS outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef. Using eDNA gut content analysis, we confirmed seven species (~12% of individuals) of wild-caught decapod, collected from two reefs separated by &gt;1,000 km, as CoTS predators. Owing to spatial variation in predator abundance and community structure, we estimated potential (previous aquarium experiments) and realized (eDNA results here) rates of CoTS consumption were ~3-fold and ~1.6-fold lower, respectively, in outbreak hotspots. Through combination of field and molecular techniques, we demonstrated the appreciable impact of cryptic predators on early population success of this nuisance species, which expands our knowledge of CoTS outbreaks, pest species management, and reef conservation. Resolving predator–prey interactions at lower levels of the ecosystem can be crucial to understanding broader ecological outcomes.",

          "abstract": "The flagellum is the most complex macromolecular structure known in bacteria and is composed of around two dozen distinct proteins. The main building block of the long, external flagellar filament, flagellin, is secreted through the flagellar type-III secretion system at a remarkable rate of several tens of thousands of amino acids per second, significantly surpassing the rates achieved by other pore-based protein secretion systems. The evolutionary implications and potential benefits of this high secretion rate for flagellum assembly and function, however, have remained elusive. In this study, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence that the flagellar secretion rate has been evolutionarily optimized to facilitate rapid and efficient construction of a functional flagellum. By synchronizing flagellar assembly, we found that a minimal filament length of 2.5 μm was required for swimming motility. Biophysical modeling revealed that this minimal filament length threshold resulted from an elasto-hydrodynamic instability of the whole swimming cell, dependent on the filament length. Furthermore, we developed a stepwise filament labeling method combined with electron microscopy visualization to validate predicted flagellin secretion rates of up to 10,000 amino acids per second. A biophysical model of flagellum growth demonstrates that the observed high flagellin secretion rate efficiently balances filament elongation and energy consumption, thereby enabling motility in the shortest amount of time. Taken together, these insights underscore the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the development and optimization of the flagellum and type-III secretion system, illuminating the intricate interplay and cost-benefit tradeoff between functionality and efficiency in assembly of large macromolecular structures.",

Traditional approaches combining conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors with neoantigen vaccines have shown some promise in treating PDAC but are often compromised by intratumoral T lymphocyte exhaustion and systemic toxicity. Hence, novel approaches are needed to address these challenges. Herein, we demonstrate that mRNA polymeric nanoparticles encoding anti-PD-1 antibodies in situ at the tumor site enhance the therapeutic efficacy of neoantigen-based mRNA vaccine for PDAC. This mRNA-based, in situ anti-PD-1 antibody production strategy also protects tumor-infiltrating T cells from PD-1 inhibition, potentially reducing the toxicities induced by systemic checkpoint inhibition. Our study may provide an innovative dual mRNA nanoparticle strategy for effective tumor neoantigen immunotherapy, as well as an mRNA cancer combination therapy strategy with other clinically approved drugs (e.g., β-elemene).",

Here, we report that RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), an H3K27me3 demethylase, promotes hypocotyl elongation under R light in Arabidopsis . Upon exposure to R light, REF6 preferentially interacts with the active Pfr form of phyB. Consequently, phyB enhances REF6 accumulation and its binding ability, which are necessary for inducing cell-elongation-related genes from open chromatin, ensuring normal plant growth under prolonged light exposure. Moreover, REF6 acts together with the phyB-PIF4 module to mediate light regulation of hypocotyl growth.

Allograft assays using different KRAS mut cell lines showed that treatment with BI-3406 impaired RAS activation and RAS downstream signaling and decreased tumor burden and disease progression as a result of both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic therapeutic effects of the drug. Consistent with prior genetic evidence and the KRAS mut allografts assays in immunocompromised mice, our analyses using an in vivo model of KRAS G12D -driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) in immunocompetent mice showed that single, systemic BI-3406 treatment impaired tumor growth and downmodulated protumorigenic components of the tumor microenvironment comparably to SOS1 genetic ablation or to treatment with the specific KRAS G12D inhibitor MRTX1133.

Like eukaryotic actin, bacterial actins assemble into dynamic polymers upon ATP binding, however variation in interactions between strands gives rise to striking diversity of filament architectures.

The motor program is dependent on the sensorimotor part of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and on synaptic plasticity in the thalamostriatal synapses. New findings from several laboratories have revealed a highly precise spatially interactive organization within the basal ganglia [DLS, substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and the thalamostriatal parafascicular nucleus (PF)] and with precise input from the cortex. The DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop is subdivided into many parallel loops. I now propose that these parallel loops can act to reinforce the activity of the different striatal projection neurons in the DLS that take part and that the synaptic transmission in DLS becomes potentiated each time the motor sequence is performed successfully, if rewarded through a dopamine burst. It is argued that after learning the DLS-SNr-PF-DLS loop can operate in isolation.",

Here, we introduce an algorithm to systematically uncover these excitations up to the activation energy scale relevant to structural relaxation. We use it in a model system to measure the density of states on a scale never achieved before, confirming that this quantity shifts to higher energy under cooling, precisely as the activation energy does. Second, we show that the excitations’ energetic and spatial features allow one to predict with great accuracy the dynamic propensity, i.e., the location of future relaxation dynamics. Finally, we find that excitations have a primary field whose properties, including the displacement of the most mobile particle, scale as a power-law of their activation energy and are independent of temperature. Additionally, they exhibit an outer deformation field that depends on the material’s stability and, therefore, on temperature. We build a scaling description of these findings. Overall, our analysis supports that excitations play a crucial role in regulating relaxation dynamics near the glass transition, effectively suppressing the transition to dynamical arrest predicted by mean-field theories while also being strongly influenced by it.",

However, the immunological properties of iPSCs in an allogeneic setting are not well understood. We previously established a mouse transplantation model of MHC-compatible/minor antigen-mismatched combinations, assuming a hypoimmunogenic iPSC-setting. Here, we found that iPSCs subcutaneously inoculated into MHC-compatible allogeneic host mice resisted rejection and formed teratomas without immunosuppressant administration. Notably, when skin grafts were transplanted onto hosts more than 40 d after the initial iPSCs inoculation, only the skin of the same strain as the initial iPSCs was engrafted. Therefore, donor-specific immune tolerance was induced by a single iPSC inoculation. Diverse analyses, including single-cell RNA-sequencing after transplantation, revealed an increase in regulatory T cell (Treg) population, particularly CD25 + CD103 + effector Tregs within the teratoma and skin grafts. The removal of CD25 + or Foxp3 + cells suppressed the increase in effector Tregs and disrupted graft acceptance, indicating the importance of these cells in the establishment of immune tolerance. Within the teratoma, we observed an increase in TGF-β2 levels, suggesting an association with the increase in effector Tregs.

          "abstract": "Metamorphic proteins switch reversibly between two differently folded states under a variety of environmental conditions. Their identification and prediction are gaining attention, but the fundamental physicochemical basis for fold switching remains poorly understood. In this Perspective article, we address this problem by surveying the landscape of well-characterized metamorphic proteins and noting that a significant fraction of them display temperature sensitivity. We then make the case that the dependence on temperature, in particular cold-denaturation effects, is likely to be an underlying property of many metamorphic proteins regardless of their ultimate triggering mechanisms, especially those with a single domain. The argument is supported by rigorous analysis of hydrophobic effects in each well-characterized metamorphic protein pair and a description of how these parameters relate to temperature. The conclusion discusses the relevance of these insights to a better understanding of prediction, evolution, and de novo design strategies for metamorphic proteins.",

We characterize the elastic junction near the bonding and conceptualize it as a bending boundary layer. While the size of this junction decreases with the pulling force, we observe the surprising existence of the binding angle as a macroscopic signature of the bending stiffnesses. Our results thus challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational response of the structure exhibits a nonlinear and universal behavior regardless of the ratio of asymmetry. Leveraging the independence of the binding angle to the pulling force, we finally introduce the λ -test—a visual measurement technique to characterize membranes through simple mechanical coupling.",

          "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus are critical for memory retrieval, decision making, and emotional regulation. While ventral CA1 (vCA1) shows direct and reciprocal connections with mPFC, dorsal CA1 (dCA1) forms indirect pathways to mPFC, notably via the thalamic reuniens nucleus (Re). Neuroanatomical tracing has documented structural connectivity of this indirect pathway through Re however, its functional operation is largely unexplored. Here, we used in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology along with optogenetics to address this question. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acute mouse brain slices revealed both monosynaptic excitatory responses and disynaptic feedforward inhibition at Re–mPFC synapses. However, we also identified a prolonged excitation of mPFC by Re. These early monosynaptic and late recurrent components are in marked contrast to the primarily feedforward inhibition characteristic of thalamic inputs to the neocortex. Local field potential recordings in mPFC brain slices revealed prolonged synaptic activity throughout all cortical lamina upon Re activation, with the late excitation enhanced by blockade of parvalbumin neurons and GABA A Rs. In vivo Neuropixels recordings in head-fixed awake mice revealed a similar prolonged excitation of mPFC units by Re activation. In summary, Re output produces recurrent feedforward excitation within mPFC suggesting a potent amplification system in the Re–mPFC network. This may facilitate amplification of dCA1-&gt;mPFC signals for which Re acts as the primary conduit, as there is little direct connectivity. In addition, the capacity of mPFC neurons to fire bursts of action potentials in response to Re input suggests that these synapses have a high gain.",

          "abstract": "The problem of combining P -values is an old and fundamental one, and the classic assumption of independence is often violated or unverifiable in many applications. There are many well-known rules that can combine a set of arbitrarily dependent P -values (for the same hypothesis) into a single P -value. We show that essentially all these existing rules can be strictly improved when the P -values are exchangeable, or when external randomization is allowed (or both). For example, we derive randomized and/or exchangeable improvements of well-known rules like “twice the median” and “twice the average,” as well as geometric and harmonic means. Exchangeable P -values are often produced one at a time (for example, under repeated tests involving data splitting), and our rules can combine them sequentially as they are produced, stopping when the combined P -values stabilize. Our work also improves rules for combining arbitrarily dependent P -values, since the latter becomes exchangeable if they are presented to the analyst in a random order. The main technical advance is to show that all existing combination rules can be obtained by calibrating the P -values to e-values (using an α -dependent calibrator), averaging those e-values, converting to a level- α test using Markov’s inequality, and finally obtaining P -values by combining this family of tests; the improvements are delivered via recent randomized and exchangeable variants of Markov’s inequality.",

Here, we found that the internalization of DR5, an important receptor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, initiates apoptosis to inhibit Kaposi sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication. An evolutionary analysis of the DR5 sequence demonstrated that three amino acids underwent positive selection in primates. Notably, one of these positive selection sites, A62, is essential for the antiviral function of DR5 and is important for the binding of DR5 to its ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Moreover, DR5 exhibits broad antiviral activity against and inhibits various herpesviruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, and herpes simplex virus type 2. As a countermeasure, the KSHV K5 protein interacts with DR5 and promotes DR5 degradation through the lysosomal and proteasomal degradation pathways; lysine 245 of DR5 is essential for K5-induced DR5 degradation. These findings demonstrate that DR5 is a restriction factor for human herpesviruses.",

          "abstract": "For decades, microtubules—composed of αβ-tubulin dimers—have been primary targets for cancer chemotherapy. While eight binding sites on the tubulin dimer have been structurally characterized, this study reveals a ninth. We found that the tubulin inhibitor Tumabulin-1 (TM1, a BML284 derivative) binds simultaneously to the well-known colchicine site and a previously unknown site, designated as Tumabulin site. This site resides at the interface of α1-tubulin, β1-tubulin, and RB3 within the tubulin–RB3–tubulintyrosine ligase complex. Remarkably, two TM1 molecules bind cooperatively to this relatively large pocket, interacting with all three proteins. Crucially, this binding is dependent on RB3; it is absent when RB3 is missing or the key residue H71 is mutated (H71Q). We further designed and synthesized Tumabulin-2 (TM2) that selectively binds the Tumabulin site, excluding binding the colchicine site. TM2 acts as a molecular glue, strengthening the interaction between RB3 and the tubulin dimer and consequently enhancing RB3’s tubulin-depolymerizing activity. In conclusion, our findings confirm the existence of a ninth tubulin-binding site and offer a promising foundation for developing Tubulin–RB3 molecular glues as a next generation of anticancer therapeutics.",

          "abstract": "Inflammation is among the known causes of cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL), but its exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that pyroptosis—a recently identified inflammatory type of regulated cell death dependent on gasdermin D (GSDMD)—was activated in the cochleae of cisplatin-treated mice, causing CIHL. Meanwhile, treatment with the GSDMD inhibitor necrosulfonamide alleviated CIHL in these mice. To further examine the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in CIHL, we conducted experiments in Gsdmd- deficient mice . Gsdmd −/− mice demonstrated significantly lower cisplatin-induced cochlear damage than control mice and appeared to be invulnerable to CIHL. Furthermore, GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in the stria vascularis (SV), but not in the hair cells (HCs), played a dominant role in CIHL. In marginal cells (MCs) of SV, cisplatin induced caspase-dependent GSDMD cleavage, and the pore-forming N-terminal of GSDMD rapidly localized to the mitochondria, leading to abnormal mitochondrial aggregation and oxidative stress. The consequent mitochondrial dysfunction in MCs might result in the severe progression of inflammation, SV damage, and HC loss. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of pyroptosis using the FDA-approved drug disulfiram effectively alleviated the symptoms of CIHL. Collectively, these findings offer a broad avenue for inhibiting pyroptosis-induced cisplatin ototoxicity and provide valuable theoretical insights for the clinical management of CIHL.",

We apply this model to Posidonia oceanica meadows, where positive and negative feedbacks are well documented, and there is empirical evidence of the role of sulfide accumulation, toxic for the plant, in driving complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We describe a progressive transition from homogeneous meadows to extinction through dynamical regimes that allow the ecosystem to avoid the typical ecological tipping points of homogeneous vegetation covers. A predictable sequence of distinct dynamical regimes is observed as mortality is continuously increased: turbulent regimes, formation of spirals and wave trains, and isolated traveling pulses or expanding rings, the latter being a harbinger of ecosystem collapse, however far beyond the tipping point of the homogeneous cover. The model used in this paper is general, and the results can be applied to other plant–soil spatially extended systems, regardless of the mechanisms behind negative and positive feedbacks.",

The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models. However, a major challenge has been finding a suitable fluid closure for these fluid models. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator—a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning–assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.",

However, its role in shaping behavior remains unclear. Recent evidence shows that resting-state spatial patterns not only align with task-evoked topographies but also encode distinct visual (e.g., lines, contours, faces, places) and motor (e.g., hand postures) features, suggesting mechanisms for long-term storage and predictive coding. While prior research focused on static, time-averaged task activations, we examine whether dynamic, time-varying motor states seen during active hand movements are also present at rest. Three distinct motor activation states, engaging the motor cortex alongside sensory and association areas, were identified. These states appeared both at rest and during task execution but underwent temporal reorganization from rest to task. Thus, resting-state dynamics serve as strong spatiotemporal priors for task-based activation. Critically, resting-state patterns more closely resembled those associated with frequent ecological hand movements than with an unfamiliar movement, indicating a structured repertoire of movement patterns that is replayed at rest and reorganized during action. This suggests that spontaneous neural activity provides priors for future movements and contributes to long-term memory storage, reinforcing the functional interplay between resting and task-driven brain activity.",

Microbial competition for these scarce resources can be alleviated insofar as the intensity of nutrient uptake and assimilation activities are distributed heterogeneously across organisms over periodic input cycles. Recent analysis of community transcriptional dynamics in the nitrogen-limited subtropical North Pacific gyre revealed evidence of temporal partitioning of nitrogen uptake and assimilation between eukaryotic phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacteria over day-night cycles. Here, we present results from a Lagrangian metatranscriptomic time series survey in the Sargasso Sea and demonstrate temporally partitioned phosphorus uptake in this phosphorus-limited environment. In the Sargasso, heterotrophic bacteria, eukaryotic phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria express genes for phosphorus assimilation during the morning, day, and dusk, respectively. These results support the generality of temporal niche partitioning as an emergent mechanism that can structure uptake of limiting nutrients and facilitate coexistence of diverse microbes in open ocean ecosystems.",

Here, by combining large-scale experiments, computer modeling, and analytical theory, we have identified a generic sequence of transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells of varying radii. With increasing the well’s radius, we observed that persistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex pulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational modeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from the nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become unstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key experimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed equations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the universal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to various biological and synthetic active systems.",

We previously described molecular mimicry between the EBV transcription factor EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and three human CNS proteins: anoctamin-2 (ANO2), alpha-B crystallin (CRYAB), and glial cellular adhesion molecule (GlialCAM). Here, we investigated antibody responses against EBNA1 and GlialCAM in a large cohort of 650 MS patients and 661 matched population controls and compared them to responses against CRYAB and ANO2. We confirmed that elevated IgG responses against EBNA1 and all three CNS-mimic antigens associate with increased MS risk. Blocking experiments confirmed the presence of cross-reactive antibodies and molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM, and accompanying antibody responses against adjacent peptide regions of GlialCAM suggest epitope spreading. Antibody responses against EBNA1, GlialCAM, CRYAB, and ANO2 are elevated in MS patients carrying the main risk allele HLA-DRB1*15:01, and combinations of HLA-DRB1*15:01 with anti-EBNA1 and anti-GlialCAM antibodies increase MS risk significantly and in an additive fashion. In addition, antibody reactivities against more than one EBNA1 peptide and more than one CNS-mimic increase the MS risk significantly but modestly. Overall, we show that molecular mimicry between EBNA1 and GlialCAM is likely an important molecular mechanism contributing to MS pathology.",

          "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TADs) are sub-Megabase regions in vertebrate genomes with enriched intradomain interactions that restrict enhancer–promoter contacts across their boundaries. However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, here we show that the width of TAD boundaries forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBSs distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the random crosslinker polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis, using three generic boundary categories, identifies differential influence on TAD insulation, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in establishing genome organization. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer–promoter contacts over long distances across TAD boundaries, providing a further mechanism for transcriptional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Some viruses counter host-cell efforts to digest invading viral RNA by using special structures resistant to host RNases, known as exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs). xrRNAs typically form an unusual fold with the 5′-end threaded through a ring consisting of a multihelix junction closed by a pseudoknot. By using single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), we previously showed that a Zika virus xrRNA is extremely rigid mechanically, withstanding very high forces, and that this mechanical resistance—not simply the knot-like fold topology—is essential for RNase resistance. Here, we have determined which interactions are most important for generating mechanical rigidity in the Zika virus xrRNA, by systematically mutating tertiary contacts. We found that removing any of the tertiary contacts involving the threaded 5′ end was sufficient to abrogate mechanical resistance. In contrast, breaking a single pseudoknot base pair was not sufficient to do so: Two broken pairs were needed. This hierarchy of interaction importance for mechanical rigidity was supported by simulations mapping how mechanical tension was distributed within the xrRNA. For all mutants, RNase resistance varied in lock-step with mechanical resistance, confirming the primary role of mechanical rigidity in xrRNA function.

          "abstract": "Genetic assimilation is a process by which a trait originally driven by the environment becomes independent of the initial cue and is expressed constitutively in a population. More than seven decades have passed since Waddington’s pioneering demonstration of the acquisition of morphological traits through genetic assimilation, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by performing combined genomic analyses of Waddington’s genetic assimilation experiments using the ectopic veins (EV) phenocopy in Drosophila as a model. Our study reveals the assimilation of EV in both outbred and inbred fly natural populations, despite their limited genetic diversity. We identified key changes in the expression of developmental genes and pinpointed selected alleles involved in EV assimilation. The assimilation of EV is mainly driven by the selection of regulatory alleles already present in the ancestral populations, including the downregulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Cad96Ca by the insertion of a transposable element in its 3′ untranslated region. The genetic variation at this locus in the inbred population is maintained by a large chromosomal inversion. In outbred populations, the evolution of EV results from a polygenic response shaped by the selective environment. Our results support a model in which selection for multiple preexisting alleles in the ancestral population, rather than stress-induced genetic or epigenetic variation, drives the evolution of EV in natural fly populations.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which NBS1 mutations cause clinical phenotypes of NBS, such as craniofacial dysmorphism, is still unclear. Here, we show that NBS1 localizes at the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) loci in nucleoli and interacts with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery including RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and TCOF1. Loss of NBS1 impairs Pol I-dependent transcription of pre-rRNA and induces nucleolar stress. In particular, lacking Nbs1 in mouse neural crest cells not only leads to the reduction of ribosome biogenesis but also craniofacial abnormalities during prenatal development. Moreover, the C-terminus of NBS1 is associated with pre-rRNA and a number of pre-rRNA processing factors, which may also facilitate pre-rRNA maturation. Taken together, our study reveals the functions of NBS1 in rRNA biogenesis.",

Here, we report that a p53-induced circular RNA circASCC3 promotes chemotherapeutic resistance by resolving R-loops. Our results reveal that p53 directly activates the transcription of ASCC3 , the host gene of circASCC3. In addition, the RNA-binding protein SFPQ is identified to inhibit the formation of circASCC3 by associating with its flanking regions. Importantly, p53 facilitates the formation of circASCC3 by repressing the expression of SFPQ. CircASCC3 has a marginal effect on the survival and growth of cancer cells under normal growing conditions but surprisingly boosts their survival and growth in response to DNA damage stress. Mechanistic analysis reveals that circASCC3 binds to the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX5 to inhibit its proteasomal degradation. This results in the prevention of R-loop accumulation due to DNA damage, thereby conferring tumor resistance to chemotherapy. Together, our study uncovers that p53 activates circASCC3 to promote R-loop resolution, which maintains genomic stability and potentially contributes to chemoresistance.",

Unless their therapeutic effects are solely mediated by paracrine, transplanted stem cells need to be highly plastic to adapt to the host tissue environment and differentiate into constituent tissue-specific cells for tissue repair. Stem cells used in current cell-based therapies either have limited differentiation potential or are pluripotent but must be strictly restricted to avoid tumorigenicity risk in vivo. Here, we describe the derivation of human adult high-plasticity stem cells, which we call guide-integrated adult stem cells (giaSCs), from the interaction of blood-derived guide cells and umbilical cord tissue–derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs). The guide cells are a cell population derived from the peripheral blood of human adults. Unidirectional transfer through nanotube-like structures of granular substances from the guide cells into the recipient UC-MSCs gave rise to giaSCs. Topical application of human giaSCs into full-layer excisional wounds of wild-type mice led to reconstitution of skin tissue. Systemically administered human giaSCs migrated to and reside in mouse small intestinal tissue damaged by lipopolysaccharides and then differentiated into small intestinal epithelial cells for tissue repair. These transplantation experiments demonstrated that giaSCs have in vivo high plasticity. Additional in vivo and in vitro data showed that giaSCs have low immunogenicity and are nontumorigenic. These data indicate that giaSCs offer a highly promising approach to stem cell therapy.",

In the present study, we identified the m 6 A methylation of the viral RNA of different IAV subtypes and confirmed that m 6 A modification promotes the polymerase activity and replication of IAV. By mutating m 6 A motifs on the multiple viral RNAs (vRNAs) of IAV, we revealed that m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the expression of viral genes and the replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA reduced the pathogenicity of IAV in a mouse model. Mechanistically, m 6 A deficiency in vRNA suppresses the assembly of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex by impairing the interaction between vRNA and vRNP proteins in an m 6 A methyltransferase-dependent manner, but not the m 6 A reader proteins.

          "abstract": "Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that establishes a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis within root nodules of legumes. In this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes a drastic cellular change leading to a terminally differentiated form, called bacteroid, characterized by genome endoreduplication, increased cell size, and high membrane permeability. Bacterial cell cycle (mis)regulation is at the heart of this differentiation process. In free-living cells, the master regulator CtrA ensures the progression of cell cycle by activating cell division (controlled by FtsZ) and inhibiting DNA replication, while on the other hand the so far poorly unknown downregulation of CtrA and FtsZ is essential for bacteroid differentiation. Here, we combine cell biology, biochemistry, and bacterial genetics to understand the functions of FcrX, a factor that controls both CtrA and FtsZ in free-living growth and in symbiosis. Depletion of the essential gene fcrX led to abnormally high levels of FtsZ and CtrA and minicell formation. Using multiple complementary techniques, we showed that FcrX may interact with FtsZ and CtrA. Moreover, fcrX transcription is directly controlled by CtrA itself and the FcrX protein displays a cell cycle-dependent pattern. We showed further that FcrX also binds the degradosome complex ClpXP and its adaptors CpdR1 and RcdA, and that CtrA degradation efficiency depends on FcrX. We further showed that, despite weak homology with FliJ-like proteins, only FcrX proteins from closely related species are able to complement S. meliloti fcrX function. Finally, deregulation of FcrX showed abnormal symbiotic behaviors in plants suggesting a putative role of this factor during bacteroid differentiation.",

In situ control and manipulation to achieve diversity in emulsion droplets for emerging applications is challenging. In a liquid crystal-based emulsion, the surface anchoring of the molecules at the isotropic fluid-liquid crystal interface introduces elastic distortions that result in anisotropic interparticle interactions, similar to electrostatic interactions between multipoles, which also lends a naming analogy as elastic dipoles, quadrupoles, and higher. However, controlling the anchoring condition at the interface at will is rarely achieved. Here, we present an emulsion system in which silicone oil droplets in a nematic liquid crystal spontaneously induce conic surface anchoring, forming elastic hexadecapoles without any surfactant. The conic degenerate surface anchoring shows continuous reversible anchoring transition to tangential and homeotropic below and above the ambient temperature, respectively. We introduce a physical design principle and in situ control to achieve three-phase compound droplets with diverse morphologies and topologies by fusing elastic hexadecapoles of oil droplets with elastic dipoles of glycerol droplets. The surrounding director field and the resulting defect structure of the compound droplets are analyzed by numerical simulations. Our approach to forming compound droplets will allow the on-demand design of building blocks for engineered emulsions for reconfigurable composite materials.",

          "abstract": "As infants grow, they develop greater attentional control during interactions with others, shifting from patterns of attention primarily driven by caregivers (exogenous) to those that are also self-directed (endogenous). The ability to endogenously control attention during infancy is thought to reflect ongoing brain development and is influenced by patterns of joint attention between infant and caregiver. However, whether measures of infant attentional control and caregiver behavior during infant–caregiver interactions relate to patterns of infant brain activity is unknown and key for informing developmental models of attentional control. Using data from 43 infant–caregiver dyads, we quantified patterns of visual attention with dyadic, head-mounted eye tracking during infant–caregiver play and associated them with the duration of infant EEG microstate D/4 measured during rest. Importantly, microstate D/4 is a scalp potential topography thought to reflect the organization and function of attention-related brain networks. We found that microstate D/4 associated positively with infant-led joint attention rate but did not associate with caregiver-led joint attention rate, suggesting that infant-led coordination of joint attention during play may be critical for the neurobiological development of attentional control, or vice versa. Further, we found that microstate D/4 associated negatively with infant attention shift rate and positively with infant sustained attention duration, suggesting that increased stability of microstate D/4 may reflect maturation of attentional control and its underlying neural substrates. Together, our findings provide insights into how infant attentional control abilities and infant–caregiver visual behavior during play are associated with the spatial and temporal dynamics of infant brain activity.",

          "abstract": "The importance of macrophages in kidney diseases has been well established; however, the mechanisms underlying the infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys are not well understood. RGMb is a member of the repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family. RGMb can be expressed on the cell surface but a large portion of RGMb is localized intracellularly. Among various immune cell types, macrophages express the highest levels of RGMb, but the biological functions of RGMb in macrophages remain largely unknown. We find that RGMb promoted macrophage migration in vitro and that in vivo, RGMb enhanced infiltration of macrophages into injured kidneys and aggravated kidney inflammation and injury in mice. Mechanistically, RGMb bound to TAB1 inside the cell and facilitated the interaction between TRAF6 ubiquitin ligase and TAB1, thereby promoting TRAF6-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and phosphorylation of TAK1, followed by increased αTAT1 phosphorylation and α-tubulin acetylation. The resulting changes in the cytoskeleton promoted macrophage migration in vitro and in vivo. Deletion of Rgmb in macrophages markedly reduced TAK1 phosphorylation, αTAT1 phosphorylation, and α-tubulin acetylation and attenuated macrophage infiltration, renal inflammation, tubular injury, and interstitial fibrosis during kidney injury. Our results suggest that macrophage RGMb promotes kidney disease by increasing macrophage infiltration via the TRAF6-TAB1-TAK1/αTAT1/α-tubulin cascade.",

          "abstract": "At the end of their growth phase, Drosophila larvae remodel their bodies, glue themselves to a substrate, and harden their cuticle in preparation for metamorphosis. This process—termed pupariation—is triggered by a surge in the hormone ecdysone. Substrate attachment is achieved by a pupariation subprogram called glue expulsion and spreading behavior (GSB). An epidermis-to-CNS Dilp8-Lgr3 relaxin signaling event that occurs downstream of ecdysone is critical for unlocking progression of the pupariation motor program toward GSB, but the factors and circuits acting downstream of Lgr3 signaling remain unknown. Here, using cell-type-specific RNA interference and behavioral monitoring, we identify Myoinhibiting peptide (Mip) as a neuromodulator of multiple GSB action components, such as tetanic contraction, peristaltic contraction alternation, and head-waving. Mip is required in a pair of brain descending neurons, which act temporally downstream of Dilp8-Lgr3 signaling. Mip modulates GSB via ventral nerve cord neurons expressing its conserved receptor, sex peptide receptor (SPR). Silencing of Mip descending neurons by hyperpolarization completely abrogates GSB, while their optogenetic activation at a restricted competence time window triggers GSB-like behavior. Hence, Mip descending neurons have at least two functions: to act as GSB command neurons and to secrete Mip to modulate GSB action components. Our results provide insight into conserved aspects of Mip-SPR signaling in animals, reveal the complexity of GSB control, and contribute to the understanding of how multistep innate behaviors are coordinated in time and with other developmental processes through command neurons and neuropeptidergic signaling.",

Furthermore, high-quality satellite radiometer observations of the most recent solar cycle, 24, systematically differ from estimates that rely on TSI proxies for reasons that have been unclear. Using a Bayesian Kalman filtering approach to estimate TSI from both satellite-based observations and proxies gives two complementary explanations: recent satellite-based observations of TSI contain unaccounted-for positive linear drifts, and regression-based reconstructions are affected by commonly used solar magnetic proxies becoming less sensitive to TSI variations at low values. After accounting for satellite instrument drifts and reduced sensitivity, direct and proxy observations come into agreement and together indicate a linear trend in overall TSI of −0.15 W/m 2 per decade with a 95% CI of −0.17 to −0.13 W/m 2 per decade between 1980 and 2023.",

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here, we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a space-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction, and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision-making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.",

Using a combination of computational modeling and biochemical reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that multivalent interactions with CFTR protein binding partners, calcium, and membrane cholesterol can induce mesoscale CFTR cluster formation on model membranes. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CFTR also promotes mesoscale cluster formation in the absence of calcium, indicating that multiple mechanisms can contribute to CFTR cluster formation.

To understand heterogeneity across microbiome samples from different host individuals, sampling times, spatial locations, or experimental replicates, we present FAVA ( F ST -based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances), a framework for characterizing compositional variability across two or more microbiome samples. FAVA quantifies variability across many samples of taxonomic or functional relative abundances in a single index ranging between 0 and 1, equaling 0 when all samples are identical and 1 when each sample is entirely composed of a single taxon (and at least two distinct taxa are present across samples). Its definition relies on the population-genetic statistic F ST , with samples playing the role of “populations” and taxa playing the role of “alleles.” Its mathematical properties allow users to compare datasets with different numbers of samples and taxonomic categories. We introduce extensions that incorporate phylogenetic similarity among taxa and spatial or temporal distances between samples. We demonstrate FAVA in two examples. First, we use FAVA to measure how the taxonomic and functional variability of gastrointestinal microbiomes across individuals from seven ruminant species changes along the gastrointestinal tract. Second, we use FAVA to quantify the increase in temporal variability of gut microbiomes in healthy humans following an antibiotic course and to measure the duration of the antibiotic’s influence on temporal microbiome variability.

          "abstract": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy, or glaucoma, is the world’s primary cause of irreversible blindness. Glaucoma is comorbid with other neurodegenerative diseases, but how it might impact the environment of the full central nervous system to increase neurodegenerative vulnerability is unknown. Two neurodegenerative events occur early in the optic nerve, the structural link between the retina and brain: loss of anterograde transport in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and early alterations in astrocyte structure and function. Here, we used whole-mount tissue clearing of full mouse brains to image RGC anterograde transport function and astrocyte responses across retinorecipient regions early in a unilateral microbead occlusion model of glaucoma. Using light sheet imaging, we found that RGC projections terminating specifically in the accessory optic tract are the first to lose transport function. Although degeneration was induced in one retina, astrocytes in both brain hemispheres responded to transport loss in a retinotopic pattern that mirrored the degenerating RGCs. A subpopulation of these astrocytes in contact with large descending blood vessels were immunopositive for LCN2, a marker associated with astrocyte reactivity. Together, these data suggest that even early stages of unilateral glaucoma have broad impacts on the health of astrocytes across both hemispheres of the brain, implying a glial mechanism behind neurodegenerative comorbidity in glaucoma.",

          "abstract": "Transgenic crops that produce insecticidal toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are grown worldwide to manage insect pests. Western corn rootworm is a serious pest of maize in the United States and is managed with Bt maize. In the United States, the commercial cultivation of a Bt crop requires an accompanying resistance-management strategy to delay the evolution of Bt resistance. One of the primary resistance-management strategies consists of non-Bt refuges along with a Bt crop that produces two Bt toxins (i.e., a pyramid) that kill the same pest species. This approach delays resistance because individuals with resistance to one toxin are killed by the second. However, if a pest species is resistant to one toxin in a pyramid, the effectiveness of a pyramid to delay resistance is compromised, potentially leading to the evolution of resistance to both toxins. Here, we apply a meta-analysis to demonstrate the sequential evolution of resistance by western corn rootworm to Bt maize producing Cry3Bb1 followed by resistance to Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 maize, with resistance to each Bt toxin increasing in a linear manner over time. Additionally, we show that Bt-resistant western corn rootworm imposed substantial feeding injury, in the field, to maize containing a pyramid of Gpp34/Tpp35Ab1 and Cry3Bb1. To minimize the risk of sequential evolution of resistance to multiple transgenic traits, an emphasis should be placed on developing transgenic pyramids not compromised by prior resistance, and in cases where resistance is already present, larger non-Bt refuges and more diversified pest-management approaches should be applied.",

In a DMD mouse model, mdx 5cv mice, CC chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) deficiency diminishes Ly6C hi macrophage infiltration by blocking blood Ly6C hi inflammatory monocyte recruitment. This is accompanied by transient improvement of muscle damage, fibrosis, and regeneration. The benefit, however, is lost after the expansion of intramuscular Ly6C lo macrophages. To address the mechanisms underlying the Ly6C lo macrophage expansion, we compared mdx 5cv /Nur77 −/− and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− /Nur7 −/− mice with mdx 5cv and mdx 5cv /Ccr2 −/− mice, respectively, and found no evidence to suggest Ly6C lo monocyte recruitment by dystrophic muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis and Flt3 cre /Rosa26 LSL-YFP -based lineage tracing of macrophage origins demonstrated the expansion and pathogenic activation of muscle resident macrophages in CCR2-deficient mdx 5cv mice. The expansion was associated with increased cell proliferation, which appeared induced by colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) derived from fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Our study establishes a pathogenic role for skeletal muscle resident macrophages and supports a regulatory role of FAPs in stimulating the expansion of resident macrophages in the DMD mouse model when the inflammatory macrophage infiltration is inhibited.",

          "abstract": "The transthyretin (TTR) tetramer, assembled as a dimer of dimers, transports thyroxine and retinol binding protein in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Aggregation of wild type (WT) or pathogenic variant TTR leads to transthyretin amyloidosis, which is associated with neurodegenerative and cardiac disease. The trigger for TTR aggregation under physiological conditions is unknown. The tetramer is extremely stable at neutral pH, but aggregation via tetramer dissociation and monomer misfolding can be induced in vitro by lowering the pH. To elucidate factors that may cause TTR aggregation at neutral pH, we examined the effect of shear forces such as those that arise from fluid flow in the vascular system. Fluid shear forces were generated by rapidly stirring TTR solutions in conical microcentrifuge tubes. Under agitation, TTR formed β-rich aggregates and fibrils at a rate that was dependent upon protein concentration. The lag time before the onset of agitation-induced aggregation increases as the total TTR concentration is increased, consistent with a mechanism in which the tetramer first dissociates to form monomer that either partially unfolds to enter the aggregation pathway or reassociates to form tetramer. NMR spectra recorded at various time points during the lag phase revealed growth of an aggregation-prone intermediate trapped as a dynamically perturbed tetramer. Enhanced conformational fluctuations in the weak dimer–dimer interface suggest loosening of critical intersubunit contacts which likely destabilizes the agitated tetramer and predisposes it toward dissociation. These studies provide insights into the mechanism of aggregation of WT human TTR under near-physiological conditions.",

          "abstract": "Regulation of mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake is critical in cardiac adaptation to chronic stressors. Abnormalities in Ca 2+ handling, including mitochondrial uptake mechanisms, have been implicated in pathological heart hypertrophy. Enhancing mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) expression has been suggested to interfere with maladaptive development of heart failure. Here, we addressed whether MCU modulation affects the cardiac response to pressure overload. MCU content was quantified in human and murine hearts at different phases of myocardial hypertrophy. Cardiac function/structure were analyzed after Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) in mice undergone viral-assisted overexpression or downregulation of MCU. In vitro and ex vivo assays determined the effect of MCU modulation on mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake, cellular phenotype and hypertrophic signaling. In human and murine hearts MCU levels increased in the adaptive phase of myocardial hypertrophy and declined in the failing stage. Consistently, modulation of MCU had a cell-autonomous effect in cardiomyocyte/heart adaptation to chronic overload. Indeed, upon TAC MCU-downregulation accelerated development of contractile dysfunction, interstitial fibrosis and heart failure. Conversely, MCU-overexpression prolonged the adaptive phase of hypertrophic response, as, in advanced stages upon TAC, hearts showed preserved contractility, absence of fibrosis and intact vascularization. In vitro and ex vivo analyses indicated that enhancement in mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake in cardiomyocytes entails “mitochondrion-to-cytoplasm” signals leading to ROS-mediated activation of Akt, which may explain the protective effects towards heart response to TAC. Enhanced mitochondrial Ca 2+ uptake affects the compensatory response to pressure overload via retrograde mitochondrial-Ca 2+ /ROS/Akt signaling, thus uncovering a potentially targetable mechanism against maladaptive myocardial hypertrophy.",

          "abstract": "Muscle contraction is driven by myosin motors from the thick filaments pulling on the actin-containing thin filaments of the sarcomere, and it is regulated by structural changes in both filaments. Thin filaments are activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca 2+ ] i and by myosin binding to actin. Thick filaments are activated by direct sensing of the filament load. However, these mechanisms cannot explain muscle relaxation when [Ca 2+ ] i decreases at high load and myosin motors are attached to actin. There is, therefore, a fundamental gap in our understanding of muscle relaxation, despite its importance for muscle function in vivo, for example, for rapid eye movements or, on slower timescales, for the efficient control of posture. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD) to determine how muscle thin and thick filaments switch OFF in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the mouse in response to decreases in either [Ca 2+ ] i or muscle load and to describe the distribution of muscle sarcomere lengths (SLs) during relaxation. We show that reducing load at high [Ca 2+ ] i is more effective in switching OFF both the thick and thin filaments than reducing [Ca 2+ ] i at high load in normal relaxation. In the latter case, the thick filaments initially remain fully ON, although the number of myosin motors bound to actin decreases and the force per attached motor increases. That initial slow phase of relaxation is abruptly terminated by yielding of one population of sarcomeres, triggering a redistribution of SLs that leads to the rapid completion of mechanical relaxation.",

In brown and beige adipocytes, C16:0 ceramide binding to FPR2 inhibits thermogenesis via G i -cyclic AMP signaling pathways, an effect that is reversed in the absence of FPR2. We present three cryo–electron microscopy structures of FPR2 in complex with G i trimers bound to C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0 ceramides. The hydrophobic tails are deeply embedded in the orthosteric ligand pocket, which has a limited amount of plasticity. Modification of the ceramide binding motif in closely related receptors, such as FPR1 or FPR3, converts them from inactive to active ceramide receptors. Our findings provide a structural basis for adipocyte thermogenesis mediated by FPR2.",

Symmetric arrangement of two TOM core complexes around a central VDAC2 dimer is facilitated by TOM5 and TOM20, both of which also bind PINK1 kinase C-lobes. PINK1 enters mitochondria through the proximal TOM40 barrel of the TOM core complex, guided by TOM7 and TOM22.

In the extension zone, we found that ice exhibits anisotropic properties. We constructed ice shelf–wide anisotropic viscosity maps that capture the suture zones, which inhibit rift propagation. The inferred stress exponent near the grounding zone dictates the grounding-line ice flux and grounding line stability, whereas the inferred viscosity maps inform the prediction of rifts.

          "abstract": "Homo-oligomerization of biological macromolecules leads to functional assemblies that are critical to understanding various cellular processes. However, RNA quaternary structures have been rarely reported. Comparative genomics analysis has identified RNA families containing hundreds of sequences that adopt conserved secondary structures and likely fold into complex three-dimensional (3D) structures. We use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures from four RNA families, including ARRPOF and OLE forming dimers, and ROOL and GOLLD forming hexameric, octameric and dodecameric nanostructures, at 2.6 to 4.6 Å resolutions. These homo-oligomeric assemblies reveal a plethora of structural motifs that contribute to RNA multivalency, including kissing loop, palindromic base-pairing, A-stacking, metal ion coordination, pseudoknot and minor-groove interactions. These results provide the molecular basis of intermolecular interactions driving RNA multivalency with potential functional relevance.",

Although media attention has focused on the immediate impacts of flooding on society, politics, and the economy, our results show that toxic contamination within newly exposed sediments of the former reservoir bed poses a largely overlooked long-term threat to freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems.

In this study, we shed light on the global production capacity of 32 mined geological resources, considering regional water availability as a constraint. We found that current resource mining greatly exceeds regional water constraints for several, notably copper (37% of current production exceeds available water capacity) in 2010. Changing the location of production to regions of lower water stress would alleviate current exceedances of water constraints; however, considering economic factors shows that this is not always feasible. Future demand for geological resources is expected to require a considerable increase in water consumption. Considering the constraints of water resources in geological resource production is crucial for sustainability.",

Here, we reveal and classify contributions of individual tropical Asian regions to their overall diversity by leveraging species-level phylogenomic data and new fossils from the most species-rich Asian palm lineage, the rattans and relatives (Arecaceae, Calamoideae). Radiators (Borneo) generate and distribute diversity, incubators (Indochina, New Guinea, and Sulawesi) produce diversity in isolation, corridors (Java, Maluku, Sumatra, and the Thai-Malay Peninsula) connect neighboring regions, and accumulators (Australia, India, Palawan, and the Philippines) acquire diversity generated elsewhere. These contrasting contributions can be explained by differences in region size and isolation, elucidating how the unique island-dominated geography of the Asian tropics drives their outstanding biodiversity.",

Establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. Here we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schrödinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench dynamics of two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for matrix-product-state approaches. We show that several leading approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks cannot achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable timeframe. Thus quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that may remain out of reach for classical computation.",

These materials exhibit shear PE strain coefficients that reach ~38 and 33 picocoulombs per newton in ZrNiSn and TiCoSb, respectively, which are high values for noncentrosymmetric nonpolar materials. We demonstrated a TiCoSb-based PE sensor with a large voltage response and capable of charging a capacitor. The PE effect in HHs remains thermally stable up to 1173 kelvin, underscoring their potential for high-temperature applications.

          "abstract": "The ozonolytic deconstruction of aromatics remains a challenge in organic chemistry. Ozone preferentially reacts with alkenes over arenes, meaning that once the initial aromatic cleavage occurs, the dearomatized products are inherently more reactive than the starting materials. Consequently, the process cannot be halted, resulting in full oxidation. Addressing this challenge requires subverting intrinsic rules of chemoselectivity to transform a less reactive substrate in the presence of a more reactive one. We demonstrate that this concept can be achieved by using photoexcited nitroarenes. Crucial to the success of this chemoselective process is the use of a nitroarene that is preferentially excitable to a triplet π,π* state over the n,π* state. This switch in excited-state configuration provides an otherwise inaccessible manifold, in which oxidative cleavage is diverted toward aromatics in the presence of alkenes.",

In this work, we present cryo–electron microscopy structures of DMTs from two trypanosomatid species, Leishmania tarentolae and Crithidia fasciculata , at resolutions up to 2.7 angstrom. The structures revealed 27 trypanosomatid-specific microtubule inner proteins, a specialized dynein-docking complex, and the presence of paralogous proteins that enable higher-order periodicities or proximal-distal patterning. Leveraging the genetic tractability of trypanosomatid species, we quantified the location and contribution of each structure-identified protein to swimming behavior. Our study shows that proper B-tubule closure is critical for flagellar motility, exemplifying how integrating structural identification with systematic gene deletion can dissect individual protein contributions to flagellar motility.",

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) orchestrate these immune responses by presenting luminal antigens to CD4 + T cells and inducing their differentiation into regulatory (peripheral regulatory T cell) or inflammatory [T helper (Th) cell] subsets. We used a proximity labeling method (LIPSTIC) to identify APCs that presented dietary antigens under tolerizing and inflammatory conditions and to understand cellular mechanisms by which tolerance to food is induced and can be disrupted by infection. Helminth infections disrupted tolerance induction proportionally to the reduction in the ratio between tolerogenic APCs—including migratory dendritic cells (cDC1s) and Rorγt + APCs—and inflammatory APCs, which were primarily cDC2s. These inflammatory cDC2s expanded by helminth infection did not present dietary antigens, thus avoiding diet-specific Th2 responses.",

          "abstract": "After an election, should election officials release a copy of each anonymous ballot? Some policy-makers have championed public disclosure to counter distrust, but others worry that it might undermine ballot secrecy. We introduce the term vote revelation to refer to the linkage of a vote on an anonymous ballot to the voter’s name in the public voter file and detail how such revelation could theoretically occur. Using the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Arizona, as a case study, we show that the release of individual ballot records would lead to no revelation of any vote choice for 99.83% of voters as compared to 99.95% under Maricopa’s current practice of reporting aggregate results by precinct and method of voting. Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots. We discuss the potential benefits of transparency, compare remedies to reduce or eliminate privacy violations, and highlight the privacy-transparency trade-off inherent in all election reporting.",

The liver resident macrophages, Kupffer cells, form the hepatic firewall to clear many encapsulated bacteria in the blood circulation but fail to control certain high-virulence capsule types. Here we report that the spleen is the backup immune organ to clear the liver-resistant serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a leading human pathogen. Asplenic mice failed to control the growth of the liver-resistant pneumococci in the blood circulation. Immunologic and genetic analyses identified splenic red pulp (RP) macrophages as the major phagocytes for bacterial clearance. Furthermore, the plasma natural antibodies against the cell wall phosphocholine and the complement system were necessary for RP macrophage–mediated immunity. These findings have provided a conceptual framework for the innate defense against blood bacterial infections, a mechanistic explanation for the hyper-susceptibility of asplenic individuals to S. pneumoniae , and a proof of concept for developing vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against encapsulated pathogens.",

However, most experimental systems either ignore gradients or fail to capture gradients in mechanically relevant contexts. Here, we use microfluidic experiments and biophysical simulations to explore how host-relevant shear flow affects antimicrobial gradients across communities of the highly resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa . We discover that flow patterns gradients of three chemically distinct antimicrobials: hydrogen peroxide, gentamicin, and carbenicillin. Without flow, resistant P. aeruginosa cells generate local gradients by neutralizing all three antimicrobials through degradation or chemical modification. As flow increases, delivery overwhelms neutralization, allowing antimicrobials to penetrate deeper into bacterial populations. By imaging single cells across long microfluidic channels, we observe that upstream cells protect downstream cells, and protection is abolished in higher flow regimes. Together, our results reveal that physical flow can promote antimicrobial effectiveness, which could inspire the incorporation of flow into the discovery, development, and implementation of antimicrobials.",

Results reveal a key period between weeks 4 and 6 with elevated intra-organoid oxygen tension, altered energy homeostasis, and rapid neurogenesis within the organoids. The timed oxygen tension elevation can be suppressed by hypoxia treatment or silencing of neuroglobin gene. This study provides insights into the role of oxygen in early neurogenesis from functional, genotypic, phenotypic, and proteomic aspects.

This is particularly controversial in the marine realm, where the success of restoration is mostly evaluated in terms of the short-term survival of transplanted organisms. In view of this, we combined population and trait-based approaches to explore the long-term effectiveness of active restoration of a key Mediterranean octocoral. For this purpose, an assemblage with restored Corallium rubrum colonies was monitored over 10 years and compared with a nearby reference site. Our results revealed growth of the transplanted colonies followed by a change in the functional structure (i.e., dominance and diversity of traits) of the restored assemblage. This change was related not only to the development of the coral but also to the arrival and/or increase of species with different traits. Overall, our findings provide an example of how active restoration of long-lived octocorals can be an effective tool for recovering high-diverse coralligenous assemblages at decadal timescales.",

Valvular interstitial cells (VICs) aberrantly activate to myofibroblasts during AVS, driving the fibrotic valve phenotype in females. Myofibroblasts further differentiate into osteoblast-like cells and produce calcium nanoparticles, driving valve calcification in males. We hypothesized that the lysine demethylase UTY (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat containing Y-linked) decreases methylation uniquely in male VICs responding to nanoscale extracellular matrix cues to promote an osteoblast-like cell phenotype. Here, we describe a hydrogel biomaterial cell culture platform to interrogate how nanoscale cues modulate sex-specific methylation states in VICs activating to myofibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells. We found that UTY modulates the osteoblast-like cell phenotype in response to nanoscale cues uniquely in male VICs.

          "abstract": "Lipid homeostasis is critical to neuronal survival. ATP-binding cassette A (ABCA) proteins are lipid transporters associated with neurodegenerative diseases. How ABCA transporters regulate lipid homeostasis in neurodegeneration is an outstanding question. Here we report that the Drosophila ABCA protein engulfment ABC transporter in the ovary (Eato) regulates phagocytosis-dependent neurodegeneration by playing opposing roles in neurons and phagocytes: In neurons, Eato prevents dendrites and axons from being attacked by neighboring phagocytes; in phagocytes, Eato sensitizes the cell for detecting neurons as engulfment targets. Thus, Eato deficiency in neurons alone causes phagocytosis-dependent neurite degeneration, but additional Eato loss from phagocytes suppresses the neurite degeneration. Mechanistically, Eato functions by removing the eat-me signal phosphatidylserine from the cell surface in both neurons and phagocytes. Multiple human and worm ABCA homologs can rescue Eato loss in phagocytes but not in neurons, suggesting both conserved and cell type–specific activities of ABCA proteins. These results imply possible mechanisms of neuron-phagocyte interactions in neurodegenerative diseases.",

We identified genome subcompartmentalization and chromatin interactions specific to GBM, as well as extensive intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity at these levels. We identified copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) and demonstrated how they disrupted 3D genome structures. SVs could not only induce enhancer hijacking but also cause the loss of enhancers to the same gene, both of which contributed to gene dysregulation.

Here, we introduce light sheet elastography, a noninvasive method that couples low-frequency shear waves with light sheet fluorescence microscopy by adapting commercially available instruments. With this method, we achieved in toto stiffness mapping of organ-stage mouse and zebrafish embryos at cellular resolution. Versatility of the method enabled time-lapse stiffness mapping during tissue remodeling and of the beating embryonic heart.

A total of 694 event layers were identified. They display a distinct regional trend of increasing storminess in the southwestern Caribbean, which follows an orbitally driven shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Superimposed short-term variations match Holocene climate intervals and originate from solar irradiance–controlled sea-surface temperature anomalies and climate phenomena modes.

To investigate the metabolic regulation of radiation response, we conducted a comprehensive, metabolic-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen using radiation as selection pressure in human non–small cell lung cancer. Lipoylation emerged as a key metabolic target for radiosensitization, with lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1) identified as a top hit. LIPT1 covalently conjugates mitochondrial 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases with lipoic acid, facilitating enzymatic functions involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Inhibiting lipoylation, either through genetic LIPT1 knockout or a lipoylation inhibitor (CPI-613), enhanced tumor control by radiation. Mechanistically, lipoylation inhibition increased 2-hydroxyglutarate, leading to H3K9 trimethylation, disrupting TIP60 recruitment and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)–mediated DNA damage repair signaling, impairing homologous recombination repair. In summary, our findings reveal a critical role of LIPT1 in regulating DNA damage and chromosome stability and may suggest a means to enhance therapeutic outcomes with DNA-damaging agents.",

The neuropeptide Y (NPY) system, best known for its role in controlling energy homeostasis, has also been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a range of cancer types, but its role in PC has yet to be explored. We show that expression of NPY and NPY1R are up-regulated in mouse PC models and human patients with PC. Moreover, using the genetically engineered, autochthonous KP R172H C mouse model of PC, we demonstrate that pancreas-specific and whole-body knockout of Npy1r significantly decreases metastasis to the liver. We identify that treatment with the NPY1R antagonist BIBO3304 significantly reduces KP R172H C migratory capacity on cell-derived matrices. Pharmacological NPY1R inhibition in an intrasplenic model of PC metastasis recapitulated the results of our genetic studies, with BIBO3304 significantly decreasing liver metastasis.

Therefore, under steady-state conditions, a given individual needs to maintain a large pool of naïve T cells, ready to respond to potential threats. Here, we demonstrate that N-myc downstream-regulated gene 3 (Ndrg3) is essential for naïve T cell stability. Mice with T cell–specific Ndrg3 loss are lymphopenic, with reduced numbers of conventional T cells and natural killer T cells. We show that in the absence of Ndrg3, naïve CD8+ T cells exhibit high rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, phenotypes that could be partially rescued by transgenic expression of a high-avidity T cell receptor. Furthermore, Ndrg3-deficient cells were refractory to interleukin-4, resulting in reduced Eomes induction, and a decreased virtual memory population. Our study therefore identifies Ndrg3 as an unexpected, pleiotropic regulator of T cell homeostasis.",

Our previous study, using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque model, revealed an increase of U6 snRNA in plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) in acute retroviral infection. Given the limited understanding of U6 snRNA dynamics across cells and EVs, particularly in SIV infection, this research explores U6 snRNA trafficking and its association with splicing proteins in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and EVs. We observed a redistribution of U6 snRNA from the nucleus to EVs post-infection, accompanied by distinct protein profile changes and alterations in nucleic acid metabolism and spliceosome pathways. In addition, U6 machinery proteins changed in cells and EVs in a contrasting manner. The redistribution of U6 and related proteins we observed could be part of a viral strategy to redirect host splicing machinery, suggesting that U6 may have regulatory roles and be part of retroviral infection signature.",

Despite recent advances in understanding the disease etiology and applying emerging treatment methodologies, glucocorticoid derivatives remain the only general therapeutic option that can slow disease development. However, the precise molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action remains unclear, and there is still need for additional remedies to complement the treatment. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to Dmd mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids. Our analysis reveals pathogenic mechanisms that can be readily targeted by extant therapeutic options for DMD.",

Unlike dual depletion, individual BRD4 or BRDT knockdown did not impair transcriptional responses to hypoxia in BRDT-expressing cells, consistent with redundant function. However, BRD4 depletion/BRDT complementation revealed that BRDT can also release paused RNA polymerase II independently of its bromodomains as we previously demonstrated not to be required for Pol II pause/release function of BRD4, underscoring the functional importance of the C-terminal domains in both BRD4 and BRDT and their potential as therapeutic targets in solid tumors.

We analyzed 22 steroids from 148 serum samples of individuals aged 20 to 73, using 98 samples for model training and 50 for validation. Our model reflects the often-overlooked fact that aging heterogeneity expands over time and uncovers sex-specific variations in steroidogenesis. This study leveraged key markers, including cortisol (COL), which underscore the role of stress-related and sex-specific steroids in aging. The resulting model establishes a biologically meaningful and robust framework for predicting BA across diverse datasets, offering fresh insights and supporting more targeted strategies in aging research and disease management.",

This nanosensor, designed to respond to the proteolytic activity of AS-associated dysregulated enzymes, entails CQDs as signal reporters to convert AS-associated proteolytic activity to fluorometric readings enabling a sensitive and cost-effective urine-based assay for early AS detection. Our findings demonstrated that the nanosensor provided distinct signals in atherosclerotic versus healthy mice at early AS stages, indicating its diagnostic potential. Moreover, toxicity tests showed no notable adverse effects, supporting its safety for diagnostic applications. This minimally invasive diagnostic approach could facilitate personalized therapy design and continuous efficacy assessment.

          "abstract": "Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and Max-like protein X (MLX) form a heterodimeric transcription factor complex that couples intracellular sugar levels to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. To promote the expression of target genes, two ChREBP-MLX heterodimers form a heterotetramer to bind a tandem element with two adjacent E-boxes, called carbohydrate-responsive element (ChoRE). How the ChREBP-MLX hetero-tetramerization is achieved and regulated remains poorly understood. Here, we show that MLX phosphorylation on an evolutionarily conserved motif is necessary for the heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE and the transcriptional activity of the ChREBP-MLX complex. We identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as MLX kinases. High intracellular glucose-6-phosphate accumulation inhibits MLX phosphorylation and heterotetramer formation on the ChoRE, impairing ChREBP-MLX activity. Physiologically, MLX phosphorylation is necessary in Drosophila to maintain sugar tolerance and lipid homeostasis. Our findings suggest that MLX phosphorylation is a key mechanism for the ChREBP-MLX heterotetramer formation to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.",

          "abstract": "In vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, the precise output of the final effectors, GLI (glioma-associated oncogene) transcription factors, depends on the primary cilium. Upon pathway initiation, generating the precise levels of the activator form of GLI depends on its concentration at the cilium tip. The mechanisms underlying this critical step in Hh signaling are unclear. We developed an assay to visualize GLI2, the primary GLI activator isoform, at single-particle resolution within the cilium. We found that GLI2 is a cargo of intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery. Anterograde-biased IFT loading of GLI2 in a restricted time window following pathway activation results in the tip accumulation of GLI2. Unexpectedly, we found that the conserved Hh regulator KIF7, a nonmotile kinesin, is important for the temporal control of IFT-mediated GLI2 transport and retention of GLI2 at the cilium tip. Our findings underscore a design principle where a cilia-specific cytoskeletal transport system and an Hh pathway–specific cytoskeletal protein collaboratively regulate GLI2 trafficking for Hh signaling.",

Disruption of large-scale functional connectivity in 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has been widely reported, but the biological factors driving these changes remain unclear. We used a cross-species design to uncover the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. In LgDel mice, a model for 22q11DS, we found age-specific patterns of brain dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyperconnectivity in juvenile mice reconfiguring to hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These changes correlated with developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and both were transiently normalized by GSK3β inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous pubertal hyperconnectivity-to-hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs in human 22q11DS, affecting cortical regions enriched for GSK3β-associated synaptic genes and autism-relevant transcripts. This dysconnectivity also predicts age-dependent social alterations in 22q11DS individuals. These results suggest that synaptic mechanisms underlie developmental brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS.",

Enteroviruses use the cloverleaf RNA structure at the 5′ end of the genome to balance these two processes. Cloverleaf acts as a promoter for RNA synthesis and forms a complex with viral 3CD protein, the precursor to 3C pro protease, and 3D pol polymerase. The interaction between cloverleaf and 3CD is mediated by the 3C pro domain, yet how 3C pro promotes specific RNA-binding is not clear. We report the structure of coxsackievirus cloverleaf RNA-3C pro complex, wherein two 3C pro molecules interact with cloverleaf stem-loop D. 3C pro dimer mainly recognizes the shape of the dsRNA helix through symmetric interactions, suggesting that 3C pro is a previously undiscovered type of RNA binding protein. We show that 3CD protein also dimerizes on cloverleaf RNA and binds the RNA with higher affinity than 3C pro . The structure provides insight into the RNA-binding mechanism of 3C pro or 3CD with other cis-acting replication elements.",

The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.",

          "abstract": "The high-dimensional basis of orbital angular momentum (OAM) has several added and unique advantages for photonic quantum technologies compared to the polarization basis, which is only two-dimensional. However, one of the major roadblocks in implementing OAM-based applications with their full potentials is the absence of an ideal OAM-mode detector. Despite the plethora of efforts in the last three decades, currently, there is no OAM detector that can detect a broad OAM-mode spectrum, has uniform detection-efficiency over all the modes, measures the true spectrum, and works for an arbitrary quantum state without the need for any previous information. Here, we experimentally demonstrate just such an OAM detector. We report detection of pure and mixed OAM states with fidelities more than 98% and with measurement times of only a few minutes for dimensionalities up to 100. We expect our work to substantially boost the OAM-based photonic quantum technology efforts.",

Herein, we propose an oxygen vacancy–rich (BiFe) 0.9 (BaTi) 0.1 O 3− x nanoreactor as a piezoelectric sonosensitizer by spatiotemporal ultrasound–driven sono- and chemodynamic tandem catalysis to amplify antibacterial efficacy. The piezoelectric charge carriers under a built-in electric field synchronize the reaction of O 2 and H 2 O, efficiently generating H 2 O 2 . The electron-rich oxygen vacancies modulate the local electronic structure of an Fe site. It facilitates reactive oxygen species generation by piezoelectric electrons and accelerates valence state cycles of Fe(III)/Fe(II) to achieve the sustained maintenance of hydroxyl radicals via H 2 O 2 /Fe(II)–catalyzed chemodynamic reactions, which lead to bacterial membrane damage. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that intracellular Fe overload induced by excessive Fe(II)-mediated dysregulation of the two-component system disrupts bacterial metabolism, triggering bacterial ferroptosis-like death. Thus, the porous titanium scaffold, engineered with a piezoelectric nanoreactor, demonstrates superior antibacterial efficacy under ultrasound and facilitates osteogenesis via piezoelectric immunomodulation–activated therapy.",

Traditional studies focus on rapid crack-propagation detachment and account only for short-term adhesion governed by interfacial-viscoelastic dissipation, failing to explain long-term phenomena like sudden detachment after prolonged adherence and to predict corresponding adhesion lifetimes. Here, we investigate the long-term adhesion through a rheological paradigm using both theory and experiment. By considering both the bulk rheology and interfacial viscoelasticity mechanisms, we show that long-term adhesion durability is governed by the competition between them. This understanding leads to accurate lifetime predictions, which we validate through experiments. In addition, our study reveals a previously undocumented, counterintuitive phenomenon unique to long-term adhesion: the expansion of the contact area under tensile forces, in contrast to short-term adhesion in which the contact area always shrinks during detachment. This research fills a critical gap in adhesion physics.",

Here, we investigated palynomorphs, plant, and tetrapod fossils from the Permian-Triassic South Taodonggou Section in Xinjiang, China. Our fossil records, calibrated by a high-resolution age model, reveal the presence of vibrant regional gymnospermous forests and fern fields, while marine organisms experienced mass extinction. This refugial vegetation was crucial for nourishing the substantial influx of surviving animals, thereby establishing a diverse terrestrial ecosystem approximately 75,000 years after the mass extinction. Our findings contradict the widely held belief that restoring terrestrial ecosystem functional diversity to pre-extinction levels would take millions of years. Our research indicates that moderate hydrological fluctuations throughout the crisis sustained this refugium, likely making it one of the sources for the rapid radiation of terrestrial life in the early Mesozoic.",

Molecular dynamics simulations show more fluctuations of the DNA structure in select monovalent ions (Na + and K + ) compared to divalent ions (Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ). A key highlight is the successful assembly of DNA motifs in nickel-containing buffer at temperatures below 40°C, otherwise unachievable at higher temperatures or using an annealing protocol. DNA nanostructures isothermally assembled in different ions do not affect the viability of fibroblasts, myoblasts, and myotubes or the immune response in myoblasts.

Here, we combine simulations with limited proteolysis (LiP) and cross-linking (XL) mass spectrometry (MS) to study the protein phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). Simulations recapitulate its stretched-exponential folding kinetics and reveal that misfolded states involving changes of entanglement underlie this behavior: either formation of a nonnative, noncovalent lasso entanglement or failure to form a native entanglement. These misfolded states act as kinetic traps, requiring extensive unfolding to escape, which results in a distribution of free energy barriers and pathway partitioning. Using LiP-MS and XL-MS, we propose heterogeneous structural ensembles consistent with these data that represent the potential long-lived misfolded states PGK populates. This structural and energetic heterogeneity creates a hierarchy of refolding timescales, explaining stretched-exponential kinetics.",

The hydrogen bonds shorter than 2.5 angstrom are expected to accelerate the ion transport.

This work develops an interlayer confinement strategy to construct SHB networks in a two-dimensional (2D) nanocapillary assembled by bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) nanosheets and boost the ionic conductivity of HEMs. With confined nanochannels and adjustable hydrophilic groups in BiOI-based HEMs, the number of SHBs increases by 12 times, creating a shortcut for the Grotthuss-type anion transport, which in turn affords a high ionic conductivity of 168 millisiemens per centimeter at 90°C, higher than polymeric HEM and 2D-based HEM. This work demonstrates the facile approach to generating SHB networks in 2D capillaries and opens a promising avenue to developing advanced HEMs.",

The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signaling directly and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction could offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein–containing complexes.",

Our results show that B-site substitution, particularly with alkaline-earth and lanthanide elements, notably strengthens lattice interactions, restrains octahedral oscillation, and increases iodine-migration barriers, outperforming the commonly used A-site and X-site substitutions and interstitial doping. Moreover, the enhanced barrier aligns with the geometric factor of μτ (tolerance-octahedral product), underlining the superior effectiveness of co- and multiple-element B-site doping in lattice stabilization and ion migration suppression. Experimental validation with exemplary hysteresis-free Eu-Ca–doped perovskite single crystals demonstrates remarkable improvements in ambient stability and transport properties.

We present terahertz (THz) spectra, which directly probe the intermolecular interactions of water under these extreme conditions. While we spectroscopically detect the liquid-gas phase transition just below the critical point, THz spectra of the high-temperature gas phase are indistinguishable from those of supercritical water at the same density.

          "abstract": "We propose a mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme uses cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.",

          "abstract": "Brain age gap (BAG), the deviation between estimated brain age and chronological age, is a promising marker of brain health. However, the genetic architecture and reliable targets for brain aging remains poorly understood. In this study, we estimate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based brain age using deep learning models trained on the UK Biobank and validated with three external datasets. A genome-wide association study for BAG identified two unreported loci and seven previously reported loci. By integrating Mendelian Randomization (MR) and colocalization analysis on eQTL and pQTL data, we prioritized seven genetically supported druggable genes, including MAPT , TNFSF12 , GZMB , SIRPB1 , GNLY , NMB , and C1RL , as promising targets for brain aging. We rediscovered 13 potential drugs with evidence from clinical trials of aging and prioritized several drugs with strong genetic support. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of brain aging, potentially facilitating drug development for brain aging to extend the health span.",

          "abstract": "Understanding plastics’ harmful impacts on wildlife would benefit from the application of hypothesis agnostic testing commonly used in medical research to detect declines in population health. Adopting a data-driven, proteomic approach, we assessed changes in 745 proteins in a free-living nonmodel organism with differing levels of plastic exposure. Seabird chicks heavily affected by plastic ingestion demonstrated a range of negative health consequences: Intracellular components that should not be found in the blood were frequently detected, indicative of cell lysis. Secreted proteins were less abundant, indicating that the stomach, liver, and kidneys are not functioning as normal. Alarmingly, these signatures included evidence of neurodegeneration in &lt;90-day-old seabird chicks with high levels of ingested plastic. The proteomic signatures reflect the effects of plastic distal to the site of exposure (i.e., the stomach). Notably, metrics commonly used to assess condition in wildlife (such as body mass) do not provide an accurate description of health or the impacts of plastic ingestion.",

          "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is an inevitable stage in the progression of most chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment of liver fibrosis are crucial for effectively managing chronic liver conditions. However, there lacks a noninvasive and sensitive imaging method capable of early assessing fibrosis activity. Here, we report a molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probe for imaging fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed on activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) even in very early fibrotic livers. This method relies on FAP-catalyzed in situ self-assembly of its substrate probe that leads to the increase of the rotational correlation time (τ R ) of probe, thereby notably amplifies T 1 MRI signal. Thanks to the superior specificity and efficiency of enzymatic reaction, our method has been validated as highly selective and sensitive to FAP in two liver fibrosis mouse models. By establishing a direct correlation between MRI signals and fibrosis activity, our method enables continuous monitoring of liver fibrotic disease progression and assessment of treatment responses.",

          "abstract": "Polymer blend films exhibit unique properties and have applications in various fields. However, understanding their nanoscale structures and polymer component distributions remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy–based technique called oxygen-excluded nanoimaging. By using point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography with sulfonate-based dye molecules, we achieved nanoscale imaging of polymer blend films while specifically labeling non-oxygen domains and excluding oxygen-containing domains. This selectivity is attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged sulfonate groups in the dye molecules and the oxygen atoms in the polymer side chains. We demonstrate the applicability of oxygen-excluded nanoimaging to various polymer blend films, enabling domain identification and visualization of nanoscale structures. Our oxygen-excluded nanoimaging technique provides unique insights into the complex phase separation behavior of polymer blends at the nanoscale, opening possibilities for the nanoscale characterization of a wide range of materials beyond polymer blends.",

          "abstract": "High-affinity and specific binding toward the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS)–related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) remains incompletely understood. We report cryo–electron microscopy structures of eight different S-proteins from SARSr-CoVs found across Asia, Europe, and Africa. These S-proteins all adopt tightly packed, locked, prefusion conformations. These structures enable the classification of SARSr-CoV S-proteins into three types, based on their receptor-binding motif (RBM) structures and ACE2 binding characteristics. Type-2 S-proteins often preferentially bind bat ACE2 (bACE2) over hACE2. We report a structure of a type-2 BtKY72-RBD in complex with bACE2 to understand ACE2 specificity. Structure-guided mutagenesis of BtKY72-RBD reveals that multiple synergistic mutations in four different regions of RBM are required to achieve high-affinity hACE2 binding. Similar RBM changes can also confer hACE2 binding to another type-2 BM48-31 S-protein, which is primarily non-ACE2 binding. These results provide an understanding of how high-affinity hACE2 binding may be acquired by SARSr-CoV S-proteins.",

          "abstract": "When neutral water is sprayed, oppositely charged microdroplets are formed. The close approach of oppositely charged microdroplets causes an electrical discharge and leads to luminescent emission. The light emission happens without any external voltage applied, and the electrical discharge is sufficiently energetic to excite, dissociate, or ionize surrounding neutral gas molecules. Thus, sprayed water microdroplets cause chemical reactions to occur. Similar findings to the Urey-Miller experiment were observed by spraying room temperature water microdroplets into a gas mixture containing nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, which leads to the synthesis of organic molecules containing carbon-nitrogen (C─N) bonds. These observations provide another explanation for unique reactivity at the gas-water interface, as well as a possible mechanism for making the building blocks of life on early Earth.",

          "abstract": "Manipulating the ionic-electronic coupling in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) offers opportunities for interesting phenomena and advanced applications but has not been systematically exploited. Here, we develop monolithically integrated solid-state vertical OECTs to fully explore polyelectrolyte’s strengths, enabling the OECTs to switch between neuromorphic and logic functions. This transition capability is achieved by mastering the complex transport of large-size polycations within the channel through well-designed drain electrodes. Frame drains positioned atop the organic channel act as ion barriers, regulating the penetration and relaxation of polycations. This regulation allows our multilevel synaptic OECTs to transform from short-term depression (STD) to STD-based long-term memory, and eventually to long-term depression (LTD). Conversely, placing frame drains beneath the channel exposes the polyelectrolyte fully, hence yielding high-density logic OECTs, which have been successfully used to construct unipolar integrated circuits such as NOT, NAND, and NOR gates. These achievements represent a substantial advancement in manipulating polyelectrolyte-based ionic-electronic interactions, introducing more possibilities beyond small ion-based OECTs.",
