          "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in phenotypically normal tissue are common across adult organs 1,2 . This suggests that multiple events need to converge to drive tumorigenesis and that many processes such as tissue differentiation may protect against carcinogenesis. WNT–β-catenin signalling maintains zonal differentiation during liver homeostasis 3,4 . However, the CTNNB1 oncogene—encoding β-catenin—is also frequently mutated in hepatocellular carcinoma, resulting in aberrant WNT signalling that promotes cell growth 5,6 . Here we investigated the antagonistic interplay between WNT-driven growth and differentiation in zonal hepatocyte populations during liver tumorigenesis. We found that β-catenin mutations co-operate with exogenous MYC expression to drive a proliferative translatome. Differentiation of hepatocytes to an extreme zone 3 fate suppressed this proliferative translatome. Furthermore, a GLUL and Lgr5 -positive perivenous subpopulation of zone 3 hepatocytes were refractory to WNT-induced and MYC-induced tumorigenesis. However, when mutant CTNNB1 and MYC alleles were activated sporadically across the liver lobule, a subset of mutant hepatocytes became proliferative and tumorigenic. These early lesions were characterized by reduced WNT pathway activation and elevated MAPK signalling, which suppresses zone 3 differentiation. The proliferative lesions were also dependent on IGFBP2–mTOR–cyclin D1 pathway signalling, in which inhibition of either IGFBP2 or mTOR suppressed proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, we propose that zonal identity dictates hepatocyte susceptibility to WNT-driven tumorigenesis and that escaping WNT-induced differentiation is essential for liver cancer.",

          "abstract": "During the past decade, our understanding of eukaryotic evolution has increased immensely. Newly recognized eukaryotic supergroups have been established1,2,3, and most enigmatic orphan lineages have had their relationships resolved4,5,6. Studies on unicellular protist eukaryotes have also been key to understanding the evolution of mitochondria, the fundamental organelles of the eukaryotic cell, which originated from an alphaproteobacterial ancestor. The retention of ancestral alphaproteobacterial pathways in some protist lineages reveals that the mitochondrion of the last eukaryotic common ancestor was more metabolically versatile than are the highly derived mitochondria that are found in most modern eukaryotes7,8. Here we report the discovery of such a unicellular eukaryote, Solarion arienae gen. et sp. nov., an inconspicuous, free-living heterotrophic protist with two morphologically distinct cell types and a novel type of predatory extrusome. We assign Solarion to the new phylum Caelestes. Together with Provora, hemimastigophoreans and Meteora, they form a new eukaryotic supergroup, Disparia. Moreover, S. arienae has some noteworthy traits associated with the mitochondrial genome; in particular, the mitochondrially encoded secA gene, a remnant of an ancestral alphaproteobacterial protein secretion pathway, which has been lost almost entirely in extant mitochondria9,10. The discovery of S. arienae broadens our understanding of early eukaryotic evolution and facilitates the study of proto-mitochondrial metabolic remnants, shedding light on the complexity of ancestral eukaryotic life.",

Despite this constraint, however, there exists incredible diversity in the world’s 7,000 spoken languages, each of which is learned through extensive experience hearing speech in language-specific contexts 1 . It remains unknown which elements of speech processing in the brain depend on daily language experience and which do not. In this study, we recorded high-density cortical activity from adult participants with diverse language backgrounds as they listened to speech in their native language and an unfamiliar foreign language. We found that, regardless of language experience, both native and foreign languages elicited similar cortical responses in the superior temporal gyrus (STG), associated with shared acoustic–phonetic processing of foundational speech sound features 2,3 , such as vowels and consonants. However, only during native language listening did we observe enhanced neural encoding in the STG for word boundaries, word frequency and language-specific sound sequence statistics. In a separate cohort of bilingual participants, this encoding of word- and sequence-level information appeared for both familiar languages in the same individual and in the same STG neural populations. These results indicate that experience-dependent language processing involves dynamic integration of both shared acoustic–phonetic and language-specific sequence- and word-level information in the STG.",

          "abstract": "Ribosome collisions activate the ribotoxic stress response mediated by the MAP3K ZAK, which in turn regulates cell-fate consequences through downstream phosphorylation of the MAPKs p38 and JNK 1 . Despite the critical role of ZAK during cellular stress, a mechanistic and structural understanding of ZAK–ribosome interactions and how these lead to activation remain elusive. Here we combine biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to discover distinct ZAK–ribosome interactions required for constitutive recruitment and for activation. We find that upon induction of ribosome collisions, interactions between ZAK and the ribosomal protein RACK1 enable its activation by dimerization of its SAM domains at the collision interface. Furthermore, we discover how this process is negatively regulated by the ribosome-binding protein SERBP1 to prevent constitutive ZAK activation. Characterization of novel SAM variants as well as a known pathogenic variant of the SAM domain of ZAK supports a key role of the SAM domain in regulating kinase activity on and off the ribosome, with some mutants bypassing the ribosome requirement for ZAK activation. Collectively, our data provide a mechanistic blueprint of the kinase activity of ZAK at the collided ribosome interface.",

          "abstract": "Most molecules of chemistry and biology are chiral, leading to mirror image variants, so called enantiomers. However, while the selective chemical synthesis of molecules where the stereogenicity arises from a carbon atom is well-established, enantioselective approaches to nitrogen-stereogenic molecules are much less common,1-3 and in case of acyclic, N-stereogenic amines, even elusive, due to their rapid pyramidal inversion. We describe here the catalytic asymmetric synthesis of stable, acyclic N-stereogenic amines by the addition of enol silanes to nitronium ions that ion pair to a confined chiral anion. In the produced so-called anomeric amines, the commonly observed isomerization is slowed down by two N-oxy-substituents, which hamper nitrogen inversion. The critical stereogenicity creating step challenges previously established stereochemical descriptors of enantiodifferentiation. Computational studies provide additional insight into the origin of the observed stereocontrol. Our work opens up a new avenue to investigate the fascinating and previously underexplored chemistry of enantiopure anomeric amines.",

          "abstract": "Flexible control of motor timing is crucial for behaviour 1–4 . Before volitional movement begins, the frontal cortex and striatum exhibit ramping spiking activity, with variable ramp slopes anticipating movement onsets 5–12 . This activity in the cortico-basal ganglia loop may function as an adjustable ‘timer,’ triggering actions at the desired timing. However, because the frontal cortex and striatum share similar ramping dynamics and are both necessary for timing behaviours, distinguishing their individual roles in this timer function remains challenging. Here, to address this, we conducted perturbation experiments combined with multi-regional electrophysiology in mice performing a flexible lick-timing task. Following transient silencing of the frontal cortex, cortical and striatal activity swiftly returned to pre-silencing levels and resumed ramping, leading to a shift in lick timing close to the silencing duration. Conversely, briefly inhibiting the striatum caused a gradual decrease in ramping activity in both regions, with ramping resuming from post-inhibition levels, shifting lick timing beyond the inhibition duration. Thus, inhibiting the frontal cortex and striatum effectively paused and rewound the timer, respectively. These findings are consistent with a model in which the striatum is part of a network that temporally integrates input from the frontal cortex and generates ramping activity that regulates motor timing.",

          "abstract": "The colorectal epithelium is rapidly renewing, with remarkable capacity to regenerate following injury. In colorectal cancer (CRC), this regenerative capacity can be co-opted to drive epithelial plasticity. While oncogenic MAPK signalling in CRC is common, with frequent mutations of both KRAS (40-50%) and BRAF (10%)1, inhibition of this pathway typically drives resistance clinically. Given the development of KRAS inhibitors, and licensing of BRAF inhibitor combinations2-4, we have interrogated key mechanisms of resistance to these agents in advanced preclinical CRC models. We show that oncogenic MAPK signalling induces epithelial state changes in vivo, driving adoption of a regenerative/revival stem like population, while inhibition leads to rapid transcriptional remodeling of both Kras- and Braf-mutant tumours, favoring a Wnt-associated, canonical stem phenotype. This drives acute therapeutic resistance in Kras- and delayed resistance in Braf-driven models. Importantly, where plasticity is restrained, such as in early metastatic disease, or through targeting ligand-dependent Wnt-pathway Rnf43 mutations, marked therapeutic responses are observed. This explains the super response to BRAF+EGFR targeted therapies previously observed in a BRAF/RNF43 co-mutant patient population, highlighting the criticality of cellular plasticity in therapeutic response. Together, our data provides clear insight into the mechanisms underpinning resistance to MAPK targeted therapies in CRC. Moreover, strategies that aim to corral stem cell fate, restrict epithelial plasticity or intervene when tumours lack heterogeneity may improve therapeutic efficacy of these agents.",

          "abstract": "Non-invasive skin permeation is widely used for convenient transdermal delivery of small-molecule therapeutics (less than 500 Da) with appropriate hydrophobicities 1 . However, it has long been deemed infeasible for large molecules—particularly polymers, proteins and peptides 2,3 —due to the formidable barrier posed by the skin structure. Here we show that the fast skin-permeable polyzwitterion poly[2-( N -oxide- N,N -dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OP) can efficiently penetrate the stratum corneum, viable epidermis and dermis into circulation. OP is protonated to be cationic and is therefore enriched in the acidic sebum and paracellular stratum corneum lipids containing fatty acids, and subsequently diffuses through the intercorneocyte lipid lamella. Beneath the stratum corneum, at the normal physiological pH, OP becomes a neutral polyzwitterion, ‘hopping’ on cell membranes, enabling its efficient migration through the epidermis and dermis and ultimately entering dermal lymphatic vessels and systemic circulation. As a result, OP-conjugated insulin efficiently permeates through the skin into the blood circulation; transdermal administration of OP-conjugated insulin at a dose of 116 U kg −1 into mice with type 1 diabetes quickly lowers their blood glucose levels to the normal range, and a transdermal dose of 29 U kg −1 normalizes the blood glucose levels of diabetic minipigs. Thus, the skin-permeable polymer may enable non-invasive transdermal delivery of insulin, relieving patients with diabetes from subcutaneous injections and potentially facilitating patient-friendly use of other protein- and peptide-based therapeutics through transdermal delivery.",

          "abstract": "Generative genomic models can design increasingly complex biological systems 1 . However, controlling these models to generate novel sequences with desired functions remains challenging. Here, we show that Evo, a genomic language model, can leverage genomic context to perform function-guided design that accesses novel regions of sequence space. By learning semantic relationships across prokaryotic genes 2 , Evo enables a genomic ‘autocomplete’ in which a DNA prompt encoding genomic context for a function of interest guides the generation of novel sequences enriched for related functions, which we refer to as ‘semantic design’. We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and type II and III toxin–antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant sequence similarity to natural proteins. In-context design of proteins and non-coding RNAs with Evo achieves robust activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural priors, known evolutionary conservation or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to complete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a database containing over 120 billion base pairs of artificial intelligence-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic design across many functions. More broadly, these results demonstrate that generative genomics with biological language models can extend beyond natural sequences.",

          "abstract": "Proper brain function requires the precise assembly of neural circuits during development. Despite the identification of many cell-surface proteins (CSPs) that help guide axons to their targets 1,2 , it remains mostly unknown how multiple CSPs work together to assemble a functional circuit. Here we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit 3,4 to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN), which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male–male courtship, we switched its connection nearly completely from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type to a new PN type that promotes courtship. From this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attraction between synaptic partners and repulsion between non-partners 5,6 . The anatomical switch changed the odour response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male–male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring—increasing repulsion with the old partner, decreasing repulsion with the new partner and matching attraction with the new partner—to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work shows that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving the way to investigations of how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.",

          "abstract": "Precise genome-editing technologies such as base editing 1,2 and prime editing 3 can correct most pathogenic gene variants, but their widespread clinical application is impeded by the need to develop new therapeutic agents for each mutation. For diseases that are caused by premature stop codons, suppressor tRNAs (sup-tRNAs) offer a more general strategy. Existing approaches to use sup-tRNAs therapeutically, however, require lifelong administration 4,5 or show modest potency, necessitating potentially toxic overexpression. Here we present prime editing-mediated readthrough of premature termination codons (PERT), a strategy to rescue nonsense mutations in a disease-agnostic manner by using prime editing to permanently convert a dispensable endogenous tRNA into an optimized sup-tRNA. Iterative screening of thousands of variants of all 418 human tRNAs identified tRNAs with the strongest sup-tRNA potential. We optimized prime editing agents to install an engineered sup-tRNA at a single genomic locus without overexpression and observed efficient readthrough of premature termination codons and protein rescue in human cell models of Batten disease, Tay–Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. In vivo delivery of a single prime editor that converts an endogenous mouse tRNA into a sup-tRNA extensively rescued disease pathology in a model of Hurler syndrome. PERT did not induce detected readthrough of natural stop codons or cause significant transcriptomic or proteomic changes. Our findings suggest the potential of disease-agnostic therapeutic genome-editing approaches that require only a single composition of matter to treat diverse genetic diseases.",

          "abstract": "Insulating nanomaterials have large energy gaps and are only electrically accessible under extreme conditions, such as high-intensity radiation and high temperature, pressure or voltage 1,2 . Lanthanide-doped insulating nanoparticles (LnNPs) are widely studied owing to their exceptional luminescence properties, including bright, narrow-linewidth, non-blinking and non-bleaching emission in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) range 3,4 . However, it has not been possible to electrically generate excited states in these insulating nanomaterials under low biases and, therefore, not possible to fabricate optoelectronic devices from these systems. Here we report an electrical excitation pathway to obtain emission from LnNPs. By forming LnNP@organic molecule nanohybrids, in which the recombination of electrically injected charges on the organic molecule is followed by efficient triplet energy transfer (TET) to the LnNP, it is possible to turn on LnNPs under a low operating bias. We demonstrate this excitation pathway in light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with low turn-on voltages of about 5 V, very narrow electroluminescence (EL) spectra and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) greater than 0.6% in the NIR-II window 5 . Our LnNP-based LEDs (LnLEDs) also allow for widely tunable EL properties, by changing the type and concentration of lanthanide dopants. These results open up a new field of hybrid optoelectronic devices and provide new opportunities for the electrically driven excitation sources based on lanthanide nanomaterials for biomedical and optoelectronic applications.",

Previous studies linking neural coding and cortical connectivity have focused on input-driven activity in the sensory cortex1,2,3. Here we studied neural activity in the motor cortex while mice gathered rewards with multidirectional tongue reaching. This behaviour does not require training, allowing us to probe neural coding and connectivity before activity is shaped by extended learning. Motor cortex neurons were tuned to target location and reward outcome, and typically responded during and after movements. We studied the underlying network interactions in vivo by estimating causal neural connections using an all-optical method3,4,5,6. Mapping connectivity between more than 20,000,000 excitatory neuron pairs showed a multi-scale columnar architecture in layer 2/3 of the motor cortex. Neurons displayed local (less than 100 µm) like-to-like excitatory connectivity according to target-location tuning, and inhibition over longer spatial scales. Connectivity patterns comprised a continuum, with abundant sparsely connected neurons and rare densely connected neurons that function as network hubs. Hub neurons were weakly tuned to target location and reward outcome but influenced more neighbouring neurons. This network of neurons, encoding location and outcome of movements to different motor goals, may be a general substrate for rapid learning of complex, goal-directed behaviours.",

Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that T cells from clusters were enriched for gene signatures associated with tumour reactivity and exhaustion. Clustered T cells exhibited increased TCR clonality indicative of expansion, whereas TCR-matched T cells showed more exhaustion and co-modulation when conjugated to APCs than when conjugated to tumour cells. T cells that were expanded from clusters ex vivo exerted on average ninefold increased killing activity towards autologous melanomas, which was accompanied by enhanced cytokine production. After adoptive cell transfer into mice, T cells from clusters showed improved patient-derived melanoma control, which was associated with increased T cell infiltration and activation. Together, these results demonstrate that tumour-reactive CD8 + T cells are enriched in functional clusters with tumour cells and/or APCs and that they can be isolated and expanded from clinical samples. Typically excluded by single-cell gating in flow cytometry, these distinct heterotypic T cell clusters are a valuable source to decipher functional tumour–immune cell interactions and may also be therapeutically explored.",

          "abstract": "Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent and devastating form of oncogene amplification in cancer 1,2 . Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres, stochastically segregate during cell division 3–6 and persist over many generations. It has been more than 40 years since ecDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear 3,7 . Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. Using Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that we developed, we reveal thousands of human retention elements that confer generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromosome conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions that are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins. This activity intermolecularly recapitulates promoter–enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated. Targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, which suggests that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, and reveal the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.",

Each CSP pair exhibits inverse expression patterns in the select ORN–PN partners. Loss of each CSP in ORNs led to similar synaptic partner matching deficits as the loss of its partner CSP in PNs, and mistargeting phenotypes caused by overexpressing one CSP could be suppressed by loss of its partner CSP.

Through careful control of dopant composition and concentration in nanocrystals, we also achieve wide-ranging multicolour EL without altering the device architecture, reaching an external quantum efficiency exceeding 5.9% for Tb3+.

At temperatures below 10 K, the superconductivity in PtBi 2 gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, whereas its bulk states remain normal 2 . The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the centre of the Fermi arcs and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space.

          "title": "Putting nature on the balance sheet: how to account for the ecological costs of our actions",
          "authors": "Jacob Hochard",
          "abstract": "On Natural Capital: The Value of the World Around Us Partha Dasgupta Witness (2025)\n\nAn economist might celebrate a nation achieving record economic growth on one day, yet overlook a coral reef lying bleached and lifeless on another. This contradiction must be challenged, writes economist Partha Dasgupta in his elegant account of why the global economic system is exploiting, rather than sustaining, life on our planet.\n\nOn Natural Capital recaps the roaring economic advances of the past 75 years, including improved life expectancies and education and fewer people living in poverty. But it also shares how economic progress has benefited from the exploitation of our planet: an ecological debt that conventional accounting leaves off the balance sheet.\n\nHow to build nature back better — read this manual\n\nDasgupta starts by vividly portraying the essential workings of Earth’s life-support systems and how living processes regulate the climate, replenish soils and sustain food webs. He notes that one-third of the planet’s remaining wetlands, which are crucial for filtering nutrients, providing flood protection and storing carbon, have been lost between 1970 and 2015 owing to infrastructure construction, urban expansion and other human activities. He also describes how deforestation can create savannah-like conditions in parts of the tropics, because the disruption of moisture-recycling processes decreases rainfall and ecological productivity.\n\nNext, Dasgupta examines why economic principles have long treated nature’s functions as background scenery. He explains that this omission is rooted in the mid-twentieth-century origins of growth and development economics, in which economists constructed models that explained output using only human labour and skills, and physical goods. This was a reasonable assumption back when natural resources seemed abundant, the world wasn’t pressing against planetary limits and forests, soils and fisheries seemed too plentiful to constrain growth. What began as a practical simplification evolved into a blind spot.\n\nUneasy trade-offs\n\nBy stitching these two narratives together, Dasgupta succeeds in portraying woodlands, watersheds and wild species as bona fide assets, the depletion of which undermines the prosperity statistics that governments use to track and celebrate progress. He solidifies this narrative by estimating that humanity’s collective demand on nature now exceeds the planet’s regenerative capacity by around 70%. Effectively, this means that, since the early 1970s, we have been living off the planet’s ‘capital’ rather than the accrued ‘interest’, jeopardizing our biosphere’s solvency.\n\nBeyond growth — why we need to agree on an alternative to GDP now\n\nAs Dasgupta’s writing flows between nature’s processes and economic principles, he stresses the uneasy trade-offs that societies navigate daily. Each tonne of fish landed or cubic metre of water taken for irrigation is a draw on assets that must remain intact to avoid compromising future yields of food, income and ecological stability.\n\nDasgupta reminds us that these choices are not simply about extraction but also about stewardship. Overfishing might boost a nation’s gross domestic product for one fiscal quarter, yet deplete the reproductive stock that sustains the following year’s catch. Likewise, draining wetlands to generate farmland might bring an immediate harvest, yet erode the flood protection and nutrient-cycling processes that make such agriculture possible.\n\nSustainable forestry management preserves biodiversity and allows forests to regenerate.Credit: Alexander Manzyuk/Anadolu Agency/Getty\n\nThe constant tension between nature’s bounty and the ecological conditions that make that bounty possible is revealed brilliantly by Dasgupta but left out of the accounting practices that currently define progress. As a result, society perceives the conversion of natural resources as costless profit and celebrates growth figures, but the natural systems that made that growth possible decline quietly.\n\nDasgupta’s call to put nature on the balance sheet is timely precisely because it indicates a rapidly expanding movement in policy that is beginning to give the natural world the accounting treatment it has often lacked.\n\nChallenges ahead\n\nCountries such as the Netherlands, Canada and Colombia are developing or trialling natural-capital accounting and statistical frameworks that treat ecosystems as assets: measuring their stock (for example, wetlands, forests and soil microorganisms), tracking their depreciation (or appreciation) and defining the ‘interest’ they generate, such as flood protection and carbon storage.\n\nEnvironmental politics is doomed to fail — unless we tell better stories\n\nIn the corporate domain, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures is a market-led, government-supported and science-based global initiative that encourages companies to include nature in their financial reports. It provides firms with a framework for disclosing nature-related risks, including biodiversity loss, as well as dependencies, such as supply-chain access to clean water.\n\nDasgupta highlights both the promise of natural-capital accounting as well as the areas that need improvement. Markets are finally aligning with the reality that woodlands, watersheds, wildlife and other aspects of the natural world are not ‘free’ inputs but assets, and their degradation erodes prosperity. The gaps, he emphasizes, lie in the valuation of natural systems (how to reliably price ecosystem services), governance (who owns and manages those assets) and integration (how to incorporate natural-capital metrics into macroeconomic indicators).",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Gibney",
          "abstract": "No one could accuse Demis Hassabis of dreaming small.\n\nIn 2016, the company he co-founded, DeepMind, shocked the world when an artificial intelligence model it created beat the best human player of the strategy game Go. Then Hassabis set his sights even higher: in 2019, he told colleagues that his goal was to win Nobel prizes with the company’s AI tools.\n\nChemistry Nobel goes to developers of AlphaFold AI that predicts protein structures\n\nIt took only five years for Hassabis and DeepMind’s John Jumper to do so, collecting a share of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for creating AlphaFold, the AI that revolutionized the prediction of protein structures.\n\nAlphaFold is just one in a string of science successes that DeepMind has achieved over the past decade. When he co-founded the company in 2010, Hassabis, a neuroscientist and game developer, says his aim was to make “a world-class scientific research lab, but in industry”. In that quest, the company sought to apply the scientific method to the development of AI, and to do so ethically and responsibly by anticipating risks and reducing potential harms. Establishing an AI ethics board was a condition of the firm’s agreement to be acquired by Google in 2014 for around US$400 million, according to media reports.\n\nNow Google DeepMind is trying to replicate the success of AlphaFold in other fields of science. “We’re applying AI to nearly every other scientific discipline now,” says Hassabis.\n\nDemis Hassabis co-founded DeepMind in 2010.Credit: Antonio Olmos/Guardian/eyevine\n\nBut the climate for this marriage of science and industry has changed drastically since the release of ChatGPT in 2022 — an event that Hassabis calls a “wake-up moment”. The arrival of chatbots and the large language models (LLMs) that power them led to an explosion in AI usage across society, as well as a scramble by a growing number of well-funded competitors to achieve human-level artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nGoogle DeepMind is now racing to release commercial products — including iterations of the firm’s Gemini LLMs — almost weekly, while continuing its machine-learning research and producing science-specific models. The acceleration has made doing responsible AI harder, and some staff are unhappy with the firm’s more commercial outlook, say several former employees.\n\nAll of this raises questions about where DeepMind is headed, and whether it can achieve blockbuster successes in other fields of science.\n\nNobel bound\n\nAt Google DeepMind’s slick headquarters in London’s King’s Cross technology hub, gleaming geometric sculptures and the smell of espresso hang in the reception hall. Time is so precious that staff members — thought to number between 500 and 1,000 worldwide — can pick up a scooter to race the few hundred metres from one office to another.\n\nIt’s a far cry from the humble origins of the company, which sought to build general AI systems by melding ideas from neuroscience and machine learning. “They were absolutely just super geniuses,” says Joanna Bryson, a computer scientist and researcher in AI ethics at the Hertie School in Berlin. “They were these 12 guys that everybody wanted.”\n\nThe laboratory pioneered the deep-learning AI technique, which uses simulated neurons to learn associations in data after studying real-world examples, as well as reinforcement learning, in which a model learns by trial, error and reward. After applying these to teach models how to play arcade games1 in 2015 and master the ancient game of Go2 in 2016, DeepMind turned its sights to its first scientific problem — predicting the 3D structure of proteins3 from their constituent amino acids.\n\nA member of the AlphaFold team examines a prediction of a protein structure.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nHassabis first came across the puzzle of protein structure as an undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, UK, in the 1990s and noted it as being a problem that AI might one day help to solve. AI learning techniques require a database of examples as well as clear metrics of success that guide the model’s progress. Thanks to a long-standing database of known structures and an established competition that judged the accuracy of the predictions, proteins had both.\n\nProtein folding ticked a crucial box for Hassabis: it is a ‘root node’ problem that, once solved, opens up branches of downstream research and applications. Those kinds of problem “are worth spending five years or ten years on, and loads of computers and researchers”, he says.\n\nWhat’s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution\n\nDeepMind released its first iteration of AlphaFold in 2018, and by 2020, its performance far outstripped that of tools from any other team. Today, a spin-off from DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, is seeking to use AlphaFold in drug discovery. And DeepMind’s AlphaFold database of more than 200 million protein-structure predictions has been used in a range of research efforts, from improving bee immunity to disease in the face of global population declines to screening for antiparasitic compounds to treat Chagas disease, a potentially life-threatening parasitic infection4.\n\nScience is not just a source of problems to solve; the firm tries to approach all of its AI development in a scientific way, says Pushmeet Kohli, who leads the company’s science efforts. Researchers tend to go back to first principles for each problem and try fresh techniques, he says. Staff members at many other AI firms are more like engineers, applying ingenuity but not doing basic discovery, says Jonathan Godwin, chief executive of the AI firm Orbital Materials in London, who was a researcher at Google DeepMind until the end of 2022.\n\nJohn Jumper and Pushmeet Kohli speak to researcher Olaf Ronneberger in the DeepMind offices.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nBut replicating the success of AlphaFold will be tough: “Not many scientific endeavours work like that,” says Godwin.\n\nUnlocking the genome\n\nGoogle DeepMind is throwing its resources at several problems for which it thinks AI could speed development, and which could have “transformative impact”, says Kohli. These include weather forecasting5 and nuclear fusion, which has the potential to become a clean, abundant energy source. The company picks projects through a strict selection process, but individual researchers can choose which to work on and how to tackle a problem, he says. AI models that work on such problems often require specialized data and researchers to program knowledge into them.\n\nOne project that shows promise, says Kohli, is AlphaGenome, which launched in June as an attempt to decipher long stretches of human non-coding DNA and predict their possible functions6. But the challenge is harder than for AlphaFold, because each sequence yields multiple valid functions.\n\nMaterials science is another area in which the company hopes that AI could be revolutionary. Materials are hard to model because the complex interactions of atomic nuclei and electrons can only be approximated. Learning from a database of simulated structures, DeepMind developed its GNoME model, which in 2023 predicted 400,000 potential new substances7. Now, Kohli says, the team is using machine learning to develop better ways to simulate electron behaviour, ones that are learnt from example interactions rather than by relying on the principles of physics. The end goal is to predict materials with specific properties, such as magnetism or superconductivity, he says. “We want to see the era where AI can basically design any material with any sort of magical property that you want, if it is possible,” he says.\n\nJohn Jumper and Pushmeet Kohli in the headquarters building.Credit: Alecsandra Dragoi for Nature\n\nAI models have a variety of known safety issues, from the risk of being used to create bioweapons to the perpetuation of racial and gender-based biases, and these come to the fore when releasing models into the world. Google DeepMind has a dedicated committee on responsibility and safety that works across the company and is consulted at each major stage of development, says Anna Koivuniemi, who runs its ‘impact accelerator’, an effort to scour society for areas in which AI could make a difference. Committee members stress-test the idea to see what could go wrong, including by consulting externally. “We take it very, very seriously,” she says.\n\nAnother advantage the firm has is that its researchers are pursuing the kind of AI that the world ultimately wants, says Godwin. “People don’t really want random videos of themselves being generated and put on a social-media network; they want limitless energy or diseases being cured,” he says.\n\nBut DeepMind now has company in the quest to use AI for science. Some firms that started out making LLMs seem to be coming around to Hassabis’ vision of AI for science. In the past two months, both OpenAI and the Paris-based AI firm Mistral have created teams dedicated to scientific discovery.\n\nCompany concerns\n\nFor AI companies and researchers, OpenAI’s 2022 release of ChatGPT changed everything. Its success was “pretty surprising to everyone”, says Hassabis.",

Credit: Christoph Burgstedt/SPL\n\nA single multipurpose gene-editing tool can correct several genetic conditions by restoring proteins that have been truncated by disease-causing mutations. The method might one day overcome a key stumbling block faced by gene-editing therapies: the need to design a bespoke treatment for each disease.\n\nThe new approach, called PERT, combines gene editing with engineered RNA molecules that allow protein synthesis to continue even when a mutation in the DNA tells it to stop prematurely. Such mutations are called nonsense mutations, and they comprise nearly one-quarter of known disease-causing DNA variants.\n\nPowerful CRISPR system inserts whole gene into human DNA\n\nSo far, PERT has overcome disease-linked nonsense mutations in mice and in human cells grown in culture, but further testing and refinement are needed before the approach can be studied in people, says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a co-author of a paper about the technique.\n\nIf it does prove effective in humans, PERT could drive down the cost and speed up the development of gene-editing therapies for many conditions. “Disease-agnostic approaches like this raise a possibility that, I think, would be incredibly exciting for patients,” says Liu. He and his colleagues published their results on 19 November in Nature1.\n\nPERT proposal\n\nLiu first dreamt up the idea for PERT a few years ago while preparing for an event called science karaoke at his laboratory’s annual retreat. During this event, each member presents an out-of-the-box idea for a project that could send the lab in a new direction. Singing is not required.\n\nFor his project, Liu suggested that the team should investigate synthetic RNA molecules called suppressor tRNAs, which allow a cell’s protein-synthesis machinery to read through a nonsense mutation in the DNA and produce a full-length protein. Suppressor tRNAs, Liu proposed, could be inserted into a genome using a technique called prime editing. At the end of his ten-minute presentation, Liu asked his lab if anyone would be interested in taking on the project; a few members volunteered.\n\nPersonalized gene editing helped one baby: can it be rolled out widely?\n\nAs the team worked to develop PERT, other researchers published promising results using suppressor tRNAs without gene editing. One group used a virus to shuttle the tRNA into cells2; another encased their tRNAs in fatty particles similar to those used in COVID-19 mRNA vaccines3.\n\nEach of these approaches showed promise in animal models with genetic diseases. But viruses can provoke dangerous immune responses, and fatty particles require repeated doses, says Zoya Ignatova, a biochemist at the University of Hamburg in Germany.\n\nGene editing, by contrast, would allow researchers to insert a gene encoding the suppressor tRNA into a recipient’s genome. In theory, no further doses would be needed.",

          "abstract": "US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr and JD Vance shared a stage at the MAHA Summit in Washington DC.Credit: Alex Wroblewski/AFP/Getty\n\nWashington DC\n\nSocial-media influencers and anti-ageing entrepreneurs mingled with top US government officials, including the head of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), at an exclusive event steps from the White House last week. The meeting’s purpose was to discuss the future of health in the United States.\n\nOrganizers called it the MAHA Summit, referring to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s signature ‘Make America Healthy Again’ movement. Attendees included Kennedy, US vice-president JD Vance, NIH director Jayanta Bhattacharya, US Food and Drug Administration chief Marty Makary and the food activist Vani Hari, who blogs under the name Food Babe. Sessions at the summit, which Nature attended, covered a wide range of health-related topics, including psychedelics, brain implants and anti-ageing therapies. Academic researchers and clinicians were not among the speakers at the sessions, which were peppered by comments critical of the medical establishment.\n\nTrump team backs an unproven drug for autism — but does it work?\n\nThe conference showcased the influence of the MAHA movement, whose supporters say there is a chronic-disease epidemic in the United States that they blame in part on corruption in the food and pharmaceutical industries. To combat this epidemic, supporters advocate lifestyle choices, such as improving sleep and taking dietary supplements.\n\nThe movement has ascended rapidly from a loose network of Kennedy supporters into a political force that Vance, speaking at the summit, called “a critical part of our success in Washington”. The event also drew officials from corporate heavyweights, such as Walmart and Google, and biotechnology firms, such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown, New York.\n\n“We didn’t have anything like this,” Robert Redfield, who led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2018 to 2021, during US President Donald Trump’s first term, told Nature at the summit. “Bobby [Kennedy] has gotten industry to sit down with him.”\n\nWarm praise\n\nThe nearly eight-hour summit featured remarks by several officials in Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services. Among them was Bhattacharya, who said that the “MAHA movement is an absolutely incredible thing to me”. He added: “I have waited my entire life to see this movement come.”\n\nOther speakers included mixed-martial-arts promoter Dana White and actor and comedian Russell Brand. Attendees also heard health advice from Bryan Johnson, a Silicon Valley multimillionaire known for his anti-ageing ‘biohacks’, such as receiving plasma transfusions from his teenage son, and his view that his generation might be first to never die.\n\nRFK Jr slings accusations and defends public-health upheaval at fiery hearing\n\nThroughout the event, speakers criticized established scientific and medical institutions. Both are frequent targets of Kennedy, who founded Children’s Health Defense, a non-profit organization in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, that is known for its anti-vaccine advocacy. One of these speakers was Bhattacharya, who said that the NIH, the world’s largest biomedical-research funder, has focused too heavily on small scientific steps instead of “disruptive” or “innovative” research.\n\n“What puts lives at risk is doing research that’s incremental,” Bhattacharya said. “All it does is advance the careers of the researchers that do it. It results in publications that don’t get used and aren’t replicable.”\n\nFollow the science\n\nMakary decried “groupthink that again and again led us astray”, citing as an example public-health recommendations against eating saturated fat. (Kennedy has suggested that saturated fats are part of a healthy diet; the US government has, for decades, recommended limiting saturated-fat consumption.) “We got ‘saturated fat causes heart disease’ wrong for 50 years,” Makary said. “That’s a war we’re going to end.”",

          "title": "Mind-reading devices can now predict preconscious thoughts: is it time to worry?",
          "authors": "Liam Drew",
          "abstract": "Before a car crash in 2008 left her paralysed from the neck down, Nancy Smith enjoyed playing the piano. Years later, Smith started making music again, thanks to an implant that recorded and analysed her brain activity. When she imagined playing an on-screen keyboard, her brain–computer interface (BCI) translated her thoughts into keystrokes — and simple melodies, such as ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’, rang out1.\n\nThe rise of brain-reading technology: what you need to know\n\nBut there was a twist. For Smith, it seemed as if the piano played itself. “It felt like the keys just automatically hit themselves without me thinking about it,” she said at the time. “It just seemed like it knew the tune, and it just did it on its own.”\n\nSmith’s BCI system, implanted as part of a clinical trial, trained on her brain signals as she imagined playing the keyboard. That learning enabled the system to detect her intention to play hundreds of milliseconds before she consciously attempted to do so, says trial leader Richard Andersen, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.\n\nSmith is one of roughly 90 people who, over the past two decades, have had BCIs implanted to control assistive technologies, such as computers, robotic arms or synthetic voice generators. These volunteers — paralysed by spinal-cord injuries, strokes or neuromuscular disorders, such as motor neuron disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) — have demonstrated how command signals for the body’s muscles, recorded from the brain’s motor cortex as people imagine moving, can be decoded into commands for connected devices.\n\nBut Smith, who died of cancer in 2023, was among the first volunteers to have an extra interface implanted in her posterior parietal cortex, a brain region associated with reasoning, attention and planning. Andersen and his team think that by also capturing users’ intentions and pre-motor planning, such ‘dual-implant’ BCIs will improve the performance of prosthetic devices.\n\nNancy Smith used a brain–computer interface to make music after a car accident left her paralysed from the neck down.Credit: Caltech\n\nAndersen’s research also illustrates the potential of BCIs that access areas outside the motor cortex. “The surprise was that when we go into the posterior parietal, we can get signals that are mixed together from a large number of areas,” says Andersen. “There’s a wide variety of things that we can decode.”\n\nThe ability of these devices to access aspects of a person’s innermost life, including preconscious thought, raises the stakes on concerns about how to keep neural data private. It also poses ethical questions about how neurotechnologies might shape people’s thoughts and actions — especially when paired with artificial intelligence.\n\nMeanwhile, AI is enhancing the capabilities of wearable consumer products that record signals from outside the brain. Ethicists worry that, left unregulated, these devices could give technology companies access to new and more precise data about people’s internal reactions to online and other content.\n\nEthicists and BCI developers are now asking how previously inaccessible information should be handled and used. “Whole-brain interfacing is going to be the future,” says Tom Oxley, chief executive of Synchron, a BCI company in New York City. He predicts that the desire to treat psychiatric conditions and other brain disorders will lead to more brain regions being explored. Along the way, he says, AI will continue to improve decoding capabilities and change how these systems serve their users. “It leads you to the final question: how do we make that safe?”\n\nConsumer concerns\n\nConsumer neurotech products capture less-sophisticated data than implanted BCIs do. Unlike implanted BCIs, which rely on the firings of specific collections of neurons, most consumer products rely on electroencephalography (EEG). This measures ripples of electrical activity that arise from the averaged firing of huge neuronal populations and are detectable on the scalp. Rather than being created to capture the best recording possible, consumer devices are designed to be stylish (such as in sleek headbands) or unobtrusive (with electrodes hidden inside headphones or headsets for augmented or virtual reality).\n\nStill, EEG can reveal overall brain states, such as alertness, focus, tiredness and anxiety levels. Companies already offer headsets and software that give customers real-time scores relating to these states, with the intention of helping them to improve their sports performance, meditate more effectively or become more productive, for example.\n\nAI has helped to turn noisy signals from suboptimal recording systems into reliable data, explains Ramses Alcaide, chief executive of Neurable, a neurotech company in Boston, Massachusetts, that specializes in EEG signal processing and sells a headphone-based headset for this purpose. “We’ve made it so that EEG doesn’t suck as much as it used to,” Alcaide says. “Now, it can be used in real-life environments, essentially.”\n\nAnd there is widespread anticipation that AI will allow further aspects of users’ mental processes to be decoded. For example, Marcello Ienca, a neuroethicist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany, says that EEG can detect small voltage changes in the brain that occur within hundreds of milliseconds of a person perceiving a stimulus. Such signals could reveal how their attention and decision-making relate to that specific stimulus.\n\nAlthough accurate user numbers are hard to gather, many thousands of enthusiasts are already using neurotech headsets. And ethicists say that a big tech company could suddenly catapult the devices to widespread use. Apple, for example, patented a design for EEG sensors for future use in its Airpods wireless earphones in 2023.\n\nYet unlike BCIs aimed at the clinic, which are governed by medical regulations and privacy protections, the consumer BCI space has little legal oversight, says David Lyreskog, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, UK. “There’s a wild west when it comes to the regulatory standards,” he says.\n\nIn 2018, Ienca and his colleagues found that most consumer BCIs don’t use secure data-sharing channels or implement state-of-the-art privacy technologies2. “I believe that has not changed,” Ienca says. What’s more, a 2024 analysis3 of the data policies of 30 consumer neurotech companies by the Neurorights Foundation, a non-profit organization in New York City, showed that nearly all had complete control over the data users provided. That means most firms can use the information as they please, including selling it.\n\nNeuralink brain chip: advance sparks safety and secrecy concerns\n\nResponding to such concerns, the government of Chile and the legislators of four US states have passed laws that give direct recordings of any form of nerve activity protected status. But Ienca and Nita Farahany, an ethicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, fear that such laws are insufficient because they focus on the raw data and not on the inferences that companies can make by combining neural information with parallel streams of digital data. Inferences about a person’s mental health, say, or their political allegiances could still be sold to third parties and used to discriminate against or manipulate a person.\n\n“The data economy, in my view, is already quite privacy-violating and cognitive- liberty-violating,” Ienca says. Adding neural data, he says, “is like giving steroids to the existing data economy”.\n\nSeveral key international bodies, including the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, have issued guidelines on these issues. Furthermore, in September, three US senators introduced an act that would require the Federal Trade Commission to review how data from neurotechnology should be protected.\n\nHeading to the clinic\n\nWhile their development advances at pace, so far no implanted BCI has been approved for general clinical use. Synchron’s device is closest to the clinic. This relatively simple BCI allows users to select on-screen options by imagining moving their foot. Because it is inserted into a blood vessel on the surface of the motor cortex, it doesn’t require neurosurgery. It has proved safe, robust and effective in initial trials4, and Oxley says Synchron is discussing a pivotal trial with the US Food and Drug Administration that could lead to clinical approval.\n\nElon Musk’s neurotech firm Neuralink in Fremont, California, has surgically implanted its more complex device in the motor cortices of at least 13 volunteers who are using it to play computer games, for example, and control robotic hands. Company representatives say that more than 10,000 people have joined waiting lists for its clinical trials.\n\nAt least five more BCI companies have tested their devices in humans for the first time over the past two years, making short-term recordings (on timescales ranging from minutes to weeks) in people undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Researchers in the field say the first approvals are likely to be for devices in the motor cortex that restore independence to people who have severe paralysis — including BCIs that enable speech through synthetic voice technology.\n\nAs for what’s next, Farahany says that moving beyond the motor cortex is a widespread goal among BCI developers. “All of them hope to go back further in time in the brain,” she says, “and to get to that subconscious precursor to thought.”\n\nLast year, Andersen’s group published a proof-of-concept study5 in which internal dialogue was decoded from the parietal cortex of two participants, albeit with an extremely limited vocabulary. The team has also recorded from the parietal cortex while a BCI user played the card game blackjack (pontoon)6. Certain neurons responded to the face values of cards, whereas others tracked the cumulative total of a player’s hand. Some even became active when the player decided whether to stick with their current hand or take another card.\n\nCasey Harrell (with his wife Levana Saxon) uses his brain implant to generate synthetic speech.Credit: Ian Bates/New York Times/Redux/eyevine\n\nBoth Oxley and Matt Angle, chief executive of BCI company Paradromics, based in Austin, Texas, agree that BCIs in brain regions other than the motor cortex might one day help to diagnose and treat psychiatric conditions. Maryam Shanechi, an engineer and computer scientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, is working towards this goal — in part by aiming to identify and monitor neural signatures of psychiatric diseases and their symptoms7.\n\nBCIs could potentially track such symptoms in a person, deliver stimulation that adjusts neural activity and quantify how the brain responds to that stimulation or other interventions. “That feedback is important, because you want to precisely tailor the therapy to that individual’s own needs,” Shanechi says.\n\nShanechi does not yet know whether the neural correlates of psychiatric symptoms will be trackable across many brain regions or whether they will require recording from specific brain areas. Either way, a central aspect of her work is building foundation models of brain activity. Such models, constructed by training AI algorithms on thousands of hours of neural data from numerous people, would in theory be generalizable across individuals’ brains.",

Credit: Ilnur Khisamutdinov/Alamy\n\nOn 10 November, hackers gained access to a Princeton University database containing the personal information of those in the institution’s community, including alumni, donors and students. In October, similar data breaches occurred at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThese incidents are part of a broader trend. Over the past few years, cyberattacks have been on the rise at academic institutions around the globe. Not only are attacks time-consuming and costly to contain and clean up, but they have also caused university employees to lose access to essential digital services, such as e-mail and research software, for weeks — or even months — at a time.\n\n“The number of cyberattacks is not relenting,” says Harjinder Singh Lallie, a cybersecurity specialist at the University of Warwick, UK.\n\nUniversities have been working to implement more robust security systems, but specialists say that academic institutions need to do more to shore up defences, especially against attacks that are assisted by artificial intelligence (AI), which might enable hackers to conduct breaches with greater speed and ease.\n\nToby Murray, a cybersecurity researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia, says that in today’s political climate, in which competition between countries has been on the rise, “universities remain a really attractive target”. It’s often difficult to trace where attacks come from, but some have been linked to state-sponsored groups, and often involve the use of ransomware, malicious software that blocks data or systems until a payment is made.\n\nNEWS: Cyberattacks are hitting research institutions — with devastating effects\n\nWhat makes universities vulnerable?\n\nAcross all sectors, from government organizations to private companies, cyberattacks have been increasing. Specialists say that universities are particularly vulnerable because of the valuable data they house, such as employee records and intellectual property, and because these institutions are difficult to secure. Many universities have older, outdated security systems as well as diverse digital infrastructures and communities that can make it easy for hackers to infiltrate such systems.\n\n“It’s going to get worse,” says David Batho, the director of security at Jisc, an organization that provides digital infrastructure to educational institutions in the United Kingdom. “Prevention is no longer enough. Building resilience is essential.”\n\nA UK government survey carried out between August and December last year, revealed that the country’s educational institutions have had a high prevalence of cybersecurity breaches and were more likely to experience such incidents than were other businesses. According to an accompanying report, 91% of higher education institutions and 85% of further education colleges reported having experienced such an incident in the past 12 months.\n\nQuantum hacking looms — but ultra-secure encryption is ready to deploy",

          "title": "Waste not: how researchers harness pee and poo for science",
          "authors": "Hannah Docter-Loeb",
          "abstract": "As Mathilde Poyet ushers me through the Global Microbiome Conservancy’s laboratory in Kiel, Germany, I’m met with all sorts of state-of-the-art equipment. It’s an impressive facility, with typical lab apparatus, such as incubators, the latest sequencing devices and anaerobic chambers for culturing bacteria. But the most important stuff in the lab is stored in a freezer at −80 ºC. The samples are so crucial that there is a back-up battery system — if the electricity to the freezers goes off, the materials will remain intact. These test-tube samples aren’t some immortality serum or cancer-fighting bacteria: they’re faeces.\n\nTo be precise, they’re suspended stool samples and bacteria that have been cultured from faeces. But at one point, this was poo that Poyet and her colleagues, including her partner Mathieu Groussin, had collected as part of their work for the Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMbC), of which Groussin is a co-founder. Poyet likes to call the project their “first baby” (one of their real babies, their infant daughter Aelis, joins us in their office as we speak).\n\n“We’ve seen all sorts of poop across the Bristol stool scale — all shapes, all sizes, all colours,” says Poyet, referring to the stool classification chart physicians use to assess digestive issues.\n\nPoyet and Groussin’s work is predicated on the idea that faeces provide an ideal snapshot of the human gut microbiome: the genetic content of the community of organisms found in intestines. This differs across populations1 and can serve as a health indicator. Most research on the human gut microbiome focuses on populations of European descent. But the GMbC solicits samples that are more globally representative. The samples in the freezer come from as far afield as Ghana, Tanzania, Finland and Thailand.\n\nSamples being collected and frozen for the GMbC’s biobank of waste products.Credit: F. Rondon/Global Microbiome Conservancy\n\nOver the past nine years of the programme, the team has sampled 50 populations spanning 19 countries. Its members have worked with local scientists, ethics boards and communities to collect the samples, and have taken cars, boats, helicopters and even quadbikes to sample sites. Back in the lab, researchers analyse the stool content, sequence the genetic material of bacteria cultured from samples and store the live samples in their biobank.\n\nTo outsiders, taking stool samples constantly might seem — and smell — disgusting. In Kiel, the scientists occasionally make “poop soup”, using a vessel called a bioreactor to see the effects of different scenarios on procured bacteria. They do this only a few times a year, because the process can be long and expensive, and the aromas pungent, prompting their more-conventional floor mates to give the workspace the nickname “smelly lab”.\n\nBut faeces provide a remarkable window into human health. “It’s our best way to interrogate what’s in the gut from healthy people,” says Groussin. “It’s a little bit gross, but that’s just our best way to access this incredible and important biodiversity.”\n\nA treasure trove for science\n\nWith the microbiome a buzzy research topic, other scientists around the globe are taking samples to study it themselves. And as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater analysis is a valuable public-health tool — providing scientists with the means to monitor pathogens in the population before an infection surges.\n\n“The waste we put into the environment is really data rich,” says Janelle Thompson, an environmental microbiologist at Nanyang Technological University’s Asian School of the Environment in Singapore. Thompson and her team sample Singapore’s wastewater to detect harmful microorganisms in the environment, looking for biological “signals” from organisms or viruses that are shed from the human body.\n\n“You can identify where signals are occurring and follow them over time to see when they’re occurring,” she explains. For example, in 2021 and 2022, Thompson and her colleagues were able to identify variants of concern for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 at university campus sites and treatment plants2. This was long before these variants became dominant, indicating “minimal silent circulation”, according to the team.\n\nThe implications of research into human waste span several scientific disciplines. Amid a global fertilizer shortage, some scientists (and farmers) are looking to urine as fertilizer, owing to its nitrogen content. A study in Nature Water3, published earlier this year by a group of researchers at Stanford University, California, created a prototype system that extracts nutrients from urine. The team estimates that its design could generate up to US$4.13 per kilogram of nitrogen recovered. And research published in 20204 shows that urine-based fertilizer might also help to conserve other resources, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and water use.\n\nA researcher pours urine-based fertilizer into a bottle.Credit: Marcin Szczepanski/Lead Multimedia Storyteller, Michigan Engineering\n\nAs well as a public-health bellwether, stool samples are being used in the development of a potentially life-saving process to treat infections of Clostridium difficile, through transferring healthy faecal bacteria and other microbes from one host to another.\n\nC. difficile infections are “really caused by a disturbed microbiota”, explains Josbert Keller, a gastroenterologist at the Haaglanden Medical Centre in The Hague, the Netherlands. Keller was part of a group that published an early clinical trial5 into the effectiveness of faecal transfers, also known as faecal microbiota transplants, in 2013. “If the patient is not able to restore this microbiota, then it can recur and recur, and that’s the moment that faecal microbiota transplants can really cure a patient.”\n\nNow, faecal transfers are being looked at as a way to treat obesity6, type 2 diabetes7, Parkinson’s disease8 and other conditions.\n\nHow to fix a gut microbiome ravaged by antibiotics\n\nSomething that’s often perceived as disgusting can actually have a lot of intrinsic value, says Bryn Nelson, whose 2022 book Flush: The Remarkable Science of an Unlikely Treasure was described by its publisher as “an urgent exploration of the world’s single most squandered natural resource”. As part of the research and writing process, the former microbiologist spent years looking at the applications of faeces — and found at least 24 fields that take important information from what we consider waste products. Referring to excrement’s ‘ick’ factor, he says: “We just have to kind of get past that hurdle to discover all the information that it contains.”\n\nGetting into the field\n\nPoyet comes from a wet-lab background. For her PhD, she studied the fruit fly Drosophila suzukii and often spent full days dissecting specimens of the insect. Her research now involves sifting through stool samples to access bacteria that are not exposed to oxygen. Some samples are more foul than others, she says, adding: “What is really gross when working with stool sample is actually when people don’t digest the food, and you can find food almost intact in the stool. I really don’t like it.”\n\nFor Thompson, working with waste materials was also a natural fit. “I’ve always just been fascinated by the microbial world and then accessing it for human benefit,” she says. “Microbes are slimy, they can be smelly, but I don’t find them gross.”\n\nStools and urine are also something that you get desensitized to over time. Chong Chun Wie, a microbiome researcher at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya, oversees stool-sample collection as part of his work on the human microbiome. His research looks at how the gut microbiome differs across ethnic groups9 in the region. Unlike Poyet and Groussin, he is not involved in fieldwork. Instead, bottles are sent to donors who deposit their samples at home, but there is still handling to be done in the lab.\n\n“The more you do it, the more you just get used to it because it’s something you do routinely,” he says.\n\nYour friends shape your microbiome — and so do their friends\n\nMarissa Ledger, a medical microbiology resident at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, studies the history of parasite infections. Ancient fossilized poo samples — decayed organic components that resemble soil — can be incredibly valuable in archaeology and palaeontology. Ledger’s undergraduate training was in anthropology, studying skeletal remains. She soon learnt that studying parasites in preserved faecal matter is a better way to chronicle infectious diseases throughout human history, likening the fossilized stools to time capsules that can yield nuanced details about infections and diets in a community.\n\n“When I decided that I wanted to look at parasite infections, understanding that they should have been a huge contributor to disease in the past, I was more like, ‘That’s a really cool goal,” she says. “I never really kind of thought of it as gross until I had the response of people talking to me saying, ‘You study ancient poo? That’s crazy.’”\n\nThere’s a stronger cultural taboo towards poo than towards pee, observes Marine Legrand, an anthropologist at OCAPI, an interdisciplinary action and research programme in Paris that looks at ways of recycling human waste, such as by using urine as fertilizer. Although funding is available for research on faeces, it seems to be directed more towards medical than agricultural applications. “When we look for funds, it’s easier to find funds to work on pee than to work on poo.”\n\nThe public restroom",

So, who better to re-examine the state of the modern Internet ecosystem, and champion reform, than the web’s creator himself: computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee? However, he is not the kind of charismatic leader who can inspire a revolution, at least not through his writing.\n\nHow AI is reshaping science and society\n\nThis Is for Everyone reads like a family newsletter: it tells you what happened, recounting the Internet’s origin and evolution in great detail, but rarely explaining why the ideal of a decentralized Internet was not realized. Berners-Lee’s central argument is that the web has strayed from its founding principles and been corrupted by profit-driven companies that seek to monetize our attention. But it’s still possible to “fix the internet”, he argues, outlining a utopian vision for how that might be done. In it, social media would be designed to “maximize the joy” the user experiences instead of fuelling division, and technical standards would be introduced to prevent the mistakes of the social-media era from being repeated in the age of artificial intelligence. Both ideas are optimistic — some might say naive — but coming from someone so integral to the web’s creation, they carry particular weight.\n\nIn this personal history of the Internet, penned with co-writer Stephen Witt, Berners-Lee recounts decades of his career at various institutions, most notably CERN — the European centre for particle physics in Geneva, Switzerland. Here, his seminal invention, the World Wide Web, began as a side project that his managers tolerated grudgingly. Much of this is a well-known tale, both because the web is so prevalent in our lives and because Berners-Lee has given plenty of interviews about how it came to be.\n\nComputer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.Credit: Sam Ogden/SPL\n\nAs an author, Berners-Lee is most powerful and persuasive when he looks beyond his own life to examine the web’s exploitative corners. For instance, he notes that some US Democrats — such as senator Ed Markey and former vice-president Al Gore, who both advocated for well-thought-out technology regulations — were more willing than Republicans to engage with the web’s inner workings. He argues that this imbalance partly shaped the web’s early development in the 2000s, establishing harmful norms that still persist today.\n\nBerners-Lee criticizes cookies — small pieces of data that websites store on users’ computers, often to track browsing behaviour — for needlessly spying on users. And he laments that the web is controlled by “a handful of providers” that “grew into dominant, unregulated monopolies”. He suggests that they ought to be brought into check.\n\nAre the Internet and AI affecting our memory? What the science says\n\nIn the later sections of the book, Berners-Lee is refreshingly candid. He criticizes Google for attempting to dominate the World Wide Web Consortium — the non-profit organization in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that sets web standards — by embedding its preferred coding language into its Chrome browser, effectively making this language the default choice. This fight over standards is comparable to his earlier run-ins with the creators of the Mosaic browser, including entrepreneur Marc Andreessen, whose profit-driven vision for the web clashed with Berners-Lee’s original ideal of a distributed, decentralized and open system. Berners-Lee seems to have a grudging admiration for Andreessen’s success in commercializing early web browsing by ignoring the niceties of the online community that had been the norm until this point. He made changes to how browsers render images, “as was his right, I suppose”, Berners-Lee writes. Mosaic quickly became “a dominant monopoly” in the 1990s, making its rendering method the standard. Another firm Berners-Lee condemns is Apple — for steering users towards its tightly controlled app store and making it virtually impossible to download apps that are outside Apple’s ecosystem. Social-media algorithms also draw his ire; he warns that they act like “an undercover megaphone”, distorting and polluting public discourse.\n\nHis solution is as radical today as the web was in 1989. Alongside his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, he has created a data protocol called Solid. This data-management framework gives users control over their personal information through secure ‘pods’ — individual data stores that let them decide which apps or services can access their data. This approach flips the power dynamic: sharing data with tech companies is possible, but only on the user’s terms.",

          "abstract": "The surging value of firms such as NVIDIA has fuelled concerns about an AI stock market bubble.Credit: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty\n\nAfter years of hype and ballooning investment, the boom in artificial intelligence technology is beginning to show signs of strain. Many financial analysts now agree that there is an ‘AI bubble’, and some speculate that it could finally burst in the next few months.\n\nIn economic terms, the rise of AI is unlike any other tech boom in history — there is now 17 times more investment in AI than in Internet companies before the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. And, valued at around US$4.6 trillion, the AI company NVIDIA was worth more than the economies of every nation except the United States, China and Germany.\n\nBut AI is not living up the promise of revolutionizing multiple sectors — nearly 80% of companies using AI found it had had no significant impact on their earnings, according to a report from management consulting firm McKinsey, and concerns over the basic architecture of chatbots is leading scientists to say that AI has the potential to harm their research. These doubts over the technology’s utility, and financial viability, is leading analysts and investors to speculate that a crash is coming. Even tech chief executives such as Sam Altman of ChatGPT’s parent company OpenAI in San Francisco, California, have admitted that parts of the field are “kind of bubbly right now”.\n\nSo, if a crash is imminent, how will it affect AI research and the scientists and engineers who make it happen?\n\nLessons from the noughties\n\nSome analysts say that an AI-market collapse would be even more catastrophic than the dot-com crash — a shock that wiped out more than $5 trillion in stock-market value and led to hundreds of thousands of job losses in the tech industry alone. Like those of other tech bubbles before it, the dot-com crash had a lasting impact on computer-science research, says John Turner, an economist and historian at Queen’s University Belfast, UK. “But it wasn’t all bad,” he adds.\n\n“In 2000, a lot of highly skilled electronic engineers and computer scientists lost their jobs” and demand for computer-science graduates plummeted, he says. This led to a drop in the numbers of computer-science graduates — but despite this, research output didn’t falter, and the average number of computer-science publications continued to rise each year during and after the dot-com crash (see Dot-com crash aftermath’). Similarly, the roll-out of telecommunication technologies such as mobile phones and the Internet continued unabated.\n\nSources: National Center for Education Statistics; Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2025.\n\nBrent Goldfarb, an economist at the University of Maryland in College Park, says similar lay-offs in AI researchers and developers would happen were the AI bubble to burst. The biggest impact “would be on the hoard of start-ups jumping on the AI bandwagon, like the tenth AI notetaking app or AI scientist”, he says. OpenAI, Google, NVIDIA and other major AI companies “will likely survive”, he says. “The last thing they’ll do is get rid of their scientific core; that’s the path to the future.”\n\nIn fact, crashes can have a silver lining: they can take innovation into other sectors when leading scientists change jobs, Turner says. Take, for instance the British bicycle crash of 1896. “Motorcycles, motorcars, the Wright brothers; all can trace their origins to the bicycle bubble,” he says. “The railway ‘manias’ of the nineteenth century left the legacy of railways for the benefit of people, much like the dot-com bubble gave society the Internet.”\n\nLiberated researchers\n\nCurrently, the tech industry eclipses academia when it comes to AI, in terms of both investment and publication output. Some researchers have called this an “AI brain drain”, which sidelines exploratory science in favour of commercial interest1. “If I’m an AI researcher working at OpenAI, why would I go to a university when I earn ten times the salary?” Goldfarb says.",

A nudge. A gentle hand slowly turning my chin towards the windows, where their white trunks reach skywards and their golden leaves glow in the three-sun dawn.

The sharpness of leaves. “Like the woods by Grandpa’s old cabin.”\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nWe are sojourners in the unknown.\n\nAvery insists on documenting our symptoms, but Flynn won’t let her file an official report. It’s curious, yes, but no risk to the mission. And who wouldn’t be a bit jumbled by arriving on a shining new world? By this massive forest of honey-coloured leaves and bright white branches rising skywards, their arms spread out in every direction?\n\nWe move up the date of our initial excursion. For the first time, consensus comes easily.\n\nOur feet are the first to mark the soft and silty soil. Tiny birdlike creatures flit among the trees, as curious about us as we are about them. As we wander, I gather a feather. A leaf. A handful of dirt. A curl of bark. A twig.\n\nFlynn photographs the forest. Cooper collects our data. Avery keeps an eye on our vitals from the safety of the habitat. I only notice we’re working in perfect rhythm — shutter click, hygrometer beep, gather, step and step — when I hear her voice humming along.\n\nAnother tone harmonizes.\n\n“Is that your oxygen tank?”\n\nIt is. Beeping.\n\nHours have passed unnoticed, untroubled. We are deeper into the forest than intended. Farther from the habitat. Somehow, without argument, without discussion, without a single spoken word, we coordinate our movements to connect the extra tank to my suit. It’s a complex process, but I forget which hands are mine as they all work in synchronicity.\n\nAt the airlock, we extract ourselves from the forest. Climbing inside, limb by limb, is like trying to untangle a length of vines without snapping any branches. We sit, gasping, trying to collect ourselves. Trying to understand this sudden sense of loss. Still breathing in rhythm with the wind.\n\nInside, we go about our separate tasks, but the new-found cohesion prevails. Each role is essential, balanced, aligned, making our previous conflicts seem absurd, our previous views so narrow.\n\nThe samples whirl in the sequencer like a maple’s samara fruit.

You could see the place was on the blink from halfway down Dagenham Dock Avenue, the ninth floor flashing green and opal in a lengthy, repeating rhythm. Nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe lobby lay silent and deserted, as they all do these days. Up on ninth, I swiped in and entered the office. Employees shimmered in their nooks like hummingbird wings, faces flipping back to front with every surge peak. Some were translucent — always a bad sign. I checked the manifest. Cubicle 18 was the locus point. First, I’d calibrate the wavefronts. Next, wrap a firewall around the entire grid, and —\n\nThe inhabitant of cubicle 18 stared up at me, mouth drawn tight with worry. Hair, skin, face — she was as human as me. Neither of us said a word. I don’t know who was more surprised.\n\n“You’re auditing?” I finally managed. “Or did they keep someone on?”\n\nShe looked like my aunt. Her lanyard said Pam Dewsbury. “Did … did they send you to remove me?”\n\nI indicated my badge. “Travis Ovis, maintenance. Where’s number 18?”\n\n“I’m number 18.”\n\nI’d heard enough. I said, “That attitude’s hardly going to help you. Don’t you know about the Time bomb?”\n\nPat gave out a sad little laugh. “Right. The Time bomb.”\n\nJust to make sure she understood, I explained the Time bomb.\n\n*****\n\nOpinion is divided as to whether the population-time-bomb theory has any real validity. It’s simple enough. Over generations, the fertility rate drops below replacement levels and economic meltdown follows. Supposedly. Growth is all.\n\nRead more science fiction from Nature Futures\n\nHence the government initiative. Multiplying the citizenry without any of the complications; expanding the horde; getting in on the ground floor. Call it what you like. Invent people to the nth degree — social security, tax codes, even birth certificates — and send your children out into the world. In this case, to the Cloudberry Tower, ninth floor.\n\nSo it came to be. And the irksome regulations stating that these citizens-without-sin must at least have a physical presence? The vested interests that pushed them through Parliament administrate the holographic technology themselves. Of course they do. Rental of their services equates to roughly the newbies’ wage. Thus, everyone’s happy.\n\nEveryone except Pam. “Oh, I know all that,” she said. “I may as well tell you, then. My son Ned helped me out. They used to call people like him hackers, I think. Now they call them data assistants. When we all got the word here about the new directives I asked him to look into alternatives.”\n\n“Did he suggest UBI?”\n\n“You think I want to spend the rest of my life on universal basic income?” Her worry was turning to righteous anger. “Playing online games all day every day so some analysis centre can extract my neural response data, no thank you.”\n\nI couldn’t waste time arguing about it. The inhabitants of the adjacent cubicles had turned a not-unpleasant crimson hue. “Look, if they don’t get you for trespassing, they’ll haul you up for inhibiting growth forecasts. What do you do here anyway? Push files around, probably. Wouldn’t you prefer putting your feet up somewhere?”\n\nShe tried too hard to look innocent. “Someone has to water the plants. And what about you? Maintenance will be shifting to automation soon enough.”\n\nI doubted she was wrong. I’d seen holograms in the backs of cabs, through the windows of ice-bars, occupying park benches, their accompanying projector drones hovering silently overhead. It seemed the Time bomb issue was well on its way to being solved. The tech companies would just have to keep an eye on runaway inflation. You don’t want wages over-matching output.\n\nI changed tack. “This is fraud, you know.” The crimson shade surrounding us deepened. “I’ll have to report your presence. Besides, you’re upsetting the transmissions.”\n\nShe turned back to her desk and swept her fingers over the touch-screen. “Let me show you what Ned turned up. It’s Travis Ovis, right?”\n\nA face swam into being. A cold lump formed in my stomach. There was no denying it — the visage was mine. I never knew I looked so good in blue.\n\n“There’s one of these for everyone,” Pam said. “Here they sit, biding their time until our overlords decide all of us are fully expendable. Ned believes they’ll even have a voting-rights override.”",

Or are they more risk-averse?Credit: Westend61/Getty\n\nWomen are under-represented in medical research generally, but they are even more under-represented when it comes to retracted articles. A new study finds that women’s names filled just 23% of author slots in a sample of nearly 900 retracted articles published in medical journals between 2008 and 2017.\n\n“This is a really interesting, creative and robust study,” says Curt Rice, who promotes publishing literacy at the Publishing Unlocked project in Oslo. “The article invites us to dig into issues like negotiations about authorship and the likelihood of scrutiny.” The findings were reported on 19 November in PLoS ONE1.\n\nWhy retractions data could be a powerful tool for cleaning up science\n\nStudy author Paul Sebo, an internal-medicine specialist and researcher at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, used an artificial-intelligence tool that infers whether authors are male or female on the basis of their first names.\n\nHe found women’s names in 16.5% of first-author slots and 12.7% of last-author slots for the retracted papers. By contrast, an earlier study that used a similar tool for predicting author gender found that women accounted for 41–45% of first authors and 26–33% of last authors in all articles from the same selection of journals across the same time frame2.\n\nRisk and reward\n\nInterpreting the results is fraught. The gender-prediction tools used are imperfect. They do not capture non-binary identities, for example, and can be less accurate with non-Western names than Western ones. But in a manual check of 200 names, Sebo found no mismatches.\n\nAnd the findings themselves don’t come with a clear explanation. In an e-mail to Nature, Sebo wrote that his suspicion is that the disparity stems from how “women are still underrepresented in senior academic roles, lead fewer projects, and therefore may be less exposed to the kinds of responsibilities (and risks) that are more commonly associated with retractions”.\n\n“My speculation,” Rice says, “would be that because men are more visible in science in general, their work is getting more scrutiny.”",

          "authors": "Robert Costanza, Joseph Eastoe, Rutger Hoekstra, Ida Kubiszewski, Daniel W. O’Neill",
          "abstract": "Gross domestic product (GDP) was never designed to be a measure of societal well-being. It tracks only market transactions, conflates costs and benefits, and ignores the distribution of income, the contributions of household labour and volunteer work, and social and environmental costs and benefits.\n\nIn the decades after the Second World War, GDP growth functioned as a reasonable proxy for well-being when rebuilding economies and increasing production and consumption were the main priorities. However, since about 1950, which some call the Anthropocene era, ecological limits, inequality and declining social cohesion have restricted further improvements in well-being. At the same time, the rapid development of artificial intelligence promises fresh opportunities and challenges.\n\nDegrowth can work — here’s how science can help\n\nMeasuring and modelling what truly matters, not just market transactions, is now essential. Processes are under way to develop indicators that move beyond GDP. In May, the United Nations secretary-general António Guterres appointed a High-Level Expert Group to develop such measures, with a focus on balancing economic, social and environmental dimensions of well-being. This initiative builds on the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): target 19 of SDG17 commits governments to adopt beyond-GDP metrics by 2030.\n\nYet progress remains slow. Overcoming decades of structures built around GDP is difficult. Nonetheless, several governments, including those of New Zealand, Scotland, Wales and Bhutan, have experimented with alternatives to GDP1 (see also go.nature.com/3ktuvhv). Others should follow suit, but it will be a steep climb.\n\nShifting all societies from a narrow focus on GDP growth to a comprehensive understanding of the multiple factors that support well-being and prosperity, and of how these factors interact over space and time, demands consensus on another approach2. Over the past seven decades, researchers and institutions have proposed hundreds of alternatives to GDP.\n\nParadoxically, this proliferation has helped GDP to keep its privileged status, by creating the impression that there is little agreement on what sustainable and inclusive well-being means or how to measure it. In fact, there is much that these approaches do agree on.\n\nHere, we identify areas of common ground and propose four ways forward: universally adopting the goal of sustainable and inclusive well-being; establishing agreed metrics to evaluate progress towards this goal; developing models that incorporate the drivers and dynamics of well-being; and addressing institutionalized societal ‘addictions’ that reinforce unsustainable behaviours.\n\nEmbrace sustainable and inclusive well-being\n\nThe concept of sustainable and inclusive well-being — encompassing the well-being of all people and of the ecosystems that sustain life — is emerging as a widely accepted overarching policy goal that can provide common ground for beyond-GDP metrics, models and policies.\n\nBy assigning a central role to natural ecosystems and planetary boundaries, the concept acknowledges that human prosperity depends on healthy ecological systems. Respecting ecological limits by constraining the material scale of the economy is therefore a precondition for lasting well-being. It also demands that human societies prevent significant harm to other species, protect the rights of future generations and guarantee that all people today have access to essential resources, services and participatory forms of decision-making.\n\nMarket workers in Kenya. Employment is a core factor in many indicators of well-being.Credit: Elen Marlen/Getty\n\nA 2009 report on the measurement of economic performance and social progress, chaired by economist Joseph Stiglitz, laid the groundwork for moving beyond GDP3. Since then, international bodies, including the UN, the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), have progressively adopted this conceptual foundation. Full international enforcement should follow; however, this might depend on a more-receptive US administration and stronger demand from civil society.\n\nAgree on well-being indicators\n\nConverging on an approach to evaluating sustainable and inclusive well-being is important if policymakers and organizations such as the UN are to embed these measures into official reporting and budgetary processes. Studies suggest that this is possible.\n\nAlthough more than 200 beyond-GDP indicators have been proposed, they share many similarities. These indicators often use different terminology to describe contributors to sustainable and inclusive well-being4. For example, ‘health’ might refer to mental health, physical health, health care, child welfare or any of more than 400 variants. Semantic modelling of the components of each indicator, which looks at the similarity between them, nevertheless reveals a high degree of agreement5. Nineteen key components capture a large proportion of the similarity (see ‘Well-being components’).\n\nWell-being components\n\nThese 19 core factors are common to most beyond-GDP indicators5.\n\nHuman\n\nLife satisfaction\n\nHealth\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\nEducation\n\nSocial\n\nCrime\n\nCivic engagement\n\nGovernance\n\nIncome equality\n\nGender equality\n\nBuilt\n\nHousing\n\nInfrastructure\n\nFinancial security\n\nEmployment\n\nPer capita consumption\n\nBusiness health\n\nNatural\n\nNatural capital\n\nWater quality\n\nAir quality\n\nGreenhouse-gas emissions\n\nResearchers and policymakers, led by an international convening body such as the UN, should now establish a core set of around 20 components to serve as the backbone of national statistical reporting and UN frameworks. The UN High-Level Expert Group and the ongoing update of the SDGs are already advancing the agenda. The expert group has committed to an inclusive process that invites contributions from all stakeholders.\n\nInterested parties are encouraged to submit ideas and insights to help strengthen the emerging global consensus (see go.nature.com/4gcebvr). This month, the expert group launched an online consultation about its progress, and is expected to present its recommendations in the first half of 2026, which falls within the 80th session of the UN General Assembly. After this, intergovernmental processes will consider their recommendations.\n\nTo build a better world, stop chasing economic growth\n\nOther efforts include the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounting and the UN System of National Accounts 2025 initiative, which are revising economic accounts to include more well-being components. The 2024 UN Pact for the Future and recommendations from the secretary-general’s Our Common Agenda report call for measures of progress that complement GDP. But these efforts need help from researchers and the consensus recommendations of the High-Level Expert Group.\n\nThe UN can also play a central part in strengthening institutional capacity and securing stable funding to support the regular production of national estimates. Advances in citizen science, social-media analytics and remote sensing offer opportunities to reduce costs and improve data reliability. The world is awash with big data, so directing even a fraction of these resources towards measuring sustainable and inclusive well-being would enhance global monitoring and policy effectiveness.\n\nDevelop dynamic models that go beyond GDP\n\nGDP has retained its dominance partly because it is embedded in the models that underpin national accounts and policy analyses. For example, the input–output model developed by economist Wassily Leontief6 tracks monetary flows across sectors and into ‘final demand’, defined as GDP.\n\nWhy we need to measure people’s well-being — lessons from a global survey\n\nMainstream macroeconomic models also place growth at the centre of policy evaluation. For example, standard computable general equilibrium models assume a high degree of substitutability among factors of production, implying that labour or technology can largely replace natural resources. They neglect environmental limits and exclude well-being, equity and ecological integrity. Most importantly, they are optimization models that are intended to maximize a single objective — GDP — rather than being designed to evaluate policies against multiple goals, as is required for sustainable and inclusive well-being.\n\nNew models are needed. These must be dynamic, nonlinear and represent the economy as a subsystem of society embedded in the biosphere. Such models must be able to compare resource use and pollution to environmental limits, and social outcomes to the thresholds required to meet human needs7. They must track both stocks (natural, human, social and built capital) and flows (including monetary transactions, ecosystem services and social benefits) and capture their interactions, including feedbacks from transgressing environmental limits. Ecological macroeconomic models, rooted in the field of ecological economics, are one promising approach8.\n\nYoung people at a cultural arts centre in Kibera, an informal settlement in Nairobi, perform a traditional African dance.Credit: Eva-Maria Krafczyk/dpa/Alamy",

          "abstract": "As part of her work on the Inuksiutit project, Jessica Penney travelled to Mittimatalik, a community in the northern part of Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada.Credit: Peter Loovers\n\nAs a sociologist and an Inuk who was raised in Canada’s northernmost city — Iqaluit in the territory of Nunavut — Jessica Penney has spent much of her professional career studying the country’s Inuit communities. During this time, she has seen growing threats to the food security, cultural practices and mental health of the Inuit and other northern Indigenous peoples.\n\nInspired by her community connection with the people of Nunavut, Penney studies Inuit health, environmental issues and food sovereignty — the right of Indigenous communities to control their own food sources and access — from her current base at Toronto Metropolitan University. She is also a co-investigator on the Inuksiutit Project, an initiative by the University of Aberdeen, UK, and York University in Toronto to promote local control of food in Nunavut.\n\nPenney shares with Nature her research journey.\n\nTell us about your path from Iqaluit to a career in academia.\n\nIqaluit may seem small and remote, but with just over 8,000 people, it’s a large town by Inuit standards, and it’s the cultural hub of Nunavut. All of the issues I study as a sociologist — food sovereignty, poverty and the resonance of native traditions — are Nunavut issues.\n\nNature Spotlight: Canada\n\nThe educational system in Nunavut has some challenges. There’s a serious lack of Inuit teachers and resources. For the last two years of secondary school, I attended an international school on Vancouver Island on a full scholarship. After being exposed to so many cultures, I wanted to attend university abroad and I applied to universities all over the United Kingdom. The University of Glasgow offered me a scholarship in my preferred field of sociology and public policy, so the choice was easy.\n\nI stayed at the University of Glasgow for my master’s and PhD degrees, although I never lost my focus on the Indigenous peoples of northern Canada. Every summer, I would go back to Nunavut to work for the health-policy department, so I was able to link up my studies with my actual work. I did my master's in global health, and that also helped me start to see some of the connections between health and social issues in my community, as well as links to environmental issues, especially those relating to climate change.\n\nMy PhD thesis explored the social, political and economic disruptions caused by the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project, which dammed the Churchill River in the eastern province of Newfoundland and Labrador and was completed in 2021 at a cost of roughly Can$13 billion (US$9.3 billion). I interviewed local Inuit to document their concerns about the project and its anticipated environmental impacts. The dams changed the lives of locals, including their ability to hunt and fish, and many felt powerless and voiceless as construction went ahead.\n\nWhy is food sovereignty and security such a pressing issue in Nunavut?\n\nWherever they live, people should always have some control over their food supply. But control is slipping away in Nunavut. Most food has to be shipped from the south, and the few grocery shops in Nunavut are incredibly expensive — with some items priced at two to three times the national average — and stock limited supplies that are often of poor quality. In Nunavut, a family-sized box of cereal can cost nearly Can$18.\n\nTraditional methods for harvesting food are also under threat. The sea ice around my hometown of Iqaluit (see ‘Remote research’) and many other northern communities is less stable and dependable than it was a few decades ago, which means that local hunters have a harder time finding and reaching ringed seals (Pusa hispida), a major part of the traditional diet, clothing and culture. Inuit eat seal meat, blubber and organs. They still turn seal skins into trousers and parkas. Hunting, sharing and using seal products is a focus of community bonding and Inuit identity.\n\nClimate change isn’t the only challenge. The Canadian government has been considering listing ringed seals as a species of concern, a designation that could greatly limit hunting. As part of this effort, the government surveyed people in Nunavut. As noted by my Inuksiutit Project colleagues, the questionnaire was available only in English and French, which greatly limited input from Inuktut-speaking people who have some of the deepest knowledge of seal populations and have the most at stake. The survey was also conducted online, which limited input from elders and those without iInternet access.\n\nIn February, I co-authored a piece in The Conversation that documented the ongoing food security crisis faced by Inuit children in Nunavut. Canada’s 2022 Indigenous Peoples Survey found that 80% of Indigenous children in the territory live in households experiencing food insecurity. In that article, my co-authors and I advocated for the renewal of a federal voucher programme that provides Can$500 per child each month for groceries, and another Can$250 for children under four for formula milk and nappies. The programme had been at risk of expiring, which could have been catastrophic.\n\nWhat would you change about how science is conducted in Nunavut?",

Scientists have created similar devices that can use electronic sensors to detect sweet, sour, spicy and umami tastes. But the authors of the new paper wanted to focus on spiciness in particular and to measure spice levels as precisely as possible, which is especially important for quality control in food, says co-author Jing Hu, a chemical engineer at the East China University of Science and Technology in Shanghai.\n\nTaming the burn\n\nThe team’s solution was “inspired by the spicy-neutralizing effect of milk”, they write in the paper. Milk “proteins that affect our perception of spiciness” relieve the burn of a spicy dish, explains Carolyn Ross, a food scientist at Washington State University in Pullman.\n\nThe synthetic tongue is made of a gel that contains milk powder, acrylic acid and choline chloride. When a current is applied to the gel, its chloride and hydrogen ions can conduct electricity because they are mobile. To monitor changes in conductivity, the scientists placed the gel between copper sheets and connected the whole contraption to a workstation that measures the electric current.\n\nCapsaicin — the compound that gives chilli peppers their spice — interacts with the milk proteins in the gel to form bulky complexes that disrupt ion flow. As a result, when the tongue encounters capsaicin, its conductivity drops.",

          "title": "What is the future of intelligence? The answer could lie in the story of its evolution",
          "authors": "Blaise Agüera y Arcas",
          "abstract": "Ten years ago, I would have turned my nose up at the idea that we already understood how to get machines to think. In the 2010s, my team at Google Research was working on a wide variety of artificial-intelligence models, including the next-word predictor that powers the keyboard on Android smartphones. Artificial neural networks of the sort we were training were finally solving long-standing challenges in visual perception, speech recognition, game playing and many other domains. But it seemed absurd to me that a mere next-word predictor could ever truly understand new concepts, write jokes, debug code or do any of the myriad other things that are hallmarks of human intelligence.\n\n‘Solving’ this kind of intelligence would surely require some fundamentally new scientific insight. And that would probably be inspired by neuroscience — the study of the only known embodiment of general intelligence, the brain.\n\nScience and the new age of AI: a Nature special\n\nMy views back then were comfortably within the scientific mainstream, but in retrospect were also tinged with snobbery. My training was in physics and computational neuroscience, and I found the Silicon Valley hype distasteful at times. The cultish view that Moore’s law — the observation that computing power increases exponentially over time — would solve not only every technological problem, but also all social and scientific ones, seemed naive to me. It was the epitome of the mindset “when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail”.\n\nI was wrong. In 2019, colleagues at Google trained a massive (for the time) next-word predictor — technically, a next-token predictor, with each token corresponding to a word fragment — codenamed Meena1. It seemed able, albeit haltingly, to understand new concepts, write jokes, make logical arguments and much else. Meena’s scaled-up successor, LaMDA, did better2. This trend has continued since. In 2025, we find ourselves in the rather comical situation of expecting such large language models to respond fluently, intelligently, responsibly and accurately to all sorts of esoteric questions and demands that humans would fail to answer. People get irritated when these systems fail to answer appropriately — while simultaneously debating when artificial general intelligence will arrive.\n\nHow to detect consciousness in people, animals and maybe even AI\n\nLarge language models can be unreliable and say dumb things, but then, so can humans. Their strengths and weaknesses are certainly different from ours. But we are running out of intelligence tests that humans can pass reliably and AI models cannot. By those benchmarks, and if we accept that intelligence is essentially computational — the view held by most computational neuroscientists — we must accept that a working ‘simulation’ of intelligence actually is intelligence. There was no profound discovery that suddenly made obviously non-intelligent machines intelligent: it did turn out to be a matter of scaling computation.\n\nOther researchers disagree with my assessment of where we are with AI. But in what follows, I want to accept the premise that intelligent machines are already here, and turn the mirror back on ourselves. If scaling up computation yields AI, could the kind of intelligence shown by living organisms, humans included, also be the result of computational scaling? If so, what drove that — and how did living organisms become computational in the first place?\n\nOver the past several years, a growing group of collaborators and I have begun to find some tentative, but exciting answers. AI, biological intelligence and, indeed, life itself might all have emerged from the same process. This insight could shed fresh light not just on AI, neuroscience and neurophilosophy, but also on theoretical biology, evolution and complexity science. Moreover, it would give us a glimpse of how human and machine intelligence are destined to co-evolve in the future.\n\nPredictive brains\n\nThe idea that brains are essentially prediction machines isn’t new. German physicist and physician Hermann von Helmholtz advanced it in the nineteenth century in his Treatise on Physiological Optics (1867). The idea was developed further by the founders of cybernetics, especially US mathematician Norbert Wiener, in the early 1940s — a starting point of modern, neural-net-based AI research.\n\nWiener realized3 that all living systems have ‘purposive’ behaviours to stay alive, and that such actions require computational modelling. Our internal and external senses enable us to compute predictive models, both of ourselves and of our environment. But these are useful only if we can act to affect the future — specifically, to increase the odds that we will still be a thriving part of it. Evolution selects for entities that use predictions to make the best survival decisions. The actions we take, and the observations that ensue, become part of our past experience, creating a feedback loop that enables us to make further predictions.\n\nHunting is a prime example of this predictive modelling. A predator must predict actions that will get the prey into its stomach; the prey must predict the predator’s behaviour to stop that from happening. Starting in the 1970s, neuropsychologists and anthropologists began to realize that other intelligent entities are often the most important parts of the environment to model — because they are the ones modelling you back, whether with friendly or hostile intent4. Increasingly intelligent predators put evolutionary pressure on their prey to become smarter, and vice versa.\n\nThe hunting behaviour of whales is the product of a shared, social intelligence.Credit: Nick Garbutt/NaturePL\n\nThe pressures towards intelligence become even more intense for members of social species. Winning mates, sharing resources, gaining followers, teaching, learning and dividing labour: all of these involve modelling and predicting the minds of others. But the more intelligent you become — the better to predict the minds of others (at least in theory) — the more intelligent, and thus hard to predict, those others have also become, because they are of the same species and doing the same thing. These runaway dynamics produce ‘intelligence explosions’: the rapid evolutionary increases in brain size that have been observed in highly social animals, including bats, whales and dolphins, birds and our own ancestors.\n\nDuring a social intelligence explosion, individuals get smarter, but so do groups. Bigger brains can model more relationships, allowing groups to become larger while retaining social cohesion. Sharing and division of labour enable these larger social units to do much more than individuals can on their own.\n\nTake humans. Individually, we aren’t much smarter than our primate ancestors. Humans raised in the wild, like the fictional Mowgli in Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book (1894), would seem unexceptional relative to the forest’s other large-ish animals — if, indeed, they survive at all. But in large numbers, humans can achieve many improbably complex feats beyond any individual’s cognitive or physical capacity: transplanting organs, travelling to the Moon, manufacturing silicon chips. These feats require cooperation, thinking in parallel and division of labour. They are group-level phenomena, and can justifiably be called superhuman.\n\nSymbiogenic transitions\n\nWhat applies to human sociality arguably also applies to every previous major evolutionary transition throughout life’s history on Earth. These include the transition from simple prokaryotic cells to more-complex eukaryotic ones, from single-celled life to multicellular organisms, and from solitary insects to colony-dwellers. In each case, entities that previously led independent lives entered into a close symbiosis, dividing labour and working in parallel to create a super-entity5.\n\nAI language models killed the Turing test: do we even need a replacement?\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that this ‘symbiogenesis’ is much more common than has generally been supposed. Horizontal gene transfer between cells, the incorporation of a useful retroviral element into a host’s genome and symbiotic bacteria establishing themselves in an animal’s gut are commonplace examples that would not count as ‘major’ transitions. Yet they have certainly produced organisms with innovative capabilities. The ability of termites to digest wood, for instance, depends entirely on enzymes produced by symbiotic microorganisms. The formation of the placental barrier in humans depends on syncytin, a protein derived from the envelope of a retrovirus that fused into the mammalian germ line tens of millions of years ago.\n\nStandard Darwinian evolution, involving the familiar mechanisms of mutation and selection, has no intrinsic bias towards increasing complexity. It is this less familiar mechanism of symbiogenesis that gives evolution its arrow of time: life progresses from simple to more-complex forms when existing parts merge to form new super-entities. This process speeds up over time, as the catalogue of parts available to be combined afresh increases in size and sophistication. Over the past billion years, symbiogenesis has produced increasingly complex nervous systems, colonies of social animals — and eventually our own technological society.\n\nIs this nature’s version of Moore’s law? Yes and no. As originally formulated in 1965 by US engineer Gordon Moore, the co-founder of chip company Intel, the ‘law’ states that transistor size shrinks exponentially6. This translates into exponential declines in computer size, cost and power consumption, and exponential increases in operating speed.\n\nBiological cells have not become exponentially smaller or faster throughout evolution. The advent of electrically excitable neurons sometime around 650 million years ago introduced a fast new computational timescale, but that was a one-off: since then, neurons have not become faster or smaller, nor have their energetic requirements decreased. This does not obviously resemble Moore’s law as it played out in the twentieth century.\n\nWill AI ever win its own Nobel? Some predict a prize-worthy science discovery soon\n\nBut look at the law in the twenty-first century, and a connection becomes more apparent. Since around 2006, transistors have continued to shrink, but the rise in semiconductor operating speed has stalled. To keep increasing computer performance, chip-makers are instead adding more processing cores. They began, in other words, to parallelize silicon-based computation. It’s no coincidence that this is when modern, neural-net-based AI models finally began to take off. Practically speaking, neural nets require massively parallel processing; for a single modern processor to sequentially perform the trillion or so operations needed for a state-of-the-art large language model to predict the next token in a sequence would take minutes.\n\nThis starts to look a lot more like the story of biological intelligence. AI emerged not through speed alone, but from a division of labour arising from the cooperation of many simple computational elements running in parallel: what we might term technological symbiogenesis.\n\nIn this context, computer science is a natural science as well as an engineering discipline. Humans did not invent computation any more than they did electric current or optical lenses. We merely re-discovered a phenomenon nature had already exploited, developed mathematical theories to understand it better and worked out how to engineer it on a different substrate. Our phones, laptops and data centres could aptly be called ‘artificial computers’.\n\nComputogenesis\n\nIf symbiogenesis explains the evolution of natural computational complexity and the emergence of intelligence, how and why did nature first become computational? Work that I and colleagues have been doing on artificial life over the past couple of years helps to clarify this.\n\nTo set the scene, imagine an enormous variety of randomly configured feedback mechanisms that are simple enough to arise spontaneously in a thermally variable environment such as that of Earth. Now, assume that each of these mechanisms can work only within some narrow temperature range. After a while, the mechanisms that persist will be the ones that work as thermostats, maintaining their temperature within the right range, so that they can continue to operate. This thought experiment illustrates how purposive behaviour, oriented towards self-preservation — a kind of proto-life — can emerge from random initial conditions.\n\nEven a thermostat is, by definition, performing a computation: it implements a behaviour (turn the heat on or off) that is conditional on an information input (the temperature). Thus, a minimal kind of computation — perhaps nothing more than an ‘if … then’ operation — will arise and persist whenever the output can affect the likelihood of whatever is doing the computation continuing to exist.\n\nThis kind of simple operation is still a long way from a general-purpose computer, which was defined by English computing pioneer Alan Turing using a theoretical construct we refer to today as a universal Turing machine. It consists of a ‘head’ that can move left or right along a tape, reading, writing and erasing symbols on that tape according to a table of rules. Turing realized that a rule table can also be encoded as a sequence of symbols on the tape — what we’d now call a program. Certain rule tables exist that will cause the machine to read that program from the tape, performing any computation it specifies.\n\nHumans and machines exist in a mutually dependent technological symbiosis.Credit: CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty",

          "title": "Science on shaky ground: Canadian research shifts in the wake of US cuts",
          "authors": "Lesley Evans Ogden",
          "abstract": "At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, children across the country can gain access to promising trials of cancer treatments when standard therapies fail. Among these are several conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium — a network of 15 centres across the United States and Canada that are funded by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI).\n\nIn August, news broke that the consortium would be stopping people from enrolling in its clinical trials across North America, after losing federal funding beyond March 2026. The decision was handed down by the NCI, part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). “The process of closing those studies, not just in Canada, but in the US, is beginning,” says Jim Whitlock, a paediatric oncologist at the Hospital for Sick Children. “This is a real tragedy.”\n\nNature Spotlight: Canada\n\nFor Whitlock and other Canadian scientists who have collaborations with US partners, the past ten months have been turbulent. With US scientific agencies such as the NIH, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeing billions of dollars in funding cuts and job losses under the administration of US President Donald Trump, the effects have also been felt in Canada. There, cancelled projects and uncertainty have caused scientists and academics undue stress.\n\nTotal losses to Canadian science are unclear. Among some US federal grant agencies, it can be difficult to see where the funding goes in Canada and who receives it, says Félix Proulx-Giraldeau, interim executive director at Evidence for Democracy in Ottawa, which promotes scientific evidence in governmental decision-making. He adds that whereas the NIH has “gold-standard” transparency about funding recipients, information on grants from organizations such as the EPA and the US National Science Foundation can be harder to keep track of. “It’s unequal across the board,” says Proulx-Giraldeau. As for the rationale behind the cuts to research funding, he highlights media reports that suggest some words and phrases — such as those mentioning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), transgender research and disparities faced by minority ethnic groups — might be used to flag grants for further scrutiny.\n\n“What we’re seeing has us really worried, especially about how these attacks on science translate to attacks on science in Canada, directly and indirectly,” he says.\n\nHealth divides\n\nThe Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium is not the only cancer-trial platform affected by US cuts. As a specialist in acute leukaemia, Whitlock is part of a broader collaboration called the Children’s Oncology Group (COG), which is the world’s largest research organization for childhood and adolescent cancers. The COG operates across more than 220 institutions, with over 100 clinical trials active globally. Of these, 76 involve patients at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children.\n\nBudget release: Canada courts US researchers and signals wider commitment to science\n\nThe first whisper of trouble came early on in the year, when Whitlock learnt that certain international research projects would no longer receive NIH funding, a development subsequently confirmed by the COG leadership. Not wanting to halt the group trials taking place at his hospital, Whitlock and his colleagues accessed funding through the hospital’s foundation. However, the longevity of this measure is unclear. “That puts us in a real dilemma,” he says.\n\nOther Canadian health researchers are feeling the pressure, too. Meghann Lloyd, a physical-activity and disability researcher at Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, investigates the incidence of preventable health conditions among children with disabilities globally. In June 2024, Lloyd was part of a team that submitted an NIH grant application with a US colleague. “We scored quite well, but just below the funding line,” she says. When they resubmitted a few months later, around the time of the 2024 US election, the proposal fell into what she calls “purgatory”. It was eventually sent back in May 2025 with a note about it “not aligning with the goals of the administration”, says Lloyd.\n\nClinical trials at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children have been affected by US funding cuts.Credit: Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images\n\nShe adds that it seems as if “disability has been enveloped or absorbed under this anti-equity, diversity and inclusion [rhetoric]”. For resubmission, she says that their application had to be stripped of keywords deemed by the grant officer at her institution and her US colleague as potentially problematic, including ‘inequity’, ‘disparity’ and ‘less access’. Because Lloyd is a full professor who has other projects, it’s not a make-or-break career issue, she says, but: “I’m a little bit nervous about my colleagues’ [careers] in the US.”\n\nBridging the gap\n\nThe cuts are also a concern for Canada’s early-career researchers, including health scientist Jean-Christophe Bélisle-Pipon at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, who does not have a tenured position. He studies the ethical, legal and social impacts of medical artificial intelligence, and his core research is NIH-funded. The impact of recent cuts to the agency were huge, he says, “especially in terms of stress”.\n\nAlthough Bélisle-Pipon is salaried, he had to reassure his university’s administrators that his team of about 20 research associates and graduate students, who were supported by a mixture of Canadian grants and an NIH grant, could be paid until the end of the year. And then he needed to talk to his team. Seeing the news about the US budget cuts, “I couldn’t give them formal or firm reassurance that everything will be fine,” says Bélisle-Pipon.\n\nStanding up for Inuit-led research in Canada’s changing Arctic\n\nCurrently, his team’s NIH funding has not been cancelled — but his approach has substantially shifted. In his US funding applications, Bélisle-Pipon now focuses on overall AI governance and oversight, instead of safeguards that relate to access and DEI. “I met with the NIH programme officer, and they reviewed my research programme to make sure that I don’t engage any more on DEI.”\n\nHowever, funding agencies in Canada, such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, continue to fund his DEI-focused research, particularly because it relates to ethics in medical AI. “I still think that it’s extremely important,” he says, but he now creates “a wall between the two”, making sure that everything pertaining to governance and ethics of his NIH-funded research is shielded from his Canadian-focused DEI research.\n\nComprehensive national data on the effects of the US cuts in Canada are lacking, but some institutions have been tracking the effects at a local level. Leah Cowen, who is vice-president for research, innovation and strategic initiatives at the University of Toronto, says that 4% of the university’s Can$1.5-billion (US$1.1-billion) annual research funding comes from foreign sources, of which the United States is one. Although that’s a small percentage overall, it “can have very profound impacts”, says Cowen, especially for those staff who have extensive collaborations with US investigators. “The impacts of the US cuts have been changing over time,” she says, because of various US executive orders and subsequent legal challenges. In vaccine-hesitancy research, for example, “we’ve seen programmes in that space specifically paused,” Cowen adds.\n\nLeah Cowen at the University of Toronto.Credit: Tim Fraser/Courtesy of the Connaught Fund\n\nIn response, the University of Toronto launched an emergency research fund last month to support faculty members for up to a year, allowing them to re-engage with US partners. In the interim, the university is encouraging researchers to diversify their funding sources, such as by looking to other international partners. Many scientists who spoke to Nature in October also hoped to see new funding for science in the Canadian government’s budget — released earlier this month, it indeed provided modest relief and optimism for Canadian researchers.\n\nCowen underlines that science spending accounts for just over 1% of all US federal funding, as noted in a February article by editors from the US microbiology community (I. Blader et al. ASM Case Rep. 1, e00043-25; 2025). This means that research cuts will not drastically alter or improve the US national budget, “but will decimate what’s been absolutely critical for US sovereignty and technological innovation and solving global challenges”, she says.\n\nNatural resources\n\nCross-border fieldwork is another area that has been imperilled by US funding cuts. In Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory conducts many environmental-monitoring programmes, including tracking levels of cyanobacterial blooms in waterways used for drinking, fishing and recreation — a task that relies on data from both sides of the US–Canada border. Municipal decisions on adjusting or stopping the drinking-water supply rely on this real-time data.",

          "abstract": "Credit: Suriya Silsaksom/Alamy\n\nPigeons can sense Earth’s magnetic field by detecting tiny electrical currents in their inner ears, researchers suggest. Such an inner compass could help to explain how certain animals can achieve astonishing feats of long-distance navigation.\n\nThe team performed advanced brain mapping as well single-cell RNA sequencing of pigeon inner-ear cells. Both lines of evidence point to the inner ear as the birds’ ‘magnetoreception’ organ. The results appeared in the Science on 20 November 1.\n\n“This is probably the clearest demonstration of the neural pathways responsible for magnetic processing in any animal,” says Eric Warrant, a sensory biology researcher at the University of Lund in Sweden. Studies have suggested that various animals, including turtles, trout and robins, can sense the direction and strength of magnetic fields, although the evidence has sometimes been contested — and the mechanisms have remained controversial.\n\nBird-brained navigation\n\nTwo leading hypotheses have led the research into how birds sense magnetic fields. One is a quantum-physics effect in retina cells where birds ‘see’ magnetic fields. Another is that microscopic iron oxide particles in the beak could act as tiny compass needles. However, it’s largely unknown where magnetic information is sensed in animals’ brains and how sensory neurons confer sensitivity to electromagnetic changes.\n\nIn 2011, researchers found hints that magnetic fields triggered pigeons’ vestibular system, the organ that enables vertebrates to sense accelerations (including gravity) and helps them to stay balanced2. The structure is made of three fluid-filled loops which are mutually perpendicular, so they can communicate to the brain the direction of an acceleration by breaking it down into three ‘x, y, z’ components.\n\nCompass protein attracts heap of criticism\n\nDavid Keays, a neuroscientist at Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, designed an experiment that could reveal how pigeons’ brains respond to magnetic fields.\n\nKeays’ team exposed pigeons to a magnetic field slightly stronger than Earth’s for just over an hour. The birds’ heads were immobilized and the magnetic field was continually rotated to simulate the heads’ motions with respect to Earth’s geomagnetic field.\n\nNext, the team used a method for measuring activation patterns of neurons across the brain — by measuring a genetic marker of cell activity in pigeon brains made transparent by a technique called clearing. Maps of brain activity in birds that had been exposed to magnetic fields were compared to a control group that had not been exposed to magnetic fields.\n\nThe results showed neuronal activity related to magnetic fields in the brain region that receives input from the vestibular system, as well as in regions that help to integrate various sensory stimuli. This result narrowed down the list of potential compasses to one — the vestibular system — although it did not explain how pigeon neurons can physically sense magnetic fields.\n\nA magnetic sense organ\n\nIn principle, a conducting material in an organism could produce electric currents in response to magnetic fields, giving an animal a ‘magnetic sense’ — a mechanism that has been proposed as early as 1882 by French zoologist Camille Viguier3.\n\nIn previous research, Keays had looked for a molecular mechanism of this magnetoreception by following inspiration from the biophysics of sharks and skates, which have organs that sense minute electric fields to help them find prey4. These animals express a protein sensitive to changes in neurons’ electrical activity, but modified with a 10-amino-acid-long insertion that allows them to sense electrical currents generated from magnetic fields.\n\nFruit flies’ ability to sense magnetic fields thrown into doubt",

          "authors": "Dariusz Jemielniak",
          "abstract": "Credit: Adapted from Getty\n\nMore than half a century ago, information scientist Derek De Solla Price observed that the scientific literature was growing exponentially, doubling every 10–15 years1. Little did he know that this observation would spawn not just a field of study, but an entire industry devoted to counting, measuring, weighing and indexing every aspect of academic output2. Today, the modern academic doesn’t just publish — they generate metrics. They don’t just research — they optimize their h-indices. And they certainly don’t just think up new ideas — they maximize citation counts while maintaining a favourable paper output.\n\nUltimately, they produce ‘units of assessment’, according to the UK Research Assessment Framework (REF), which the United Kingdom uses to allocate £2 billion (US$2.7 billion) in public research funding across its universities. They don’t collaborate; they strategically co-author, to maximize citation networks. And they certainly don’t read any more — who has time when there are metrics to massage?\n\nThe rise of the h-index: when counting became culture\n\nIt began innocently enough. Twenty years ago, physicist Jorge Hirsch at the University of California, San Diego, proposed the h-index. It was elegantly simple: a scholar with an h-index of n has published n papers that have each been cited at least n times3. Hirsch’s original paper suggested that “for physics, a value for h of about 10–12 might be a useful guideline for tenure decisions at major research universities”.\n\nOh, sweet summer child, to quote a popular line from Game of Thrones.\n\nWhat Hirsch had unleashed was not merely a metric, but a compulsion. Within a decade, the h-index had metastasized across disciplines. And very quickly, rather than a metric, it became a target. Search committees began sorting candidates by h-index; promotion committees set h-index thresholds; graduate students started checking their h-indices with the frequency and anxiety typically reserved for checking a dating app.\n\nAn explosion of metrics\n\nBut why stop at one number when you could have dozens? The h-index begat the g-index (which gives more weight to highly cited articles)4, which begat the e-index (to account for citations beyond those considered in the h-index), the a-index (to measure the average number of citations in a researcher’s top papers) and the m-index (which takes career length into account). There is now the i10-index (the number of publications with at least ten citations), the h-core (the core set of papers considered by the h-index) and the contemporary h-index (which adds a decay function, because apparently citations should have a half-life).\n\nEach new metric arrived with its own justification, its own formula and its own promise to finally capture the true essence of scholarly impact.\n\nTo me, metrics are like trying to measure the ocean by counting waves, each new metric promising to quantify them more accurately than the last. The REF, for example, gave us ‘impact case studies’ — documents that describe research impact beyond academia. Australia’s Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) introduced ‘research quality indicators’ to assess research quality across disciplines. The Leiden Manifesto5 actually had to remind us that “quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment” — a bit like reminding people that food should be chewed before swallowing. Naturally, these metrics are justified as ensuring accountability to taxpayers, who surely lie awake at night wondering about h-indices rather than, say, whether scientists have cured cancer or explained consciousness.\n\nMeanwhile, the publishers watched and learnt. We now have a panopticon of productivity, in which every citation is counted, every self-citation scrutinized and every collaboration strategically calculated for maximum metric optimization.\n\nEnter the j-index: the weight of true scholarship\n\nI humbly propose a new, maybe-slightly-ironic, metric. This captures what truly matters in academic work: physical heft. I call it the j-index, and its calculation is refreshingly straightforward:\n\nJ = W ÷ Y\n\nWhere W is the total weight (in kilograms) of all books a scientist has authored, and Y is the number of years since the author earned their doctorate.\n\nConsider the elegant simplicity. No longer must we worry about citation cartels (in which authors cite each others’ publications to boost citation counts) or gaming the system through self-citation. The j-index is immune to such manipulation — unless the books are printed on heavy paper stock, which should be discouraged through strict guidelines on acceptable paper weights. On the plus side, no longer will scholars insist on softcover editions: just think how many trees we can save!",

          "authors": "Brian Owens",
          "abstract": "The contents of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s first federal budget, released on 4 November, came as a relief to many researchers in Canada – because a large cut to the country’s three main research-funding councils failed to materialize. The nation has also poured further investment into attracting international scientists from abroad.\n\nWith the economic fallout from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the planned increases in expenditure on housing, infrastructure and national defence, Canada’s government departments had been asked to plan for 15% cuts in the lead-up to the 2025 budget. The scientific community feared that had those cuts been applied to the funding councils, they would have erased the large, multi-year increase promised in the 2024 budget. Much of this increase had been earmarked for long-overdue salary boosts for PhD students and postdoctoral fellows.\n\nNature Spotlight: Canada\n\nIn the end, the funding councils were spared the worst of the cuts and asked to find only 2% in savings. Three other areas were exempted from the 15% target: national security and public safety; Indigenous reconciliation; and gender equality, including for people from sexual and gender minorities (LGBTQ+).\n\n“Given the context, the fact that the government put science, research and innovation front and centre and said we cannot cut here is extremely encouraging for us,” says Félix Proulx-Giraldeau, interim executive director of the science-advocacy group Evidence for Democracy in Ottawa. “It shows that they understand that science is central to Canada’s competitiveness in this changing global context.”\n\nThe 2% cut leaves the planned funding increase from 2024 largely intact. The savings will be found from councils’ operational funding, leaving grants untouched, according to Robert Asselin, chief executive of U15 Canada, an association of 15 of the country’s most research-intensive universities.\n\nAsselin also welcomed five-year plans to invest Can$925 million (US$660 million) in artificial-intelligence infrastructure ($800 million of which had been promised in previous budgets), plus $334 million in quantum technologies — calling the plans “a great sign of the government’s commitment to science and technology”. He also hailed a promised $68-million investment over three years to establish the Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science (BOREALIS). This would be focused on developing technologies related to national defence.\n\nScience on shaky ground: Canadian research shifts in the wake of US cuts\n\nBut the biggest science-related announcement in the budget was $1.7 billion in new money to attract more than 1,000 high-level international researchers to Canada. That includes $1 billion over 13 years to support new professorships through the Accelerated Research Chairs programme, $133 million over three years for the relocation of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows, and $120 million over 12 years for the recruitment of assistant professors. There will also be $400 million, spread over seven years, to improve research infrastructure to support people who are brought in through the chairs programme.\n\n“Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research,” said finance minister François-Philippe Champagne in his budget speech. “We will make sure that the best and brightest continue to choose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.”\n\nAlthough the initiative is not specifically aimed at US researchers, the budget includes a pledge to create an accelerated immigration pathway for those who already hold US H1-B visas, making the intent clear.\n\n“The budget is a reflection of the government’s priorities, and the fact that they came through with real dollars and clear language about science shows real leadership and a clear direction for the future,” says Asselin. “They want to compete and bring the best and brightest here.”\n\nStanding up for Inuit-led research in Canada’s changing Arctic",

          "authors": "Virginia Eubanks",
          "abstract": "Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship Bruce Schneier and Nathan E. Sanders MIT Press (2025)\n\nThe tsunami of writing on artificial intelligence tends towards either bald hype or panicked dystopianism. Proponents say that AI will revolutionize health care, drive business growth and become our new best friend. But for its critics, AI could cause massive unemployment, perpetuate fake news and pose an extinction risk to humankind.\n\nWhy an overreliance on AI-driven modelling is bad for science\n\nIn Rewiring Democracy, cybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier and data scientist Nathan Sanders offer a welcome middle path by focusing on practical politics. In a heartfelt, if workmanlike, way, they craft a framework for maximizing the democratic potential of AI. Yet, by shrinking and distorting the vexing political challenges that the world faces today to fit a single solution — AI — they short-change the frustrating glories of living together as human beings.\n\nStructured clearly enough, even for readers who know little about AI, the book is rich with concrete examples and absorbing speculation. Schneier and Sanders propose that every aspect of democratic governance — such as negotiating procurement contracts, drafting legal briefs, producing local news or facilitating conversation across political divides — could be enhanced by the thoughtful application of AI developed under public control for public benefit.\n\n“Entrenched elected officials, political movements with authoritarian tendencies, and the billionaire class all regard AI as a new tool to consolidate and centralize power,” they write. “But the rest of us, the public, can harness it as a tool to distribute power instead.”\n\nFor example, a personal “army of AI minions” could extend individual power by making it easier to speak out. AI agents could make political decisions on our behalf, guessing our preferences on the basis of past behaviour and communicating them swiftly to legislators.\n\nAI for the people\n\nAI, the authors write, could either enrich or undercut different modes of political participation: campaigns, legislation, public administration, courts, organizing and advocacy. AI as is, designed by corporate players and supercharging an already unequal political system, might exacerbate discrimination and harm, allow lobbyists to concentrate their power and leave the most vulnerable people with shoddy digital attorneys rather than pricier human ones. Public AI — designed to enrich democracy — could target government resources more effectively, lower the cost and expertise needed to generate legislation, and simplify the drafting of complaints.\n\nAI can supercharge inequality — unless the public learns to control it\n\nHowever, the democratic potential of AI will not be realized unless four conditions are met. First, the commercial AI ecosystem must be reformed, by providing robust public alternatives to technologies that are privately owned and controlled. Second, authoritarian or unethical uses of AI must be resisted by ensuring that “democratic principles … govern its development and deployment”. Third, responsible government AI must consider social impacts, weigh the risks and benefits carefully and ensure accountability. Fourth, Schneier and Sanders think, social movements could help to renovate democracy by galvanizing “their constituents to respond to the long-standing democratic threats magnified by AI”.\n\nIn the final section, Schneier and Sanders describe their vision for nurturing “robust noncorporate alternatives” to commercial tools. Imagining public AI as a “universal economic infrastructure”, like publicly run schools and highways, the authors favour multilateral, anti-monopoly regulation that might allow citizen AI to compete against the products of ‘big tech’ — an approach that the United Nations is discussing. They offer organizing principles for a shared vision of democratic AI, one that is broadly capable, widely available, transparent, meaningfully responsive, actively stripped of its biases, reasonably secure and non-exploitative.\n\nMany readers will be sympathetic to these goals. Which is why it is so disappointing that the book’s fundamental premise — that democracy can best be understood as an information system — fatally undermines those objectives.\n\nGovernment is not a machine\n\nThink of democracy “as an information system for turning individual preferences into group policy decisions, and then executing those decisions through society”, Schneier and Sanders write. But democracy isn’t a flow chart or an executable piece of computer code. Preferences are formed in the process of governance, not just counted. And as any first-year student of political science can affirm, implementation, particularly at the street level, creates, shapes and modifies policy as often as it executes it.\n\nGovernments need formal rules and copious, reliable data to function efficiently and fairly. But democracies are also human, value-laden institutions for negotiating the contradictions that come with living together well. The model of government as information system has no place for the sophistication and difficulty of what democracies attempt to accomplish, or the standards to which they are held.\n\nA system at Moscow Metro stations recognizes passengers’ faces, allowing people to board trains and make cashless payments for journeys.Credit: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty\n\nFor example, Schneier and Sanders argue that the purposes of democracy include “peaceful transition of power, majority rule, fair decision-making, better outcomes”. They fail to mention equally crucial aims, such as preventing tyranny, protecting minority rights, balancing conflicting values, stewarding collective wealth and nurturing human capacity.\n\nThe premise that democracy is an information system obscures the thorniest challenges that AI poses to governance. It assumes that, if everyone has equal access to reliable, accurate and timely data, our disagreements will dissolve. But we live in a world of genuinely incommensurate interests.",

These sequences usually have cancer-promoting genes and gene-regulatory sequences that enable tumour growth, adaptation and survival. Unlike cancer-promoting genes residing on chromosomes, which are always inherited by the next generation of cells, genes on ecDNA are reliably inherited only if they tether to chromosomes when cells divide3, and untethered ecDNA can get lost over time as cells replicate. In cell division, ecDNAs are not segregated equally into daughter cells, which means that cancer cells in a tumour can contain varying amounts of cancer-promoting genes.

          "abstract": "Theoretical astrophysicist Debarati Chatterjee has always seen gender for what it is — a social construct. Despite witnessing domestic violence as a child, experiencing sexual harassment as an undergraduate and a PhD student, and being one of the small proportion (around 20%) of astronomers in the world who are women, she hasn’t let her gender define her career.\n\nLeaving her home country of India to start a postdoctoral position in Germany in 2010, she saw that prejudices based on race, class and gender also existed in the international scientific community. Chatterjee works in the emerging and male-dominated field of gravitational-wave science. She studies neutron stars — ultra-dense cores that are left over when massive stars collapse — by looking at gravitational waves, or ripples in the fabric of space-time. It’s an approach that brings together several disciplines, including nuclear, particle and condensed-matter physics.\n\nOn her return to India in 2020, she joined the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune. In June, the 45-year-old was promoted to full professor, becoming the first woman to be awarded this role in the institution’s 37-year history. Her research group generates complex theoretical models to crack the mystery of the interior composition of neutron stars.\n\nShe also wants more women to pursue science subjects, especially astrophysics, and has held various roles to promote gender equity. She was a core member of the IUCAA’s committee to combat sexual harassment and was part of the Astronomical Society of India’s Working Group for Gender Equity, for which she helped to run campaigns highlighting pioneering work by female Indian scientists. An avid science communicator, this year, Chatterjee launched the Indian branch of the Pint of Science festival — an annual festival that invites scientist to pubs and cafés to share their latest research — this year across three cities. Chatterjee has also popularized the science behind the planned Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory-India (LIGO-India), which is to be built in a rural area called Hingoli. By delivering talks at schools, universities and astronomy clubs across India, she helps to inspire girls and young women to become scientists.\n\nChatterjee spoke to Nature about how she overcame sexual harassment to become an astrophysicist, and why she promotes gender and racial diversity in her field.\n\nWhat is the great passion that has driven you as a scientist?\n\nCuriosity and adventure have always driven me. Since childhood, I have been obsessed with finding solutions, and I don’t rest until I get to the root of the issue. The fact that science can be about addressing extremely complex problems, which can take a lifetime to solve, excites me. Even for someone like Einstein, conundrums in fields such as quantum physics and general relativity were too difficult to solve in his lifetime. During my undergraduate studies at St Xavier’s College in Kolkata, my summer project at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) was about understanding how the Sun rotates, a question that remains unanswered. That was when I fell in love with how the academic world works.\n\nWhen I went to the IIA, I realized I didn’t need to pursue a 9-to-5 routine. I saw that some researchers woke up at 10 a.m. and worked past midnight — then they would go off to play badminton until the early hours. I was very attracted to this way of life. Also, visiting observatories such as the Vainu Bappu Observatory in Tamil Nadu, which is in the middle of a forest, felt like an adventure that I was ready to have for the rest of my life.\n\nDebarati Chatterjee (front row, second from right) with students at a Pint of Science outreach event.Credit: Kshitij Parshetti/Pint of Science India\nWhen did you realize you wanted to tackle racism and sexism in science?\n\nThere have been countless times during my professional life when I have confronted unfriendly racist or sexist attitudes. I remember one incident when I was a postdoc overseas. A visitor to the laboratory made an incorrect statement during a seminar, and I pointed it out. While I was having this conversation, several members of my institute walked out of the room in protest at my questioning the visitor. Such disrespectful microaggressions were a daily occurrence.\n\nAs a foreigner, if I didn’t speak the local language, I would be left out during important conversations, which sometimes happened when researchers were socializing. Many of my peers would give up and retreat into isolation. Instead, I learnt to speak five languages with enough fluency that I could give interviews in them. Adapting to new fields of research and work environments is crucial for all early-career researchers, and it is often necessary for people to receive full credit for their contributions and achievements. These days, there are welcome centres that help international students to tackle such issues.\n\nAt other times, while taking part in official inquiries into why there are so few women in nuclear and particle physics, I have had an institute director barge in demanding to know, “Why is this taking so long?”. These experiences have motivated me to stand up for myself, and to work towards diversity, equity and inclusion to set an example for others who might not speak up because of a lack of support. I have heard from leading female theoretical physicists about how hard their journey has been and why speaking up is necessary.\n\nHow have you dealt with racism or discrimination in your personal and professional life?\n\nDuring my PhD, I faced many instances of sexual harassment from a senior scientist. I had no choice but to continue my studies, because my living expenses depended on my fellowship. This person often told me that I was not good enough and that my work was inconsequential. The overwhelming pressure of the situation threw me into clinical depression, and I had to consult a therapist. I also took my grievance to the head of the department, who advised me to focus on completing my degree, because I was close to submitting my thesis. Two decades ago, there were hardly any female theoretical physicists at my university, and there was no office to which one could complain. I even trained in martial arts for self-defence at the time.\n\nTowards the end of my PhD, I won a German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) fellowship, which gave me and my work international exposure, and helped me to develop a wide collaboration network. That is how I became an independent researcher who did not have to rely on any senior scientist for advancement.\n\nWho has been your biggest influence or mentor, and why?",

          "abstract": "People with measles are barred from entering a hospital in Canada, which has seen a surge in cases of the highly infectious disease in 2025.Credit: Nicole Osborne/The Canadian Press via ZUMA Press\n\nA surge in measles cases has cost Canada its official measles-free designation — and the United States looks likely to follow suit.\n\nThe spike in Canada’s measles rate has been dramatic: so far, there have been 4,843 confirmed cases in 2025, up from just 147 cases in 2024 (see ‘Canadian surge’). Meanwhile, the United States has had more than 1,720 confirmed cases this year, more than in any year in the past three decades. If the disease continues to spread until January 2026, the United States could lose its ‘measles elimination’ status — a label applied to regions that have had no endemic measles transmission for at least 12 months — early next year.\n\nSource: Health Infobase, Government of Canada\n\nPublic-health officials say that the surge in cases in North America is concerning, and possibly a sign of worse things to come. But these outbreaks are not unprecedented in the broader picture.\n\nThe global number of measles cases was much higher in 2019 (see ‘Up and down and up again’), when Africa was hit hard by outbreaks. And 2024 was particularly bad in Europe; the region saw double the number of measles cases it recorded in 2023, and the United Kingdom declared a national incident.\n\nSource: World Health Organization\n\nHealth officials around the world have been trying to quash measles for decades, with variable success. Countries and regions come and go from the measles-free list frequently. “Elimination is a fragile state,” says William Moss, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nThe Americas became the first — and, so far, only — World Health Organization (WHO) region to be declared measles-free, in 2016, but this status didn’t last long, thanks to an outbreak in Venezuela in 2018 that spread to Brazil. The region clawed back its status in 2024, but has now lost it again, thanks to the 10 November decision about Canada, made by the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nHigh bar\n\nThe WHO recommends that countries vaccinate 95% of children with two doses of measles-containing vaccine. Few countries hit that mark: in the European Union in 2023, for example, only four countries achieved it. “That’s an aspirational goal. A country can eliminate measles without 95% coverage,” notes Moss; outbreaks tend to happen in communities in which the coverage is much lower than the national average.\n\nGlobally, the rate of measles vaccination with one dose — which provides some protection — has hovered between 81% and 86% for more than a decade, and is currently recovering from a dip that occurred during the pandemic as a result of disruptions in vaccine delivery (see ‘Widespread protection’). Many countries, including the United States and Canada, maintain a rate of around 90% for one dose.\n\nSource: UNICEF",

          "authors": "Michael E. Mann",
          "abstract": "Fifteen years ago, my friend and mentor, climate scientist Stephen Schneider, said something that has stuck with me. When it comes to climate change, the “end of the world” and “good for you” are “the two lowest-probability outcomes”.\n\nExtreme heat harms health — what is the human body’s limit?\n\nSteve’s aphorism feels especially prescient today. As the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) plays out in Belém, Brazil, this month, misleading climate messaging in the media espouses both these extremes.\n\nAt one end, take the actions of billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. On 28 October, he astounded climate advocates by publishing a manifesto arguing that the climate crisis is less urgent than other major problems that humanity faces (see go.nature.com/23xed). Jarringly, its publication coincided with the devastating Jamaican landfall of potentially the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, an event that human-caused warming made more likely to happen.\n\nGates wasn’t implying that global warming is “good for you”, but his arguments are adjacent to that sentiment: there has already been enough progress on climate, and we should instead prioritize addressing what he feels are more pressing issues, such as poverty and disease.\n\nDespite substantial criticism from me and other climate specialists that this presented a false trade-off between climate action and public health, Gates dug in his heels. “What world do they live in?” he said in an interview with the news outlet Axios, telling reporters that he would “let the temperature go up 0.1 degree to get rid of malaria”.\n\nClimate change is also a health crisis — these 3 graphics explain why\n\nIndeed, what world is Gates living in? The idea that climate action must come at the expense of efforts to address human health is a provable fallacy. In our book Science Under Siege (2025), public-health scientist Peter Hotez at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and I detail how these challenges are, in fact, inseparable. Human-caused climate change will exacerbate pandemics, as it did for COVID-19, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. How Gates or anyone else proposes to “get rid of malaria” in a rapidly warming world is anyone’s guess. This is a strawman argument.\n\nGates’ pivot has been celebrated by climate-change downplayers and fossil-fuel proponents in politics, including US President Donald Trump, and in segments of the media, including the newspapers The Wall Street Journal and New York Post — even if Gates has disavowed their characterizations of his position.\n\nMeanwhile, those at the opposite ‘end of the world’ extreme are hardly any more helpful. “It may be too late” announced Robert Hunziker, a freelance writer in Los Angeles, California, just one month ago on the news site Counterpunch. Such narratives of doom are often reinforced by media outlets that overstate the dire nature of the impacts that are baked in, with breathless headlines about supposed tipping points that have already been crossed. This feeds a collective sense of hopelessness.\n\nWhy we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change",

          "authors": "Liz Allen, Veronique Kiermer, Simon Porter, Ruth Whittam",
          "abstract": "A decade ago, we and others launched a tool for clarifying the roles of each author of a research paper. The Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) includes 14 types of contribution, from conceptualization to software and data curation. It was designed to prevent questionable authorship practices and make it easier for researchers to demonstrate the diversity of their contributions to science, among other benefits.\n\nCredit where credit is due\n\nThis year, taking stock, we’ve shown that adoption has risen steadily (see ‘More CRediT is being given’)1. By 2024, CRediT information was included in nearly 850,000 publications (encompassing articles, preprints and conference papers) — around 22% of the 3.7 million publications recorded last year in Digital Science’s Dimensions, a database of scholarly publications.\n\nThis level of uptake is remarkable, given that there have been no coordinated efforts or mandates from publishers and funders. But the issues that the taxonomy was conceived to tackle remain rampant in the research literature. Here we call for CRediT to become the norm, to support researchers and research integrity across the whole academic landscape.\n\nCRediT is still needed\n\nDespite widening use of CRediT, authorship conventions in scholarly publishing remain opaque and confusing, and differ by discipline. They typically provide little to no information about who contributed what in a study (see ‘The parts we played’). A name’s position in a list of authors is an unreliable indicator of the significance of that person’s work or the time they spent, particularly when the author list is long or alphabetical, as is common in economics2 and for large collaborations, and as also occurs in biomedical research3.\n\nStop treating code like an afterthought: record, share and value it\n\nQuestionable practices, such as including honorary authors, who are named but have not contributed, and excluding ‘ghost authors’, who have contributed but are not named, also remain prevalent — perhaps occurring in as much as one-fifth of biomedical papers4.\n\nMeanwhile, the volume of misconduct allegations and retractions in research is skyrocketing. When results are questioned after publication, transparency as to who did what helps investigators, supports accountability and can help to foster a responsible authorship culture more generally5.\n\nCRediT data can also be used to inform policy interventions that help to drive innovation, equity and impact in science. Data on author contributions have been used to study gender and the division of labour in research6,7, as well as variations in the distribution of roles across disciplines8, for example.\n\nSource: Analysis by L. Allen et al.\n\nThe tool can help institutions and funders to identify skills being used in cutting-edge fields. Institutions could use the taxonomy to analyse the contributions of their researchers and identify talent that should be retained and developed. Funders can identify specialists — such as data scientists or research software engineers — for targeted funding opportunities or to serve as expert peer reviewers.\n\nInitiatives such as the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), launched in 2012, and the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) now champion the need to consider diverse contributions to research when assessing individuals’ performance9. And the value of CRediT is increasingly acknowledged by science organizations such as the UK Academy of Medical Sciences. In 2022, the taxonomy became a recognized standard of the US National Information Standards Organization (NISO) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) — meaning that publishers and other stakeholders internationally are encouraged to adopt it.\n\nRoadblocks to progress\n\nDespite the need for CRediT, further progress is held back by the changing research landscape, a lack of resources and inconsistent implementation.\n\nThe use of CRediT has spread across disciplines and geographies1 — indicating that it strikes a chord. But some roles might fall outside the original 14 or be better represented by improving definitions of the existing roles, especially in fields such as social sciences and engineering, which were under-represented in the corpus of publications used to develop the taxonomy. For example, community engagement is becoming an increasingly important role as researchers strive to improve relationships with study participants, and because of citizen science. The CRediT term ‘software’ might need to be expanded to better reflect infrastructure development and data science. And the spread of new technologies, such as AI, could also alter the roles of scientists across the research landscape, from hypothesis generation to the writing-up of results.",

Drawing on recent behaviour publications from both fields, this Perspective highlights three issues relating to how they frame people. First, reference to ‘consumers’ in circular economy research contrasts with ‘people’ in some sustainable waste management papers. This represents an artificial separation of approaches to activities that are interwoven; furthermore, it implicitly defines a business agenda for the circular economy. Second, research into behaviour needs a broader methodological approach to identify variable needs and address underlying contextual and structural issues. Third, attention is needed to ongoing inequalities within and between countries that limit the effectiveness of circular economy implementation. Future research in these fields should prioritize human-centred approaches, including critical realism and qualitative methods, to uncover the socio-political constraints on behaviour and guide sustainability strategies that address the needs of people.",

E-waste contains highly toxic substances (including lead, cadmium, mercury, brominated flame retardants and persistent organic pollutants) and a mix of precious metals (such as gold, silver and palladium)2.\n\nIn many developed countries, e-waste management systems are established and regulated. Yet in many low- and middle-income countries, e-waste recycling is primarily driven by the informal sector: it is typically conducted in unregulated environments and often without the use of protective equipment or modern technologies2. Practices such as open burning, acid leaching and manual dismantling are common. These methods release toxicants into the air, soil and water, which creates widespread community exposure. Workers engaged in dismantling electronic components often suffer impaired renal and hormonal function, as well as increased risk of DNA damage3,4,5.

Predictive information is the mutual information between the past and future of a stochastic process. In simulations, we find that codes that minimize predictive information break messages into groups of approximately independent features that are expressed systematically and locally, corresponding to words and phrases. Next, drawing on cross-linguistic text corpora, we find that actual human languages are structured in a way that yields low predictive information compared with baselines at the levels of phonology, morphology, syntax and lexical semantics. Our results establish a link between the statistical and algebraic structure of language and reinforce the idea that these structures are shaped by communication under general cognitive constraints.",

It is unclear whether other animals require social learning to acquire adult-like breadths of information in the wild, including by key developmental milestones, or whether animals are capable of constructing their knowledge repertoires primarily through independent exploration. We investigated whether social learning mediates orangutans’ diet-repertoire development, by translating an extensive dataset describing wild orangutans’ behaviour into an empirically validated agent-based model. In this model, diets reliably developed to adult-like breadths only when simulated immatures benefited from multiple forms of social learning. Moreover, social learning was required for diets to reach adult-like breadths by the age immatures become independent from their mothers. This implies that orangutan diets constitute culturally dependent repertoires, with social learning enhancing the rate and outcomes of diet development past individual potentials. We discuss prospective avenues for researching the building of cultural repertoires in hominids and other species.",

This inference is based on genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from three geographically distinct populations, including behavioral data for one of them. The reconstructed genealogies form a wide network of kinship relationships resulting from the frequent occurrence of maternal and paternal half-siblings, reflecting male and female polygamy. Reproductive success is positively correlated with the strength of social interactions and the number of connections with opposite-sex individuals, implying a preference toward familiar mates and the importance of social relationships in determining mating patterns. This is supported by a nonrandom distribution of reproductive partners and a reproductive skew in males and females. Multiple paternity within litters points to female polygamy within a single estrus, and sexual size dimorphism implies sexual selection favoring larger males. Physiological changes resulting from polygamy, including increased male fertility and reduced breeding seasonality, could have facilitated the natural spread of novel adaptive traits and limited the introgression from wolves. The change in reproductive patterns, typically considered a consequence of selective breeding, could instead have occurred naturally in response to the dietary niche change, triggering further changes that facilitated the domestication process.",

          "abstract": "Dogs display temperamental and behavioral variation between individuals, just as psychiatric, temperamental, and cognitive traits vary in humans. In both species, these traits are highly heritable, yet causal genes remain incompletely understood. We performed 14 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for behavioral traits quantified using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) in ~1,000 golden retrievers, identifying 12 genome-wide significant loci ( P &lt; 2.97 × 10 −6 ) for 8 traits and 9 additional loci exceeding a suggestive threshold ( P &lt; 1 × 10 −5 ). A human phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) showed that most of the 18 canine positional candidate genes identified were associated with one or more of 190 psychiatric, temperamental, or cognitive traits in humans (7/12 genes at genome-wide loci and 5/9 at suggestive loci). For example, a genome-wide significant locus near PTPN1 (dog-directed aggression) overlapped with human measures of Intelligence, Educational attainment, and major depressive disorder. The gene ROMO1 was within a genome-wide significant locus for trainability in dogs and associated with intelligence, depression, irritability, and sensitivity/hurt feelings in humans. Other genes located at genome-wide significant loci associated with behavioral, psychiatric, temperamental, or cognitive traits in both species included PRDX1(dog-directed fear), VWA8 (touch sensitivity) , ITPR2, and ADGRL2/LPHN2 (trainability), and ADD2 (stranger-directed fear). From suggestive loci we also found cross-species associations for HUNK, and ZC3H12C, (dog-directed fear), SLC35F6 and IGSF11 (separation-related problems). These results suggest that shared genetic and molecular mechanisms underlie complex behavioral and temperamental states across species and may inform our understanding of emotional states driving undesirable behaviors in dogs.",

This work demonstrates that the foundational assumption of survey research—that a coherent response is a human response—is no longer tenable. I designed and tested an autonomous synthetic respondent capable of producing survey data that possesses the coherence and plausibility of human responses. This agent successfully evades a comprehensive suite of data quality checks, including instruction-following tasks, logic puzzles, and “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors, achieving a 99.8% pass rate on 6,000 trials of standard attention checks. The synthetic respondent generates internally consistent responses by maintaining a coherent demographic persona and a memory of its prior answers, producing plausible data on psychometric scales, vignette comprehension tasks, and complex socioeconomic trade-offs. Furthermore, its open-ended text responses are linguistically sophisticated and stylistically calibrated to the level of education of its assigned persona. Critically, the agent can be instructed to maliciously alter polling outcomes, demonstrating an overt vector for information warfare. More subtly, it can also infer a researcher’s latent hypotheses and produce data that artificially confirms them. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability in our data infrastructure, rendering most current detection methods obsolete and posing a potential existential threat to unsupervised online research. The scientific community must urgently develop new data validation standards and reconsider its reliance on nonprobability, low-barrier online data collection methods.",

          "abstract": "Balancing efficiency and flexibility in collective decision-making is increasingly critical in modern societies characterized by rapid sociocultural and technological change. Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has proposed two contrasting computational algorithms for social learning: value shaping (VS) and decision biasing (DB). VS posits that others’ choices serve as “pseudo-rewards” that directly shape an observer’s valuations, leading them to prefer popular options even in the absence of outcome feedback. In contrast, DB confines the influence of social information to behavior—observers may imitate popular actions, but they update their valuations solely through personal experience. Although both algorithms facilitate individual adaptation under uncertainty, their interactive dynamics and group-level consequences remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed computational models of VS and DB within a reinforcement learning framework and conducted agent-based simulations to examine collective performance in uncertain and dynamically changing environments. The results reveal a trade-off: VS enables rapid convergence and high efficiency in stable contexts, whereas DB promotes greater adaptability under environmental volatility. These differences are amplified in larger groups, particularly under strong majority influence. Importantly, evolutionary analyses indicate that both learning types can coexist stably, allowing their complementary strengths to enhance group performance. Together, our findings provide a computational and evolutionary account of how social learning can both enhance and impair collective intelligence—and suggest design principles for fostering resilient collective decision systems in human and AI societies facing rapid change.",

Individuals born in historically safe states remain safer wherever they go, while individuals born in historically dangerous states face a greater risk, including from police violence. This pattern holds across demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and marital status, across migrant groups with different average levels of education, income, and even when comparing migrants from different states who reside in the same county. To help understand why, we conducted a large national survey that oversampled internal White US migrants. The results suggest this persistence may reflect a sociocultural adaptation to dangerous settings. Residents and migrants from historically unsafe states—mainly former frontier states and the deep South—see the world as more dangerous, react more forcefully in aggressive scenarios, value toughness, distrust law enforcement, and say they rely on self and family in violent situations. These adaptations may have kept them safe in historically dangerous states, but may increase their vulnerability to harm in safer states.",

We present representations of these marginal valuations that embrace uncertainty and support robust implementation-even in environments characterized by “deep uncertainties.” These representations offer a more complete understanding of how interactions among multiple state variables, concerns about model misspecification, and uncertainties surrounding potentially long-term implications contribute to the cogent assessment of policies.

Our findings show that a substantive share of university students support viewpoint-based restrictions on academic discourse. While they also apply academic and prosocial criteria, they apply them more strongly to conservative viewpoints. The results further show that conservative statements are perceived as causing more social harm. However, prosocial concerns do not fully explain the higher demand for ideological viewpoint discrimination.

          "abstract": "Many domains in life require people to wait to access better outcomes, such as waiting in line to access prized tickets for a show, waiting to obtain a job offer from a selective firm, or being waitlisted for a prestigious university. Although waiting might be perceived as a fair mechanism to allocate resources, it may have unintended consequences on social inequalities as individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (SES) may be less likely to wait. In this study, we investigate socioeconomic differences in waiting behavior during the higher education admission process in France. To do so, we leveraged a unique national database that recorded the admission behavior of every high schooler in France over a period of three years. During the admissions process, students faced a trade-off: They could either accept an immediate offer from a university or wait in the hope of receiving a preferred offer later. Results collected among 274,316 students reveal that low-SES students were significantly less likely to wait for preferred offers, even when controlling for objective costs and benefits of waiting. This led low-SES students to ultimately enroll in programs they liked less and that were less prestigious. These results highlight how admission procedures generating uncertainty and requiring students to wait may inadvertently exacerbate educational inequalities. Such systems, while efficient, can end up favoring students who wait more. This research contributes to current discussions on admission procedure fairness by illustrating that seemingly neutral algorithms can in fact deepen social inequalities if their design rewards patience.",

          "abstract": "This study explores how individuals perceive their social networks, with a focus on their own positioning. Using experimental methods and network analysis, we show that people have a limited understanding of their social standing in terms of popularity (in-degree) and centrality. Few participants accurately estimate their popularity, and even fewer correctly identify their decile of centrality. A similar pattern emerges for their perceptions of the most popular and central individuals, but we find no correlation between the ability to assess one’s own position and the ability to detect key network members. Popular participants correctly perceive themselves as more popular, although they tend to misjudge their popularity more than less popular peers. They are nonetheless more accurate in estimating their centrality. Perceived centrality is only weakly correlated with actual centrality, but central individuals misperceive both their popularity and centrality to a greater extent. We further show that these misperceptions have real-world implications. Conditional on network positioning, students who see themselves as less popular and less central–and those with more accurate self-perceptions–tend to achieve higher grades, whereas individuals recognized by others as popular and central perform significantly better academically. These findings challenge theoretical models that assume accurate self-awareness of network positions and highlight the need to reconsider the implications for key-player interventions in public health, education, and organizational contexts.",

          "abstract": "Although prenatal exposure to famine is known to increase the risk of various noncommunicable conditions, its effects on infectious diseases remain poorly understood. We examined the effect of prenatal exposure to the Great Chinese Famine on risks for 11 notifiable infectious diseases in two consecutive generations through the analysis of &gt;4.4 million surveillance records in Sichuan Province, China. Using an approach combining cohort models with counterfactual effect imputation, we estimated the ratio of observed to expected incidence rates (incidence rate ratio, IRR) in the absence of famine among both the directly affected birth cohort (F1) and their possible offspring (F2). We further examined whether there was a dose–response relationship between famine severity and infectious disease outcomes using meta-regression at the prefecture level. We found that the risk of acquiring any of the 11 infectious diseases studied increased significantly among both the F1 (IRR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.21) and the F2 cohort (IRR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.15). IRRs for the F1 generation were higher in prefectures that experienced more severe famine, with one interquartile range increase in famine severity associated with a 3.95% (95% CI: 1.87 to 6.05%) increase in F1 IRR. Positive associations of varying magnitudes were estimated between increased risks in the F1 cohort and famine intensity for most individual diseases. Prenatal exposure to famine may have long-term and potential intergenerational impacts on the risk of a broad range of infectious diseases. Ensuring adequate prenatal nutrition may be crucial in reducing the burden of infectious diseases across generations.",

          "abstract": "The plant hormone gibberellin (GA 4 ) regulates numerous developmental processes. Within the root, GA 4 controls growth, in part, by controlling the extent of cell elongation. The nlsGPS1 FRET biosensor revealed a GA 4 gradient within the Arabidopsis root growth zones, with GA 4 levels correlating with cell length. We developed a multiscale mathematical model to understand how biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport create the GA 4 distribution within the root growth zones. The model predicted that phloem delivery of the biosynthetic intermediate GA 12 contributes to higher levels of bioactive GA 4 in the elongation zone, with the GA 4 synthesis pattern being further modified by local GA 12 synthesis in the quiescent center region and the spatial distribution of biosynthesis enzymes (GA20ox and GA3ox). Model predictions suggested that while GA20ox and GA3ox transcript is present throughout the growth zones, these enzymes are inactive in the dividing cells, which explains steep GA 4 gradients observed in the GA3ox overexpression line and improves agreement between model predictions and data in wildtype. The model suggested that the GA 4 gradient also depends on a balance of diffusion through plasmodesmata and catabolism. Both model predictions and biosensor data demonstrated that plasmodesmatal diffusion enables a more gradual GA 4 gradient, with higher diffusion antagonizing the GA 4 gradient. Model predictions suggested that catabolism limits GA 4 levels, which we validated via biosensor imaging in the ga2oxhept mutant. In conclusion, our results suggest that local GA 4 synthesis combines with diffusion and catabolism to create a spatial GA 4 gradient that provides positional information and patterns cell elongation.",

          "abstract": "The solute carrier (SLC)29A3 exports nucleosides from lysosomes into the cytosol, maintaining solute homeostasis and providing metabolic intermediates for cellular processes. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC29A3 cause H syndrome, characterized by histiocytosis, hyperinflammation, and immunodeficiency. While dysfunctions in various cell types contribute to H syndrome and to SLC29A3 deficiency in mice, the mechanisms driving hyperinflammation and immunodeficiency are incompletely understood. Remarkably, the possible role played by dendritic cells (DCs), the most efficient antigen (Ag)-presenting cells and the main cellular link between innate and adaptive immunity, remains unknown. We show that, in murine DCs, SLC29A3 is recruited to phagosomes after bacterial capture, maintains phagosomal pH homeostasis, and ensures optimal antimicrobial phagosomal signaling to the production of IL-6, IL-12, pro-IL-1β, and CCL22. In addition, SLC29A3 promotes Ag presentation on MHC-II molecules to initiate adaptive immune responses. Notably, SLC29A3 supports the activity of the lysosomal calcium channel TRPML1, promoting the nuclear translocation of transcription factor TFEB and inducing autophagy, a major anti-inflammatory mechanism. Overexpression of human SLC29A3, but not the transport mutant G437R, in SLC29A3-deficient murine DCs restores cytokine production in response to bacterial phagocytosis, suggesting that SLC29A3 transport activity is required to drive phagosomal signaling. Our data suggest that SLC29A3 supports and controls immune function in DCs by promoting effective antimicrobial signaling and Ag presentation, and inducing autophagy. Our findings also uncover a TRPML1-dependent mechanism by which SLC29A3 activates TFEB and suggest that defects in phagosomal antibacterial signaling, TFEB activation, and autophagy may contribute to immunodeficiency and hyperinflammation in SLC29A3 disorders.",

          "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is crucial for cellular energy production, metabolism, and signaling. Its dysfunction is implicated in various diseases, including mitochondrial disorders, neurodegeneration, and diabetes. mtDNA is susceptible to damage by endogenous and environmental factors; however, unlike nuclear DNA (nDNA), mtDNA lesions do not necessarily lead to an increased mutation load in mtDNA. Instead, mtDNA lesions have been implicated in innate immunity and inflammation. Here, we report a type of mtDNA damage: glutathionylated DNA (GSH-DNA) adducts. These adducts are formed from abasic (AP) sites, key intermediates in base excision repair, or from alkylation DNA damage. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified the GSH-DNA lesion in both nDNA and mtDNA and found its significant accumulation in mtDNA of two different human cell lines, with levels one or two orders of magnitude higher than in nDNA. The formation of GSH-DNA adducts is influenced by TFAM and polyamines, and their levels are regulated by repair enzymes AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) and tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1). The accumulation of GSH-DNA adducts is associated with the downregulation of several ribosomal and complex I subunit proteins and the upregulation of proteins related to redox balance and mitochondrial dynamics. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the GSH-DNA lesion stabilizes the TFAM-DNA binding, suggesting shielding effects from mtDNA transactions. Collectively, this study provides critical insights into the formation, regulation, and biological effects of GSH-DNA adducts in mtDNA. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding how these lesions may contribute to innate immunity and inflammation.",

          "abstract": "Interleukin-2 (IL2) is the key trophic factor for T regulatory (Treg) cells, controlling their differentiation and homeostasis. To understand how temporally regulated responses to IL2 unfold in Tregs, we performed fine time-course analyses, at population and single-cell levels, of changes in chromatin architecture and mRNAs induced by IL2 in Tregs in vivo. The data revealed responses that were largely uniform in rTreg, but diverse among aTregs, matching different STAT5 signal transduction efficiency. Individual Tregs displayed divergences in the preponderance of changes that may be attributed to STAT1 or STAT5 signal transduction downstream of IL2. Chromatin analysis identified an evolving implication of transcription factors that accounted for the waves of responsive genes. Covalent cytokine/Ab complexes that preferentially trigger high- (heterotrimer) or low-affinity (heterodimer) IL2 receptors activated the same signatures, yet with strong quantitative variations, especially in NK cells. Thus, IL2 is not a monolithic activator for Tregs, but a variegated sculptor of Treg identity.",

          "abstract": "Cells in tissues navigate fibrous environments fundamentally differently than they do on flat substrates, but the establishment of cell forces in physiological fibrous settings remains poorly understood. Although factors such as the stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) are known to drive behaviors, including cell motility on flat nonfibrous substrates, the interplay between fiber architecture and stiffness in fibrous ECM is not known. Here, we find that in fibrous environments, the directionality of mechanical forces overrides ECM stiffness as the primary regulator of contractility in migrating cells. Using an approach combining phase microscopy with deep learning to map forces in real time, termed deep learning-enabled live-cell fiber-force microscopy (DLFM), we reveal that when cells transition between anisotropic and isotropic stress fields, their contractility significantly drops despite encountering stiffer ECM, contrary to the behavior of cells on flat nonfibrous substrates. Unlike the peripheral adhesions observed on flat nonfibrous substrates, cells in fibrous matrices form force-generating adhesions throughout their body, stabilized by out-of-plane mechanical components unique to fiber geometry. Cells exhibit distinct force signatures during migration, division, and differentiation, with temporal signatures that predict stem cell fate. These findings, enabled by combining deep learning and the mechanics of cells and fibers, explain long-standing paradoxical behavior of cells navigating deformable fibrous environments, how they can pull and tug at them, and identify tension anisotropy as a master regulator of cell behavior, with implications for cancer invasion, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.",

Herein, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) was used to differentiate malignant from benign endometrial tissues and assess lipidomic differences among patients with obesity and diabetes. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis was performed in the same patients to gain insights into the altered signaling pathways and investigate the protein expression levels in endometrial cancer cases and controls. Tissues from 64 women (50 cancer, 14 benign) were analyzed with DESI-MSI achieving 90% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Discriminatory spectral features were primarily phospholipids [phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), and phosphatidylinositol (PI)], all elevated in cancer. Proteomics revealed upregulated proteins linked to commonly dysregulated pathways in endometrial cancer, namely PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/RAS, and Wnt signaling pathways. Lipidomic differences were found between high- (obesity/diabetes) and low-risk phenotypes (no obesity/diabetes), with PE and PS elevated in high-risk benign and PE reduced in high-risk cancer cases. A single phospholipid (PE(O-38:4)) was found as discriminatory in both normal and cancer cohorts, which may serve as biomarker in women with benign histology at high-risk of developing endometrial cancer. This study reports the application of DESI-MSI for lipidomic characterisation of endometrial cancer.",

These effects have long been considered evidence for glassy physics in these and other materials having similar mechanics, such as the cytoskeleton. Here, we study such anomalous mechanics in a simulated wet foam driven by ripening and find behavior that has a different physical origin than that in glasses. Rather, the dynamics is due to a balance of forces from the system’s self-similar potential energy landscape and viscous stress. At the lowest viscosities, bubbles move intermittently, with the system shifting abruptly between shallow potential energy minima. For higher viscosities, in contrast, the bubbles move continuously and the system follows a tortuous, fractal path through high-dimensional configuration space, at higher mean energy than the lower viscosity case. The long-time dynamics and power-law rheology are the direct consequence of the potential energy landscape’s self-similar geometry. Last, we find that the slow recovery of perturbed foams is due to the foam being kinetically rather than energetically trapped in high-energy portions of the energy landscape. Overall, viscous ripening foams follow a biased energy minimization pathway that explores regions of the energy landscape that are qualitatively different (flatter and smoother) than those corresponding to well-annealed glasses.",

          "abstract": "Axolotls can regenerate lost limbs throughout life, while they continue to grow. This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF8), are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, which eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.",

In Australia, the degree to which the arrival of Europeans and their dogs impacted the ecology and ancestry of dingoes is contentious. To test for gene flow with European dogs, we sequenced genomes of 18 ancient Australian dingoes from the Nullarbor Plain, two early 20th-century New Guinean dingoes, a mid-19th-century kangaroo hound, and 33 contemporary dingoes from across Australia. To quantify dietary shifts after the arrival of the First Fleet (AD1788), we generated stable isotopic ( δ 13 C, δ 15 N) data for 55 directly dated ancient Australian dingoes spanning the last ~2,300 y. We show that the diet of Nullarbor Plain dingoes shifted soon after European arrival, possibly due to shifts in prey abundance. Our genomic analyses demonstrated that pre-European dingoes were more inbred than most contemporary dog breeds, possibly as a result of population bottlenecks. We also showed that many dingoes, particularly those from Southeast Australia, experienced admixture with European dogs. Although we detected European ancestry dating to the early 18th-century, the majority of gene flow events coincided with the initiation of landscape-scale population control in the 1960s. Furthermore, some European dog alleles may have provided adaptive benefits to dingoes and alleviated inbreeding depression. Despite the existence of gene flow with European dogs, dingoes have maintained their distinctiveness. This suggests that management strategies should prioritize maintenance of substantial population sizes across Australia to both facilitate effective purifying and positive selection on introgressed alleles, and mitigate inbreeding.",

However, the models forecasting this ecosystem N loss are based on laboratory experiments that are inherently uncertain and have had few in situ validations. Over 6 y, we measured ~200,000 soil nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O; a powerful greenhouse gas) fluxes and used an upscaling approach to estimate N 2 fluxes after warming a temperate forest by 2 °C. Against thermodynamic theoretical predictions, warming unequivocally lowered emissions of NO by 19% and of N 2 O by 16%. These lower gaseous N losses were not explained by complete reduction of NO and N 2 O to N 2 , leaching, nor plant uptake, but rather by the warming-induced drying of soils that constrained microbial activity, consistent with other warming experiments where precipitation was less than 1,000 mm y −1 . Our findings challenge ecosystem model assumptions where warming, alone, accelerates N emissions and underscores how warming-induced losses in soil moisture and shortened freeze-thaw periods can offset temperature effects. Our data underscore the need for explicit consideration of in situ soil moisture when predicting changes on the terrestrial N cycle as the planet warms.",

They do so by testing the effectiveness of two mental model-based interventions juxtaposing problematic claims with visualized or verbally explained models of basic biological and vaccination systems. Study 1: a) graphically modeled how mRNA COVID-19 vaccination works (Model 1); b) verbally modeled ways in which cells protect themselves from foreign DNA (Model 2); and c) provided ancillary material designed to bolster perceptions of mRNA vaccination safety. Study 2 deployed an animation of the cell-protection model (Model 2), alone, and in combination with Study 1’s messaging. Neither the mRNA vaccine nor the DNA protection model explicitly acknowledged the problematic DNA-integration claim. Both preemptive (before) and rebuttal (after) positioning of the models were effective. Within-person analyses suggested that preemptive positioning may be somewhat more effective than rebuttal positioning.

Increased vascular permeability was confirmed in a Gnaq p.R183Q mouse model. Knockdown of elevated angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in EC-R183Q partially restored the EC barrier, as did a MEK1,2 inhibitor, implicating MAPK/ERK signaling.

We identified neuropeptide Y (NPY) as a promotor of liver metastasis. Hepatocyte-derived NPY attracts metastatic tumor cells to the liver niche. Subsequent microenvironment activation induces TGFβ, promoting a vicious cycle of perimetastatic NPY secretion and liver metastasis. Concomitantly, cancer cells upregulate the NPY-5 receptor (Y5R) which is correlated with liver metastasis. NPY-Y5R crosstalk drives chemotactic migration via cAMP and ERK signaling. Moreover, NPY-Y5R activation dephosphorylates checkpoint kinase 2 to promote clonogenicity and proliferation of cancer cells. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a promising drug delivery vehicle for siRNAs. LNPs carrying siRNA pools targeting NPY were designed, and preclinical studies provided evidence for efficacy for the treatment of liver metastasis.

However, the mechanism for achieving specificity in downstream signaling remains poorly understood. Here, we present cryogenic electron microscopic structures of the S1PR3-G αq complex bound to endogenous agonists: d18:1 S1P or d16:1 S1P. Both agonists shared the same binding pocket and binding mode despite the different signaling intensities of the S1PR3-G αq signal pathway. By comparing the structures of two agonist-bound complexes, combined with mutagenesis studies, we identified key amino acids, Phe119 3.33 and Arg136 3.50 , that play crucial roles in differential agonist recognition and receptor activation. Furthermore, structural comparisons with previously determined S1PR3-G αi complex or G-protein-free S1PR3 structures, along with mutagenesis analysis, revealed dynamic intracellular loop 2 conformations and specific amino acid interactions that contribute to G-protein selectivity. Notably, we identified amino acids at the 34.50 and 34.53 positions within ICL2 as critical for specific interactions with G proteins.

Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space–time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions.

Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between NLRP7 and HLA-C expression was observed in EVTs from placental tissues and choriocarcinoma samples.

Here, we apply genomic and functional analyses to uncover somatic mutations and key genes associated with TR4 resistance. We observe recurrent selection for large deletions on chromosome 5 and a tendency for elevated expression of salicylic acid-responsive genes in resistant variants. Within deletion regions, we pinpoint two members of the autoinhibited Ca 2+ -ATPase ( ACA ) gene family, known negative regulators of plant immunity, as candidate susceptibility genes. Both ACA genes are downregulated in resistant variants. Silencing the ACAs in susceptible bananas enhances salicylic acid response and attenuates TR4 disease symptoms. Our study highlights the role of structural variation and copy number change of susceptibility genes like ACAs in shaping disease resistance in clonally propagated crops. Also, these findings provide a genomic framework for the development of TR4-resistant banana cultivars through targeted gene editing or selection of somatic variants.",

          "abstract": "Fluorescence in phytoplankton and other autotrophic organisms originates within the cell chloroplasts, where a fraction of the absorbed solar radiation is reemitted at longer wavelengths by photopigments. While traditionally employed as an indicator of physiological status, emerging evidence suggests that natural chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) may also play unanticipated functional roles in the marine environment. Here, we examine the ChlF emission fields generated by pennate planktonic diatoms, a key phytoplankton group playing a critical role in global biogeochemical cycles. Using cell micromanipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the ChlF emitted by Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta (Bacillariophyceae) is markedly anisotropic, a feature attributed to both the cells’ elongated morphology and the arrangement of chloroplasts within the cytoplasm. In these diatoms, fluorescence is preferentially emitted in the transapical direction, accounting for up to 35% of total emission. However, peak ChlF intensities occur at the cell apices, suggesting that the silica frustule focuses fluorescent light emission along the longitudinal axis. At elevated cell densities (~10 6 cells/L), the underwater light field is modulated by the combined effects of ChlF emission anisotropy and preferential alignment of diatom cells within the water column. Numerical simulations indicate that ChlF intensity can vary by up to 15% depending on whether cells are predominantly aligned—commonly in stratified water columns—or randomly oriented. These results suggest that diatom-driven modulation of the light field through structured ChlF emission may influence microscale optical environments, with potential consequences for processes ranging from intercellular signaling to large-scale phytoplankton dynamics, including remote sensing–based assessments of phytoplankton physiology.",

Recently, ultrasound-based printing (“sonoprinting”) approaches have emerged as a promising strategy to address this challenge. However, an approach to sonoprint conductive materials has yet to be realized, limiting potential bioelectronic applications. Here, we extend sonoprinting to conductive materials by designing temperature-based and pressure-based methods to polymerize conductive polymers with focused ultrasound (FUS). Our temperature-based approach relies on the acoustic attenuation of the surrounding medium to generate heat under FUS, whereas our pressure-based approach leverages the acoustic vaporization of perfluorohexane double emulsions to trigger polymerization. We demonstrate that both approaches can be used to print the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) through optically opaque hydrogels and biological tissue with high spatial resolution. Taken together, our results establish complementary temperature- and pressure-based methods for sonoprinting conductive polymers, paving the way for future efforts to fabricate bioelectronic interfaces in tissue.",

We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and treating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale, the computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of individual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent. We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective behavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for cancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and precise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in the presence of an external chemical gradient, move toward areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our model: the first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient fixed over time and centered at the cancer site; the second is a more speculative, dynamic variant in which agents themselves create and amplify a gradient centered at the cancer site. In both settings, agents sense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly than by simple Brownian motion. For the first variant, we present simulation and analytical results to bound the time it takes for agents to reach the cancer site. For the second, simulations highlight collective benefit from agent-generated signaling, showing significant runtime improvement via chemical signal amplification.",

Remarkably, SelO-mediated AMPylation is conserved in bacteria and humans, yet the enzyme that removes the AMP from modified proteins remains unknown. We show that the ribonuclease, RNase Z, is both necessary and sufficient to catalyze deAMPylation of AMPylated substrates. These results establish RNase Z as a moonlighting enzyme with previously unrecognized functional roles beyond tRNA processing, expanding our understanding of its biological significance.

This aggregation mechanism exerts a broad inhibitory effect on various enzymes and facilitates the construction of artificial cells with controllable reaction processes. Leveraging this phenomenon, we have developed a microfluidic platform to fabricate giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that encapsulate CFPS systems, thereby constructing artificial cells with finely tunable protein expression. By incorporating targeted DNA templates, these artificial cells can selectively express specific proteins in response to pH adjustments. Furthermore, in vivo studies using a bile duct ligation mouse model with liver injury further confirmed significant differences in protein expression under alkaline conditions compared to neutral conditions.

          "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies, largely due to its highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which fuels metastasis and resistance to immunotherapy. Through comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we identified multiple heterogeneous tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs) subpopulations as key regulators of PDAC progression, which coexpress MRC1 and exert their effects by actively suppressing antitumor immune responses. To overcome this barrier, we developed a spatiotemporal macrophage reprogramming platform that leverages STING phase separation to reprogram TAM plasticity and reshape the immune landscape. This system, MRC1-targeting peptide–M@BLZ945 (PMMB), integrates a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor and a STING agonist within a macrophage-mimetic nanostructure, enabling sequential, controlled reprogramming of TAMs. By leveraging STING phase separation, PMMB stabilizes TAMs in an antitumor CD80 + phenotype while preventing excessive inflammation, achieving durable immune activation. In preclinical models, PMMB not only suppresses both primary and metastatic PDAC but also enhances CD8 + T cell infiltration, reinvigorates anti-PD-1 therapy responses, and mitigates immune exhaustion. These findings establish spatiotemporal macrophage circuit engineering via STING phase separation as a cross-scale strategy to override PDAC’s immune barriers and drive next-generation macrophage-targeted immunotherapy. This study paves the way for rationally designed, precision macrophage modulation strategies in solid tumors.",

We measured how sites in these 3 cortical areas responded to variation in both dimensions. Contrast modulated responses in all areas. In V2 and V4, the presence of naturalistic structure both modulated responses and increased contrast sensitivity. Tuning for naturalistic structure was both strongest and most dispersed in V4. We measured how well populations in each area could support the linear readout of both dimensions. Populations in V2 and V4 could support the linear readout of naturalistic structure, but in V4, this readout was more robust to variations in contrast.",

          "abstract": "Natural genetic transformation is a conserved mechanism of bacterial horizontal gene transfer, which is directed entirely by the recipient cell and facilitates the acquisition of new genetic traits such as antibiotic resistance. Transformation proceeds via the capture of exogenous DNA, its internalization in single strand form (ssDNA) and its integration into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. While the proteins involved in these steps have mainly been identified, the specific mechanisms at play remain poorly characterized. This study takes advantage of recent advances in structural modeling to explore the uptake of ssDNA during transformation. Using the monoderm human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae , we model a tripartite protein complex composed of the transmembrane channel ComEC, and two cytoplasmic ssDNA-binding proteins ComFA and ComFC. Using targeted mutation and transformation assays, we propose that pneumococcal ComEC features a narrow channel for ssDNA passage, and we show this channel is conserved in the diderm Helicobacter pylori . We identify key residues involved in protein–protein and protein–ssDNA interactions in the pneumococcal tripartite complex model and we show them to be crucial for transformation efficiency. Structural modeling reveals that this tripartite protein complex and its interaction with ssDNA are conserved in Firmicutes. Overall, this study validates a tripartite complex required for the internalization of ssDNA during transformation in Firmicutes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in this horizontal gene transfer mechanism central to bacterial adaptation. It also demonstrates the power of recent structural modeling techniques such as AlphaFold3 as hypothesis generators and guides for designing experiments.",

          "abstract": "REversible Saturable Optical Linear Fluorescence Transitions (RESOLFT) superresolution microscopy fundamentally overcomes the diffraction barrier in far-field fluorescence microscopy. It relies on reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) that allow repeated light-induced transitions between fluorescent on- and nonfluorescent off-states. Because these transitions are induced by low-light intensities, RESOLFT superresolution microscopy is particularly suitable for live-cell imaging. So far, RESOLFT imaging has only been performed in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. To expand the RESOLFT concept into the near-infrared (NIR) region, which is characterized by reduced autofluorescence, lower scattering and decreased phototoxicity, we developed the p hotostabl e N IR r e versibly switchab l e flu o rescent p rot e in (PENELOPE), which is the first RSFP applicable in the NIR window. PENELOPE was generated by mutagenesis of the chromophore-binding domain of the Deinococcus radiodurans bacteriophytochrome. This NIR-RSFP exhibits high photostability and high ensemble switching contrast at low-light intensities. It also undergoes an unusually fast thermal fluorescence recovery from the dark state into an on-state. This was exploited for low-light intensity RESOLFT imaging with only a single wavelength, as the same light wavelength (660 nm) is used for off-switching and fluorescence readout, while the on-switching occurs in the absence of illumination. We demonstrate RESOLFT recordings both in chemically fixed and in living human cells using PENELOPE as a fusion protein.",

          "abstract": "Dogs were domesticated at least once from a yet-unidentified wolf population at least ~15,000 y ago. However, how domestication took place is a topic of ongoing debate, and the ability of human groups to manage wolves in their communities during early stages of domestication is poorly understood. Here, we report multiproxy data from two canids excavated from Late Neolithic and Bronze Age contexts in the Stora Förvar cave on the island of Stora Karlsö in the Baltic Sea. The island is small (2.5 sq km) and, like the neighboring island of Gotland, carries no endemic populations of terrestrial mammals. Instead, the current consensus is that human introductions account for some mammal fauna on Gotland, and for the majority of that on Stora Karlsö. Genome-wide data show that the two canids have ancestry indistinguishable from Eurasian wolves, with no shared ancestry with domestic dogs of the Canis familiaris lineage. Their genome-wide heterozygosity is lower than that observed in 72 previously published ancient wolf genomes, and instead comparable to dogs. Stable isotope data (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) reveals a diet rich in marine protein, which is consistent with habitation alongside the human groups who used Stora Karlsö as a seal-hunting, fowling, and sea fishing station, and in the Bronze Age probably also for grazing. Skeletal size is at the lower end of wolf variability, and one individual shows advanced pathology consistent with reduced mobility. While other scenarios are possible, a parsimonious explanation is that these wolves were brought to the island by humans and were possibly under human control.",

          "abstract": "The developing brain undergoes neuroplasticity driven by learning, experience, and memory formation. The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized membrane domain within the proximal axon that initiates action potential. Studies have demonstrated that the AIS exhibits plasticity by altering its length and/or localization to adjust the excitability in response to neural stimuli. However, how AIS plasticity may affect brain function is unclear. The 480-kDa giant ankyrin-G protein (gAnkG) is the master organizer of AISs and nodes of Ranvier. Previously, we reported that a neurodevelopmental disorder-linked variant (Thr1861Met) in the neuron-specific domain of gAnkG causes the formation of diffused AISs in cultured ankyrin-G null neurons. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse harboring this mutation. The knock-in mice displayed impairments in motor coordination and social interaction. Neurons from these knock-in mice formed elongated AISs with no significant reduction in the accumulation of key AIS components-including ankyrin-G, β4-spectrin, voltage-gated sodium channels, and neurofascin. Crucially, unlike wild-type AISs, which shorten in response to stimulation by high K + or chemogenetics (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs), the elongated AISs in mutant neurons failed to undergo such shortening, indicating a deficit in AIS plasticity. Neurons in the primary motor cortex and anterior cingulate cortex of knock-in mice exhibited AISs of normal length at early stage but failed to undergo the developmental shortening observed in wild-type neurons; by postnatal day 60, this resulted in elongated AISs and increased neuronal excitability in these regions. Thus, the gAnkG protein mutation impairs activity-dependent AIS plasticity, leading to abnormal neuronal excitability and behavioral deficits.",

Pathogens counteract nutritional immunity by expressing gene products that enhance growth in metal-limited conditions. One of the most transcriptionally induced genes in zinc-limited Neisseria gonorrhoeae , ngo1049, encodes a DUF4198 family protein we have named Zcp. This family of proteins is widely distributed in Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we provide the first structural, biochemical, and functional characterization of a DUF4198 protein. Zcp is a periplasmic, homodimeric substrate-binding protein (SBP), which binds one zinc ion per subunit with submicromolar affinity. We identified a zinc binding pocket in each subunit, composed of three histidine residues. Zcp enables maximal growth of N. gonorrhoeae in zinc-limited conditions but is dispensable for zinc uptake, in contrast to the cluster A-I SBP ZnuA, which is required for zinc import. The growth defect of zcp mutant N. gonorrhoeae is rescued by zinc supplementation. Zcp associates with proteins with roles in maintaining cell envelope integrity, and N. gonorrhoeae lacking zcp is more sensitive to envelope-targeting antimicrobials. Zcp enables infectivity of human epithelial cells and neutrophils by zinc-limited N. gonorrhoeae . We conclude that N. gonorrhoeae produces Zcp to buffer periplasmic zinc, which enables ZnuA to balance import of different metals and ensures the bioavailability of zinc for extracytoplasmic zinc-requiring proteins, as part of the coordinated response to host-imposed nutritional immunity.",

Here, we report observation of the 2D-to-3D transition and bulk-like structural features in the size-selected boron clusters, as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy, chemisorption experiments, and first-principles calculations.

Notably, B 56 – is also found to be able to chemisorb and activate CO 2 .

          "abstract": "In Xenopus laevis tadpole tail regeneration, lineage-restricted tissue stem cells produce differentiated cells that form regenerated tail tissues, but the behavioral dynamics of tissue stem cells during tail regeneration remain largely unknown. We previously reported that multiple tissue stem/progenitor cells can be efficiently enriched from regeneration buds using the side population (SP) method. Here, we performed trajectory inference using single-cell RNA sequencing data of the SP fraction to construct differentiation trajectories and identify putative tissue stem cell populations that initiate differentiation pathways. We found that complement c1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 3 ( c1qtnf3 ) is specifically expressed in putative muscle stem cells (MSC) and, using knockdown (KD; CRISPR/Cas9-based F0 crispants) experiments, demonstrated that c1qtnf3 is necessary for tail regeneration. Furthermore, we found that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD was accompanied by abrogation of macrophage-like cell accumulation at the amputation site. These phenotypes were rescued by macrophage-like cell-specific forced expression of neutrophil cytosolic factor 1 , a gene related to effector molecule production in myeloid cells, suggesting that the impaired tail regeneration by c1qtnf3 KD is due to macrophage dysregulation. Our findings suggest that, in Xenopus , putative MSC modulate macrophage function via c1qtnf3 expression for successful tail regeneration.",

We performed deep RNA-seq to map the lncRNA expression landscape of CD8 + T cell subsets during infection and generated lncRNA knockout mouse models to evaluate the in vivo relevance of six lncRNAs. We identified Rroid2 to regulate effector CD8 + T cell function and effector-to-memory differentiation. Rroid2 -deficient mice displayed increased CD44 dim Foxp3 + regulatory T cells while the development of other immune cells, such as natural killer cells, was not affected. In CD8 + T cells, Rroid2 deficiency resulted in a fine-tuned downregulation of transcription factors Id2 and T-bet and impaired KLRG1 + and KLRG1 − effector CD8 + T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity as well as effector-to-memory CD8 + T cell differentiation. The human orthologue of Rroid2 , LINC01814 , is also upstream of the transcriptional regulator ID2 and is highly expressed in human memory CD8 + T cells. Taken together, Rroid2 represents a key regulatory layer that controls CD8 + T cell differentiation.",

          "abstract": "Metabolically versatile Pseudomonas species can assimilate various glycolytic and gluconeogenic substrates. Simultaneous assimilation is known to segregate carbons from each substrate type into different metabolic pathways. However, the mechanisms of this metabolic segregation remain unresolved. Here, we investigate Pseudomonas putida KT2440 during processing of the sugar glucose through glycolysis versus the phenolic acid ferulate through gluconeogenesis. Metabolome profiling reveals up to twofold less tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites but up to 10-fold higher metabolites of upper glycolysis, pentose-phosphate, and Entner–Doudoroff pathways in glucose-grown cells compared to ferulate-grown cells. After 13 C-substrate switching, kinetic isotopic profiling captures rapid assimilation of new substrate carbons into initial catabolic pathways, but incorporation into downstream pathways is absent or incomplete. Proteomics identifies a 22-fold higher abundance of one homolog of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, GapA) in cells fed on glucose relative to ferulate, while abundance of another homolog (GapB) remains unchanged. Growth phenotypes and quantitative metabolomics for single and double knockout mutants of these GAPDH homologs indicate only GapA involvement in glycolytic flux, which can be compensated by the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, and distinct preference of GapB with minimal role of GapA for gluconeogenic flux. Accordingly, growth of triple knockout mutant with deletion of gapA , gapB , and edd is possible only when glycolytic and gluconeogenic substrates are provided together to meet metabolic demands in a segregated fashion, but metabolic tradeoffs lead to slow growth. A mathematical, experimentally constrained, model of the GAPDH node shows that tuning of GapA and GapB concentrations enables transition between flux regimes for nutritional adaptability.",

However, existing experimental techniques lack the capability to directly observe heterogeneous structural evolution and intercomponent interactions under controlled conditions that closely mimic realistic nonequilibrium thermal fronts. Consequently, theoretical models, which assume equilibrium conditions or neglect dynamic structural evolution, remain insufficiently validated and cannot accurately predict these critical transformation pathways. Here, we developed a gradiated fast-heating system (&gt;20 °C/s) enabling precise control of heating rate gradients within submillimeter transition regions in a single specimen, seamlessly integrated with sequential synchrotron X-ray tomography and radiography to directly visualize internal structural evolution. This approach allowed capture of diverse structural transformation pathways spanning microsecond-to-millisecond timescales under distinct nonequilibrium thermal conditions, revealing the complete sequence from initial pyrolysis through ignition to final burnout. We found that local heating rates, rather than bulk temperatures, dictate void formation dynamics and fragmentation pathways. In regions with high local heating rates, rapid void nucleation within the binder phase created reticulated porous networks, evolving four times faster than curved interfacial voids observed in adjacent regions experiencing lower heating rates. Furthermore, a cascade of heterogeneous component interactions subsequently fragmented the metallic network into isolated clusters, seeding critical ignition hotspots that governed combustion initiation and propagation mechanisms. These findings indicate that kinetic processes, influenced notably by heating rate, play an important role in mesostructural evolution under nonequilibrium conditions.",

          "abstract": "Our understanding of carbon and nutrient dynamics in globally vast and socioeconomically critical dryland ecosystems lags behind mesic systems. Litter decomposition models consistently underestimate measured decomposition in these regions. Both models and measurements largely represent spatially dominant intercanopy areas; however, little litter resides in these interspaces as transport vectors move litter to other microsites such as beneath plant canopies and buried in soil. Abiotic and biotic conditions differ among microsites, but few studies have characterized microsite impacts on decomposition. We collated data on microsites where litter accumulates. In microsites with sufficient available data, we used meta-analysis to test hypotheses on decomposition relative to litter in intercanopy spaces. Decomposition was lower under woody plant canopies than in intercanopy spaces. Buried litter decomposed faster than surface litter. There was no difference in decomposition between surface litter and litter suspended aboveground to simulate standing dead. All microsite contrasts had exceptions, suggesting that site-specific characteristics influence microclimate and subsequent decomposition. Extrapolation of decomposition rates to the landscape-level (using estimates of microsite-specific decomposition rates multiplied by litter pools), suggests that decomposition estimates based on intercanopy data alone underrepresent landscape-level decomposition. Thus, despite advances in the understanding of mechanistic decomposition drivers in drylands advancing, most studies are spatially unrepresentative analyses in intercanopy areas and this will underestimate decomposition at the landscape level. Expanding the ecological relevance of decomposition processes to be useful for predicting larger-scale carbon and nutrient dynamics requires improved characterization of dryland litter distribution, coupled with a mechanistic understanding of decomposition in microsites where litter accumulates.",

We report that beyond its function of degrading poly-ubiquitinylated proteins, the immunoproteasome (i-20S) is required for the proper function of ILC2s by controlling their mitochondrial capacity. We found that 90% of the catalytic β subunits of proteasomes in human ILC2s (hILC2s) are the immuno- (β5i) rather than constitutive (β5c) isoform. Specific, noncovalent, reversible inhibition of i-20S β5i (LMP7) in hILC2s induced ROS production, which inhibited aconitase, leading to altered mitochondrial function and reduced levels of ATP. Reprogramming of metabolic status by an LMP7 inhibitor impaired ILC2 activation, without significant cytotoxicity or preventing their recovery. Hence, the selective inhibition of i-20S in ILC2 cells did not kill them but reversibly depleted their ATP, preventing their activation and cytokine secretion. In mice, proteasome inhibition similarly blocked mitochondrial function and ILC2 activation, preventing airway inflammation in response to IL33 and asthma in response to house dust mites. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated linkage between proteasome blockade, central carbon metabolism, and mitochondrial function and identify a strategy to regulate immune cell metabolism in inflammatory diseases.",

Here, we apply state-of-the-art equivariant deep learning architectures to the task of assigning global labels to orbitals, namely energies characterizations, given the molecular coefficients from Hartree–Fock or density functional theory. The architecture we have developed, the Cartesian Equivariant Orbital Network ( CEONET ), shows how molecular orbital coefficients are readily featurized as equivariant node features common to all graph-based machine-learned potentials. We find that CEONET performs well at predicting difficult quantitative labels such as the orbital energy and orbital entropy. Furthermore, we find that the CEONET representation provides an intuitive latent space for differentiating orbital character for the qualitative assignment of e.g. bonding or antibonding character. In addition to providing a useful representation for further integrating deep learning with electronic structure theory, we expect CEONET to be useful for automatizing and interpreting the results of advanced electronic structure methods such as complete active space self-consistent field theory. In particular, the ability of CEONET to infer multireference character via the orbital entropy paves the way toward the machine-learned selection of active spaces.",

Oscillations that imprint the tropical mean state are generally attributed to slow processes, such as the seasonal cycle or interannual variability. Here, we identify a pronounced tropics-wide intraseasonal oscillation (TWISO) in satellite observations and reanalyses. This oscillation, with a period of 30 to 60 d, is evident across multiple variables and involves interactions between convection, radiation, surface fluxes, and large-scale circulation. It is primarily manifested as convective perturbations in the tropical Indo-Pacific warm pool accompanied by oscillations in the large-scale tropical overturning circulation. Here, we examine the relationship between TWISO, the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), and the instability of radiative-convective equilibrium. Certain phases of TWISO coincide with specific phases of the MJO, suggesting a potential connection between the two. However, although the MJO can amplify the oscillation amplitude of TWISO, it is not essential for TWISO to occur. Finally, due to its broad manifestation across the tropics, TWISO potentially exerts widespread influence on tropical weather and climate at regional scales.",

          "abstract": "The spatial organization of chromatin is governed by epigenetic factors, including epigenetic marks and the reader proteins that bind them. By dictating the accessibility of genomic loci, epigenetic factors contribute to the physical regulation of gene expression, enabling diverse cellular phenotypes to be encoded by a shared genome in an individual. Epigenetic dysregulation can lead to aberrations in chromatin architecture, contributing to diseases such as neurological disorders and cancers. Despite the known importance of chromatin organization for human health, the physical mechanisms governing chromatin folding remain underspecified. In this work, we develop a physical model of chromatin organization based on contributions from multiple epigenetic factors. Using our model, we evaluate how conditions in the nuclear environment and crosstalk between epigenetic marks affect the compartmentalization of chromatin into dense heterochromatin and loose euchromatin. Our results emphasize the role of reader protein binding in chromatin compartmentalization. We show that reader proteins interact through an indirect mechanism facilitated by the shared chromatin “scaffold” to which they bind. Under a scenario where reader proteins compete for binding sites, we find that indirect interactions affect the program adopted by the chromatin fiber. By isolating indirect modes of epigenetic crosstalk, we demonstrate how the interplay between epigenetic patterning and environmental factors influences chromatin architecture.",

In NDRG3-deficient cells, hypoxia- and lactate-induced inhibition of ER-to-Golgi trafficking is abolished.

However, how direct manipulation of brain circuits that govern social behaviors and social rewards impacts pain and negative emotional responses remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated whether direct activation of a newly identified noncanonical social reward circuit—specifically, the projections from the medial amygdala (MeA) to the medial preoptic area (MPOA)—can mitigate pain-related emotional and behavioral responses. Our findings demonstrated that both optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in the MeA significantly reduced freezing and anxiety-like behaviors after shock period as well as pain responses in the hotplate test in both male and female mice. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of the MeA-to-MPOA circuit produced similar behavioral outcomes.

In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to image dendritic calcium transients in deep layer pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex.

However, the mechanism by which OST1 regulates SLAC1 activation and its relationship with CPKs remain unclear. Here, we identify that OST1 primarily activates SLAC1 in this process through CPK15. Mutation of CPK15 significantly impairs ABA-induced stomatal closure and increases drought sensitivity. OST1 interacts with CPK15 and phosphorylates it at T103, which is essential for ABA-induced stomatal closure. Moreover, CPK15 can phosphorylate eight sites in the N terminus of SLAC1 to activate its anion currents in oocytes. Expression of SLAC1 8D (a phosphomimetic form) in oocytes constitutively activates anion channel activity and effectively restores the impaired ABA-induced stomatal closure of cpk15-1 but not by SLAC1 8A (a phospho-dead form). Furthermore, activated CPK15 by OST1 and Ca 2+ enhances its activity toward SLAC1, and mutations of both OST1 and CPK15 have additive effect on ABA-induced stomatal closure, suggesting that CPK15 activates SLAC1 through both direct and indirect mechanisms. These findings demonstrate the key role of CPK15 in ABA-induced stomatal closure, revealing a connection between OST1 and CPKs in both Ca 2+ -independent and Ca 2+ -dependent pathways in ABA-induced stomatal closure.",

Here, we dissect how integrin binding frequency and force-dependent bond duration jointly regulate this balance in fibroblasts. Using block copolymer micelle nanolithography, we create gold nanoparticle (Au NP) arrays with controlled spacings to vary integrin–ligand binding frequency. In parallel, tension gauge tethers (TGTs) with defined force threshold limit bond lifetime of high-force integrins under cellular traction. We find that intermediate ligand spacing coupled with a moderate rupture threshold dramatically accelerates fibroblast migration—up to twelvefold faster than on denser or sparser substrates. These conditions foster rapid FA turnover and support a dendritic actin architecture driven by lamellipodia, challenging the longstanding view of fibroblasts as inherently slow, mesenchymal movers. Knockout and blocking experiments further identify α5β1 as the mechanically dominant integrin subtype that plays a pivotal role in supporting this rapid migration. Mechanistically, FAs remain sufficiently stable to generate traction but also disassemble quickly, fostering continuous protrusion–retraction cycles essential for high-speed migration. These findings refine the classic biphasic model of cell migration into a two-dimensional framework that considers ligand spacing (binding frequency) and TGT force thresholds (binding duration). Beyond expanding fundamental understanding of integrin mechanobiology, our results provide broad avenues for tissue engineering and therapeutic applications, where finely tuned adhesion mechanics can markedly modulate cell speed and phenotype.",

This repair process is particularly important in cancer cells defective in homologous recombination. The exonuclease function of DNA polymerase delta (Pol δ) has been identified as an essential component for TMEJ, functioning to remove unpaired bases flanking a microhomology (MH). It is not known if the exonuclease removes all unpaired bases at once and how this removal might affect subsequent MH selection. Here, we reconstituted a functional TMEJ repair process using purified human Pol θ and Pol δ. We find that when Pol δ exonuclease excises a nucleotide to generate a new 3′ terminus, Pol θ initiates a new MH search. Pol δ exonuclease removes a single nucleotide at a time, rather than cleaving an unpaired flap, and then transfers the DNA tail to the polymerase site of Pol θ. Specific primer-grasp amino acids in the polymerase domain of Pol θ are important for internal MH anchoring. The helicase-like domain of Pol θ harbors two activities which are recapitulated in reconstituted reactions: strand-capture to bring single-strand tails together and an ATPase activity that alleviates suppression of TMEJ by ssDNA binding protein RPA. This functional reconstitution of TMEJ advances the understanding of how two polymerases with three enzymatic activities orchestrate double-strand break repair.",

          "abstract": "DNA replication requires precise coordination between DNA unwinding and DNA synthesis. In all domains of life, protein–protein interactions at the replisome maintain proximity between the enzymes that catalyze these two activities. Surprisingly, in bacteria, the replicative DNA polymerase (Pol III), responsible for DNA synthesis, is exchanged every few seconds. How processive synthesis is maintained under these conditions has remained unclear. Here, we use single-molecule microscopy in live cells to show that Pol III rapidly rebinds the replisome within seconds of dissociation. This fast recruitment is driven by an interaction with single-stranded DNA–binding protein (SSB), which enhances Pol III target search efficiency by ~20-fold. Disrupting this mechanism alters replisome stoichiometry, causes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation, depletes free SSB, and leads to helicase disassembly and DNA breakage, culminating in genome instability. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which fast polymerase recycling sustains continuous DNA replication and genome integrity.",

Excessive lipid droplet accumulation is observed in the brains of SPG54 patients and DDHD2 knockout mice, consistent with DDHD2’s reported neutral lipase activity. Here, we find recombinant human DDHD2 preferentially hydrolyzes diacylglycerol (DAG) over phospholipids, with a slight preference for DAG over triacylglycerol (TAG). DDHD2 also exhibits transacylase activity, which enables transfer of acyl chains from TAGs to DAGs and monoacylglycerols to remodel the acyl chains of TAGs. A predicted hydrophobic amphipathic helix on DDHD2 is essential for lipid droplet binding in vitro and in cells, and its lack reduces the enzymatic activity and TAG acyl chain remodeling. Adipose triglyceride lipase, but not hormone sensitive lipase, also has transacylation activity and can remodel TAG acyl chains, but to a lesser extent than DDHD2. Taken together, this provides evidence that DDHD2 is a neutral lipid lipase and transacylase whose broad specificity enables TAG acyl-chain remodeling.",

Their role in the cell has not been elucidated. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with antibody staining we previously observed VR sequestered in punctate bodies and liquid droplets in the cytoplasm and nuclei of nonmitotic cells. Here, we report that cells in mitosis show diffuse VR staining throughout the cell, giving these cells a bright appearance. Upon mitotic enrichment using the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) inhibitor RO-3306. RO-3306, 100% of the mitotic cells showed the same diffuse staining. Antibody staining showed colocalization of VR and the L4 ribosomal protein in mitotic cells and in an in vitro firefly luciferase assay, VR depressed translation. Affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry identified ribosomal proteins as the major class of VR interacting proteins in U2OS cells including L4 along with tubulin and proteins related to neural degenerative diseases. This change from a sequestered, punctate state in interphase to dispersed diffuse staining in mitosis, and the affinity of VR for the L4 protein which lines the ribosomal exit tunnel suggests that an oligomerization change of VR may facilitate its involvement in inhibiting of global translation during mitosis. Extension to mouse embryonic cerebral cortical development showed clear staining in the ventricular zone where neural progenitor cells with a high mitotic index proliferate and in the cortical plate where new neurons settle.",

Despite extensive behavioral evidence for the existence of the reference point, its neural instantiation remains unclear. To identify reference point encoding at both the single-neuron and population levels, we analyzed neural activity from macaques performing a wealth accumulation task that dissociated objective reward values from the reference point. Across six frontal regions, we found that reference-related signals were broadly distributed at the single-neuron level. However, at the population level, only the ventral bank of the anterior cingulate cortex (vbACC) encoded the reference point significantly. In contrast, the dorsal bank of ACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed population-level encoding of reference-dependent subjective value signals. The temporal sequence of these signals and their known anatomical connectivity hints at a dedicated neural circuit for reference dependence, with the vbACC potentially serving as a global source of reference point signal modulating activity in downstream value-encoding regions.",

Two concentric cylinders of actively dividing stem cells are the main drivers of radial thickening during secondary growth, each producing distinct vascular cell types toward the inside and the outside. While the molecular mechanisms underlying their initiation have been well studied, it remains unclear how these stem cell layers determine which cell type is generated. Here, we demonstrate that the cross-talk between the ERECTA (ER) receptor pathway and auxin signaling controls the amount and choice of output tissue in these two stem cell regions. Mechanistically, we show that the ER pathway phosphorylates the transcription factor AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), thereby modulating bilateral stem cell activity and favoring the differentiation of only one type of cell. Our results thus show that the phosphorylation status of ANT regulates root girth and biomass accumulation by influencing bilateral stem cell production.

While animal models have elucidated key conserved signaling pathways involved in early TE specification, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), WNT, and HIPPO, species-specific differences during early development emphasize the need for human-specific models. We previously identified VGLL1, a coactivator of TEAD transcription factors, as a human-specific placental marker. In this study, we employed a pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based model of TE induction by BMP4 to investigate chromatin remodeling and transcriptional dynamics during TE formation. BMP4-induced chromatin accessibility changes promoted a trophoblast gene expression program, while mesoderm lineage markers were only transiently expressed upon canonical WNT activation. We found that VGLL1 was expressed downstream of key TE transcription factors (GATA2/3, TFAP2A/C) but was essential for establishment of full trophoblast identity by up-regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and reinforcing GATA3 expression through positive feedback. Notably, VGLL1 enhanced canonical WNT signaling via direct regulation of WNT receptors and effectors. We also identified KDM6B, a histone demethylase that removes H3K27me3 repressive marks, as a direct VGLL1 target. KDM6B facilitated activation of bivalent promoters associated with TE markers, linking epigenetic regulation to lineage identity. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework positioning VGLL1 as a central regulator that integrates HIPPO, BMP, and WNT signaling pathways to drive establishment of human TE.",

While effects of such short-term plasticity on neural information processing have long been studied, it is unclear how interactions between short-term and long-term plasticity affect the learning abilities of neural networks. Here, we show that long-term changes to the short-term plasticity of individual synaptic connections enable neurons to learn to process temporal sequences of spikes as if they were spatial patterns. This mechanism allows neural circuits to flexibly increase their capacity and robustness at the expense of elevated spiking activity. We further show that neurons with plastic short-term plasticity can learn to discriminate between inputs on the basis of multineuronal spike correlations that extend over space and time. Our model fits recent electrophysiological measurements of short-term plasticity in the mouse and human neocortex and is consistent with the distributions of short-term plasticity induction and recovery. Our theory predicts that the learning rule observed at a given synaptic connection depends on the degree and type of short-term plasticity which is induced by the induction protocol for long-term plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Dogs evolved through interactions between people and gray wolves during the Late Pleistocene and have been ubiquitous in human societies ever since. Instances of wolf-to-dog introgression are rare, but adaptive introgression has been shown in association with high-altitude survival. Any widespread gene flow, however, has fallen below thresholds of detection in genome-wide statistical assessments. To reexamine evidence of dog–wolf gene flow, we analyzed 2,693 published dog and wolf genomes and combined highly sensitive local ancestry inference and phylogenomic analyses of nuclear genes, mitochondrial genomes, and Y-chromosome sequences. Although dogs and wolves segregate decisively at the nuclear level, no individual nuclear gene tree supports dog monophyly. Uniparental markers show mixed and interleaved dog and wolf clades with strong support and incongruent phylogenetic topologies. Using local ancestry inference, we find that 64.1% of modern breed dogs carry wolf ancestry from admixture that occurred nearly a thousand generations ago on average and now covers ~0.14% of their individual nuclear genomes. Among modern free-living village dogs (n = 280), 100% of analyzed genomes carry wolf ancestry. We find that wolf ancestry in dog breeds correlates with functional traits including size, breed category, and personality characteristics. In village dogs, wolf ancestry is enriched at olfactory receptor genes, suggesting adaptive introgression for sensory acuity that may have helped these free-living dogs survive in more challenging environments. In total, dog–wolf admixture has likely been an important factor in shaping the evolution of modern dogs.",

          "abstract": "Given the large amplitude of prograde annual polar motion, we are able to quantify year-to-year variability of prograde annual excitation amplitude since pre-1900 observations. We obtain a Prograde Annual Amplitude Modulation (PAAM) time series and use it to investigate several key topics, including variability in annual excitation amplitude, its climatic sources, and its potential role in Chandler wobble (CW) excitation. An important finding is that the PAAM series undergoes multiyear episodes of a near six-year oscillation (SYO). This provides observational evidence for a SYO in Earth’s climate and rotational dynamics seen in recent data and confirms SYO behavior in the climate system over the past century. Using climate model and other data, we find that several fluid components of Earth’s climate system contribute to the SYO, with atmospheric sources playing the dominant role. A SYO [~0.16 cycles per year (cpy)] modulation of the annual component introduces variations at the sum and difference frequencies (1 + 0.16 cpy and 1 − 0.16 cpy). Because the difference frequency 0.84 cpy is near the Chandler frequency, the SYO may be important in understanding CW excitation. Our results show the SYO contributes significantly to the excitation of CW. Year-to-year variability of the annual excitation was originally proposed as an excitation mechanism by Harold Jeffreys in 1940, and we confirm that more than half the CW excitation power can be attributed to this cause. We also found annual excitation modulation at a period near 17 mo (~0.7 cpy) that is a source of excitation power near 1 ± 0.7 cpy.",

Understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending neural circuits’ structure and function. The ability to reconstruct neural circuits, and even entire nervous systems, at the neuron and synapse level, facilitates the study of the design principles of neural systems and their developmental plan. Here, we investigate the developing connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Our model’s predictions of the synaptic connections and their strength, using multiple reconstructions of adult worms, reflect that it identified much of the shared part of the connectivity graph. Thus, the accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.",

          "abstract": "The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) 1 receptor (PAC1R) is a class B1 G protein–coupled receptor activated by the endogenous peptide agonists PACAP and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Alternate splicing within the receptor extracellular domain (ECD) generates the PAC1R short variant (PAC1sR) that has selectively enhanced VIP function compared to the full-length, PAC1R null variant (PAC1nR). However, to date, a comprehensive pharmacological assessment of the downstream signaling outcomes of PAC1sR activation compared to PAC1nR has not been performed, and little information is available to mechanistically understand how ECD splicing may alter ligand engagement. Here, we demonstrated that VIP, but not PACAP, has globally enhanced activity across a broad range of functional endpoints at PAC1sR compared to PAC1nR. Cryo-EM structures of VIP-bound, stimulatory G protein (G s )-coupled PAC1sR and PAC1nR, supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrate transient engagement of the null loop in PAC1nR, which is absent in PAC1sR, with residues in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) and the N-terminal helix of the ECD. These interactions result in differential engagement of VIP with these domains and the top of TM2/ECL1 with PAC1sR and PAC1nR. Moreover, MD simulations predicted differential interactions of the G s protein with the two PAC1R variants when bound by VIP that correlate with a greater allosteric influence of the G s protein on VIP affinity at the PAC1sR, relative to PAC1nR. Our study provides insights into the structural basis and functional consequences of PAC1R ECD splicing, increasing understanding of PAC1R ligand selectivity and signaling.",

Herein, we report a pronounced in-plane plastic anisotropy in single-crystalline Mg 3 Bi 2 .

Here, we identify DEAF1, a FOXO-regulated transcription factor, as a key upstream driver of mTORC1 in aged muscle. Elevated Deaf1 expression increases mTOR transcription, leading to heightened mTORC1 activity, impaired proteostasis, and muscle senescence. Remarkably, exercise suppresses Deaf1 expression via FOXO activation, restoring mTORC1 balance and alleviating muscle aging. Conversely, FOXO inhibition or Deaf1 overexpression blocks exercise benefits on muscle health.

To evaluate the reliability of such tests, we analyzed data from Darwin’s Ark, a community science initiative that includes over 3,000 dogs with both genetic data and individual-level behavioral phenotypes. None of the candidate variants had significant associations or predictive power for behavioral traits as previously reported. However, we found strong associations with aesthetic traits that differentiate breeds, such as height, leg length, and ear shape. Our results suggest that earlier studies using breed-average phenotypes, rather than individually measured phenotypes, were confounded by population structure. Behavior in dogs is polygenic and complex, and thus cannot be accurately predicted using tests that consider only a few genetic variants. Furthermore, behavior in dogs is only moderately heritable, and environmental influences inherently limit the potential accuracy of genomic predictions. Developing meaningful, accurate genetic predictions for complex traits that can improve dog health and welfare will require very large cohorts of individually phenotyped dogs.",

          "abstract": "Actin networks in cells are dynamic and constantly turning over as actin subunits exchange between monomer and polymer pools. Understanding these dynamics in vivo requires a detailed understanding of pure actin behavior in vitro. The prevailing model is treadmilling, which predicts continuous growth of filament barbed ends balanced by continuous shrinkage of pointed ends, while filament length remains roughly constant. While treadmilling has been observed directly at the level of single filaments, length fluctuations—expressed as “length diffusivity”—are much greater than expected, and the origin of these high diffusivity values could not be identified experimentally. By imaging single filaments tethered to glass via α-actinin, we observed frequent, low-amplitude barbed-end fluctuations of ±2–6 subunits per event and rarer, high-amplitude fluctuations of ±50–150 subunits per event. Barbed-end fluctuations depended on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and were blocked by phalloidin and barbed-end capping agents. Barbed-end fluctuations consumed an estimated one-third of the ATP at steady state, while two-thirds is still consumed by treadmilling. Fluctuations result in diffusive spreading of filament lengths that exceeds predictions from pure treadmilling yet is lower than previously reported values, suggesting that earlier measurements captured additional sources of variability. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for kinetic models that proposed a dampened form of dynamic instability in pure actin where transient loss of the ATP/ADP•Pi barbed-end cap leads to rare, large excursions superimposed on more frequent, small fluctuations.",

We show that restraining flexibility in the two central β-strands of EF-G domain III prevents the FusB-induced increase in this minor state population, preventing FusB-mediated release of EF-G from the ribosome and thereby reinstating FA-induced stalling of protein synthesis. We further identify a region controlling access to the minor state population, potentially pinpointing the allosteric mechanism within domain III by which FusB acts. Our findings suggest a possible region that could be targeted for rational design of an inhibitor of FusB-mediated conformational flexibility, reinstating FA sensitivity even in the presence of FusB, which could rejuvenate the efficacy of this clinically important antibiotic.",

          "abstract": "CO 2 fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere is limited by nitrogen. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is the dominant natural nitrogen source to the terrestrial biosphere and can alleviate nitrogen limitation but is poorly constrained in Earth system models (ESMs). Here, we compare terrestrial BNF from an ensemble of ESMs of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to a new global synthesis of observations across natural and agricultural biomes. We find that compared to observations, ESMs underestimate agricultural BNF but overestimate natural BNF in the present day by over 50%. Natural BNF is overestimated in the most productive ecosystems that contribute most to the terrestrial carbon sink (forests and grasslands). ESMs with different BNF representations yield a range of BNF responses to CO 2 enrichment. Some ESMs with phenomenological representations of BNF predict a natural BNF increase in response to a doubling of CO 2 that aligns with a meta-analysis of CO 2 enrichment experiments (31% increase) but fail to account for the substantial carbon cost of BNF. In contrast, ESMs with mechanistic representations of BNF account for its carbon cost as well as its regulation by nitrogen limitation but overestimate the BNF response to a doubling of CO 2 (135% increase). Overall, all current BNF representations in ESMs fall short of fully capturing its response to rising atmospheric CO 2 . Finally, we find a positive correlation between modeled present-day natural BNF and the CO 2 fertilization effect across ESMs, suggesting that overestimated natural BNF translates to an exaggerated CO 2 fertilization effect of approximately 11% in ESMs.",

          "abstract": "Large, continental-scale drainage systems occupy nearly half of Earth’s land, shaping diverse ecosystems, with their activity primarily driven by climate and tectonism. Here, we investigate whether Mars, which lacks Earth’s tectonism, has similarly large drainage systems that could have impacted the extent of habitable environments, sediment transport, and the formation of large sedimentary basins. We reconstruct large drainage systems using globally mapped ancient martian water-formed topography—valley networks, outlet canyons, and fluvial depositional systems—revealing large drainage systems (&gt;10 5 km 2 ) similar in scale to those on Earth. However, collectively these systems cover only ~5% of ancient martian terrain (&gt;3.7 Ga), approximately nine times less than their counterparts on Earth. This estimate is conservative due to erosion, burial, and impact cratering, which have likely modified their preservation. Nevertheless, when quantifying the eroded sediment volumes from these large drainage systems, we show that they contributed nearly half (42%) of Mars’ ancient river-sediment budget. We further calculated the sediment eroded from large drainage systems surrounding the largest known fluvial depositional landforms on Mars and found that they potentially contributed ~21% of the planet’s river sediment budget, which we hypothesize facilitated the buildup of these sedimentary features. Our results indicate that although a substantial portion of Mars’ fluvial sediment was routed through large-scale drainage systems, sediment transport was predominantly accomplished within smaller-scale local basins. This drainage structure likely created a mosaic of habitable environments across the surface and facilitated significant sediment accumulation in a limited number of large sedimentary basins.",

In the densely forested regions north of the Alps, material culture was characterized by the use of wood as a primary raw material. Yet, the drivers behind the Roman timber economy and its impact on woodland exploitation and forest dynamics remain poorly understood. To address this, we investigated a unique collection of 20.397 dendrochronologically dated archaeological woods spanning a millennium of European Antiquity (300 BCE–700 CE). Our results reveal significant increases in exploitation during Roman occupation, with regional differences in onset, intensity, and duration. Due to rising civilian and military demand for wood, Roman logging increasingly extended into primary forests far from settlements, which indicates a significantly improved infrastructure, professionalism, and organization of lumbering. The 3rd century CE marks a tipping point, with sharp declines in wood use and long-distance transport, alongside evidence of overexploitation of old-grown forests (trees aged over 200 y). Late Antiquity is characterized by an overall decline in felling activities during the 4th and 5th centuries and a reestablishment of old-grown forests, manifested by increased tree ages thereafter. These findings demonstrate how Roman imperial expansion fundamentally reshaped woodlands north of the Alps and contribute to the environmental and economic history of European Antiquity.",

However, a microscopic description of the photoproducts originating from ultraviolet (UV) absorption and emission processes has remained elusive. Here, we explore the photochemistry of ice using time-dependent hybrid density functional theory on various models of pristine and defective ice Ih. Our investigation of the excited state potential energy surface of the crystal shows that UV absorption can lead to the formation of hydronium ions, hydroxyl radicals, and excess electrons. One of the dominant mechanisms of decay from the excited to the ground-state involves the recombination of the electron with the hydroxyl radical yielding hydronium-hydroxide ion-pairs. We find that the details of this charge recombination process sensitively depend on the presence of defects in the lattice, such as vacancies and preexisting photoproducts. We also observe the formation of Bjerrum defects following UV absorption; we suggest that, together with hydroxide anions, they are likely responsible for prominent features experimentally detected in long UV exposure absorption spectra, remarkably red-shifted relative to short exposure spectra. Our results highlight the key role of defects in determining the onset of absorption and emission processes in ice.",

As the majority of animals, species with complex life histories may have distinct traits and ecological functions at different stages. Using all 557 Chinese anurans, we tested whether adult-based conservation protects entire taxa by analyzing functional trait diversity across life stages. We compiled adult and tadpole traits, mapped spatial diversity patterns, identified hotspots, recognized conservation priority species based on traits at different stages, and tested whether integrating information from different life history stages can effectively conserve functional diversity. Results showed functional diversity hotspots of adults and tadpoles are different. Species’ functional uniqueness between stages were not correlated, with only 18.8% species overlapped in conservation priority lists. Meanwhile, conservation strategies prioritizing species based on adult traits failed to protect tadpole functional diversity. The extent of functional diversity covered by these species was similar to that of randomly chosen species. These findings reject the hypothesis that conservation strategies made based on information of adults can adequately protect whole taxa. Nevertheless, when information from both stages is integrated, the conservation effectiveness has significantly improved. Thus, comprehensive biodiversity protection requires integrated assessments of all stages.",

          "abstract": "The browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) enhances thermogenesis and holds great potential in obesity treatment. Membrane receptors have been proven as essential factors during WAT browning. In this study, we found that transmembrane receptor neuroplastin-55 (Np55) was markedly upregulated in the adipose tissue of both obese individuals and mice. Fat-specific Np55 knockout (Np55 FKO ) sensitized mice to high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders, which was attributed to impaired energy expenditure and WAT browning. We identified that mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (Manf) acts as a ligand for Np55 with high binding affinity. Mechanistically, Np55 forms a complex with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor-2 (TRAF2) and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) to activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and conduct WAT browning after Manf stimulation. Additionally, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2470738600) in Manf compromised the binding affinity to Np55 and thermogenic capacity. Finally, we showed that Np55 is indispensable for Manf-induced thermogenesis and weight loss in obese mice. Our results underscore the pivotal role of Np55 as a receptor of Manf in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and related disorders.",

The small magnitude of these interactions underlies the rapid reversibility of HOTS on the timescale of membrane signaling processes, permitting the dynamic modulation of signals. At the same time, weak interactions present an apparent paradox: HOTS should form only if the concentration of a particular protein is sufficiently high to produce oligomerization by mass action. And yet, HOTS are observed experimentally with membrane proteins present in cell membranes at concentrations of only a few per μ m 2 . In this study, we employ principles of statistical thermodynamics to explain how cells can alter the configurational entropy of the oligomerization reaction, thereby achieving HOTS formation at low concentrations of the protein in the membrane. We propose that this modification of the configurational entropy, a process we call configurational length scaling, is an important aspect of HOTS formation in cell membranes and possibly other cellular compartments.",

While the lung is a top metastatic site in breast cancer, the origins of lung metastasis-associated fibroblasts and their influence on disseminating tumor cell outgrowth and chemoresistance are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional cocultures of primary human lung fibroblasts (LF) and breast cancer cells (BCC) as models of tumor–stromal interactions in lung metastatic breast cancer. Using these models, we find that BCC lines representing clinically relevant molecular subtypes differentially induce CAF-like phenotypes in primary LFs corresponding with their propensity for lung metastasis. Furthermore, we identify a mechanism by which juxtacrine signaling from LFs to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells promotes expansion of prognostic dormant-like cell subpopulations and instigates autophagy-dependent therapy resistance via integrin and Janus kinase1/2 signaling. A high content kinase inhibitor compound library screen using this model identifies vacuolar protein sorting 34 as a therapeutic vulnerability unique to BCC-LF interaction whose inhibition can resensitize TNBC cells to chemotherapy and relieve LF-mediated extrinsic therapy resistance. Therefore, we propose coculture of primary human LFs and BCC as a reductionist model of interactions between tumor cells and lung-resident stroma and a tool for therapeutic and mechanistic discovery in lung metastatic breast cancer.",

Here, we elucidate the structural basis and evolutionary emergence of Lamassu, a bacterial immune system family featuring diverse effectors but a core conserved SMC-like sensor. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of the Vibrio cholerae Lamassu complex in both apo- and dsDNA-bound states, revealing unexpected stoichiometry and topological architectures. We further demonstrate how Lamassu specifically senses dsDNA ends in vitro and phage replication origins in vivo, thereby triggering the formation of LmuA tetramers that activate its Cap4 nuclease domain. Our findings reveal that Lamassu evolved via exaptation of the bacterial Rad50-Mre11 DNA repair system to form a compact, modular sensor for viral replication, exemplifying how cellular machinery can be co-opted for novel immune functions.",

          "abstract": "Aerosol–cloud interactions remain one of the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic forcing of the climate; a significant contribution to this is due to the aerosol effect on the development of cloud fraction and liquid water path in stratocumulus clouds. Stratocumulus are strongly modulated by the diurnal cycle, but many previous observational studies have primarily focused on the daytime behavior of these clouds. In this work, a Lagrangian framework is used to characterize the day-night variation in the cloud sensitivity to aerosol. It is shown that the cloud fraction response to aerosol is driven by nighttime processes, whereas aerosols play a lesser role in daytime cloud fraction breakup. The liquid water path response reveals that aerosols act to thin the cloud during the daytime; however, this effect is partially offset by other processes during the nighttime. These nighttime cloud processes play an important role in setting the cloud state at the start of the day and hence the daytime cloud evolution, during which stratocumulus clouds have the greatest radiative impact. Our findings are consistent with an aerosol induced suppression of precipitation that acts most effectively at night, when stratocumulus precipitation is strongest. These results highlight a requirement for nighttime observations of marine clouds and an improved representation of the diurnal cycle in model-observation comparisons, especially when assessing climate forcing and the viability of marine cloud brightening.",

However, limited costimulatory signaling essential for sustained T cell effector activity may limit CD3 TCE clinical efficacy and response duration. The CD2 receptor is an attractive costimulation target owing to its association with T cell receptor signaling and favorable expression profile. We show that CD2 costimulation is superior in maintaining T cell viability and effector function relative to other pathways in in vitro chronic stimulation assays. The extracellular domain of CD58, the predominant CD2 ligand, is functional as an antibody fusion, improving bispecific potency. We observe that higher CD3 affinity molecules have the potential for superagonism in the context of an integrated CD2 agonist. Evaluation of TCEs with integrated CD2 costimulation and attenuated CD3 binding identified optimal CD3 affinity agonists that avoid target-independent T cell activation and demonstrated an increased therapeutic index relative to nonattenuated CD3 agonists. This platform shows increased tumor-killing efficacy as compared to CD3 affinity-matched bispecifics for known tumor targets such as HER2, CD20, B7-H4, and UL16-binding protein 2 (ULBP2). We demonstrate that ULBP2-targeted trispecifics with integrated CD2 costimulation and optimized CD3 affinity are superior to higher-affinity CD3 molecules in in vivo mouse efficacy studies. This integrated CD2 costimulation platform, which we termed EVOLVE, represents a next-generation TCE platform to increase T cell effector function in the tumor microenvironment and has the potential to address unmet patient needs by improving the depth and durability of clinical antitumor T cell responses.",

We previously identified the BAH–PHD–CPL2 complex, where AIPP3 binds H3K27me3 via its BAH domain and, in concert with PHD2 and PHD3 (PHD2/3), recruits CPL2 to repress transcription by dephosphorylating RNA Polymerase II. Here, we show that CPL2 and PHD2/3 form a distinct module (CPL2–PHD2/3) that safeguards CHH DNA methylation and silences CHH-methylated sites at transposable elements (TEs) through engagement of multiple DNA methylation pathways. The CPL2–PHD2/3 module physically associates with SUVH4 and SUVH5 (SUVH4/5) to preserve SUVH4/5–CMT2-mediated CHH methylation at a subset of H3K9me2-marked regions. Chromatin enrichment of PHD3 likewise enables the module to sustain RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated CHH DNA methylation at sites bearing H3K9me2, H3K27me3, or neither. Thus, CPL2–PHD2/3 emerges as a previously underappreciated, multifunctional regulator of plant DNA methylation networks. Unexpectedly, its gene repression function is uncoupled from DNA methylation. CPL2–PHD2/3 represses Polycomb-marked genes by interacting with LHP1 or recognizing hypomethylated H3K4. While it cooperates with LHP1 at a subset of targets, it also independently silences many more genes that LHP1 alone cannot repress, both sets of genes being critical for proper development. This dual, yet largely LHP1-insufficient, repression mode singles out CPL2–PHD2/3 as the essential executor of Polycomb silencing. Together, our findings establish CPL2–PHD2/3 as a chromatin-responsive integrator that spans DNA methylation and Polycomb-associated repression, providing a unifying mechanism for epigenetic control of both TEs and genes across diverse chromatin landscapes.",

          "abstract": "Multipotent progenitors (MPP) are the quantitative source of native hematopoiesis that have been thought to be replenished slowly by hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). However, recent fate mapping studies have revealed two developmentally distinct populations of MPP, HSC-derived MPP (hMPP), and HSC-independent, embryonic MPP (eMPP). These data raise fundamental questions on the distinctions and functions of these progenitors. Here, we mapped the clonal dynamics of the two independent MPP systems, using in situ barcoding, and barcode linkage (hMPP), or disconnect (eMPP), with HSC. The cumulative output of eMPP to hematopoiesis was 35%, and their output was enriched for lymphoid fates. Conversely, hMPP output was enriched for myeloid-restricted fates. Distinguishing HSC from eMPP outputs revealed that only ~15% of adult HSC clones underwent multilineage differentiation (lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid). To prospectively identify eMPP, we developed PolySMART for joint profiling of PolyloxExpress RNA barcodes, surface markers, and transcriptomes, and we found that the plasma cell marker CD138 enriches for eMPP. CD138 + MPP are primed for self-renewal and toward lymphoid fate, and become largely but not completely replaced by CD138 − MPP over time, which may contribute to the loss of lymphoid output with age. Taken together, adult hematopoiesis consists of two distinct lineage trees. The source of the “eMPP tree” substantially contributes to hematopoiesis before it declines, while the HSC-hMPP tree supplies hematopoiesis life-long. Our molecular determinants distinguishing the two MPP systems may open avenues to further explore these unexpected layers of hematopoiesis.",

In this work, we propose that magnons with intrinsic OAM can be induced by antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions with multiple topological charges ( Q ). The proposal is demonstrated in a tetragonal lattice frustrated AFM film, where magnetic anisotropy governs the formation of multiple- Q skyrmions. Out-of-plane polarized current induces ultrafast skyrmion helicity oscillation, which enables excitation of multipolar spin waves, with OAM quantum number identical to Q . The Q , and thus OAM, can be modulated by tuning magnetic anisotropy and temperature. In addition, we reveal an unexpected AFM skyrmion Hall effect driven by in-plane polarized current, and a nonlinear correction term in skyrmion dynamics induced by spin–orbit torque fluctuation. Our results reveal unique behaviors of AFM multiple- Q skyrmions and could extend their applications in information encoding and transmission.",

          "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, with over 50% presenting with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Although chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has shown promise in targeting PC, its clinical efficacy remains limited due to several critical challenges. These include tumor antigen heterogeneity, antigen loss or escape mechanisms, functional exhaustion of CAR-T cells within the tumor microenvironment, as well as inherent limitations of autologous approaches such as high manufacturing costs, prolonged production timelines, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we developed allogeneic IL-15–enhanced, mesothelin-specific CAR-engineered invariant natural killer T ( Allo15 MCAR-NKT) cells through gene engineering of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using a clinically guided culture method. These Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells exhibited robust and multifaceted antitumor activity against PC, driven by both CAR and NK receptor–mediated cytotoxic mechanisms. In orthotopic and metastatic human PC xenograft models, Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells demonstrated superior tumor control, enhanced trafficking and infiltration into tumor sites, sustained effector and cytotoxic phenotypes, and reduced expression of exhaustion markers. Importantly, Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells demonstrated a favorable safety profile, characterized by the absence of graft-versus-host disease and minimal cytokine release syndrome. Collectively, these findings validate Allo15 MCAR-NKT cells as a promising next-generation, off-the-shelf immunotherapeutic approach for PC, with the potential to overcome critical challenges including tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance, especially in the context of metastatic disease.",

          "abstract": "Cilia are essential cellular antennae that rely on precise motor-driven transport to assemble and function. Two kinesin-2 motors—kinesin-II and OSM-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans —cooperate to transport cargo along cilia, with kinesin-II operating in the middle segment and OSM-3 taking over distally. However, how kinesin-II is spatially confined to prevent its invasion into distal regions remains unclear. Here, we identify Joubert syndrome 26 protein (JBTS-26) as a critical regulator of this motor handover. JBTS-26 localizes to axonemal doublet microtubules in the ciliary middle segment, where it competes with kinesin-II for binding to the IFT-B subunit OSM-5/IFT88. This competition displaces kinesin-II from IFT particles, enabling OSM-3 to assume distal transport. Loss of JBTS-26 allows kinesin-II to invade the distal cilium and slows down IFT. Conversely, JBTS-26 overexpression accelerates IFT by prematurely releasing kinesin-II. Our findings reveal a mechanism for compartmentalized motor regulation and link defective motor handover to ciliopathy pathogenesis.",

          "abstract": "Many contemporary breed dogs display reduced genomic health compared to mixed-breed dogs, including reduced heterozygosity and increased genetic load, likely due to strong directed breeding. Lack of historical genomes, however, has made it difficult to disentangle the timing and drivers of these declines given complex and breed-specific demographic histories, artificial selection, and crossbreeding. Here, we sequenced genomes of nine 20th-century museum specimens (1906–1993) of pedigree German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) to directly assess the consequences of contemporary breeding practices on genomic diversity and health over time. The GSD breed offers an excellent case study, given the breed’s fluctuations in global popularity, differing selective regimes, and the GSD’s use in the establishment of other breeds, including wolfdogs. Genome-wide heterozygosity showed significant reductions after the Second World War (WWII), coincident with an increase in both the frequency of runs of homozygosity and load. We also detected repeated population bottlenecks linked to the use of popular sires throughout the 20th century. Finally, although hybridization with wolves has led to genome-wide increases in heterozygosity in wolfdog breeds derived from the GSD, nonadmixed ancestry blocks (dog or wolf) were severely depleted in diversity due to the limited number of founders involved in their establishment. Combined, our results indicate that declines in the genomic health of GSDs and related breeds occurred not at the onset of breed formation but throughout the last century, as a result of population bottlenecks associated with WWII and the repeated use of popular sires.",

          "abstract": "Cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) enables three-dimensional visualization of molecular structures within tissue and intact cells, providing a powerful tool for studying the spatial organization of biological components at nanometer resolution. Realizing this potential, particularly for submegadalton complexes, is facilitated by fiducial-based labeling. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as powerful electron-dense labels for cryo-ET, but multiplexing using only conventional monomeric AuNPs is challenging, limiting their application in multitarget studies. Here, we describe functionalized dimeric AuNPs with a precisely defined size range applied to bioimaging, enabling multiplexed labeling by allowing reliable discrimination between monomeric and dimeric AuNPs, thereby supporting identification of distinct molecular targets within the same cryotomogram. Each dimer consists of two covalently linked gold particles of approximately 2.6 nm diameter separated by a defined spacing of about 1.4 nm, with high structural homogeneity validated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and electron microscopy. The anti-GluN1 Fab, which targets the N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was site specifically conjugated to a dimeric AuNP. A deep learning classifier enabled reliable discrimination between monomeric and dimeric AuNPs in tomograms. We confirmed that the dimeric AuNP–Fab conjugates bind robustly to recombinant GluN1/GluN2A receptors, validating their use for structural labeling. In situ cryo-ET of brain tissue further confirms that the dimeric labels reach NMDARs within the glutamatergic synaptic cleft. Combined with monomeric AuNPs, this dimeric AuNP platform establishes a generalizable approach for distinguishable labels optimized for cryo-ET. The compact size and structural uniformity of monomeric and dimeric AuNPs make them ideally suited for nanoscale molecular mapping in crowded cellular environments.",

However, how to effectively use such extensive information to improve the mapping and prediction of complex traits, including those that respond to climate change, remains unresolved. Here, we apply a Bayesian framework to estimate a Functional-And-Evolutionary Multi-trait Importance (FAEMI) score that combines extensive functional annotations to predict the probability that a variable genomic site causes variation in 16 complex traits of 103 K cattle. The functional annotations include information from the transcriptome, epigenome, and metabolome of cattle as well as genome constraints across species from multiple genome annotation consortia, covering 2.13 million molecular phenotypes from 24 tissues/cell types of 8,446 cattle worldwide. FAEMI analyses quantify the phenotypic importance of functional assays to guide future annotation efforts and reveal significant correlations between molecular functionality and genotype-to-phenotype associations. In new data of 45 K cattle with heat tolerance phenotypes, the FAEMI score demonstrates significant advantages in improving genomic prediction and mapping. The FAEMI score improved genomic prediction accuracy of multiple heat tolerance phenotypes by ~11%. A cellular stress-related locus, stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein family member 2 ( SERP2 ), was identified as underlying heat tolerance, with the lead variant (rs383130643) associated with enhancer activity. Additionally, high FAEMI-ranking variants are significantly enriched in variants affecting beef cattle traits. Together, our work provides methods and resources to map informative variants genome-wide, enhancing our understanding of the biology behind thermal tolerance and helping breed resilient cattle in a hotter world.",

Here, we introduce a real-time programmable, combinatorial metamaterial framework composed of asymmetric pillars that can manipulate acoustic waves based on the pillars’ angular orientation. First, we demonstrate the utility of our metamaterials with all pillars oriented in the same direction, exhibiting wave attenuation, localization, and topological insulation. Subsequently, we expand the unit-cells into multiple domains and supercells where the number of possible designs enlarges to exceed 10 100 . Our metamaterials offer real-time programmability at both the unit-cell level using individual motors for high versatility, and at a functional domain level using gears for simplicity. We also present a hybrid approach combining motors and gears in clusters providing a balance between versatility and simplicity. We expect our scalable, combinatorial approach with on-demand reprogrammability of acoustic properties to facilitate the development of advanced forms of acoustic devices.",

Results from the aggregate were consistent with previous work that detected the five canonical nucleobases and 14 of the 20 α-amino acids utilized by life to synthesize proteins. However, our analytical approach tentatively uncovered trace signals of a fifteenth α-amino acid, tryptophan, which has not been detected previously in extraterrestrial materials. Further, we found that the distributions of insoluble and soluble-derived organics differ between distinct stones, suggesting heterogeneous geologic processing within Bennu’s parent body. The distributions of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons resemble those in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites and are consistent with an abiotic origin through aqueous reactions.

Such regulation is often manifested in a sigmoidal dependence of enzyme activity on ligand concentration. Various molecular mechanisms have been proposed to underlie such sigmoidal behavior, but they are usually assumed to occur independently of one another. We hypothesized that coexistence of allosteric mechanisms can lead to complex kinetic behavior and higher or lower cooperativity than expected. A mathematical framework that analyses sigmoidal behavior as a function of two cooccurring mechanisms, hysteresis and homotropic binding cooperativity, was developed. The model shows, for example, that i) the observed cooperativity, as measured by the Hill coefficient, can decrease with increasing binding cooperativity, and that ii) unusually high values of the Hill coefficient can be observed. Our mathematical analysis is shown to be relevant for a mutant of Escherichia coli glutathione reductase with an unusually high value of a Hill coefficient for a dimer of about 1.9, in which hysteresis and binding cooperativity coexist. More generally, our findings imply that the repertoire of allosteric regulation is richer than anticipated and suggest that ultrasensitive control in natural or designed systems may arise even in low-order oligomers.",

          "abstract": "The marine biological carbon pump is driven by sinking particulate organic matter (POM). Sinking speed and remineralization rate determine flux attenuation in the mesopelagic. Since the fate of all marine organic matter is either complete remineralization or transformation to more stable products, diagenetic modifications impact carbon dioxide sequestration time from the atmosphere. To investigate particle transformation at the molecular level, we characterize the water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) fraction of sinking particles from dominant biogeochemical environments using ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry. We find distinct, inverse associations in molecular-level nitrogen content and degree of transformation (i.e., “stability”) of organic matter across a productivity gradient from coastal upwelling to oligotrophic conditions. Nitrogen enrichment and low stability were observed at the coastal upwelling site and persisted to depths &gt;400 m. Further, carbon flux is strongly correlated with the relative abundance of stable WEOM (“Island of Stability” molecular formulae) across productivity regimes and depth. This suggests emergent patterns in epi- and mesopelagic diagenesis, highlighting that the molecular composition of sinking organic matter exiting the euphotic zone varies more across regions than as a function of depth. This is attributed to highly variable sinking rates and the microbial diagenetic histories within the euphotic zone. The stability–flux relationship is considered a “diagenetic clock” relative to organic matter formation where the relative abundance of Island of Stability molecular formulae describes the degree of departure from the organic matter molecular-level composition at formation. This ubiquitous trajectory of the diagenetic clock further underpins a global ocean molecular signature of sinking POM.",

Despite ongoing efforts including the analysis of ancient dog and wolf genomes, many questions remain regarding the evolutionary processes that led to the diversity of breeds today. Although ancient genome sequences provide valuable information about these processes, their utility is hindered by low depths of coverage and postmortem damage, which inhibits confident genotype calling. In the present study, we assess how genotype imputation of ancient dog and wolf genomes, using a large reference panel, can increase the amount of information provided by ancient datasets. We evaluated imputation accuracy by down-sampling high-coverage dog and wolf genomes to 0.05 to 2× coverage and compared concordance between imputed and high-coverage genotypes. We measured the impact of imputation on principal component analyses and runs of homozygosity (ROH). Our findings show high (R 2 &gt; 0.9) imputation accuracy for dogs with coverage as low as 0.5× and for wolves as low as 1.0×. We then imputed a dataset of 90 ancient dog and wolf genomes to assess changes in inbreeding during the last 10,000 y of dog evolution. Ancient dog and wolf populations generally exhibit lower inbreeding levels than present-day individuals. Regions with low ROH density maintained across ancient and present-day dogs were significantly associated with genes related to immunity and chemosensory receptors. Our study indicates that imputing ancient canine genomes is a viable strategy that allows for the use of analytical methods previously limited to high-quality genetic data.",

          "abstract": "Explaining the origins of language is a key challenge in understanding ourselves as a species. We present an empirical framework that draws on synergies across fields to facilitate robust studies of language evolution. The approach is multifaceted, seeing language emergence as dependent on the convergence of multiple capacities, each with their own evolutionary trajectories. It is explicitly biocultural, recognizing and incorporating the importance of both biological preparedness and cultural transmission as well as interactions between them. We demonstrate this approach through three case studies that examine the evolution of different facets involved in human language (vocal production learning, linguistic structure, and social underpinnings).",

The Brassica rapa female self-incompatibility determinant, S -locus receptor kinase (SRK), recognizes interspecific pollen. Here we report the discovery of a pan-Brassicaceae SRK-interacting Interspecific Pollen Signal (SIPS). On B. rapa stigmas, SIPSs from Arabidopsis and other Brassicaceae species target Br SRK and recruit the female fertility regulator FERONIA receptor kinase to increase stigmatic reactive oxygen species and reduce interspecific pollen viability. Arabidopsis sips pollen failed to trigger the interspecific incompatibility responses. Unlike self-incompatibility, which is controlled by the polymorphic S locus, different genetic variants of SRK interacted comparably with SIPS. This study establishes SIPS-SRK as a Brassicaceae-specific ligand-receptor pair that broadly maintains the stigmatic interspecific barrier in self-incompatible species.",

By inducing CRISPR-Cas–mediated breaks at subcentromeric and subtelomeric sequences, we fused entire chromosome arms, obtaining two eight-chromosome lines. In one line, both arms of chromosome 3 were fused to chromosome 1. In another line, the arms were transferred to chromosomes 1 and 5. Both chromosome number–reduced lines were fertile. Phenotypic and transcriptional analyses revealed no differences compared with wild-type plants. After crossing with the wild type, the progeny showed reduced fertility. The meiotic recombination patterns of the transferred chromosome arms were substantially changed.

This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids. In contrast to monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, the archaeal Pyl code occurs sporadically, indicating that it arose independently in multiple lineages. We discovered that more than 1800 archaeal proteins contain Pyl, increasing the number of such proteins by two orders of magnitude.

We isolated a variant of Aeromonas genus from stool samples from UC patients, which we termed macrophage-toxic bacteria (MTB), because aerolysin secreted by MTB caused macrophage death.

In this work, we use this approach to realize an effective one-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard model. Harnessing our quantum gas microscope, we probe the correlated out-of-equilibrium dynamics of extended-range repulsively bound pairs and “hard rods.” By contrast, operating near equilibrium, we observe density ordering when adiabatically turning on the extended-range interactions.

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that face selective pressures from their hosts but also compete within the host cell for replication resources. While theory indicates that within-cell selection matters for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of these dynamics has remained elusive. Here, we measure within-cell fitness of competing Escherichia coli plasmids and characterize their drift and selective dynamics. We made synthetic plasmid dimers that can be split in a controlled way to create balanced competition, which we probed experimentally. Incompatible plasmids coexist for an extended time due to methylation-based replication control. Moreover, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell advantage and fix preferentially, favoring gene loss. Critically, fixation depends non-trivially on the interplay between plasmid transcription and translation. Our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by within- and between-cell dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Optimal neural processing relies on precise tissue patterning across diverse cell types. Here, we show that spontaneous calcium waves arise among non-neuronal support cells in the developing Drosophila eye to drive retinal morphogenesis. These waves are initiated by Cad96Ca receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, triggering phospholipase C–γ–mediated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum. A cell type–specific “innexin code” coordinates wave propagation through a defined gap junction network among non-neuronal retinal cells, excluding photoreceptors. Wave intensity scales with ommatidial size, triggering stronger myosin II–driven apical contraction at interommatidial boundaries in larger ommatidia. This size-dependent mechanism compensates for early boundary irregularities, ensuring uniform ommatidial packing that is critical for precise optical architecture. Our findings reveal how synchronized calcium signaling among non-neuronal cells orchestrates tissue patterning in the developing nervous system.",

Pkdcc is an essential gene in the nervous system, and VLK is enriched at synapses and released from neurons in an activity- and soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor (SNARE)–dependent manner to drive extracellular interactions.

This study aimed to identify maternal metabolomic signatures associated with prenatal heat exposure and PTB. We conducted a prospective analysis of 215 participants in the Atlanta African American Maternal-Child Cohort (2014 to 2020). Serum samples collected during early and late pregnancy underwent untargeted metabolomic profiling. Daily maximum ambient temperature was estimated at geocoded residential addresses and averaged over three exposure windows: conception to early pregnancy, early to late pregnancy, and conception to late pregnancy. Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for each exposure window and PTB, followed by a meet-in-the-middle analysis. We identified 23 metabolic pathways and four overlapping metabolites, including methionine, proline, citrulline, and pipecolate, associated with both temperature exposure and PTB. These metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress regulation. Findings highlight the potential of metabolomics to detect early biological alterations linked to environmental risk and adverse birth outcomes.",

A fundamental challenge is that, because two people may differ in many ways, factors besides race might explain differences in treatment. Here, we propose a test for bias that circumvents the difficulty of comparing two people by instead assessing whether the same person is treated differently when their race is perceived differently. We apply our method to test for bias in police traffic stops, finding that the same driver is likelier to be searched or arrested by police when they are perceived as Hispanic than when they are perceived as white. Our test is broadly applicable to other datasets where race, gender, or other identity data are perceived rather than self-reported, and the same person is observed multiple times.",

We use data from the nationally representative (United States) High School and Beyond cohort, characterize fluoride exposure from drinking water across adolescence, adjust for confounders, and observe cognitive test performance in both secondary school and at age ~60. We find that children exposed to recommended levels of fluoride in drinking water exhibit modestly better cognition in secondary school, an advantage that is smaller and no longer statistically significant at age ~60.",

These metals are currently sourced from declining terrestrial reserves, making deep-sea polymetallic nodules a promising alternative. However, current metal extraction methods are lengthy and energy and carbon intensive, emitting 45, 28, and 4 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per ton of nickel, cobalt, and copper, respectively. We present a fossil-free hydrogen plasma–based reduction process, powered by green hydrogen and renewable energy, which condenses calcination, smelting, reduction, and refining into a single-step metal extraction, reducing direct carbon dioxide emissions by up to 90% and improving energy efficiency by up to 18%. In addition, we demonstrate selective copper recovery via a heat treatment requiring no acids or reducing agents, offering a more sustainable and cost-effective pathway for critical metal extraction from polymetallic nodules.",

Successful implementation of these techniques depends on creating a robust, uniform two-dimensional (2D) material surface. The conventional method for fabricating graphene on silicon carbide (SiC) is high-temperature graphitization. However, the extremely high temperature required for silicon sublimation (typically above 1500°C) causes step bunching, forming nonuniform multilayer graphene stripes and an unfavorable surface morphology for epitaxial growth. Here, we developed a wafer-scale graphitization technique that allows fast synthesis of single-crystalline graphene at low temperatures by metal-assisted graphitization. In contrast to previous reports, we found annealing conditions enabling SiC dissociation while avoiding silicide formation, producing uniform single-crystalline graphene while maintaining the pristine surface morphology of the substrate. We successfully produce high-quality freestanding single-crystalline III-N (AlN and GaN) membranes on graphene/SiC via the 2D material–based layer transfer technique.",

A promising candidate, UA2239, an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with a guanine as nucleobase, demonstrates rapid and irreversible inhibitory effects on Plasmodium parasites. It blocks the active exit process, named egress, of merozoites and gametes from infected erythrocytes. UA2239 disrupts the essential cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)–dependent egress pathway by decreasing cGMP levels in the parasite, strongly suggesting Plasmodium falciparum guanylyl cyclase α as its primary target. We also uncovered remarkable molecular mechanisms of resistance developed by parasites after prolonged exposure to the drug, which involve mutating not the target itself, but downstream effectors. The unique mechanism of action of UA2239 makes it a valuable first-in-class candidate for further development. Its ability to inhibit both parasite growth and transmission highlights its therapeutic potential as a dual-stage antimalarial agent.",

The addition of chlorotrimethylsilane facilitated the in situ formation of an N -trimethylsilyl pyridinium salt, increasing the electron deficiency of the pyridine core and enabling it to preferentially undergo single-electron reduction over alkyl bromides, thereby enhancing both yield and regioselectivity. Furthermore, the C4-alkylated pyridines can undergo subsequent electroreductive C2 alkylation, allowing for the sequential installation of distinct alkyl groups, thereby providing a versatile approach to accessing structurally diverse di- and trifunctionalized pyridines.",

We combined genomic and ecological analyses to investigate parallel introductions of the Eurasian Tree Sparrow across continents. Our analyses of genetic structure and demography revealed that introduced populations in North America (European origin) and Australia (Chinese origin) experienced founder effects, with resulting bottlenecks, reduced genetic diversity, and increased inbreeding. Despite the genome-wide loss of diversity, we identified conserved regions of high genetic variation in the introduced populations, potentially maintained through balancing selection of ancestral polymorphisms. Genotype-climate association and genetic offset modeling demonstrated that climate-adaptive genetic variants retained similar frequencies across the native and introduced ranges, likely maintaining similar interactions of genetic components with climate niches. Our findings highlight how retention of adaptive polymorphism facilitates establishment success in the introduced populations, providing a framework for predicting invasion potential through genomic signatures of adaptation.",

However, phosphate’s low terrestrial abundance and the poor aqueous solubility of phosphorus-bearing minerals pose major hurdles for prebiotic chemistry. Here, we show that silicate-phosphate immiscibility in volcanic melts could have provided a widely available mechanism for the local enrichment of phosphate. Starting with a phosphorus-enriched Archean melt, we observe that rapid cooling results in the formation of immiscible glassy droplets with up to 21 weight % phosphorus pentoxide, which can be delivered to the surface by volcanic processes. In aqueous leaching, we detect millimolar phosphate concentrations, which enable the synthesis of phosphorylating agents such as polyphosphates and imidazole phosphate with up to 34% yield. These results demonstrate how volcanic processes can enrich phosphate to fuel prebiotic chemistry.",

Materials that support PhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high-quality factor are therefore needed. Here, using monochromatic electron energy loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultrathin SrTiO 3 membranes have the desired properties. Systematic measurements across varying thicknesses reveal two PhP branches with wide spectral dispersion, strong confinement, and exceptionally slow group velocities spanning from the mid-infrared to terahertz range. Notably, in 3-nanometer-thick membranes, these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~7 × 10 −5 c , rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO 3 as versatile platforms for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.",

          "abstract": "Endoscopic resection of colon cancer represents an advanced technique in early intervention, but faces the challenges in identifying tumor margins and removing residual lesions. Here, we developed orally administered Raman probes (i.e., BBT-Apt@CS NPs) that enable precise tumor imaging and photothermal ablation. Protected by an enteric coating for colon-targeted release, the inner nanoparticles use a stacking-induced charge transfer–enhanced Raman scattering (SICTERS) mechanism and are functionalized with tumor-targeting aptamers. In a proof-of-concept study using the endoscopic optical fiber, we achieved in situ precise detection of microtumors and effective photothermal ablation of residual lesions at the resection margins, with simultaneous induction of immune memory. In a rechallenge model, mice treated with photothermal therapy on residual lesions exhibited no tumor recurrence. We have optimized endoscopic resection strategies through theranostic Raman probes, thus providing an innovative solution for the minimally invasive precision intervention in colorectal cancer.",

          "abstract": "Modulation of gut microbiota has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, current interventions such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation remain limited by insufficient safety and efficacy. To address this, we engineered commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) using miRNA-loaded biomimetic nanoparticles to enhance its proliferation and indole-3-carboxaldehyde production. By functionalizing bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) derived from LGG with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), we developed BEV-LNPs that exhibited enhanced targeting efficiency toward LGG compared to Escherichia coli . In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that BEV-LNPs showed superior stability in simulated physiological fluids and gastrointestinal environments compared to conventional LNPs. When combined with 5-aminosalicylic acid, the BEV-LNP formulation notably improved outcomes in acute and chronic colitis models, reducing inflammation, restoring epithelial barrier integrity, and promoting microbial balance.

Using two complementary datasets, we identify a sharp increase in magnetic mineral concentration immediately after the early Miocene unconformity [~20 million years ago (Ma)], concurrent with a shift in detrital zircon ages, indicating a major provenance shift. We identify bimodal volcanism of the Columbia River Basalt Group as the dominant Miocene source, requiring that the early Miocene Continental Divide lay ~400 kilometers west of its present position. This reorganization, driven by Yellowstone plume–induced uplift, persisted until at least 10 Ma.

Here, we show that far-red (FR) light, enriched in skylight during dusk and dawn, activates plant antiviral defense via phytochrome A (phyA). FR light-induced phyA activation promotes degradation of phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1), which triggers the REVEILLE 7 (RVE7)–enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1) cascade to enhance salicylic acid (SA) signaling. Furthermore, multiple viruses use their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to disrupt the phyA–far-red elongated hypocotyl 1 (FHY1) interaction to block phyA nuclear transport, impairing FR light–induced plant defense. Our findings uncover the molecular basis of FR light–mediated plant antiviral defense and reveal a previously unidentified viral counter-defense mechanism, highlighting how plants interpret environmental light cues to adapt to insect-borne viral infections.",

These electrons are usually chemical radicals, requiring removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources, such as ultraviolet irradiation, generate lower polarization and require cryogenic transport. We present ultrahigh–dose rate electron irradiation as an alternative for generating nonpersistent radicals in alanine/glycerol mixtures. These are stable for months at room temperature, quench spontaneously upon dissolution, are present in dose-dependent concentrations, and generate comparable nuclear polarization (17%) to trityl radicals used clinically (19%) through a previously unknown mechanism we believe to involve partial ordering and electron-electron interactions. Owing to the large radiation doses required, this process is sterilizing, permits imaging of alanine metabolism in vivo in the rat kidney, and may aid clinically translating dDNP.",

We apply this technique to swelling and acid-catalyzed deconstruction of cross-linked and linear polymers to observe how structural heterogeneity evolves over time.

In this review, we explore the catalytic mechanisms at the atomic scale by examining the origins and design principles of carbon catalysts for carbon dioxide conversion. A framework is proposed for the rational design of the active sites for carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen couplings, facilitating the production of high-value multicarbon (C 2+ ) hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing chemicals.

Cohesive strength is frequently ignored in constitutive laws used to describe fault rheology in numerical simulations of earthquakes and SSEs alike. To demonstrate its importance, we perform and analyze a suite of petrological experiments that simulate fault healing under representative pressure and temperature conditions. We show that significant cohesive strength recovery caused by dissolution-precipitation processes occurs on timescales of just a few hours. Together, our experimental and observational results support the idea that cohesion is a key component of fault strength under SSE conditions and highlight the need for its inclusion in both future experiments and numerical models of fault slip.",

Our AI-driven screening highlighted melatonin (MLT) as a promising candidate. Serum profiling of 161 human individuals confirmed an age-related fall in circulating MLT level, while subsequent in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that MLT rescues cognition, suppresses neuroinflammation, and alleviates senescence phenotypes. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)–guided chemoproteomic deconvolution next pinpointed the histone acetyltransferase p300 as MLT’s target. Integrated Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics revealed that MLT-bound p300 cooperates with specificity protein 1 (SP1) at a brain and muscle ARNT-like protein 1 super-enhancer, elevating histone H3 lysine-27 acetylation and reengaging a circadian-epigenetic program that links redox resilience to neuroprotection. By combining AI-driven discovery with PROTAC-based target mapping and super-enhancer–centric mechanistic resolution, our study identifies MLT as a dual-action candidate and sets out a reproducible “AI-to-clinic” paradigm for multitarget drug innovation in aging-related neurodegeneration.",

          "abstract": "Uricase (UOX) is effective for treating refractory gout but is limited by antidrug antibody (ADA) formation, which leads to loss of efficacy and infusion reactions. Here, we demonstrate that a single coadministration of erythrocyte-conjugated UOX (UOX-Ery) with an immunosuppressant such as cyclophosphamide (CTX) induces robust and durable antigen-specific immune tolerance. This one-time intervention effectively prevented ADA formation in mice and rats, even after repeated challenges with UOX-Ery or free UOX protein, an outcome not achieved by CTX or UOX plus CTX. This tolerogenic effect relied on splenic uptake of UOX-Ery by myeloid cells, particularly macrophages, and was associated with the expansion of a distinct subset of effector regulatory T cells. Functionally, this immune tolerance enhanced the pharmacokinetics of UOX, sustained long-term control of serum uric acid levels, and attenuated local inflammation within tophus-like lesions. Together, these findings demonstrate that UOX-Ery, combined in a single dose with clinically used immunosuppressants, can effectively treat gout by inducing antigen-specific immune tolerance.",

This gap limits the quality of digital tactile information and the realism of virtual experiences. Here, we introduce a step toward human-resolution haptics: a class of wearable tactile displays designed to match the spatial and temporal acuity of the human fingertip. Our device, VoxeLite, is a 0.1-millimeter-thick, 0.19-gram, skin-conformal array of individually addressable soft electroadhesive actuators (“nodes”). As users touch and move across surfaces, VoxeLite delivers high-resolution distributed forces via the nodes. Enabled by scalable microfabrication techniques, the display achieves actuator densities up to 110 nodes per square centimeter, produces stimuli up to 800 hertz, and remains transparent to real-world tactile input. We demonstrate its ability to render small-scale hapticons and virtual textures and transmit physical surfaces, validated through human psychophysics and biomimetic sensing. These findings position VoxeLite as a platform for human-resolution haptics in immersive interfaces, robotics, and digital touch communication.",

Current therapeutic options are limited, and innovative treatments to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) are needed. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) comprises a family of 12 isoforms. In the present study, single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells revealed that AMPKβ1 isoform (AMPKα1β1γ1) predominates in the erythroid lineage. AMPKβ1 activators increased the expression of HbF in erythroid cells from SCD donors and decreased sickling in vitro through activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2) but independently from direct Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) inhibition, by way of a noncanonical NRF2 pathway, as shown by phosphorylation of Unc-51–like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) and sequestosome 1/p62 (SQSTM1). In vivo studies in Townes SCD mice treated with the selective AMPKβ1 activator PF-06409577 confirmed increased HbF in circulating erythrocytes, associated with decreased reactive oxygen species and reduced chronic inflammation markers.

However, human preimplantation embryos often display an array of morphological defects associated with poor development and implantation. Here, we used live-embryo imaging and computational analysis to capture how these defects can be produced in real time. We record various forms of mitotic errors including lagging chromosomes producing micronuclei, multipolar spindles causing abnormal chromosome organization recapitulated by daughter cells, and uncontrolled scattering of condensed chromosomes. In addition, we capture abnormal cleavage furrow dynamics during cytokinesis producing binucleated and enucleated cells. Finally, we find cells with disrupted mitotic progression ultimately leading to blebbing and fragmentation. Thus, these results document specific aberrant cell behaviors producing morphological defects in real time, and indicate that errors during mitosis and cytokinesis represent a major cause of developmental failures in human embryos.",

We show that IL-10–producing tolDC (DC IL-10 ) regulate B cell responses through direct and indirect mechanisms. DC IL-10 enhances T cell–independent human B cell proliferation and differentiation while suppressing Ag-specific memory B cells via T cell inhibition in vitro and dampen Ag-specific IgG production in preclinical humanized and murine models.

This catalyst enables the production of optically pure glyceric acid from a broad range of biomass sources including raw biomass with unprecedented yield (59 to 96%) and enantiomeric excess (97 to &gt;99%). Structural and mechanistic studies reveal that silver clusters, stabilized by surface oxygen vacancies, activate dioxygen through π-backbonding, while electron-deficient silver single atoms preferentially bind the chiral substrate via ionic interactions, increasing the energy barrier for mutarotation and preserving its stereochemical identity. Oxygen spillover between the two sites facilitates precise oxidative Cα–Cβ bond cleavage.

In contrast, T cell–mediated immunity targeting conserved epitopes may offer broad and long-lasting protection. However, whether T cells alone can provide sufficient protection remains unclear. Here, we identified both Omicron BA.1–specific and ancestral (Wuhan)–conserved CD8 T cell epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and evaluated them as carrier-protein fusion vaccines in mouse models. Subcutaneous immunizations with two CD8 epitope peptides substantially lowered lung viral load and conferred protection against low-dose viral challenge, but not against high-dose challenge. Notably, intranasal boosting—with or without adjuvant—enhanced lung resident memory T cell responses and conferred potent, durable protection against high-dose infection. These findings emphasize the importance of mucosal vaccination to boost protective T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and support the potential of T cell–based vaccines targeting conserved epitopes for broad immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral threats.",

Here, we identify the nonfibrillar collagen CLE-1, a member of the evolutionarily conserved multiplexin family, as a master determinant of synapse identity in Caenorhabditis elegans . C. elegans muscle cells are innervated by both cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons. The CLE-1B isoform is secreted by motoneurons and localizes to neuromuscular junctions. Loss of CLE-1B causes the relocalization of acetylcholine receptors to GABAergic synapses. We show that CLE-1B positions previously unidentified proteolytic fragments of the extracellular scaffold Punctin/MADD-4 to align acetylcholine receptors with cholinergic terminals and independently modulates receptor abundance. These findings reveal CLE-1 as a dual-function synaptic organizer that integrates spatial and quantitative control of postsynaptic receptor localization to maintain synapse identity.",

Here we report a damage perception and rapid self-healing encapsulant consisting of alkoxy polyvinylimidazole bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (EP). The dynamic ion aggregates in the encapsulant can easily drive the molecular chain movement of EP, thereby achieving rapid damage repair to maintain device stability and inhibit lead leakage.

Single-molecule microscopy reveals the dynamics governed by hydrodynamic interactions, demonstrating that increasing histone H4 acetylation density enhances structural fluctuations and relaxation times. In vitro Hi-C reveals power-law decay of the nucleosome contacts consistent with the Gaussian chain, which is globally reduced by acetylation.

Interfacial voids between FA 1− x Cs x PbI 3 layer and hole-transport layers, caused by the limited annealing temperature for f -PSMs, severely disrupt the film structural continuity. A double-sided annealing strategy is used to address this challenge, which markedly reduces the voids at the buried interface and yields homogeneous perovskite films with enlarged grains. The double-sided annealing can flip the phase transition direction from traditional top-down to bottom-up, because of the much higher air temperature above perovskite films, allowing a quick dimethyl sulfoxide evaporation. The f -PSMs achieve an aperture-area power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.1% and show ~10% efficiency loss after 107 thermal cycles between −40° and 85°C.

Understanding this would reveal regulatory mechanisms used to maintain critical bioenergetic gradients for cellular respiration, oxidative mitochondrial reactions, and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. In this work, mutational analyses and localized NAD + biosensors revealed that the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) works in concert with charged residues in the carrier’s inner pore to enable sustained import of NAD + against its electrochemical gradient into the matrix. Dissipation of the ΔΨm or mutation of select residues in SLC25A51 led to equilibration of NAD + from the matrix.

We found that extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus suis , common zoonotic bacteria found in pigs, can trigger PRV reactivation, and bacteria up-regulated CXCL1 to enhance STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, which triggers PRV reactivation by regulating the transcription of early viral genes. Effective booster immunization significantly reduced PRV reactivation among pigs. Our work highlights the risk of bacterial coinfections on PRV reactivation, emphasizing the importance of adequate immunization for controlling PRV within pigs and reducing zoonotic transmission.",

Understanding intense light-matter interaction is crucial for steering intramolecular quantum dynamical processes. Here, we record time-resolved x-ray diffraction images of C 60 molecules during and after their interaction with intense near-infrared fields, giving direct access to structural changes of the molecules and their fragmentation in real time. Tuning the intensity of the excitation pulses, we uncover a transition from a weak-field regime of excited but stable molecules to a high-field regime dominated by Coulomb explosion. In the transition region, the molecules expand by up to 50% of their initial size within just 140 fs, with major fragmentation only setting in afterward. This work demonstrates that x-ray diffractive imaging is capable of retrieving time-resolved structural information of large molecules reshaped by intense laser fields. Laser-driven fragmentation is a first step toward observing molecular processes modified by laser fields of increasing intensity.",

          "abstract": "In 2021, Canada experienced one of the most extreme heatwaves ever seen anywhere on the globe. We use a weather forecast model to attribute health impacts to climate change. We simulate the heatwave as a present-day forecast, a preindustrial-counterfactual scenario, and a future-counterfactual scenario. Despite the extremeness of the event, our analysis shows that, under current climate conditions, we could have still seen up to 30% more heat-related deaths than the number observed. We show that between 11 and 15% of the observed human mortality was attributable to climate change during this event, depending on the conditioning of the atmospheric circulation. We also show that, had “the same event” occurred in the future, the mortality toll is nonlinear compared with the warming trend, and so the future attribution would be even more extreme, 16 to 31%. We argue that this method gives particularly reliable impact attribution results and is therefore strongly defensible in decision-making and legal settings.",

          "abstract": "Emerald green, a copper acetoarsenite pigment, enriched the 19th-century and 20th-century artists’ palettes and caused darkening and fragilities in paintings. The accepted alteration mechanism involves the oxidation of triarsenite ions [(As 3 O 6 ) 3− ] to arsenates (AsO 4 3− ), although questions about the promoting factors and the origin of the oxidized arsenic remain unanswered. This study investigates the primary environmental parameters inducing alteration in the oil binder and elucidates the associated degradation pathways through a multiscale analytical approach, including noninvasive spectroscopic techniques and synchrotron radiation–based x-ray methods. By combining results from a historical oil painting by James Ensor (1860 to 1949) and artificially aged paint mock-ups, we identified ultraviolet A–visible light and humidity (relative humidity ≥ 95%) as key driving factors, inducing a dual degradation pathway: Light promotes surface-stratified arsenic oxidation (As 3+  → As 5+ ) resulting in amorphous As 5+ -rich compounds, whereas a dark, high moisture environment favors arsenolite (As 2 O 3 ) crystallization. In addition, a noninvasive analytical strategy is proposed for monitoring the conservation state of emerald green paints in historical artworks.",

Liquid biopsies, involving analysis of cell-free mtDNA, enable early cancer detection but suffer from low sensitivity due to scarce analytes. Here, we developed a CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated urinary biomarker, termed CasUber, for in vivo monitoring of tumor progression and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that CasUber can deliver a CRISPR detection system into tumor cell mitochondria, leverage the single-nucleotide variant recognition ability and trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a to convert tumor-specific mtDNA mutations into renal-clearable fluorescent biomarkers, and exocytosed along with the natural efflux pathway of damaged mtDNA. As a result, CasUber enables discrimination of ultrasmall tumor lesions (~1 cubic millimeter) and detection of lung tumor nodules earlier than bioluminescence imaging in a blood-lung metastasis model. This renal clearable nanosensor allows in situ recognition of specific gene mutation to generate amplified signals, overcoming the limitation of low mtDNA abundance and enabling noninvasive and ultrasensitive monitoring of tumor progression and metastasis via a simple urine test.",

In vitro assays reveal high biological efficacy, with engineered polymersomes supporting targeted cellular interactions. Functionalization with diverse ligands introduces specific biological functionalities, including mitochondrial targeting, cell migration stimulation, and enhanced receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Our study demonstrates that during the recent decades, the Arctic Ocean deep water is warming at 0.020°C/decade in the Eurasian Basin between 2000 and 2600 m, exceeding what can be explained by geothermal heating. We find that the rapid warming in the deep Greenland Basin diminishes its cooling effect on the deep Eurasian Basin via the Fram Strait, leading to the warming in the deep Eurasian Basin. Meanwhile, the Lomonosov Ridge blocks this warming signal from reaching the deep Amerasian Basin, maintaining its relative slow warming rate of 0.003°C/decade.

          "abstract": "The repeated evolution of avian obligate brood parasitism (OBP) across diverse lineages represents a major evolutionary puzzle. While host-parasite coevolution has been extensively studied, the initial conditions favoring OBP emergence remain unclear. Here, we integrate theoretical modeling, paleoclimate mapping, and phylogenetic comparative analyses to identify the key drivers underlying OBP evolution. Our model shows that rising parental care costs, particularly under environmental stress, may favor the emergence of OBP. However, its persistence requires additional life-history adaptations, including increases in fecundity (egg production). Paleoclimatic data support this framework: OBP origins often followed major climatic upheavals with fixations occurring during subsequently more stable periods. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that OBP is associated with high-mortality ecological traits, such as open-habitat use. We also find increased OBP likelihood in both smaller carnivorous and larger herbivorous/omnivorous species, indicating size-dependent trophic constraints. These results provide a unified framework explaining the recurrent evolution of OBP by linking environmental pressures and life-history trade-offs to this remarkable behavioral adaptation.",

Here, we identify a shift in the ENSO-BSWI relationship. Pre–mid-1990s, traditional eastern Pacific ENSO dominated, driving a positive ENSO-BSWI linkage; post–mid-1990s, more frequent central Pacific (CP) ENSO events reversed this relationship to negative. Observations and model experiments show that CP El Niño coupled with positive-phase North Pacific meridional mode (NPMM) redirects poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains, enhancing Bering Sea southerlies. This suppresses ice advection, intensifies warm air intrusion, and reduces BSWI. Strengthened CP ENSO-NPMM coupling and heightened NPMM variability amplify this teleconnection, increasing its influence on BSWI by 38.9% versus NPMM alone. Our findings underscore the growing role of subtropical and tropical Pacific climate interactions in subarctic sea ice variability and highlight the need for improved climate models that capture ENSO diversity, NPMM dynamics, and subtropical-subarctic teleconnections to enhance BSWI projections under climate change.",

This study reveals a vicious circle of ECM-cell-ECM, where increased ECM hardness activates the STING pathway in macrophages, in turn activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), thus enhancing ECM stiffness again and exacerbating liver fibrosis. To reverse liver fibrosis, an innovative carrier-free nanosystem capable of degrading ECM, specifically blocking the STING pathway in macrophages as well as remodeling matrix mechanical, is created. In mouse models, pharmacological STING inhibition via alkylation in macrophages, combined with ECM degradation via matrix metalloproteinases and metal ion–induced macrophage polarization, reduces stromal stiffness and reverses fibrosis. Our findings underscore the antifibrotic potential of matrix mechanical remodeling, demonstrating that concurrent reduction of matrix stiffness and inhibition of STING pathway in macrophages can synergistically promote fibrosis regression.

The temperature dependence of the tunneling rate provides a clue to understanding the quantum effects. Important physics behind quantum tunneling involves the correlation with surrounding environment, such as phonons and electrons. However, this correlation is not yet well understood due to the difficulty of directly probing hydrogen hopping. Taking advantage of nuclear reaction analysis and resistance measurements, we successfully observed hydrogen hopping from tetrahedral to octahedral sites in palladium. The hydrogen hopping is observed even at low temperatures owing to the quantum tunneling. The tunneling rate reveals a slightly positive and negative temperature dependence above and below 20 kelvin, respectively. The former is explained by the phonon effects. The latter is attributed to the nonadiabatic effects of conduction electrons, whose coupling constant K was derived to be 0.41 ± 0.03 from its temperature ( T ) dependence described as T 2 K –1 .",
