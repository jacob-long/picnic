          "authors": "Marta Topor; Henrik Danielsson",
          "abstract": "Preregistration, the process of publicly recording a study’s hypotheses, design, and analysis plan before data collection and/or analysis, is an essential practice for enhancing transparency, methodological rigour, and reproducibility in research. This chapter provides a practical guide for integrating preregistration into teaching and supervision.\n\nThe first section highlights arguments for adopting preregistration, emphasising its role in reducing biases. It introduces preregistration as a critical skill for academic development and offers guidance for designing learning exercises, including activities that build competencies in hypothesis formulation, study design, and analysis planning relevant to both quantitative and qualitative studies.\nThe second section addresses the practical implementation of preregistration in student-led projects. It discusses how to support preregistration across methodological traditions—quantitative, qualitative, and systematic reviews—and offers concrete guidance on template selection, platform use, managing deviations from preregistered plans, and reporting exploratory analyses.",

          "authors": "María de los Ángeles Crespo López; Claudia Pallise Perello; Jeroen de Ridder; Krishma Labib",
          "abstract": "The open science (OS) movement is growing, with increasing policies, guidelines, tools and infrastructures being developed to support researchers who engage in OS practices. However, there is no widely accepted single definition of OS. Different initiatives and countries employ a variety of characterizations. To chart how OS is understood in different parts of the world, we conducted a scoping review and critical discourse analysis of OS guidance documents aimed at researchers. Our search led to the inclusion of 69 national and international documents, with most originating from North America, Europe, and Latin America. Our results show that OS discourses are exaggerated, framing OS as the solution to address all scientific and societal problems. Furthermore, they provide often conflicting ideas about what OS can achieve. Many guidance documents frame OS as a tool to promote economic growth and efficiency. Others see OS as necessary to safeguard research quality and reproducibility through transparency. In contrast, few documents address knowledge equity and inclusion. Taking this into account, we see dominant OS discourses reproducing knowledge equity problems already present in research, rather than tackling them. We urge researchers be more precise about the specific approach they take to OS and more humble about the effects it can have – both positive, and negative.",

          "authors": "James Scott; Robert Andrew Foley; Mirjana Bozic",
          "abstract": "We investigated how the presence of linguistic labels, their iconicity and mode of presentation affect non-linguistic cognitive processing; focusing on learning and visual recognition of new semantic categories. Novel species of aliens that mimicked natural semantic categories were paired with iconic labels, non-iconic labels, or no labels across two tasks. In the Training task participants learnt to categorise the aliens, and we then used a Match to Sample design to test how this affects their rapid visual recognition. Results showed the presence of labels, their iconicity and online presentation significantly affect non-linguistic cognitive processing, leading to more rapid and accurate visual recognition of newly acquired semantic categories. We argue that this is due to iconicity exaggerating sensory expectations provided by linguistic labels, made more readily accessible by their online presentation. We also examine the implications that our results might have for the language evolution discussion.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Matthew Fawcett; Brady Ryan Thomas Roberts; Siyue Hu; Cayley Thoms; Jedidiah Whitridge; Colin M. MacLeod; Hannah Willoughby",
          "abstract": "The production effect refers to the finding that words read aloud are remembered better than words read silently. Historically, this phenomenon has been explained with reference to distinctive features encoded at study (e.g., auditory and motor elements) being retrieved at test to discriminate between studied and unstudied items, with emphasis placed on features stemming from the act of production itself. Across two experiments, we demonstrate that even anticipation of reading a word aloud is sufficient to improve its memory over silent items. Using a recent variant of the production paradigm involving pupillometry, participants were instructed to withhold their response until a “Go” signal appeared. On “catch” trials this signal never occurred. Despite having not produced the word on a catch trial, participants nonetheless demonstrated both a behavioral (Experiments 1 and 2) and a pupillary (Experiment 2) production effect, although both were of lesser magnitude than on trials requiring actual production. For “Go” trials, the behavioral production effect was evident for both recollection and familiarity; for “catch” trials, the effect was evident only for recollection. These results support recent claims that motivational or attentional factors play a role in the emergence of the production effect, connecting this effect to a broader framework of action-oriented memory enhancement.",

          "authors": "Daniel Mark Low; Patrick Mair; Matthew Nock; Satrajit S Ghosh",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). Yet when used to assess psychological constructs in text, they are generally not evaluated for the types of validity, reliability, and standardization typically expected from traditional questionnaires with rating scales. This study bridges that gap by demonstrating how to evaluate the psychometric properties of text-based models, which we call Text Psychometrics.\n\nWe first review different NLP methods, compare their ability to address key challenges in psychological research such as explainability, and outline methods for evaluating them on many desirable psychometric properties. We then demonstrate this through two empirical studies. Study 1 classifies thousands of crisis counseling conversations and Reddit posts into different types of mental health issues and introduces a novel method to evaluate text models for content validity —the extent to which a test captures the full range of expressions of a construct. Study 2 examines prospective criterion validity by estimating how 49 known suicide risk factors predict imminent risk in crisis counseling conversations.\n\nIn sum, NLP studies in psychology often rely on only a few validation metrics; here, we demonstrate the need for broader psychometric evaluation and provide a practical blueprint and future directions for achieving it.",

          "abstract": "Everyday experiences can evoke positive feelings that differ among individuals and guide their behavior. Although reward processing is often linked to positive feelings, few studies have assessed the mechanisms underlying subjective positive affect. Whether varied positive experiences share brain mechanisms that are predictive of subjective positive affect is unclear. Here, we used fMRI and predictive modeling to investigate how multiple dynamic, personalized positive experiences are encoded in the brain. Neural representations and functional integration of brain areas during experiences of monetary reward, social media, music, and positive autobiographical memories were used to predict participants' affect ratings of each experience. We found that, across experiences, positive affect was encoded in multivariate neural patterns and functional coupling of distributed cortical and subcortical brain areas, as well as some canonical value-linked brain regions, like the orbitofrontal cortex. We also found that more restricted sets of brain representations and functional connections linked to sensory processing were involved in encoding type-specific subjective positive affect. Our findings suggest that positive affect may be computed and communicated throughout the brain.",

          "abstract": "Mediation analysis plays a central role in marketing research due to its usefulness in helping to explain complex processes. Like other forms of inference, mediation analyses are susceptible to false positive results. This is particularly true when analytic decisions are based on the data, rather than a priori hypotheses. To assess the collective evidential value of mediation analyses in marketing, we used an approach first implemented by Götz and colleagues (2021) that (1) measures the relative proximity of confidence intervals to zero (RP) and (2) aggregates a related set of RP scores into a single distribution. For our analysis, we compared the RP distribution of top marketing journals (2018-20) to simulations of low power, adequate power, and null effects. We also compared the marketing journals to real-world data from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (JPSP) (2018-20). We found that, in terms of evidential value, mediation analyses in marketing substantially deviated from simulations of adequate power and JPSP but  were similar to simulations of low power and null effects. We propose study preregistration, corrections for multiple testing, and increased statistical power as solutions to increase evidence quality going forward.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity. To limit its damaging impacts, billions of people must take pro-environmental actions. However, these often require effort and people avoid effort. It is vital to identify psychological interventions that increase willingness to exert effort. 3,055 people from six diverse countries completed an effort-based decision-making task (Pro-Environmental Effort Task; Bulgaria: n=404, Greece: n=85, Nigeria: n=660, Sweden: n=1090, UK: n=482, USA: n=334). Participants chose whether to exert physical effort (50-95% of their maximum) to reduce carbon emissions, after experiencing one of 11 expert crowd-sourced interventions or no intervention. We applied computational modelling to precisely quantify motivation to help the climate, compared to a closely matched non-environmental cause. We found two interventions, which reduced the psychological distance to climate change impacts or promoted climate action as patriotic and protecting participants’ way of life, had consistent positive effects on increasing effortful pro-environmental behaviours, across measures and control analyses. At the individual level, motivation to benefit the climate was associated with belief in climate change and support for pro-environmental policies. In contrast, trait apathy and effort aversion were linked with reduced motivation to benefit both the climate and food cause. Together, our results have crucial implications for promoting effortful actions that help mitigate climate change.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation is a fundamental process that shapes\ncognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to emotional\nstimuli. Traditional emotion regulation models conceptualize\nregulation as a sequential modulation of emotional responses.\nHowever, they do not fully explain how emotions are\nconstructed in a way that allows such regulation to occur.\nPredictive processing (PP) provides a mechanistic framework\nfor understanding emotion generation by proposing that the\nbrain minimizes prediction errors (PEs) to optimize perception\nand behavior. Yet, standard PP accounts reduce valence to PE\nminimization, failing to explain how PEs can generate different\nsubjective feelings. To address these limitations, we propose a\nvalence-focused model of emotion regulation that integrates\npredictive processing with self-referential cognition. We\nincorporate emotional valence as interpretative processes of\nthe self-model, which assigns emotional significance based on\ngoals, values, and autobiographical context. This model\nbridges the gap between emotion generation and regulation,\nhighlighting the dynamic interplay between prediction errors,\nsubjective valuation, and self-referential processes. This\napproach not only advances theoretical understanding but also\nopens new avenues for computational modeling and empirical\nresearch into the adaptive and maladaptive aspects of\nemotional experience.",

          "abstract": "Pursuing a life of moral excellence is often seen as allowing a person not only to live by good and just principles but also to live an authentic life that brings them closest to their true self. This view is taken to reflect the priority that people should place on moral pursuits or “moral primacy.” The results of four preregistered studies (N = 2,911) suggest that people do not always hold this view and highlight a tension within it: how can morality both constrain human behavior and afford the freedom to be one’s truest self? We find that people resolve this conflict with ‘value pluralism,’ preferring a balance of life pursuits across several value domains, where aesthetic pursuits are viewed as affording freedom from convention. We then adapt a personal change paradigm from prior work and develop a novel paradigm to examine whether people’s intuitions about the true self also reveal that a broader set of values—not just moral ones—inform judgments of the true self. We find no differences in true self judgments following the loss of an aesthetic versus moral quality. However, when directly comparing life paths, the pursuit of aesthetic excellence is sometimes viewed as offering greater access to one’s true self compared with moral excellence, in part because aesthetic pursuits are seen as less rule bound. These findings offer insights into the myriad paths a person can take in life while pursuing autonomy, authenticity, and closeness to their true self.",

          "abstract": "Many people around the world believe that to be moral, one must believe in God. However, individuals who do not believe in God also hold distinct ethical beliefs. Similar to theists, non-theists in different cultures may share overarching narratives about morality and what it is founded upon – a possibility that remains to be systematically researched. In the present study, we utilised open-ended survey data to explore what non-religious non-theists from ten countries (N = 996) described as the basis of their views on right and wrong. We furthermore investigated how different beliefs about morality clustered together. The findings point towards cross-culturally recurring non-theistic beliefs and belief clusters pertaining to 1) important moral principles and 2) non-theistic ways to view the source of morality. We furthermore discuss country-specific findings, such as the importance of ‘conscience’ for Turkish and Czech participants and ‘cultural Christianity’ in the Danish sample. Altogether, the results support research indicating that a lack of belief in God does not entail moral relativism and question views on non-theists primarily seeing morality as self-constructed. Instead, our findings point towards a more prominent role of social interaction and ‘social contract’ in non-theistic views about right and wrong. We suggest that prominent ways of measurement in moral psychology may currently engulf the diversity of non-theistic moral outlooks and communal moralities in particular. To our knowledge, the study provides the first data-driven examination of non-theists’ views on right and wrong in different cultures.",

          "abstract": "Purpose of Review: This commentary summarizes how the intense and distinctive subjective effects of psychedelics complicate tests of the efficacy and mechanisms of action (MOAs) of psychedelic-assisted treatments (PATs) for mental-health conditions. Specifically, we discuss a) how estimates of PAT efficacy are confounded under functional unblinding and b) uncertainty surrounding whether subjective or neurobiological effects are causal therapeutic MOAs of PATs. We then review methodological solutions to address these challenges.\n\nRecent Findings: Several novel methodologies have been discussed in the literature. For testing PAT efficacy under functional unblinding, potential solutions include improved active placebo conditions, expectancy-focused recruitment and consent procedures, better measurement of expectancies and blinding, and more rigorous statistical modeling. For testing whether subjective effects are causal MOAs in PATs, strategies that disentangle the subjective and neurobiological effects of psychedelics are needed. Potential methods include administering psychedelics under general anesthesia, developing non-psychoactive psychedelic analogues, leveraging Mendelian randomization, and studying psychedelic microdosing. Participant safety and ethical considerations are critical for many of these strategies. Ultimately, combining multiple innovative methods may offer the most robust insights. \n\nSummary: Future empirical efforts to develop these strategies will be crucial for advancing our limited understanding of whether and how PATs achieve clinical benefits in psychiatry.",

          "authors": "C. Huang; Tobias Egner",
          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

          "abstract": "Experimenter demand effects occur when participants alter their behavior to align with perceived study hypotheses, threatening internal validity. Concern about demand effects is pervasive in psychology. Experimenter demand may be especially acute in studies relying on experienced participants recruited online (e.g., via Prolific), who may readily guess hypotheses, or using common paradigms (e.g., vignette studies and interventions) where study goals are transparent. We conducted three preregistered experiments (N = 2,254) examining whether explicit demand cues influence online participants’ behavior across three paradigms commonly used in psychology: a dictator game, replicating prior work on demand effects (Experiment 1); a moral dilemma vignette (Experiment 2); and an intervention on group attitudes (Experiment 3). We randomly assigned participants on Prolific to receive information about the study’s hypothesis or to a no-information control. As expected, we find that receiving such information significantly shifts participants’ beliefs about the study’s hypothesis, creating an experimenter demand. Yet we find no evidence that learning any study’s hypothesis alters participants’ behavior, judgments, or attitudes, suggesting that demand effects may be elusive in online samples. These findings offer important insights for the design and interpretation of modern psychology experiments.",

          "abstract": "For a series of indicators used to assess psychosocial constructs, we propose reporting new types of correlation matrices to gain greater insight into the relation of the indicators with one another. What we define as the observed residual correlation(ORC) matrix can give insight as to whether, when a given indicator is above the indicator-average scores across all indicators for that individual, what other indicators might be anticipated to be above that individual’s average score as well. What we define as the relative excess correlation(REC) matrix, when reported, can give insight,for each pair of indicators, whether the strength of that particular correlation is above or below what might have been anticipated based on the correlation of each of those two indicators with all of the others.The ORC and REC matrices will, generally,have numerous negative entries even if all of the raw correlations between each pair of indicators are positive. We discuss the relation between these correlation matrices,their analogues for covariances, along with the interpretation of the correlations they reportand the insights they can provide in understanding the relation of indicators with one another.The analogue of the REC matrix for covariances has the attractive property that its entries have an expected value of zero under a classical test theory model. The positive deviations of the REC matrix entries from zero help identify clusters of indicators that are more strongly related toone another, providing insights somewhat analogous tofactor analysis, but without the need for rotations or decisions concerning the number of factors.",

          "abstract": "Individual learners often show a tendency to engage in self-reinforcing avoidance, a pattern referred to as a learning trap.  Across five experiments, we investigated the extent to which previously trapped learners can escape via social observational learning. While social observational learning did help a significant number of trapped learners escape, the majority of trapped learners remained trapped even after observing a partner demonstrate an optimal decision rule. Across several follow-up experiments, we unpack possible factors which limited the effectiveness of social observational learning. Overall, the results suggest that social decision rule inference (inferring a partner's decision rule from observed choices) was a key bottleneck for observational learning. Simulations show that these results were unanticipated by a leading model of social reward learning, and highlight a central role for inference in social learning.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

Across two exploratory studies (N = 5,551), we examine engagement with the arts and their connection with primals. In Study 1, across three samples, we explored correlational relationships between primals and attitudes toward the arts and arts engagement behavior, finding that key primal world beliefs were consistently linked with the arts items. In Study 2, we conducted a five-week long visual art intervention experiment to examine potential changes in primals based on psychoeducational priming for certain methods of engaging with the art (i.e., focusing on art technique, social connections, or perspective taking). Although the experimental conditions did not differentially change primals, Good world belief increased and Hierarchical decreased. Further, key individual differences (i.e., openness to experience, aesthetic appreciation) predicted who was more likely to exhibit changes in primals following an art intervention. These studies provide initial evidence of the relevance of the arts in the study of primal world beliefs and provide suggestions for future work on this topic, including practical ways for changing primal world beliefs via arts engagement.",

However, when successfully resolved, it can also stimulate cognitive flexibility and adaptation. This raises a question: Can cognitive conflict positively influence subsequent cognitive processes and human behaviour, or is it inherently deleterious? We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

We examined this claim by comparing the acceptability of clitic doubling in three different speaker groups: monolingual and heritage speakers of European Spanish, and Rioplatense Spanish monolinguals. Accusative clitic doubling is grammaticalized in Rioplatense but not in European Spanish, consistent with Rioplatense Spanish being a more diachronically innovative variety. If heritage speakers mirror diachronic change, they may perform more similarly to Rioplatense than European monolinguals. The results of an acceptability judgement task showed that heritage speakers had robust knowledge of clitics but did not show evidence of progressive behavior with accusative clitic doubling. We propose that grammatical innovation may crucially depend on the demographic characteristics of heritage speakers, and on the grammatical properties of the phenomenon tested.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Posting results to clinical trial registers is encouraged and even mandatory for certain trials. This study assessed the feasibility of using structured results data from ClinicalTrials.gov for meta-analyses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using two exemplary approaches. \n\nMethods: In study one, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for studies employing CBT for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and extracted posted results. We evaluated whether the data were sufficient for running a meta-analysis. In study two, we selected a published meta-analysis on digital interventions for depression, extracted all registrations of the primary sources, and assessed if the meta-analysis could be reproduced using posted results.\n\nResults: For study one, we identified 179 completed studies on CBT for MDD from ClinicalTrials.gov. 16 of 179 studies had posted results and 15 had reported depression outcomes, using various psychological scales, such as the BDI-II. This low number of posted results and the heterogeneity of reported scales made running a meta-analysis infeasible. In study two, using 83 primary sources of a published meta-analysis, we obtained 59 registrations. Only three studies had  posted results, all to ClinicalTrials.gov. Again, this made running or reproducing the meta-analysis infeasible.\n\nConclusion: The potential for clinical trial registries to support meta-analyses is substantial, yet few studies on psychotherapy post their results. Core results of clinical trials should be openly available in a timely manner and in a structured format. Currently, it seems that the posting of results data is so uncommon that running meta-analyses using structured results data from trial registries is practically impossible.",

          "abstract": "Although fasting—abstaining from food for several hours to days—is generally considered safe and potentially beneficial for long-term health, concerns persist about its acute effects on cognitive function. Given the importance of sustaining adequate levels of cognitive performance for professional and personal activities, this potential side effect warrants careful examination. Here, we synthesize evidence from experimental studies comparing cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults using standardized psychological tasks. Analyzing 222 effect sizes across 3,484 participants (median fasting duration: 12 hours), our hierarchical random-effects model revealed no meaningful difference between fasted and satiated participants (g = 0.02, 95% CrI = [-0.05, 0.10]), with low between-study heterogeneity (τ = 0.17). Notably, we observed modest reductions in cognitive performance for longer fasting intervals, and for younger (vs. older) participants during fasts. Differences across cognitive domains (e.g., attention and inhibitory control) were negligible. These findings suggest that cognitive performance remains remarkably stable during short-term fasting, supporting the feasibility of fasting practices while highlighting nuanced considerations for implementation in health interventions.",

While previous research has examined family characteristics from either the patient’s or relative’s perspective, this study systematically compares patient-family dyads using genogram analysis and attributional bias assessment. We investigated the relationship between symptom severity, attributional biases, and perceptions of emotional relationships and risk behaviors (ERRB) from both perspectives. Six female patients with BPD receiving outpatient treatment in Brazil and six family members participated. Data were collected remotely and included a BPD symptom measure, an attributional bias task, and semi-structured interviews for genogram construction exploring family ERRB. Patients showed higher intentionality scores (p = 0.0357) and more reports of physical abuse (p = 0.0235), whereas family members reported more distant/poor relationships (p = 0.0198). Categorical symptom severity correlated with suspected alcohol and drug use (p = 0.0117), and personalization bias predicted continuous symptom severity (β = 0.16, p = 0.0283). Qualitative analysis identified significant relationships within each dyad and the family members involved. These findings highlight how attributional biases and ERRB shape BPD symptoms and suggest that integrating family narratives with cognitive assessments enriches clinical understanding of underlying mechanisms.",

Behavioral science, and environmental psychology in particular, is thus well positioned to contribute knowledge to guide impactful climate action.

Formalizing theories (i.e. expressing them in the precise language of mathematics or computer code) offers many benefits to the field: it increases conceptual clarity; advances cumulative science; allows integration with other disciplines; and guides future research. Theory formalization is especially important to give substance to thinking about complex systems, where it can help evaluate the effects of candidate interventions.

We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

Most research has been conducted in contexts with clear societal and heritage languages, leaving open questions about language mixing in environments with two societal languages. Montreal provides a unique opportunity to examine this question, as both French and English hold societal status, while many families also maintain heritage languages. Using archival data from 398 bilingual children (7–34 months), we looked at French-English bilinguals (representing societal bilingualism) and heritage-language bilinguals within the same sociolinguistic environment. We assessed the prevalence, predictors, and motivations of parental language mixing, and its relationship with vocabulary development. Results revealed that mixing was less frequent among French-English bilinguals compared to heritage-language bilinguals in the same city. The direction of mixing differed between groups: French-English bilinguals mixed based on language dominance, while heritage-language bilinguals mixed based on societal language status. Primary motivations included uncertainty about word meanings, lack of suitable translations, and teaching new words. Mixing showed minimal associations with vocabulary size across participants. These findings suggest that parental mixing practices reflect adaptive strategies that vary by sociolinguistic context rather than detrimental influences on early language acquisition.",

We conducted a pilot parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial.\nSetting. Data were collected at the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands (March to November 2023).\nParticipants. We included participants aged 18-30, with good English proficiency, owning smartphones, using cannabis flower at least weekly, and wanting help to stop or diminish use. Current treatment for or diagnosis of a substance use or psychotic disorder were exclusion criteria. We recruited through flyers, social media, peer-to-peer recruitment, and the University of Amsterdam lab. We used block randomization stratified by gender; participants were blind to condition.\nIntervention. Both groups received TAU, additionally, the experimental group received EMA and personalized feedback (TAU+).\nMeasurements. Main outcomes were self-reported cannabis use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) DSM-5 symptoms. Secondary outcomes were mental health variables. Predictors were time, condition, and their interaction. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with TAU+ participants and practitioners giving the intervention and analyzed with thematic analysis.\nFindings. 90 participants were screened, 76 were randomized, 13 per group were included (target sample size), other randomized participants either declined participation/had to be excluded or were in the waiting list. Two experimental and one control participants dropped out (23 participants included in the analyses). Average cannabis grams smoked per day, days smoking cannabis, and CUD symptoms decreased in both groups (p &lt; .001). However, only TAU+ participants maintained the change for the three main outcome measures at three-months follow-up (p = .038, .035, .056 respectively). Both interventions diminished depression, stress, and negative emotions. No adverse events occurred. Participants reported high perceived usefulness, ease of use and motivation regarding the personalized feedback, but some difficulties and negative emotions in answering EMA. Practitioners’ interview results suggested the need to simplify the tool for practitioners and give more training on communicating feedback. \nConclusions. Adding personalized EMA and feedback to TAU seems feasible and may reduce relapse rates in problematic cannabis use compared to TAU alone. A larger trial is needed to support these results.",

Despite this growing interest, there is little guidance on how to most effectively develop and use computational models in psychological research. Other scientific disciplines, such as ecology and chemistry, have used computational modeling extensively for decades and may offer valuable insights from which psychologists can learn. This scoping review synthesizes methodological steps used in developing and evaluating computational models across disciplines, spanning physical and biopsychosocial phenomena. We identified 53 computational modeling roadmaps and conducted a narrative synthesis with frequency analyses. The narrative synthesis is organized according to three research questions: i) what is the general purpose of computational modeling?; ii) what are the proposed modeling steps?; iii) how should researchers move through the modeling steps? For each of these research questions, we also examined whether roadmaps aimed at modeling physical phenomena differ from those that aim at modeling biopsychosocial phenomena. Our narrative synthesis identifies critical gaps in the existing modeling roadmaps and offers a foundation for developing more comprehensive how-to guides for psychologists seeking to integrate computational modeling into their research.",

Understanding how these categorical representations develop is fundamental to cognitive science. However, capturing the structure of human conceptual knowledge is a challenging experimental task. The most prominent approach, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), usually requires participants to produce many similarity judgments, leading to long experiments. Moreover, the representations found by MDS are limited to the fixed set of experimental stimuli and have to be reconstructed for every new item. In contrast, we present a more flexible machine-learning method that can generalize to novel stimuli. This method uses a child-friendly task that allows researchers to uncover the development of categories with fewer participant judgments. We evaluate our approach on simulated data and find that it can accurately reveal representations even when trained on data generated by groups that categorize differently. We then analyze data from the World Color Survey and find that we can recover language-specific color organization when aggregating languages that only share the same number of basic color terms. Finally, we use the method in a developmental experiment and find age-dependent differences in how complex fruit stimuli are organized. These differences were consistent with participants' reasoning and additional experimental measures. Our results suggest that our approach is applicable in psychological tasks and opens the possibility of examining children's developing psychological spaces in new detail.",

Issues such as cultural variability and dynamic changes in mental health over time further complicate the task of constructing a reliable organization of psychopathology. \n\nGiven the shortcomings of traditional classification systems like the ICD and DSM, the field has recently witnessed the emergence of alternative approaches to classification, such as the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP; Kotov et al., 2017). The goal of this chapter is to briefly review important features of a useful nosology, describe the origin and structure of HiTOP, and discuss its implications for clinical practice, research endeavours, and the broader understanding of mental health within the context of an ever-evolving scientific landscape. Additionally, we will address some of the major criticisms of the quantitative approach to classification represented by HiTOP and describe ongoing efforts to address them.",

          "abstract": "Brain regions differ in the intrinsic timescales over which they integrate, shaping the information they encode; and these differences change with development. Here we used EEG to investigate how intrinsic timescales develop from infancy to toddlerhood and how they compare to adults. A recent rs-fMRI study found sleeping neonates had longer timescales than awake adults. However, fMRI is affected by hemodynamics, has limited temporal resolution, and timescales may be affected by sleep. Therefore, EEG was used to measure intrinsic timescales in infants longitudinally from 6 to 16-months-old (exploratory cohort, N=45; validation cohort, N=45) and adults (N=10). Infants were awake and engaged in visual stimulation, and adults were recorded under comparable (vs. different) conditions. Six-month-olds’ timescales were longer than those of adults in comparable conditions, and they shortened from 6 to 16-months-old. Finally, in younger infants, brain timescales correlated to alpha rhythm self-predictability. Longer intrinsic timescales early in infancy, a finding which generalises across fMRI and EEG, might act as an inductive bias favouring the learning of holistic abstract representations. Delineating the mechanisms underlying brain processing timescales in infants is a crucial step towards understanding the neural mechanisms which could allow infants to extract and learn patterns from the environment.",

          "abstract": "Western-centered (primarily American-centered) samples have long faced criticism, yet limited progress has been made to address this issue. The present research validates data from an Eastern culture—China—offering a promising solution. We conducted 11 preregistered studies with 18,256 Chinese and American online participants, examining well-established phenomena across various social science disciplines. The findings provide strong evidence that Chinese online platforms offer geographically and demographically diverse samples from across China. These participants are highly attentive and produce valid data. Additionally, we find tentative evidence that language is a surmountable barrier for Western researchers, as translation variations had little impact on Chinese participants’ responses in our tests. Finally, we share practical insights on using Chinese online platforms for data collection. We hope this paper encourages researchers to embrace diverse samples by trying them in their own research and appreciating it in the research of others.\n\nThis preprint is also available on SSRN (https://ssrn.com/abstract=5488129).

          "abstract": "Devraj et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02448-2, 2024) argued that findings which suggest that memories for items become less accessible over time conflict with categorisation findings where exemplar performance improves across training. To reconcile this, they highlighted that under real-world conditions items tend to reappear less frequently over time, thus preferentially maintaining new items can improve performance. Typical categorisation experiments instead distribute exemplars uniformly across trials. Instead, under a power-law stimulus distribution Devraj et al. showed worsening fit for exemplar classification models across trials. They used this as evidence that forgetting behaviour adapted to task demands, reducing exemplar were accessibility and encouraging prototype use for classification decisions. By re-analysing the same data, we argue instead that this pattern can be produced with exemplar-forgetting in both conditions. By systematically increasing in the delays across which stimuli were tested, their Experimental condition exaggerated the effects of forgetting on performance in later trials compared to the Control condition. This resulted in a reversal of performance growth across trials – instead leading to a steady decline in performance. As exemplar model-fit advantage is expected to vary with performance, we suggest that trends in this advantage are not diagnostic of a shift in classification strategy. We found that a forgetting-function improved exemplar model fit to Devraj et al.’s data, and under reasonable parameters could predict the observed patterns of performance and model-fit a-priori. Compared with a strategy-shifting mixture model, exemplar-forgetting provided equivalent fits despite being more theoretically parsimonious. We suggest power-law memory decay does not produce a tension between categorisation and memory findings, as increased forgetting is found across longer retention intervals whereas the delay between exemplar learning and classification remains constant across typical categorisation experiments.",

          "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into school psychology is evolving rapidly, presenting both opportunities and challenges. AI has the potential to enhance educational and mental health services by facilitating data-driven decision-making, streamlining administrative tasks, and offering personalized interventions for students. However, biases inherent in AI systems—reflecting the prejudices of developers and historical data—pose significant risks of exacerbating systemic inequalities. This paper examines AI’s historical context, current applications in education, and specific uses within school psychology. It also discusses the socio-political factors contributing to algorithmic biases, data privacy concerns, and language/cultural inequities in AI systems. Recommendations are offered to mitigate AI biases, emphasizing the importance of diverse representation in AI development, comprehensive policy formation, transparency, and community involvement. Addressing these concerns is crucial for ensuring that AI contributes equitably to student success.",

          "authors": "Wenyue Gao; Yoko Nagai; Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "Aphantasia (the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery) has traditionally been studied as a congenital or neurological condition. However, historical and clinical reports also implicate affective and stress-related factors in the onset of imagery loss, which are themselves associated with disrupted interoception and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. To investigate these links, we surveyed individuals with self-identified acquired aphantasia (N = 59) using structured questions and validated questionnaires assessing early adversity (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), autonomic reactivity (Body Perception Questionnaire–Short Form; Atrial Fibrillation Symptoms Questionnaire), and neurodevelopmental traits (AQ-10, ASRS-6). 62% of participants reported psychological triggers, 41% cited neurological or physiological events, and 30% identified pharmacological factors. Notably, nearly half of the participants described a combination of these influences, with psychological factors frequently co-occurring with medication use or physical events, suggesting that acquired aphantasia may often arise from a multifactorial interplay rather than a single isolated cause. Compared to typical imagers, individuals with acquired aphantasia reported significantly higher levels of childhood trauma and increased supra-diaphragmatic autonomic reactivity. People with acquired aphantasia also showed significantly elevated scores on measures of ADHD (especially inattention) and autistic traits. These findings suggest that acquired aphantasia may not only follow neurological injury but can also emerge in the context of affective conditions shaped by early adversity and neurodevelopmental vulnerability. Affective disturbances may contribute to imagery loss by altering the subjective experience of autonomic signals and disrupting the integration of bodily, emotional, and cognitive information required to generate vivid mental representations. In conclusion, these results support an affective-autonomic pathway to acquired aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Purpose of Review: This commentary summarizes how the intense and distinctive subjective effects of psychedelics complicate tests of the efficacy and mechanisms of action (MOAs) of psychedelic-assisted treatments (PATs) for mental-health conditions. Specifically, we discuss a) how estimates of PAT efficacy are confounded under functional unblinding and b) uncertainty surrounding whether subjective or neurobiological effects are causal therapeutic MOAs of PATs. We then review methodological solutions to address these challenges.\n\nRecent Findings: Several novel methodologies have been discussed in the literature. For testing PAT efficacy under functional unblinding, potential solutions include improved active placebo conditions, expectancy-focused recruitment and consent procedures, better measurement of expectancies and blinding, and more rigorous statistical modeling. For testing whether subjective effects are causal MOAs in PATs, strategies that disentangle the subjective and neurobiological effects of psychedelics are needed. Potential methods include administering psychedelics under general anesthesia, developing non-psychoactive psychedelic analogues, leveraging Mendelian randomization, and studying psychedelic microdosing. Participant safety and ethical considerations are critical for many of these strategies. Ultimately, combining multiple innovative methods may offer the most robust insights. \n\nSummary: Future empirical efforts to develop these strategies will be crucial for advancing our limited understanding of whether and how PATs achieve clinical benefits in psychiatry.",

          "authors": "Maggie Toplak; Adam Burnett; Peter Bieling",
          "abstract": "Research training has been an integral part of training requirements for the professional practice of psychology since the original scientist-practitioner Boulder model.  The field of psychology can attribute its productivity and progress to the systematic empirical study of human behaviour. This unique feature of our discipline ensures that the professional practice of psychology is based on a solid foundation. However, since its inception, the professional practice of psychology has been compelled to manage the dialectical struggle between advancing science and training clinicians. There is also what has come be called the Two Hat Problem, whereby research and clinical training have never been fully integrated in training for professional practice, neither in the original conceptualization of the Boulder model nor in subsequent competency-based models. For example, the conceptual separation of foundational and functional domains of competency-based models may have inadvertently further separated research from clinical training. In addition, several practical considerations have also emerged, such as the growing demands of training programs, absence of evidence showing that research training transfers to clinical practice and concerns regarding shortages in practitioners to meet mental health demands in our society. Given these issues, we need to sharpen our definition of what kinds of scientific and research training best support the professional practice of psychology. This paper proposes several recommendations and a working taxonomy of the types of concepts and illustrative empirical studies that integrate research and scientific thinking with clinical competencies for professional practice. If training integrates research and scientific thinking, it will reveal a unifying strategy to define competencies and coherence in the profession. Such integration will require some new thinking for training programs, but it will preserve our profession’s distinction from other mental health care professions, ones that do not have research and scientific thinking built into the core of their training.",

While prior research established the model using a large sample (N = 4,000) and a long assessment (27 items), practical applications require guidance on whether DFSM can be reliably used with fewer students and shorter assessments. A fully crossed Monte Carlo simulation varying sample sizes (N = 250, 500, 1,000, 4,000) and assessment lengths (J = 9, 18, 27) was conducted where we evaluated item parameter, facet structure, and student latent profile recovery. Results showed that assessment length most strongly influenced item parameter recovery, with at least 18 items necessary to obtain unbiased estimates even for small samples. In contrast, facet sparsity and profile recovery were more sensitive to sample size, requiring at least 500 students for accurate estimation. We provide recommendations for assessment developers and educators on using DFSM in applied contexts.",

Experimental findings indicate that meaning increased attention (Studies 1 &amp; 3), and attention increased meaning, but only when meaning could be found in a stimulus (Studies 2a, 2b &amp; 3). An experience-sampling study further reveals a positive meaning–attention association at dispositional, situational, and cross-levels (Study 4). Across varied daily activities, participants reported greater meaning when they paid more attention. These studies also explored the interplay of meaning and attention with boredom, negative emotions, and subjective well-being. Together, our results suggest that paying attention during everyday activities can, in some instances, enhance the experience of meaning.",

Adults based in China (N = 161) and the UK (N = 155) completed questionnaires assessing emotion beliefs and regulation. Chinese participants reported stronger beliefs in the controllability, usefulness, and acceptability beliefs of negative emotions and greater overall use of emotion regulation strategies than British participants. Across both cultures, controllability belief predicted the use of both antecedent- and response-focused strategies. Usefulness beliefs predicted greater situation modification and acceptability predicted increased suppression. Controllability beliefs also mediated cultural differences in the use of all strategies, while usefulness and acceptability beliefs mediated cultural differences in suppression. These effects remained significant even after controlling for self-construals. Both acceptability and controllability beliefs were stronger negative predictors of suppression among British than among Chinese. Our findings suggest that selection of emotion regulation strategies depends on emotion beliefs. They also highlight the role of culturally influenced emotion beliefs in shaping emotion regulation beyond self-construals.",

          "abstract": "The ability to process facial displays of emotion is a crucial aspect of everyday interpersonal interactions, yet the use of emotions as communicative tools for situational context information remains underexplored. This study, conducted in 2024, addresses this gap by using a novel dynamic display of targets’ reactions to a poker game to assess perceivers ' ability to detect contextual information from facial displays of emotion. We categorised targets’ dynamic facial displays of emotional reactions to game outcomes using MorphCast Emotion AI HTML5 SDK, an online machine-learning tool that detects emotions in recorded videos. Additionally, we investigated the role of perceivers ' covert facial mimicry during the categorisation task using facial electromyography (fEMG). Results indicate that while perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy in guessing targets’ outcomes (win, loss,or draw) from facial displays of emotion, they struggled to distinguish between losses and draws. Further, although emotions (positive vs. negative)appear to act as cues for outcome detection, fEMG data reveal no significant pattern of activation linked to outcome accuracy. These findings highlight facial display of emotion as a communicative tool for contextual information and the role of experience, societal and cultural norms in constructing subjective yet socially expected reactions across individuals. Most participants identified as white or Asian, limiting the sample variability and generalisability, particularly due to the underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minority participants. Future research should include a more diverse sample to understand the cultural influences on expression and interpretation of facial displays of emotion.",

Participants were recruited from Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform (N = 164), and completed four cognitive ability tasks, a narrative interview with an ICA, and a battery of survey measures. Our findings indicate that older adults can engage meaningfully with an ICA and provide enough textual cues to assess personality on par with previous studies on younger adult samples. These older adults also reported that they enjoyed the interaction and found it easy to use and concentrate throughout the interview. We were able to use the textual responses from the narrative interview to assess cognitive ability to a limited extent, primarily capturing aspects of verbal fluency; however, correlations of narrative-based cognitive ability scores with self-reported cognitive functioning and health outcomes were weak. Overall, these results suggest that ICA systems are not only feasible but also engaging and easy for older adults to use. This presents a promising first step towards the development of automated, scalable tools for cognitive evaluation. We encourage future research to design and validate an ICA system specifically for cognitive evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Prosociality and aggression are fundamental social-emotional behaviors with important implications for well-being. While often considered antagonistic, recent evidence suggests they may also coexist as independent tendencies. Cultural norms may shape how these behaviors interact, yet few studies have directly examined their dynamics across cultural contexts. Building on differences in Eastern collectivistic and Western individualistic information-processing and thinking styles, we proposed an integrated model with four cultural regulatory pathways (Eastern Holistic, Eastern Dialectic, Western Analytic, Western Logistic) and examined prosociality-aggression dynamics at both country and individual levels. Secondary data were analyzed from 121 college students in Taiwan (N = 50, Mage = 21.10; representing a collectivistic culture) and the United States (N = 71, Mage = 20.01; representing an individualistic culture). Prosocial and aggressive tendencies to strangers were measured based on task-based paradigms, and individual cultural orientation were measured by self-reported questionnaires. Results revealed that Taiwanese participants exhibited a uni-dimensional, antagonistic relationship between reactive prosociality and aggression, whereas U.S. participants demonstrated a bi-dimensional pattern in which the two behaviors functioned independently. At the individual level, higher horizontal collectivism predicted a stronger antagonistic dynamic between prosociality and aggression, and especially in reactive subtype. Together, these findings provide support for the Holistic-Analytic information-processing framework, suggesting that collectivistic orientations may integrate prosocial and aggressive tendencies into an antagonistic relationship, while individualistic orientations allow them to coexist independently. This study highlights culture’s critical role in shaping social-emotional behavior across countries and individual levels, paving the way for future research and culturally tailored prevention strategies.",

          "authors": "Nurit Gronau; Conor J. R. Smithson; Isabel Gauthier",
          "abstract": "People differ in their ability to distinguish visually similar items, a domain-general ability known as o (Richler et al., 2019). While o typically involves extracting invariant object properties, we investigated whether it also relates to long-term memory for episodic information extrinsic to object identity, specifically, object location. We further examined whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus meaningfulness, a factor known to enhance long-term memory, by using both high- and low-meaning stimuli. Participants completed a location memory test, a series of visual object-recognition tasks assessing o, and other cognitive covariate measures. Results showed a positive correlation between o and location memory, which was stronger for high-meaning than for low-meaning stimuli. This suggests that semantic content may enhance the link between object recognition and episodic location memory. Importantly, these effects remained after controlling for age, gender, low-level visual perception, working memory, and general intelligence. Our findings indicate that domain-general object recognition ability contributes to episodic memory by supporting the binding of meaningful objects to their spatial context. This challenges traditional cognitive boundaries by integrating current knowledge about individual differences in perception and memory, with semantic meaning acting as a significant moderator.",

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix, modeled within a linear dynamical system, has psychologically interpretable entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Critically, these entries can be distilled into summary features that represent synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

However, there is no consensus on precisely how these constructs relate, with different researchers adopting substantially different views. Here, we sought to clarify this relationship by providing a critical test of two leading hypotheses: that affective valence tracks value, and that affective valence tracks value updates (i.e., changes in value). To accomplish this goal, we assessed the determinants of valence in a context where these hypotheses make clear and dissociable predictions – classical conditioning. Across three studies, we found consistent evidence that affective valence tracks value, rather than value updates. Additionally, we show that more optimistic expectations can lead to more positive affective responses to actual outcomes. Altogether, our results clarify the relationship between value and affective valence, and thus inform the broad range of psychological research that depends on an understanding of the connection between these constructs.",

          "abstract": "The healthcare sector, especially dentistry, contributes significantly to the environmental crisis. The behaviors and attitudes of dentists regarding sustainability practices may differ markedly; we applied the Stated and Revealed Preferences framework to compare these. Our aim was to assess a mixed method innovation, encompassing material use, digital technologies, and preventive measures in dentistry. We recruited 16 dentists based on two quotas: sex and the funding source of the clinic. Dentists’ behaviors were recorded through the structured observation of four patient sessions, while their attitudes were examined via structured interviews exploring barriers to more sustainable practices. Observation results were visualized for each dentist, depicting sustainable and unsustainable choices per session. Barriers were visualized in network graphs employing the Qualitative Network Approach. Observational data helped pinpoint (un)sustainable practices across cases and highlighted individuals whose practices diverged from the group. Qualitative networks helped identify frequent and rare associations between barriers, their types, directionality, along with themes in interview narratives. Triangulating the two data sources provided insight into case idiosyncrasies, prevalent rationales in decision-making, and apparent contradictions between intra-case behavior and attitudes. These, in turn, aided in refining data collection instruments and guiding further analyses. This novel method advances research by examining sustainable behavior on the level of individual choices, mapping the relationships between barriers, and triangulating data sources bidirectionally, thus offering the potential to inform targeted interventions that enhance sustainable practices in dentistry.",

          "abstract": "Antisemitism, a persistent form of cultural prejudice, is increasingly manifesting in subtle and modernized forms within contemporary society. This study examined how cultural representations of Jews are encoded in large language models (LLMs), which absorb societal discourse through training on vast corpora of human-generated text. To investigate these representations, we developed an indirect methodology: generating character biographies using Jewish and non-Jewish names, removing overt identity markers, and prompting the LLM to evaluate a range of psychological and sociocultural traits. Characters associated with Jewish (vs. non-Jewish) names were consistently rated as more competent, privileged, dominant, self-controlled, future-oriented, hierarchical, and obsessive—and as less likable and less collectivistic. When these trait profiles were mapped onto fictional characters, they aligned with archetypes historically associated with antisemitic tropes. These findings demonstrate how latent stereotypes can persist in AI systems despite explicit bias mitigation, highlighting the adaptability of prejudice and the structural embedding of cultural archetypes in contemporary technologies.",

          "abstract": "Musicians convey different timing ‘feels’ in groove-based performance by manipulating onset asynchrony between instruments (playing ahead/on/behind the beat) and the durational ratio of metrical subdivisions (non-isochrony, or ‘swing’). The present study asked whether listeners perceive such fine-grained timing deviations, which place demands on perceptual grouping, attentional allocation, and temporal prediction, in complex, multi-instrumental groove contexts. We measured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony and swing in a naturalistic funk pattern featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with uniform onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. These have been shown to index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological complement to behavioral measures of microrhythm. Thresholds varied systematically by instrument: for asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to detect than early ones (≈23ms).  Musical training generally conferred lower thresholds. We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further indicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm.  The findings expand our understanding of perceptual boundaries for microrhythmic expression in multi-layered groove music and highlight how both acoustic and experiential factors shape sensitivity to timing nuances.",

The present study determines whether dog personality and behavioral traits can be used to predict herding performance. We began by replicating Wilson and colleagues (2022), who found that personality traits predict herding ability in Australian kelpies. We asked American owners of herding dogs to complete an online survey about their dog’s (n = 335) personality traits, behavioral traits, and herding ability. We grouped related personality traits together in a principal components analysis to create dog personality profiles. Next, we determined whether any dog personality profiles predicted herding ability. We partially replicate Wilson et al.’s (2022) findings, with similar personality profiles predicting herding ability. We then expanded on the previous study by creating a new set of profiles that also included behavioral traits. We found that both personality and behavioral traits predicted herding ability. We propose that herding dog handlers and breeders should focus on key personality and behavioral traits when making decisions about herding dog career paths and training efforts.",

          "abstract": "The integration of auditory and visual cues supports efficient speech and emotion perception, yet little is known about how emotional salience interacts with temporal congruency during audiovisual binding. In this study, 125 participants completed a synchrony judgment task using dynamic face–voice pairs varying in emotion (angry, happy, neutral), congruency, and temporal alignment. Temporal binding windows (TBWs), or the temporal offsets within which a stimulus pair is perceived as perceptually bound, were calculated for each condition. TBWs were significantly wider for emotionally salient (angry, happy) compared to neutral congruent pairs, indicating greater tolerance for temporal asynchrony in the presence of emotion. Moreover, across multiple analytic approaches, emotionally congruent pairs yielded narrower TBWs than incongruent pairs, demonstrating that emotional congruence influences low-level perceptual aspects of multisensory integration. These results suggest that emotion, as a higher-order cue to bind, interacts with low-level temporal information to bias causal inference toward integration. Our findings extend models of multisensory integration by highlighting the interaction of emotion and low-level stimulus properties as a dimension shaping audiovisual binding. This work has implications for understanding social communication and may provide insight into populations with known difficulties in both emotion perception and multisensory integration.",

Timeless books—popular well after publication—are a rare occurrence, standing the test of time and distinguishing themselves from the millions of books published each year. Is it possible to predict which books will be timeless, versus merely best-selling, based on word usage alone? We built two corpora of books, published between 1909 and 1923: (1) those that were best-selling (i.e., popular upon publication), and (2) those that have become timeless (i.e., popular a century later). Machine learning models were then trained to predict whether a novel was timeless or merely best-selling, based on mostly word-level psycholinguistic features. Our models were able to achieve approximately 70% classification accuracy and identified several key features of timeless books that distinguished them from those merely popular upon publication (e.g., fewer social words; more plural pronouns and words per sentence).",

Higher levels of religious identification, involvement, and coping, altruistic behavior, social support, optimism, and mindfulness, as well as lower levels of pessimism, were found in the group(s) with the highest PTG.

I describe the core strengths of CDA for personality development research, including its capacity to test lifespan theories and detect nuanced patterns of change, to address key limitations of traditional meta-analysis, to systematically disentangle substantive variability from artifactual variability, and to distinguish robust null findings from false negatives. I also highlight key challenges, such as false consensus, data availability, and preregistration constraints, and offer recommendations for addressing them. Finally, I showcase the broader impact of CDA for the personality development field, emphasizing its potential to inspire future research, uncover context-specific patterns, and promote more collaborative, open, and cumulative science.",

This randomized-controlled experiment was an advanced followup-study of a Nextdoor-study (Katsaros et al., 2023) conducted a year before, showing mostly null effects of the intervention. In this study, the results showed a significant reduction in two target outcomes - views of offensive posts and comments - in the treatment group compared to the control group.

No one path into extremism has been identified in the literature, with no specific profile of those who engage in radicalisation, extremism and/or terrorism existing. The GLM allows for a focus on individuality and identity, accounting for the variation of individual’s found to hold extremist views.

          "abstract": "With the recent expansion of social networking platforms, we are increasingly presented with opportunities to evaluate others by reading their profiles without direct interaction. Uncertainty reduction theory (URT) posits that as an individual’s uncertainty diminishes, they are evaluated as more attractive. While past studies have predominantly examined the relationship between uncertainty and attraction by focusing on the amount of accessible information, little attention has been paid to qualitative aspects of information (i.e., how information is described). In light of this, the present study investigates the effect of expression abstractness in profiles on attraction to the target individual. Given that concrete expressions convey richer information than abstract ones, we hypothesized that (1) a person described in more (positive) concrete terms would be perceived as more attractive, and (2) the level of uncertainty would mediate this effect. To test these hypotheses, we conducted an online experiment with 1,003 native adult Japanese speakers. Participants were assigned to either a concrete or abstract condition and rated ten target individuals, each described in a profile consisting of five sentences; two of the five sentences were subject to the abstractness manipulation. Consistent with our prediction, the results demonstrated that participants in the concrete condition evaluated target individuals more favorably than those in the abstract condition. In addition, mediation analysis showed that this effect was mediated by attributional confidence (i.e., perceived uncertainty) regarding the target individual. These findings indicate that uncertainty reduction enhances interpersonal attraction even in online unilateral browsing situations, and that manipulating the abstractness of character descriptions can serve as an effective method of altering perceived uncertainty.

Witnessing a broken vase, humans will automatically bring to mind a causal story of what happened. Multiple sources of sensory evidence can support this inference. Seeing the broken pottery tells you something, but hearing the crash tells you even more. In this work, we explore people's inferences about the past from multimodal evidence. We present a physical reasoning paradigm called Plinko. In the prediction task, participants must determine where a ball that is dropped into a box with obstacles will land. A computational model that uses mental simulation in an Intuitive Physics Engine captures participant predictions very well. In the inference task, participants must infer which hole in the box the ball fell from. Across conditions, participants are presented with different combinations of visual and auditory cues, and must combine this information to determine what happened. We develop a sequential sampling model that selectively simulates from promising hypotheses, and demonstrate that this model accurately captures participants' judgments and eye-movements. By coordinating sensory evidence in an underlying causal representation of the physical world, this simulation approach is able to capture complex multimodal inferences that go beyond traditional approaches to multimodal integration.",

We investigated the relationship between symptom severity, attributional biases, and perceptions of emotional relationships and risk behaviors (ERRB) from both perspectives. Six female patients with BPD receiving outpatient treatment in Brazil and six family members participated. Data were collected remotely and included a BPD symptom measure, an attributional bias task, and semi-structured interviews for genogram construction exploring family ERRB. Patients showed higher intentionality scores (p = 0.0357) and more reports of physical abuse (p = 0.0235), whereas family members reported more distant/poor relationships (p = 0.0198). Categorical symptom severity correlated with suspected alcohol and drug use (p = 0.0117), and personalization bias predicted continuous symptom severity (β = 0.16, p = 0.0283). Qualitative analysis identified significant relationships within each dyad and the family members involved. These findings highlight how attributional biases and ERRB shape BPD symptoms and suggest that integrating family narratives with cognitive assessments enriches clinical understanding of underlying mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility—the ability to adapt behavior in response to changing conditions—is widely recognized as a key feature of animal cognition. It is often measured using reversal learning tasks, where individuals must inhibit a previously rewarded response and adopt a new one after contingencies shift. Despite its widespread use, the comparability of these tasks across species remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review of 206 empirical studies (2014–2023) spanning eight major taxonomic groups: invertebrates, fishes, amphibians and reptiles, birds, rodents, other mammals, non-human primates, and humans. For each study, we extracted variables related to taxon coverage, sampling, learning and reversal criteria, cue types, and outcome measures. Analyses included nonparametric tests to assess group-level differences, linear discriminant analyses to explore multivariate structure, and model-based robustness checks. Our findings reveal three fundamental obstacles to reliable cross-species inference. First, research effort is highly imbalanced: birds, rodents, and humans accounted for over half of all study cells, while most animal diversity—especially invertebrates and amphibians and reptiles—remains virtually untested, with less than 1% of described species included per taxon. Second, research is taxonomically siloed: 99% of studies focus on a single group, limiting opportunities for direct comparison. Third, and most critically, methodological standards diverge dramatically across taxa. Humans were consistently held to the strictest learning criteria (median threshold 90%), while birds, invertebrates, and fishes most often used lower thresholds (80–84%). Overtraining was implemented in two-thirds of amphibian and reptile studies but was rare (less than 30%) elsewhere. The number of reversal phases differed more than threefold among groups. Nearly all studies of amphibians, reptiles, fishes, and invertebrates used single-reversal designs, whereas multi-reversal protocols were much more common in humans and non-human primates. Sample sizes—both per cell and per study—, evaluation window lengths, cue types, and outcome metrics also displayed taxon-specific patterns. These systematic differences in experimental design introduce structural asymmetries that complicate cross-taxon comparisons, blurring the line between true cognitive variation and methodological artifacts. Although research to date has advanced our understanding, further progress will depend on greater methodological coordination and broader taxonomic coverage. Emerging large-scale collaborations are beginning to address these gaps, offering a promising path toward a more robust and equitable science of behavioral flexibility.",

          "abstract": "This chapter focuses on multidisciplinary teaching strategies for open qualitative research. It addresses open science values (transparency, reproducibility, and inclusivity), practices (preregistration, replication, data sharing, etc.), and class activities. Teaching qualitative open science is more effectively accomplished when researchers conceptualize scientific processes as expressions of human cognition and various types of labor with the goal of creating usable and reliable documentation for posterity. This chapter covers practices developed within qualitative paradigms (reflexivity, audit trails, negative case analysis, etc.) and offers suggestions for how to lead diverse populations of students through the logic and application of these paradigms. Emphasizing contextual integrity, the chapter explores how to ethically balance openness with participant confidentiality and cultural sensitivity. While this chapter focuses on qualitative perspectives, these perspectives and practices are also relevant and beneficial to those working with quantitative data and methods.",

          "abstract": "In a United States sample of 32 Protestant and Catholic congregations (N = 16,548), we evaluated associations between seven childhood religious and family experiences (e.g., conversations with parents about faith, childhood religious service attendance [RSA]) and five religious and relational outcomes in adulthood (e.g., RSA, conversations with one’s own children about faith). We used multilevel models that incorporated childhood predictors simultaneously, with each model examining one outcome at a time. Better childhood family experiences and more frequent religious engagement were generally associated with greater religious participation in adulthood. Having frequent conversations about faith with one’s parents in childhood showed the strongest associations with adulthood outcomes (e.g., more frequent RSA, faith transmission to one’s own children, more forgivingness), but all childhood factors were associated with at least one adulthood outcome. These findings highlight the potentially lasting and complex role of childhood experiences in shaping subsequent faith and relationships.",

However, little is known about the complexity and referents of recodes or differences between mothers and fathers and how this relates to child language.\nMethod: This study included 15 children with DS (M age in months = 39.67, range = 24–61) and their mothers and fathers. Mother–child and father–child play interactions were recorded in the home.\nResults: We found no differences between mothers’ and fathers’ use of recodes. A moderate positive association existed between child receptive language and total combined recodes from mothers and fathers. A weak positive association was found for expressive language and mothers’ recodes. \nConclusions: Our preliminary findings highlight the need for further research into how mothers and fathers recode their children’s communicative acts in ways that support later language development.

          "abstract": "As the world globalizes, a greater volume of cross-cultural interactions produces more opportunities for cultural transmission across group lines. How do psychological processes shape this transmission of cultural information between groups? We examine how people’s perceptions of other nations shape their willingness to transmit cultural information from individuals in that nation to others within their own nation. Drawing on theories of prestige-based cultural transmission, we tested whether people were more likely to transmit cultural information from individuals whose countries are perceived as internationally influential. We also tested whether this effect was shaped by two theoretically motivated moderators: the domain of information shared by a model (instrumental vs. value-oriented), and perceived competition with the model’s country. Across four studies using correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Studies 2-4) methods, and across samples from both the United States and New Zealand (Study 4), we found consistent evidence that international influence increases transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information across national borders. The role of competition is less consistent, sometimes moderating the effect of influence (Study 1), sometimes independently increasing transmission of instrumental—but not value-oriented—cultural information (Studies 3 &amp; 4), and varying across countries (Study 4). Together, these results suggest that psychological processes may support the transmission of norms from globally influential nations, but that this effect may be critically bounded by the type of cultural information in question, with implications for how cultural norms, practices, and traditions may flow across borders and ultimately shape large-scale cultural change.",

          "abstract": "Optimal stopping problems provide a framework for studying decision-making under uncertainty, balancing the trade-off between information sampling and decision commitment. We investigated deviations from normative strategies in human decision-making and examined the neural mechanisms underlying decision commitment versus sampling using electroencephalography (EEG). Forty participants viewed sequences of beads drawn from fictitious urns and attempted to infer the majority bead colour in each urn, while their EEG activity was recorded. After viewing each bead, participants could choose to sample more by drawing another bead (draw choice) or to stop sampling and infer the contents of the urn (urn choice). A Bayesian ideal observer model and parametrised models were used to predict participant behaviour. Participants undersampled relative to the ideal observer, particularly in the more uncertain condition where the proportion of bead colours was close to chance (60/40 or 0.6), with the model better capturing behaviour in the easier 80/20 (0.8) condition. P300 amplitudes showed larger responses for urn choices and a gradient of increasing amplitude as draws approached commitment. Larger frontal ERP responses were also observed under higher uncertainty (0.6 condition). Beta oscillatory activity was stronger for urn choices in the high uncertainty condition, with fast beta (20–30 Hz) activity driving final commitment to a decision. Beta power was further predicted by model-derived action values. By integrating behavioural, computational, and neurophysiological data, this study advances our understanding of active information sampling versus decision commitment in reward-related probabilistic environments.",

          "abstract": "The Self-Objectification Beliefs and Behaviors Scale (SOBBS) was adapted to the Czech context using multiple independent translations and subsequent cognitive interviews. Data were collected from a non-random online sample of 548 participants, including 72% women and 27% men, aged 18–75 years (M = 25.8, SD = 10.1). The analysis supported the two-factor structure of the scale (i.e., body surveillance and body as self-representation), although the data favored the removal of one item. The SOBBS demonstrated high internal consistency (α = .87, ω = .90 for the total scale; α = .87, ω = .87 for body self-monitoring; and α = .83, ω = .83 for body as a representation of the Self), and correlations with body shame and body self-monitoring scales provided evidence for concurrent validity. Measurement invariance was supported at the level of the parallel model, allowing for gender-based comparisons. The main analysis revealed a statistically significant but small difference in overall self-objectification between women and men (d = 0.22). An exploratory analysis showed a higher body surveillance in women (d = 0.48), with no significant differences in the body as a self-representation dimension. The Czech version of the SOBBS thus represents a valid and reliable instrument for further research on self-objectification in the Czech context. We conclude with suggestions for future research, mainly wording revisions and clarifications for the conceptual placement of body shame within the Objectification Theory (Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997).",

          "authors": "Camila Valenzuela-Moguillansky",
          "abstract": "This article proposes a contemplative research framework—the Multidimensional Approach to Presence (MAP)—for the scientific study of lived experience. Building on micro-phenomenological research, the proposal examines how cultivating presence –inhabiting one’s lived experience as it unfolds– can be integrated methodologically and epistemologically into experiential inquiry. Drawing on studies of pain and bodily awareness, it analyzes three moments in the generation of experiential knowledge: contact with experience, the description of experience, and the analysis of descriptions. From an enactive perspective that conceives experience as dynamic, self-referential, and transformative, the discussion addresses the strengths and limitations of the method, particularly regarding evocation and memory, dimensions of lived experience that exceed declarative language, and the intersubjective character of knowledge generation. MAP places the cultivation of presence at the core of the investigative process and operates on two levels: methodologically, by integrating tools that foster familiarity with bodily experience—such as micro-phenomenological interviewing, somatic practices, and artistic expression—and epistemologically, by contending that investigating experience requires transforming modes of knowing and thereby opening a process of self-transformation. In this way, the article highlights the need to broaden the methodological and epistemological repertoire of cognitive science, paving the way for a science of experience consistent with the very nature of what it seeks to investigate.",

          "authors": "Niyati Kachhiyapatel; Igor Grossmann",
          "abstract": "How can one bring wisdom into STEM education? One popular position holds that wise judgment follows from teaching morals and ethics in STEM. However, wisdom scholars debate the causal role of morality and whether presence of a moral blueprint is a necessary condition for cultivating and expressing wisdom. Some philosophers and education scientists champion this view, whereas social psychologists and cognitive scientists argue that moral features like prosocial behavior are reinforcing factors or outcomes of wise judgment rather than pre-requisites. This debate matters particularly for science and technology, where wisdom-demanding decisions typically involve incommensurable values and radical uncertainty. Here, we evaluate these competing positions through four lines of evidence. First, empirical research shows that heightened moralization aligns with foolish rejection of scientific claims, political polarization, and value extremism. Second, economic scholarship on folk theorems demonstrates that wisdom-related metacognition—perspective-integration, context-sensitivity, and balancing long- and short-term goals—can give rise to prosocial behavior without an apriori moral blueprint. Third, in real life moral values often compete, making metacognition indispensable to balance competing interests for the common good. Fourth, numerous scientific tasks require wise handling of ill-defined challenges, without a clear role of morals for such tasks. We address potential objections about immoral and Machiavellian applications of blueprint-free wisdom accounts. Finally, we explore implications for giftedness: what exceptional wisdom looks like in STEM context, and how to train it in the classroom via self-reflection exercises and exercises that highlight one’s knowledge gaps.",

          "abstract": "The sexuality of older people in long-term residential care remains a taboo topic, often met with uncertainty and prejudice among care staff. Many facilities lack clear guidelines and training, leading to restrictions on residents' sexual self-determination. Professionalization in this area can be improved through targeted education. This study investigates the effects of a profession-specific workshop on handling sexuality in long-term care. Using a pre-post mixed-methods design, 27 nursing staff members were surveyed before and after the workshop with a psychometric questionnaire (BS-SWE). Additionally, qualitative data was gathered through observations and content analysis. Findings show varied responses to the topic: some staff engaged openly, while others found it uncomfortable. Challenges included dealing with assaultive behavior, cultural differences, and ethical concerns. Participants emphasized the need for further training, increased privacy for residents, and better documentation of incidents. Quantitative results revealed a significant increase (p &lt; .001, d = .865) in job-specific self-efficacy expectations, shifting from a lower to an upper average range compared to norm values. Since sexual issues frequently arise in nursing care, systematic preparation and destigmatization are essential for professional practice. Sexual psychology workshops effectively enhance self-efficacy, though ethical issues such as documentation and sexually transmitted diseases require further attention.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual load theory (Forster &amp; Lavie, 2008) is a key framework in visual attention research, demonstrating that under high-load conditions, fully irrelevant distractors are no longer processed and do not disrupt task performance. In our recent work (Manini et al., 2025), we replicated this effect. However, we also found that under high load, the distractor not only failed to impair performance but actually led to faster reaction times (RTs) in distractor-present trials. In the broader attentional capture literature, this reversed effect is typically considered to reflect distractor suppression. However, in the perceptual load task, where the distractor is placed outside the relevant search array, suppression should not logically lead to faster responses.  Furthermore, the faster responses were accompanied by increased error rates, leading us to hypothesize that this reversed effect reflects spatially controlled attentional capture rather than distractor suppression. Specifically, the distractor may alert the attentional system, accelerating responses, while attention moving to its position remains somehow controlled, as the distractor is never the target. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the consistency of this effect across all available open-data resources using the Forster and Lavie (2008) task. We then reanalyzed the same data, incorporating the spatial proximity between target and distractor, observing that trials with the distractor near the target strongly drove the reversed RT effect, while trials with the distractor far from the target led to increased error rates. These findings challenge the idea that high perceptual load prevents attentional capture by irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, they suggest that faster RTs in distractor-present conditions do not necessarily indicate distractor suppression, as commonly assumed in attentional capture research, giving new insight into the interpretation of this reversed effect.",

Since 2018, gender-neutral/sensitive wording has been required in job advertisements (Antidiskriminierungsstelle des Bundes, 2024). The study examines whether gender sensitivity in this context is related to the skills and personality traits of employees and to what extent gender sensitivity is implemented in German-language job advertisements.\nMethod: Following a explorative cross-sectional study with a mixed-methods research design was conducted. The gender sensitivity, diversity competence and personality traits of test persons (N = 44) were correlated and the implementation of the \"TransVisible\" recommendations (2020) for the formulation of 60 job advertisements from a big data dataset from 2024 was analyzed.\nResults: There were correlations between gender sensitivity and diversity competence as well as diversity competence and openness among the respondents who are professionally involved with job advertisements. In addition, the implementation of gender sensitivity in German-language job advertisements could be characterized. For example, there are differences with regard to different professions and federal states. It was also found that there are still considerable deficits in the implementation of gender sensitivity in the German-language job advertisement market.",

We investigated the influence of the connectivity of words in the child’s lexicon (preferential attachment), the child’s environment (preferential acquisition), or between novel and known words (lure of associates) in the development of early phonological and semantic networks, using longitudinal data from 17-to-36-month-old Norwegian children. We compared the extent to which the different scenarios predicted individual children’s lexical\nacquisition whilst also examining the joint influence of form and meaning on vocabulary growth. Our results revealed a ‘rich?get-richer’ pattern whereby semantically well-connected words in children’s existing lexicons best predicted the likelihood of a word entering the lexicon earlier. Phonological connectivity tended to impede word learning, with leveraging effects only in early development when semantic connectivity was low. Our findings imply that words are learned more easily when they\nare similar to many words in meaning, but not, necessarily, in form. Furthermore, relative to previous studies examining the influence of phonological connectivity on word learning, our study highlights the importance of considering the interplay between semantics and phonology and accounting for individual\ndifferences in vocabulary development.",

          "abstract": "Social exclusion has been linked to increased risk for psychotic experiences; however, it remains unclear whether exclusion has a unique impact beyond general negative experiences. Across two studies run between April 2024 and May 2024, we tested whether recalling autobiographical experiences of exclusion leads to greater increases in psychotic experiences compared to recalling other negatively valenced experiences (i.e., sadness) using a within-subjects design and a novel momentary self-report measure. Participants completed the Momentary Assessment of Psychotic Experiences (MAPE) immediately before and after a five-minute recall task, during which they were randomly assigned to recall an experience of exclusion, sadness, inclusion, or a neutral event. Study 1 (N = 810) found that neither the exclusion nor sadness induction increased positive symptoms. Both conditions led to increased negative symptoms but did not differ significantly from each other. Study 2 (N = 836) replicated these findings in an independent sample. Across both studies, inclusion unexpectedly led to a reduction in negative symptoms, including amotivation and anhedonia, and social anhedonia. These findings suggest that exclusion contributes to short-term increases in psychotic experiences that reflect negative symptoms, but its effects are not distinguishable from other negatively valenced life experiences. In contrast, inclusion may have a protective effect, reducing specific negative symptoms. Together, these findings highlight the need to consider both negative and positive life experiences when evaluating social risk and protective factors for psychotic experiences.",

Conversely, the multiple decision-making systems theory posits competing decision-making algorithms that separately identify actions to take. These two theories have increasingly become central to how neuroscientists understand decision-making. However, these theories appear incompatible with each other, at least on the surface. This Perspective addresses how these theories interact with each other and points to unanswered questions about the intricacies of action selection. We find that it is unlikely that a single common currency arbitrates between decision systems, but that some algorithms can be described as containing a common currency mechanism. However, others are unlikely to be compatible with a common currency hypothesis. We also find that computational differences between individual common currency representations may have measurable effects neurophysiologically and behaviorally.",

In a convenience sample of undergraduate students and people with VSS recruited through the Visual Snow Initiative (N = 144), we found the CVSS (1) strongly differentiated people with VSS from healthy controls, (2) demonstrated high internal consistency, and (3) aside from visual static, the degree of night vision impairment, blue field entoptic phenomenon, and afterimages, and tinnitus (in that order) best predicted group membership. Overall, CVSS is a promising PROM that warrants further validation.",

          "abstract": "Moral motivation, the translation of moral judgments into actions, can result from many different processes including deliberate reasoning, emotional responses, and social pressures. Across existing literature, moral motivation is neither concretely defined nor consistently conceptualized, but instead attributed to diverse sources across disciplines. The objectives of this scoping review are to synthesize and examine how moral motivations are defined across the literature, how methodologies are used to study moral motivations, which populations the literature has examined, which cognitive mechanisms and moral domains are implicated in moral motivation, which theoretical frameworks and models are used to interpret findings, and where further research is needed to fill gaps in the current literature. An iterative approach to searching scholarly databases will be conducted using various search terms (e.g. “moral drive*”) in addition to “moral motiv*” to examine moral motivations and related terminologies that may be related or describe the same processes. Studies will be included if moral motivations or related terms are specifically addressed or measured. Studies will be excluded if they address moral motivations in a metaphorical or non-moral sense, as well as if they address moral motivation in contexts unrelated to psychology. A structured charting form was created to systematically extract data from the relevant literature. The main outcome will simply be a mapping of the literature on the topic. As a result, this scoping review will synthesize the widely dispersed accounts of moral motivation and inform the development of new frameworks and future research.",

          "authors": "Valentin Krieger; Samuel St-Amour; Paquito Bernard; Niharika Parashar; Lionel Cailhol",
          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder is associated with severe suffering and insomnia disorder. The study aimed to explore the association between self-reported physical activity and the symptoms of borderline personality disorder with the severity of insomnia disorder acting as a mediator. The indirect relationship within the mediation analysis (n = 54) is not significant (β = 0.0503 [-0.1050 – 0.2250]). Furthermore, physical activity is not significantly associated with insomnia disorder (β = 0.0001 [-0.003 – 0.0005]). However, insomnia disorder is significantly associated with borderline personality disorder (β = 0.5601 [0.3006 – 0.8738]). Additionally, the direct mediating (β = 0.0003 [-0.0000 – 0.0007]) and total relationship (β = 0.0004 [-0.0000 – 0.0008]) independently of the mediation analysis between physical activity and borderline personality disorder show statistical trends. Accordingly, insomnia disorder does not appear to affect the relationship between physical activity and borderline personality disorder. However, insomnia disorder seems to be positively and potentially physical activity negatively related with the symptoms of borderline personality disorder in direct ways. Further studies should investigate the relationship between physical activity, insomnia disorder, and borderline personality disorder.",

Music-making in particular sets perceptions into motion that both creator and appreciator can experience. This establishes one’s identity within the community, and further emphasizes one’s voice within the collective. Group-based music-making’s ability to foster agency and belonging might be especially advantageous for those experiencing psychosis. \nMethods: Twenty participants with psychosis engaged in four sessions during which they wrote and recorded songs with four other participants and a music facilitator. This study builds on music therapy research in psychosis by incorporating symptom specific measures and adding linguistic analyses as objective measures of mental states. Symptom changes were assessed by administering paranoia and hallucination questionnaires before and after the music intervention. Fluctuations in the language participants use to describe experiences were quantitatively captured using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2022. \nStudy Results: Although a decrease in hallucinations was not observed, paranoia decreased in participants who experience less severe hallucinations as compared to those who experience them more frequently. Linguistic findings revealed a significant reduction in the usage of the first-person pronoun “I” and significant increases in the plural pronoun “we,” accomplishment, agentic, cognitive processing, and positive emotion language. \nStudy Conclusion: Suggestions regarding how these language shifts reflect the song-making activity and translate into participants’ lives outside of the song-writing workshop are discussed. Overall, this study highlights the potential of group-based song-making in promoting recovery from psychosis.",

We argue that these concepts are identical  both conceptually and mechanistically, despite much VR research defining presence as something which much necessarily take place in VR. We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

Jurisdictions such as Australia and the UK are replacing industry messages with a range of independently-designed ones, like in tobacco warning labels. Counter-industry messages have been proposed to challenge industry narratives, e.g., “gambling products are designed to be addictive”. Here we tested 10 potential counter-industry messages among UK gamblers (N=4,269) using a mixed-methods approach. Results showed that the three best-performing messages came from existing counter-industry campaigns. Participants believed the messages, and agreed that they were relevant to people experiencing gambling harm. Participants experiencing higher levels of gambling harm tended to see the messages as more personally relevant to them. Free-text analysis showed that “gambling products are designed to be addictive” received the most positive responses, and also that personal responsibility views were widespread among participants. Messages randomly shown later in the experiment were appraised more positively, suggesting that counter-industry messaging may become more effective when its core message is repeated in multiple ways. Continual design and testing will contribute to the development of best approaches and inform future implementation.",

To this end, we discuss reproducibility-related challenges of synthetic data and outline different approaches for generating synthetic data, including conventional and data-augmented MI (DA-MI) approaches to synthetic data. Furthermore, we conducted a case study using data from the PISA 2018 study, in which we aimed to address several challenges with synthetic data in educational research, such as missing data, multilevel data, and complex sampling designs. Our results indicate that these challenges can be addressed with relatively simple tools and that synthetic data can reproduce the results in a variety of statistical analyses.

Our preregistered study\naimed to investigate the relationship between cognitive and affective empathy and alcohol\nconsumption in late adolescence. Building on prior research, we predicted a dissociation of\ncognitive and affective empathy related to alcohol consumption. Specifically, we hypothesized\nthat whereas a negative association between affective empathy and alcohol consumption would\nemerge, no significant association would be observed for cognitive empathy. To test these\nhypotheses, we surveyed a convenience sample of U.S. college students (N = 116; ages 18-23;\n73.28 % women). The online survey comprised questions assessing drinking behavior\n(categorized as non-binge drinking, binge drinking, and extreme binge drinking), engagement in\nhazardous drinking behavior (continuous measure), and self-reported empathic traits.\nWe found that binge drinking categories and hazardous drinking scores were closely\naligned, suggesting that the two measures capture similar aspects of drinking behavior. Men\nreported more problematic drinking patterns than women, who also tended to show higher\naffective empathy. Age was positively related to hazardous drinking, with participants at the\nupper end of the age range reporting riskier alcohol use. Contrary to our preregistered\nhypotheses, we found no significant relationship between affective empathy and engagement in\nbinge drinking or hazardous drinking among late adolescents. Cognitive empathy, as predicted,\nwas not related to the extremity of alcohol consumption. Additionally, we observed a striking\npattern in our data: 20.69 % of our sample indicated extreme binge drinking (EBD), which is\nsignificantly higher than the 12% reported by a U.S. national survey conducted in 2020. While\nthe relationship between drinking behavior and empathy may be more nuanced than expected,\nthe observed disparity in EBD behavior emphasizes the importance of addressing its prevalence\nwithin U.S. college communities and implementing proactive measures to promote responsible\nalcohol consumption during late adolescence.",

The extent and causes of this suboptimality, however, remain poorly understood. Combining a novel Bayesian modeling approach with experimental data, we show that individuals adjust their reliance on advice based on the cognitive and metacognitive profiles of artificial advisers, and that advice generally improves performance. Nevertheless, decision-makers display systematic biases: they overweight self-generated judgments and confidence, and misapply knowledge of metacognitive skills by inconsistently translating global traits into local decisions. Strikingly, these biases persist even when both self and adviser attributes are fully transparent. Our findings reveal fundamental bottlenecks in advice integration, not stemming from ignorance, but from biased information processing. By identifying these limits, this work highlights concrete pathways for enhancing collaboration in human–human and human–AI decision-making.",

          "abstract": "This study addresses the potential benefits of eye-tracking to assess the relationship between people’s presuppositions about how liars behave and where people actually look when making deception judgements, and how these presuppositions and looking behaviours are related to judgement accuracy. Participants (N = 68) took on the role of either interviewer or observer in a 2×2 between-subjects design (face-to-face vs. video; active vs. passive role). Gaze data were collected using Tobii Pro Glasses 2 and mapped to predefined facial and bodily areas of interest, e.g. arms and hands, eyes and brows, forehead. Participants’ beliefs about nonverbal deception cues (e.g., gaze aversion, blinking, fidgeting) were collected via questionnaire. Veracity judgments were assessed using both direct ratings and indirect (intuitive) measures. The preliminary findings suggested that looking more often at someone’s legs and feet associated with more accurate deception judgements than when these areas were looked at less often. Looking at the forehead more often leads to lower deception judgement accuracy. Interestingly, while certain presuppositions about deception, such as the belief that liars avoid eye contact, were reflected in participants’ gaze behaviour (e.g., spending more time looking at the eyes), these beliefs and gaze behaviour did not translate into higher judgement accuracy. Looking the deceiver more in their eyes did not predict accuracy.  Instead, even when gaze behaviour aligned with such presuppositions, it offered no advantage in detecting deception and often had no predictive value for veracity judgments. Our findings demonstrate a new method for directly testing theoretical associations between people’s beliefs about deception and their actual behaviour when making judgements. Tentatively, our preliminary findings support theories that suggest nonconscious and indirect deception judgements are more accurate than direct deception judgements, due to people attending to unreliable cues to deception, such as eye contact, when making direct judgements.",

          "abstract": "Amidst escalating global environmental crises, understanding the psychological factors driving pro-environmental action is crucial. We argue that stewarding the Earth System away from instability requires an embrace of expansive perspectives that drive effective action. Past perspectives underscore the importance of ‘expansiveness’ for prosocial behaviour, including both a more inclusive moral universe and an extended self-concept. Across two studies (N = 546), assessed via the well-established Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and identification processes. Specifically, we employed a tailored version of the MES to scrutinize self-identity and its relative expansiveness. Study 1 revealed a significant relationship between moral concern and self-expansion, yet each exhibited distinct patterns, displaying discriminant validity. The degree of identification with an entity, especially nature-related ones, related to moral concern judgments associated with it, offering fresh insights into moral expansiveness. In Study 2, individuals demonstrating broader and deeper moral circles, alongside a more inclusive self-concept, exhibited heightened tendencies to identify as environmental activists and engage in pro-environmental activism. However, neither construct predicted signing the Climate and Ecology Bill, indicating the need for further investigation into factors influencing pro-environmental behaviour. This paper extends research into environmental activism by examining the unique contribution of expansiveness in moral circles and the self-concept, shedding light on individuals' prosocial engagement with the natural world.",

We find that participants were indeed greatly distressed at losing access to GPS, with negative initial and follow-up emotional reactions. Users reported turning to strategies such as route memorization or offline maps, and limiting their driving to new places. However they still continued to rely on GPS for navigation.

In young adults, free time substantially improved performance. Passive repetition also improved performance, but not beyond the effect of free time. Active repetition, on the other hand, slightly impaired it. In 9-year-olds, active repetition also impaired performance, but free time provided little benefit. These findings demonstrate that providing more free time during instruction delivery improves performance in young adults but is far less effective in children, suggesting important developmental differences in the short-term maintenance of instructions and the (strategic) use of free time.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory is shaped by event segmentation, which divides continuous experience into discrete episodes often marked by temporal gaps. Emotional learning can influence memory across these boundaries by prioritizing not only threatening events but also related information that is encoded shortly before or after the emotional episode, which in turn supports adaptive generalization. However, evidence for such cross-boundary modulation is mixed, possibly because conventional group-level analyses can mask systematic individual variability in the effects of emotional learning on nearby neutral memories.\n  \nWe reanalyzed data from a large-sample study (N = 285) combining emotional and episodic learning that had previously shown no consistent retroactive or proactive enhancement across event boundaries at the group level. Young adults incidentally encoded neutral images from two categories (animals, tools) across three temporally separated phases: pre-conditioning, conditioning, and post-conditioning. One category was partially reinforced with mild electric shocks during conditioning to create a category-level threat association. Memory was tested 24 hours later using a surprise old–new recognition task.\n\nA hierarchical Bayesian recognition model with a latent-mixture component revealed two profiles of memory modulation. One showed declining memory across phases, with modest enhancement limited to items from the shock-predictive category encoded during conditioning. The other showed strongest memory for items encoded during conditioning, with substantial category-selective enhancement extending into post-conditioning. These findings suggest that proactive, but not retroactive, enhancement is most evident in individuals whose memories are strongly anchored to the emotional episode, indicating integration of threat-related information across temporal boundaries.",

Participants practiced a motor-sequence task under action-awareness or yoked-control conditions, followed by 24-hour delayed retention and sequence-knowledge tests. In Experiment 1, individual levels of action awareness were positively correlated with delayed performance gains, suggesting a link to memory improvement mechanisms. In Experiment 2, action awareness heightened susceptibility to interference from competing learning, suggesting reduced memory stabilization. Findings reveal that conscious awareness of actions has a dual effect, enhancing early learning and differentially modulating consolidation pathways. Our results demonstrate that conscious awareness of actions shapes motor skill encoding and consolidation, thus highlighting the role of metacognitive processes in motor memory formation.",

The present study asked whether listeners per-ceive such fine-grained timing deviations, which place demands on perceptual grouping, attention-al allocation, and temporal prediction, in complex, multi-instrumental groove contexts. We meas-ured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony and swing in a naturalistic funk pattern featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with uniform onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. These have been shown to index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological comple-ment to behavioral measures of microrhythm. Thresholds varied systematically by instrument: for asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to de-tect than early ones (≈23ms).  Musical training generally conferred lower thresholds. We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further in-dicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm.  The findings expand our understanding of perceptual boundaries for microrhythmic expression in multi-layered groove mu-sic and highlight how both acoustic and experiential factors shape sensitivity to timing nuances.",

          "authors": "Johan Hennert; Dario Paape; Himanshu Yadav; Shravan Vasishth",
          "abstract": "A signature prediction of memory-based theories of sentence processing is that processing difficulty should increase with increased dependency distance. However, in addition to this so-called locality effect, an anti-locality effect has also been reported, where increased dependency distance leads to a reduction in processing difficulty. Anti-locality effects are a key prediction of expectation-based accounts; these accounts predict that increasing dependency distance can make the upcoming word more predictable, and therefore easier to process. A theory that has been argued to explain both locality and anti-locality effects within a unified framework is lossy-context (LC) surprisal (Futrell, R., Gibson, E., &amp; Levy, R. P. (2021). Lossy-context surprisal: An information-theoretic model of memory effects in sentence processing. Cognitive Science, 44(3)). LC surprisal extends the expectation-based account with a memory component that lets memory for the linguistic context degrade and be reconstructed, and this affects the surprisal computation. Locality or anti-locality effects can arise depending on how much the context has degraded, and how it is reconstructed. Although this claim has been investigated by Futrell and colleagues using data from English and German, it has not been put to the test against other cross-linguistic experimental data in which both memory and expectation effects are in play. We present an evaluation of LC surprisal theory against three empirical studies involving Russian, Hindi, and Persian, which found evidence for both memory- and expectation-based effects. We show that the lossy-context surprisal model as laid out in Futrell et al. (2021) has only limited success in explaining the observed patterns in these data. Alternative implementations of LC surprisal need to be developed that align better with the observed data.",

Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users’ diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that a large portion of media use is driven by habit. Yet our ability to measure habitual processes directly remains limited, suggesting that more naturalistic methods are needed. Leveraging a deep mobile event log and experience sampling dataset of German Internet users (N = 889), we probe the situational dynamics of smartphone habits. We investigate how moment-to-moment smartphone behavior corresponds to the perception of automaticity, with implications for the measurement of habitual behavior more generally. Contrary to expectations, duration – rather than frequency – of smartphone behavior emerged as the more consistent predictor of situational habit perception at both within- and between-person levels. However, these links varied by the type of behavior, with sessions and episodes (but not glances) relating to perceived automaticity. Additionally, home screen and gateway app use were not associated with perceived automaticity. Our results generate new insights – and deep questions – into the nature of real-world media habits.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To highlight lived experiences of Visual Snow Syndrome, and characterize its impacts on daily life. \n\nBackground: Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is neurological condition typified by persistent visual snow, or static throughout the visual field, alongside additional phenomena that impact night vision, visual perception, and visual processing. Only formally characterized in the last decade, little consideration has been given to the broader impacts of this condition on the lives of those who experience it. This study presents the first qualitative investigation of the subjective experience of Visual Snow Syndrome, to further inform clinical, research, and consumer communities alike. \n\nMethods: Forty-nine adults who self-identified as having Visual Snow Syndrome completed an online survey that queried the good and bad aspects of VSS, and its general impact on their daily life. Their qualitative data were analysed iteratively, to determine the key themes represented across and between individual responses. \n\nResults: The lived experience of VSS varied both inter and intra-individually across this sample. Responses endorsed several themes, related to mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, functional vision, the dynamic course of visual snow syndrome, clinical challenges, and medical system limitations. The majority of participants described their VSS as a negative component of their daily life, with impacts to mental health and psychosocial wellbeing, and functional vision the most commonly endorsed themes. Specifically, participants described how living with VSS worsened their mental health, cognition, sleep, daily routines, visual quality, and comfort in both natural and artificial light. However, one third of participants were able to identify some positive aspects of their visual snow experience, highlighting that it can bring unique meaning and fascination to their lives. \n\nConclusion: VSS has broad and varied impacts on the day-to-day lives of those who experience it. It can introduce substantial mental health and psychosocial wellbeing challenges and functional vision impairments, but also a unique, and sometimes beautiful perspective. These experiences, paired with its variability between and within persons, indicates a need for more holistic and individualised approaches to the long-term treatment and support of people living with Visual Snow Syndrome.",

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

We recruited 774 young adults from the central U.S. (M age = 18.9 years; 60.9% women) and tested relations between sensitivity and other self-reports and narrative expressions of personality. Each dimension of sensitivity was significantly correlated with other measures of personality. These correlations were not so large as to suggest redundancy between measures. Further, sensitivity to emotional and physiological stimuli was related to the ways people changed expressions of narrative processing between the construction of positive-valence and negative-valence life stories. We discuss how findings reinforce theories about sensory processing sensitivity and personality, as well as the value of considering sensitivity as distinct yet complementary to other longstanding measures of personality.",

Building on prior methodological frameworks, the study ensured data quality through systematic data management, outlier detection and normality testing. Outliers were identified using univariate and multivariate approaches, while normality was evaluated using statistical (Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov) and visual (skewness, kurtosis, histograms and QQ plots) approaches. Demographic and descriptive analyses provided baseline insights into sample characteristics and variable distributions. The reliability of measurement instruments was confirmed using Cronbach’s alpha and item–total correlations. These procedures demonstrate data integrity and offer guidance for similar studies in behavioural economics and management, particularly in under-researched geographical contexts such as Singapore. Results also establish the basis for future studies on how overconfidence, herding and decision avoidance biases influence workplace decision-making, including evaluating information, searching information and procrastination.",

          "abstract": "In daily life, we are constantly bombarded with sensory information from multiple sources. Our ability to combine these cues into a single perceptual experience is known as multisensory integration. Research is starting to show that multisensory integration may be altered in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, most studies have focused on clinical populations, leaving little known about how multisensory integration related to ADHD traits along a dimensional spectrum, consistent with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach. The present study examined associations between ADHD traits and multisensory integration in university students using three different behavioural tasks (i.e., Sound-Induced Flash Illusion [SIFI], McGurk, and speech-in-noise). ADHD traits were assessed dimensionally, including overall ADHD traits, as well as inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive trait dimensions. Participants were also divided into High ADHD and Low ADHD trait groups for categorical comparisons. Results indicated no significant associations between overall, inattentive, or hyperactive-impulsive ADHD traits and performance on any of the multisensory tasks. Similarly, no group differences were observed between High and Low ADHD trait groups. These findings suggest that multisensory integration differences reported in previous research may emerge only when ADHD traits reach clinical severity, rather than existing across the broader continuum of traits. This study highlights the importance of considering both dimensional and categorical approaches when examining cognitive mechanisms in ADHD. Future work should explore developmental and contextual factors that may shape multisensory integration in clinically significant ADHD.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental question in psychology is how humans digest, retain, and reconstruct information. While this process has been extensively studied in laboratory-based memory recall tasks, we have missed opportunities to examine it under more naturalistic, real-world conditions. Summarization is a task that people routinely engage in every day, and it is also a long-standing challenge in the machine learning community. Researchers in machine learning have developed rich datasets of human summaries for model training, which represent a valuable and largely untapped resource for cognitive science researchers. In this work, we analyze 45,220 human summaries drawn from three large datasets, including news articles, autobiographical stories, and Reddit posts, and compare them with a dataset of narrative memory recall. We demonstrate a close relationship between human summarization and laboratory-based memory recall. We show that while summarization operates at a higher level of the event abstraction than memory recall, the two tasks share deep similarities. The process of summarizing is fundamentally constrained by the mechanisms of memory recall, displaying behavioral patterns that align with well-known memory biases. Conversely, memory recall takes the form of summarization, prioritizing more central and important information. Together, these findings bridge the real-world task of summarization and the rich literature on memory recall and lay the foundation for developing integrated theories of how humans digest and reconstruct information.",

However, fear of happiness, a construct representing reward devaluation may negatively impact the efficacy of these reward-based interventions. As such, the current meta-analysis sought to examine the associations between fear of happiness and psychopathology.\n\nMethod: We conducted a scoping literature review in July 2025 from various databases. We calculated the pooled Hedges’ g for each of the following meta-analyses: the association between fear of happiness and (1) concurrent depression, (2) longitudinal depression, (3) concurrent anxiety, and (4) concurrent anhedonia. We also conducted moderation analyses for culture, scale version, symptom severity, and demographics.\n\nResults: Twenty-six samples were included, representing 6,604 different individuals. We found large effect sizes for the cross-sectional associations between fear of happiness and depression (g = 1.117), anxiety (g = 0.999), and anhedonia (g = 0.837), and a small-to-medium effect size for the longitudinal association between fear of happiness and depression (g = 0.481). We also found stronger associations in Eastern cultures compared to Western cultures.\n\nConclusion: Our findings provide evidence of strong concurrent and predictive implications of fear of happiness on depression, as well as concurrent implications on anxiety and anhedonia. Moreover, there were nuanced differences across cultures, symptom severity, and scale version, indicating that the clinical implications of fear of happiness may differ across populations. Nevertheless, these findings provide rationale for the assessment and treatment of fear of happiness among persons with depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Background: Various lines of research explore how psychosocial factors like gender dysphoria, minority stress, gender euphoria, and social support affect trans people’s mental health. Conceptualizations of these factors have continuously evolved, resulting in a diverse spectrum of ideas for research on stressors and resources, but also leading to a considerable risk of overlap and confusion. Thus, clarifying and distinguishing these factors is now crucial for improving research and mental health care in this population. This study aims to develop a comprehensive questionnaire on stressors and resources relevant to trans and non-binary individuals, designed for health services and therapy outcome research, and inclusive of all gender identities.\n\nMethods: Participants (n=483 trans adults; age range 18-62) filled out an online questionnaire of candidate items for a comprehensive questionnaire (A-JOURNEY) on stressors and resources as well as self-report measures for well-being and psychopathology to assess criterion validity. We used parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis to identify the questionnaire’s factors and select items.\n\nResults: Analyses yielded a final A-JOURNEY questionnaire comprising 53 items that assesses nine stress factors and four resource factors. Extracted factors showed high reliability (𝛼=.77-.93) and correlated with mental health outcomes in the expected directions.\n\nDiscussion: The A-JOURNEY questionnaire provides a comprehensive tool for assessing stressors and resources in trans and non-binary individuals, streamlining evaluation without requiring multiple measures. While validation for change sensitivity is still required, it shows promise for advancing psychological and healthcare research and may enhance our understanding of how specific trans-specific stressors/resources affect mental health.",

          "authors": "Nora Harhen; Aaron Bornstein; Catherine A. Hartley",
          "abstract": "How do we make efficient use of limited past experience to guide our present choices? Most widely-studied option evaluation strategies rely on knowledge accumulated across numerous repeated experiences. One possible alternative strategy in unfamiliar environments is episodic sampling, in which a decision maker retrieves a small number of memories of similar past decisions to estimate the value of present options. Such a strategy would be particularly useful for children and adolescents who, by virtue of their younger age, inherently have less experience to draw on than adults. On the other hand, the effectiveness of episodic sampling derives from its precision and context sensitivity—properties of episodic memory that continue to develop into adolescence and young adulthood. This raises a key question: do developmental changes in episodic memory produce changes in episodic sampling? To address this, 106 participants, ages 8-25, completed a two-day choice task that dissociated the influence of a single episodic memory on choice from the influence of multiple episodes sharing a common context. Across all ages, single evoked episodes biased choice, but only adults showed sensitivity to the broader evoked episodic context. Developmental gains in memory precision fully explained these differences, and paralleled a shift in the relationship of memory to forward planning. Together, these findings suggest that episodic memory guides decision making throughout development, but the character of its influence evolves as memory becomes more precise and richly structured.",

In two pre-registered experiments, Spanish-English bilinguals heard these sentence fragments and predicted the language of the omitted final word. They successfully predicted upcoming code-switches when given 30 seconds of context prior to their predictions (Experiment 1; N=94), but not when only hearing the sentence fragment (Experiment 2, N=115).

          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas; Melanie B. Fessinger",
          "abstract": "Research Summary\nWe compared ratings provided by 355 judges and 372 laypeople on the ethicality of various prosecutorial behaviors and whether they should be investigated as possible misconduct. Most prosecutorial behaviors were sourced from exoneration cases and varied from highly egregious misconduct (e.g., manipulating exculpatory evidence) to more questionable in nature (e.g., opposing a defense expert witness on Frye grounds). Results showed that laypeople had generally stricter ethical standards—perceiving acts as more unethical (d = 0.36) and more worthy of investigation (21 of 27 acts; 77%) compared to judges. Notably, however, this varied based on individual acts. For some acts, specifically those with clearly established legal rules, judges had stricter ethical standards instead. Overall, our data showed wide variation in ethicality and investigation judgments across individuals, across respondent type, and across specific acts. \nPolicy Implications \nLaypeople were more skeptical of prosecutorial discretion than judges—a skepticism that may be justified given that many of the behaviors stemmed from wrongful conviction cases. Yet, as experts, judges are in a better position to identify and report misconduct. This discrepancy between who perceives and who reports misconduct may partly explain why misconduct is seldom investigated or sanctioned. Laypeople, however, are not powerless to mitigate such injustices. As jurors, awareness of misconduct can protect them from being unduly influenced by improper prosecutorial tactics. As members of the court of public opinion, laypeople shape narratives about justice processes, apply pressure for institutional accountability, and can mobilize collective action when official outcomes clash with public values. Most critically, as voters, laypeople influence the platforms on which prosecutors run and who ultimately gets elected, which can help drive more ethical institutional norms within prosecutors’ offices. Our results highlight the challenges facing prosecutorial oversight and accountability, underscoring the roles that judges and laypeople can play in addressing them.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI systems, especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, have recently emerged as significant contributors to creative processes. While LLMs can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of LLMs on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional GPT-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance AI-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of LLMs could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.",

          "abstract": "We introduce MultiLevelOptimalBayes (MLOB), an R package for estimating between-group\neffects in multilevel latent variable models. MLOB implements a regularized Bayesian\nestimator developed by Dashuk, Hecht, Lüdtke, Robitzsch, and Zitzmann (2024), and\nextended to models with covariates (Dashuk, Hecht, Lüdtke, Robitzsch, and Zitzmann\n2025a). This estimator selects prior parameters to minimize the mean squared error\n(MSE) of the between-group effect by optimally balancing bias and variance. Leveraging\nthis bias-variance trade-off, the regularized Bayesian estimator yields robust and\nstable results—even in small-sample settings or when intraclass correlations (ICCs) are\nlow. For practical use, MLOB supports unbalanced group sizes through built-in balancing\nprocedures and offers comprehensive inference, including estimates, standard errors,\np values, and confidence intervals for both target predictors and covariates. To provide\ncontext, we first review the theoretical underpinnings of the regularized Bayesian estimator\n(Dashuk et al. 2024, 2025a), followed by a description of its implementation in MLOB,\nfocusing on the core function mlob(). We demonstrate its application using real-world\ndatasets. Ultimately, MLOB equips researchers in psychology, the education sciences, and\nrelated fields with a robust and accessible tool for estimating multilevel latent variable\nmodels—especially under small-sample conditions and low ICCs. We expect that MLOB\nwill advance robust and reproducible multilevel modeling in psychology, education, and\nbeyond.",

          "abstract": "In this article, we extend the regularized Bayesian estimator of multilevel latent variable models (Dashuk et al., 2024) to improve the estimation of the between-group parameter βb in two-level latent variable models with covariates. Specifically, we allow for the inclusion of covariates and optimize the estimator’s accuracy in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Simulation results indicate that the regularized Bayesian estimator consistently outperforms both standard and transformed maximum likelihood (ML) estimators, especially in scenarios with small sample sizes and low intraclass correlations. While the estimator achieves lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and relative bias, it exhibited poorer coverage rates and less reliable standard errors compared to ML estimators. To address these limitations, we propose some strategies. Furthermore, a transformed ML estimator is utilized to enhance the accuracy of the estimation of the covariate parameter γ. Finally, we provide a step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how to apply the extended regularized Bayesian estimator to a real dataset using the MLOB package in R.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies have examined how the COVID-19 pandemic affected dream recall, dream content, and nightmares. However, relatively little attention has been devoted to the individual and situational factors associated with pandemic-induced changes in dreams. The threat simulation theory of dreaming predicts that threatening situations in our waking life (situational factors) influence threatening dream content. At the same time, individual differences predispose some people to be more prone to experience threatening dreams more frequently than others. Using a large Finnish sample of prospective dream diaries, we analyzed the relative importance of individual (e.g., belonging to COVID-19 risk group, life satisfaction, depression symptoms) and situational factors (e.g., daily COVID-19 worry, COVID-19 media consumption, negative and positive emotions) to determine the best predictors for threatening events and COVID-19 related threatening events in dreams. Random forest analyses revealed that individual factors were consistently better predictors than situational factors for both threatening events and pandemic-related threatening events in dreams. Lower life satisfaction was the only statistically significant predictor for threatening events, and fewer positive emotions in the past two weeks the only statistically significant predictor for pandemic-related threatening events, in dreams. These findings suggest that the propensity to experience threatening dream content, including pandemic-related threatening events, is more of a stable trait rather than a daily fluctuating feature of dreams. In the light of the threat simulation theory, it could be argued that individual variation in the proneness to simulate threatening events adaptively interacts with daily experiences to modulate threatening dream content.",

In addition, R&amp;S might be differentially related to processing exteroceptive and interoceptive information. The present study aimed at manipulating different components of the predictive processing model (prior beliefs and prediction error monitoring) in interoception, and evaluating the resulting changes in the implicit R&amp;S. In a variant of the heartbeat discrimination task (HDT), we used a sham transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol to induce prior beliefs about a decrease or increase of the heartbeat frequency (Experiment 1). Prediction error monitoring was modulated by manipulating error feedback reliability in the same HDT (Experiment 2). Results showed that the point of subjective equality and the decision criterion shifted towards the direction of the induced prior compared to the baseline condition only in the direction of the decreased heartbeat frequency (Experiment 1), while the sensitivity decreased with unreliable error feedback compared to reliable one (Experiment 2). Crucially, implicit S, but not R, that were measured after the HDT increased following the prior beliefs induction; no significant change was observed after the unreliable error feedback. The effects in Experiment 1 were modulated by the prevalence of autistic personality traits. Together, the results support the predictive coding account of R&amp;S where increased reliance on prior beliefs, but not on prediction error monitoring, has a crucial role in the R&amp;S experiences, and demonstrate the differential input of interoceptive signals in the R&amp;S.",

          "abstract": "Gender differences in reading comprehension and motivation can contribute to disparities between genders in educational and occupational success, as well as in societal participation. Previous meta-analyses on gender differences in reading have had several limitations: They investigated only student samples, lacked recent international effect size estimates, and focused on printed texts and a narrow set of motivational constructs. To address these gaps, we synthesized representative individual participant data from international large-scale assessments conducted between 1990 and 2023, spanning 130 countries and including both student and adult populations (total N = 6,365,416). Overall, females outperformed males in reading comprehension (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.17) and reported higher reading motivation (SMD = 0.22). Moderator analyses provided novel evidence that the magnitude of these gender differences varies systematically by age, assessment format, construct operationalization, and contextual factors. Gender differences in both reading comprehension and motivation were more pronounced during adolescence but decreased for motivation and diminished for comprehension in adulthood. Gender differences in reading comprehension were smaller for digital than for printed texts, and gender differences in task values were larger than those in self-beliefs. From 1990 to 2023, motivation differences declined, whereas comprehension differences increased overall but narrowed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater national prosperity and higher participation of women in management positions and tertiary education were associated with larger advantages for females in comprehension, whereas motivation differences decreased as national prosperity rose. These findings provide the most comprehensive and robust evidence on gender differences in reading with important implications for research, practice, and policy.",

Most studies on human exploration used overly simple tasks that isolate variables but poorly reflect problems humans evolved to solve–limiting the generalizability of the results. To address this limitation, we introduce the Lockbox paradigm, a novel, ecologically valid, and challenging task that requires active exploration and physical interaction.\nData from 263 participants interacting with the Lockbox across three different interaction modalities of varying interaction costs, reveal a remarkable ability to adapt and solve problems efficiently in complex scenarios. By comparing the interaction modalities, we demonstrate the critical role of cost variations, such as physical and temporal costs, in driving attentiveness and shaping exploration strategies. These findings provide important insights into human exploration strategies, with potential applications in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.",

Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an AI model? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

The current study addresses this gap by using a novel dynamic display of targets’ reactions to a poker game to assess perceivers ' ability to detect contextual information from facial displays of emotion. We categorised targets’ dynamic facial displays of emotional reactions to game outcomes using MorphCast Emotion AI HTML5 SDK, an online machine-learning tool that detects emotions in recorded videos. Additionally, we investigated the role of perceivers ' covert facial mimicry during the categorisation task using facial electromyography (fEMG). Results indicate that while perceivers achieved above-chance accuracy in guessing targets’ outcomes (win, loss, or draw) from facial displays of emotion, they struggled to distinguish between losses and draws. Further, although emotions (positive vs. negative)appear to act as cues for outcome detection, fEMG data reveal no significant pattern of activation linked to outcome accuracy. These findings highlight facial display of emotion as a communicative tool for contextual information and the role of experience, societal and cultural norms in constructing subjective yet socially expected reactions across individuals.",

          "abstract": "Science-related populism, as a specific form of populist attitude toward scientific authority, has attracted increasing scholarly attention in recent years. Although the SciPop Scale has been proposed to measure this attitude, its cross-national validity and measurement invariance remain underexplored. Moreover, the impact of scoring approaches corresponding to different measurement philosophies on the interpretation of the SciPop Scale has not yet been examined. Using data from the “Trust in Science and Science-Related Populism” (TISP) project and the Swiss Science Barometer, this study analyzes a sample of 69,341 participants across 68 countries and regions, as well as a nationally representative Swiss sample of 1124 participants, to examine the psychometric properties of the SciPop Scale. The results indicate that: first, the SciPop Scale demonstrates high reliability, with a four-factor structure being the most widely applicable optimal model; second, full measurement invariance is achieved across sex, age, education, residence, political orientation, and religiosity, while partial invariance is observed across geographic regions, economic development levels, cultural values, and political regimes. However, overall cross-national comparability remains limited, though approximate invariance can be attained through measurement alignment. Third, different scoring methods yield inconsistent identification of the weakest dimension. Fourth, when examining criterion validity, alignment-adjusted scores based on the Bollen approach consistently outperform those based on the Goertz approach, showing greater explanatory power for cross-national or cross-group comparisons. Taken together, this study not only provides evidence for cross-national applicability of the SciPop Scale but also engages with broader questions regarding the measurement philosophy of populist attitudes. The choice of scoring method is not merely a technical decision; it directly shapes how the structure of populism is understood and interpreted.",

In the aftermath, the health and well-being of older adults have been a major concern for researchers and policymakers. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the post-disaster health outcomes of older adults affected by this natural disaster. This study aims to first compare the health status of older adults who were affected by the flood to those who were unaffected using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting, approximately 1.5 years after the disaster, and then examine the impact of primary and secondary stressors on health outcomes among flood-affected older adults, identifying potential risk and protective factors. Results suggested that, for most health outcomes, there were no significant differences between the affected and unaffected groups. Notably, older adults who experienced the flood reported significantly lower levels of loneliness and better psychological health-related quality of life, suggesting effective recovery and strong resilience. However, injuries, the loss of close family members or friends, and structural damage to homes were significantly associated with poorer health and well-being. However, some counterintuitive findings also emerged, with certain stressors showing associations with better post-disaster health outcomes. In sum, our findings provide support for the inoculation/maturation hypothesis and challenge common assumptions about older adults’ vulnerability in disaster contexts.",

The intervention targeted loss-related memory characteristics, negative grief appraisals, a sense of social disconnection, and unhelpful coping strategies, and used a personalised digital modular approach and therapist support through weekly calls and messages. Outcomes were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up using validated measures.\nResults:\nAll participants completed treatment. Large reductions in PGD symptoms and comorbid symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were observed. At post-treatment, 87.5% (7/8) demonstrated both reliable improvement in PGD symptoms on the Reliable Change Index, and recovery below clinical cut-offs. There was no reliable deterioration on any measure. Process measures showed large effect sizes, with the strongest improvements in loss-related memory characteristics. Therapeutic gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Average therapist time was approximately 10 hours per participant.\nConclusions:\niCT-PG was feasible, well-accepted, and associated with substantial clinical improvement. The intervention successfully targeted mechanisms known to maintain PGD, supporting its theoretical foundation.

We manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony (300 ms vs. 1300 ms), reflecting early attentional engagement and later, more controlled processing phases respectively, and threat type (sensory-affective vs. stigma-related). \nResults:\nResults consistently showed no evidence of attentional bias toward personally relevant threat words compared to neutral control words. This was true during both attention processing phases. These findings do not support the hypervigilance hypothesis. \nConclusions:\nIn combination with an earlier negative report, we conclude that there is currently no evidence that attentional bias, as assessed by the spatial cueing task, plays a central role in the psychological burden associated with atopic dermatitis.",

The present study, therefore, conducted the first psychometric evaluation of the new Arabic translation of the scale in Libya, including participants who were directly affected by the recent devastating floods.

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

Specifically, we asked participants to imagine (hypothetical) people working in certain professions and to say their names out loud. We found that the statistics of the uttered names reflected societal gender stereotypes and environmental statistics of actual people working in these occupations. Importantly, the proportion of female and male names generated for each profession by each participant predicted their performance in a sequential priming task (prime = stereotyped professions, target = female and male faces) better than the environmental statistics or participants’ estimates of gender proportions.

          "authors": "Johannah Völler; Juan Linde Domingo; Javier Ortiz-Tudela; Carlos González-García",
          "abstract": "Sudden perceptual learning refers to the abrupt disambiguation of an initially ambiguous stimulus. Despite the limited encoding time, these brief perceptual experiences transform into enduring memory engrams. Still, a comprehensive framework of why these memories are so long-lasting and their neural underpinnings, in particular the role of the hippocampus, is currently lacking. Here, we build on the apparent connection of sudden perceptual learning with long-term memory to outline how a representational perspective may help to overcome current limitations, similar to other areas of memory research. In short, we claim that sudden perceptual learning triggers initial prediction errors across the hierarchy, including strong higher-level (semantic) ones. Once a solution is found, the formerly ambiguous image can be connected to previous schemas and a disambiguation cascade of prediction error minimization is triggered, starting with semantic prediction errors. As a consequence, these events lead to low-dimensional representations that show signs of early semanticization, thereby favouring semantics over perceptual details. In sum, we propose that multiple memory traces are simultaneously encoded during sudden perceptual learning, and while low-dimensional representations engage neocortical structures, high-dimensional, episodic representations require the hippocampus. This perspective offers a promising framework to advance research on sudden perceptual learning and related phenomena.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Self-harm is a leading cause of death and injury worldwide and is especially common amongst adolescents. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are characterized as a risk factor for self-harm within the Integrated-Motivational Volitional (IMV) model. However, it is unclear how ACEs relate to self-harm as it unfolds in daily-life, and research investigating potential protective factors in the association between ACEs and self-harm is scarce. Here, we investigated whether ACEs were associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM), and whether parent-child or peer attachment relationship quality influenced this association. Additionally, we explored whether specific types of ACEs were differentially associated with self-harm. \n\tMethods: A cross-sectional study using retrospective questionnaires to assess ACEs, lifetime self-harm thoughts and behaviours, and paternal, maternal, and peer attachment relationship quality, and ESM to assess daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, 10x/day for 6 days. N=1014 adolescents (Age, Mean (SD) = 14.05 years (1.91), 66.66% female) were recruited from the general population via schools across Flanders (Belgium). \n\tResults: Multilevel analyses demonstrated associations between ACEs and lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours, that were attenuated by a high-quality maternal attachment relationship. Specific types of ACEs (e.g., sexual victimization) were more strongly associated with lifetime and daily-life self-harm thoughts and behaviours.\n\tConclusion: The study provides evidence for ACEs as a pre-motivational phase variable within the IMV model. Clinicians are encouraged to consider exposure to ACEs and the potential of maternal relationships to buffer their impact in the prevention and management of adolescent self-harm.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nDigital mental health platforms often consist of many different forms of self-care exercises. To our knowledge, whether the number of choices presented to the users affects their uptake and experiences and poses negative consequences (i.e., not choosing any exercises, choice dissatisfaction) for users, especially those experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms or unpleasant state emotions have not been empirically investigated.\n\nObjective:\nThe present study investigated the impact of choice set size on practice decisions, completion, satisfaction, and subjective experiences, as well as potential moderators including depression and anxiety symptoms, state emotions, and motivational and decisional attributes on these choice outcomes.\n\nMethods:\nParticipants were recruited through university mass email and social media, and 652 participants were included in our analyses. Participants completed questions regarding anxiety and depressive symptoms, state emotions, and other psychological attributes. Then, they were randomly assigned to 1-choice, 4-choice, and 16-choice conditions, in which they may choose a self-care activity to practice or decide not to practice. Finally, they completed questions regarding completion, satisfaction, engagement, attitude, and perceived improvement in psychological state.\n\nResults:\nPresenting multiple choices resulted in a higher likelihood of practice (ORs = 3.12, 95% CI [2.08, 4.67] and 3.83. 95% CI [2.55, 5.76], ps &lt; .001) and better decision satisfaction (16-choice vs 1-choice: d = 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.56], p &lt; .001; 4-choice vs 1-choice: d = 0.24, 95% CI [0.05, 0.43], p = .033) compared to presenting with a single choice. Tentative evidence indicates anxiety symptoms and state emotions were meaningful moderators. Specifically, for individuals with more anxiety symptoms and intense negative emotions, presenting a larger choice set (16 choices) resulted in more positive chosen exercise satisfaction, better attitudes towards chosen activity, and higher perceived improvement in mental health state after the activity, when compared to presenting with smaller choice sets (anxiety: β = -0.38, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.06] to -0.51, 95% CI [-0.84, -0.18], state emotions: β = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.66, 0.03] to -0.60, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.28]). No evidence was found for moderating effect of motivational and decisional attributes. \n\nConclusions:\nThe moderation results were contradictory to prior research and our expectation that a larger choice set may result in worse outcomes than a smaller choice set for people who were experiencing higher levels of psychological distress. We speculated a possible reason for these findings may be that people with more anxiety symptoms and unpleasant emotions may have stronger need to reduce these uncomfortable symptoms and emotions, and being presented with more choices on self-care activities, there may be a higher possibility that these self-care activities can address their distress.\n\nRegistration:\nOpen Science Framework puwxb; https://osf.io/puwxb/",

This study utilized data from a large, population-based sample of Norwegian youth aged 12–16 years and employed generalized linear models to examine whether current and past peak subjective distress following physical abuse were associated with mental and somatic symptoms, measured by the Hopkin’s Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-10) and the Children’s Somatic Symptoms Inventory (CSSI-8). Causal mediation analyses were conducted to investigate whether subjective distress mediated the relationship between physical abuse and health outcomes. Subjective distress accounted for significant variation in health outcomes, above and beyond externally defined features of physical abuse, such as severity and frequency. Notably, the impact of physical abuse on health outcomes was largely transmitted through experiences of subjective distress. While externally defined characteristics of maltreatment remain important predictors of health outcomes, this study underscores the necessity of incorporating measures of subjective experience to fully understand the pathways linking childhood maltreatment to later health outcomes.",

We investigate how moment-to-moment smartphone behavior corresponds to the perception of automaticity, with implications for the measurement of habitual behavior more generally. Contrary to expectations, duration – rather than frequency – of smartphone behavior emerged as the more consistent predictor of situational habit perception at both within- and between-person levels. However, these links varied by the type of behavior, with sessions and episodes (but not glances) relating to perceived automaticity. Additionally, home screen and gateway app use were not associated with perceived automaticity. Our results generate new insights – and deep questions – into the nature of real-world media habits.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analytic confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a type of meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) that is useful for evaluating the factor structure of measurement scales based on data from multiple studies. Modeling the factor structure is just one example of many potentially interesting research questions. Analyzing covariance matrices allows for the evaluation of measurement properties across studies, such as whether indicators are functioning the same across studies. For example, are some indicators more indicative of the common factor in certain types of studies than in others? The additional analysis of means of the observed variables opens up many other research questions to consider such as: ‘Are there mean differences in mental health between clinical and non-clinical samples?’. To answer such questions, it is necessary to analyze both the covariance and the mean structure of the indicators. Meta-analytic CFA with means is applicable when the studies included in the meta-analysis used the same indicators, measured on the same scales. In this paper, we present and illustrate a method to incorporate the means of variables in MASEM analyses of such datasets. We focus on meta-analytic CFA, with the aim of testing differences in latent means across studies. We provide illustrations of the comparison of latent means across groups of studies using two empirical datasets, for which data and analysis scripts are provided online. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method relates to other analysis options such as multigroup or multilevel structural equation modeling.",

Confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the construct validity of SHARE-HCAP’s cognitive test battery. Based on theory and prior empirical work, unidimensional models representing the cognitive domains of memory, executive functioning, visuospatial skills, language and fluency, and orientation were tested. Additionally, we examined a correlated factor model and a second-order factor model that included a latent factor representing general cognitive performance. Criterion validity was established by examining the association between the single factor scores and level of educational attainment and age. \nResults: A second-order factor structure showed adequate model fit, suggesting five domains of cognition and a general cognitive performance latent factor. Greater single factor scores were associated with higher educational attainment and younger age. Approximate measurement invariance across the five countries was supported. \nConclusions: Results suggest that the SHARE-HCAP is a psychometrically sound neuropsychological test battery and is a valuable tool for cross-national comparisons of cognitive health.",

Growth Mixture Modeling identified two sex-invariant lying trajectories: most adolescents lied infrequently (84.40%; low stable), while some lied more frequently with a slight decrease (13.60%; medium decreasing). Poorer parental monitoring and supervision, more inconsistent discipline, more corporal punishment, more family dysfunction, male sex, and lower family socio-economic status significantly predicted higher odds of being in the medium decreasing trajectory.

Across three studies comprising 429,980 responses from 1,159 human participants and 4,068 large language model (LLM) agents, we tested whether LLMs use emotions to guide altruistic punishment in ways comparable to humans. In Study 1, humans (n = 1,017) and four LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo-0125, o3-mini, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) exhibited emotion-behaviour coupling: unfair allocations elicited stronger negative emotions which, in mediation analyses, predicted higher punishment. In Study 2a, prompting reasoning-optimised LLMs (o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1) to self-report their emotional valence and arousal significantly increased punishment, and this causal effect was replicated in humans (Study 2b, n = 142). Alongside these parallels, LLMs were less cost-sensitive and showed stronger emotion-mediated effects than humans, revealing a “hyper-fairness” tendency. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that modern LLMs move beyond emotional knowledge to active emotion utilisation, while highlighting the potential and safeguards for emotionally intelligent AI systems.",

          "abstract": "The construction of high-quality experimental stimuli is foundational to psychological research, yet current practices remain labor-intensive, reliant on expert intuition, and limited in scale and reproducibility. As the field increasingly pursues large-scale, cross-linguistic, and rapid experimental designs, stimulus generation has become a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automating aspects of stimulus creation, but questions remain regarding the fidelity, interpretability, and experimental validity of LLM-constructed stimuli. We, therefore, present StimMAS, which is the first multi-agent LLM framework that automates stimulus generation, validation, and evaluation, all within a psychologist-in-the-loop architecture. We validated the framework by comparing LLM-constructed stimuli against human-authored counterparts in three behavioral psycholinguistic experiments with 300 participants. Results show that LLM-constructed materials reliably replicate established effects. Stimuli produced by StimMAS yielded lower response entropy, indicating enhanced interpretive clarity, and interaction analyses revealed that key psycholinguistic effects were preserved or amplified. Ablation studies confirmed that, compared to a single-agent system, the multi-agent architecture significantly improves stimulus quality by reducing redundancy, enforcing experimental constraints, and—particularly when using GPT-4o—achieving stronger alignment with expert judgment than DeepSeek, especially in the construction of English-language items. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent LLM systems, when guided by domain expertise, can serve as scalable, reproducible, and theoretically aligned tools for stimulus construction. StimMAS offers a publicly available platform that lowers barriers to high-quality experimental design, advancing the integration of AI into the empirical workflows of psychological science.

          "abstract": "Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension: either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how much each individual’s current behavior is attributable to their own versus every other group member’s past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality). We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for modeling interpersonal dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Everyday decision making often involves choosing between multiple alternatives, and developing unified theories for this process would benefit broad disciplines of behavioral science. A key challenge lies in explaining behavioral irrationalities that arise specifically in multialternative decisions. This study, based on preregistered procedures, investigated such nonnormative behaviors in a three-choice dot numerosity discrimination task. We systematically manipulated the value of the lowest numerosity alternative (the dud stimulus) and quantified its effects on choice, response time, and confidence. We then explained observed behaviors with a sequential evidence accumulation model featuring a “max versus next” decision algorithm. This pseudo-optimal decision-making rule naturally accounted for a well-known nonnormative choice pattern: the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. Our model also explained a multichoice metacognitive bias, known as the dud-alternative confidence boost, by identifying two critical time windows in confidence constructions: Confidence is based on sensory evidence collected shortly after stimulus presentation and evidence gathered right after decision making. These findings represent a significant advancement in understanding the dynamics underlying multichoice irrationalities.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception entails the integration of multiple acoustic cues that unfold asynchronously. While conventional work posits that listeners immediately update higher-level interpretations as cues become available, emerging evidence suggests that processing of certain speech sounds (e.g., voiceless sibilant fricatives) may be buffered, in which categorical judgments are temporarily withheld until the arrival of subsequent cues (such as a following vocoid). This study examined the mechanisms underlying this buffered integration, testing whether its release is triggered by specific incoming information or by a fixed temporal threshold. Additionally, we examine potential sources of this buffering effect. Using the Visual World Paradigm (VWP), we tested this by manipulating frication duration for /s/ and /ʃ/ to canonical, doubled, and tripled lengths. Participants (n=56) completed a VWP task to determine when recognition of a fricative occurred, and a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task to assess categorization profiles and determine whether these profiles predict individual differences in buffering. The VWP results replicated prior findings: for canonical-length fricatives, listeners delayed processing until frication offset. For double-length fricatives, this buffering was extended, with listeners withholding decisions until the entire fricative duration had elapsed. When fricative lengths were tripled, partial commitment emerged during the frication period, yet final decisions remained contingent on later cues. These results suggest that buffering is largely governed by the availability of acoustic information over time, though listeners may integrate partial information at extreme durations. VAS results revealed that listeners with greater sensitivity to secondary cues showed faster recognition. Together, these findings underscore the flexible nature of speech perception, highlighting how listeners strategically modulate processing to optimize cue integration.",

          "abstract": "How do people make sense of other people, who are simultaneously psychological beings and physical objects? Across the cognitive sciences, researchers have studied theory of mind (making sense of other people’s behaviors in terms of their mental states, or ‘naive psychology’) and physical reasoning (making sense of physical events in terms of their underlying mechanics and dynamics, or ‘naive physics’), as two separate processes. In this paper, we describe two key ways in which psychological reasoning depends on physical reasoning. First, people represent the bodies of animate agents as objects, and their actions as physical events. Second, people use physical knowledge to make inferences about other minds, including what other people want, feel, and know, how hard they are trying, and how much danger they are in. We review research from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, which provides evidence for the interaction between these two systems, and Bayesian computational models of theory of mind, which articulate a formal hypothesis about how they work together. We propose that from early in human development, people navigate the social world by dedicating two distinct but interacting systems for reasoning about other agents’ ethereal minds and their physical bodies.",

          "authors": "Vipul Nair; Mehul Bhatt; Jakob Suchan; Erik Billing; Paul Hemeren",
          "abstract": "Studies in visual cognition highlight the importance of visual, spatial, and auditory cues in influencing human attention. Such cues often tend to be indicative of actions or events, thereby serving as predictive indicators in both passive observation as well as in interactive engagement. Our research focuses on visual attention in passive observation, particularly examining the manner in which visual, spatial, and auditory cues ---henceforth visuoauditory cues--- influence attention on everyday multimodal interaction.  We systematically develop a visuoauditory event model for investigating visual attention in naturalistic embodied settings. Rooted in this event model, we explore the influence of five select visuoauditory cues ---namely, speaking, gaze, relative motion, hand action, and visibility--- on visual attention. Our analysis utilizes eye-tracking data from 90 participants observing 27 carefully designed naturalistic event scenarios and correlating their attentional metrics with the select visuoauditory cues in the backdrop of the developed event model. Findings reveal strong associations between attention and both {intra-modal (irrespective of other cues) and cross-modal (combined with other cues)} cueing effects, thereby highlighting the nuanced interplay amongst the cues influencing attentional patterns. We develop a systematic and generalized method for analyzing interactions and behavioral parameters, thereby characterizing the impact of visuoauditory cues on attentional dynamics. Our methodology, combined with the obtained insights into the attentional cueing effects, provides an analytical framework explicating the manner in which everyday (interactive) events directly drive attention under naturalistic conditions. This facilitates not only the precise modeling of behavior and attention allocation but also offers a high-level `experimental lens' for examining interactions in relation to behavioral parameters. Taken together, our methodological and behavioral findings are well-positioned to benefit multiple fields, particularly by advancing human-centered design across diverse application domains. Lastly, towards promoting open-science and for wider dissemination, the complete experimental basis of this research -e.g., event-scenarios, high-quality annotated data, data-set supplementary- have been independently documented together with instructions to use and access experimental data.\n\nwww. https://codesign-lab.org/cognitive-vision/multimodal-cues",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that sustained visual attention operates rhythmically, as if the visual system periodically samples stimuli in the environment. Here we present evidence for rhythmic sampling of internal representations of targets and distractors up to one second after visual stimulation offset. Twenty participants performed an anticipatory object-based visual attention task involving a short-lasting (50 msec) target object image. This task was made more challenging by the overlaid presentation of a distractor object image. We conducted a decoding analysis on stimulus-evoked EEG to measure target and distractor information over the stimulus epoch, which extended almost 1000 msec beyond the visual stimulus offset. We found that the magnitudes of target and distractor information represented in brain activity after the offset of the visual stimuli oscillated in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz). This oscillatory period accords with previous characterizations of rhythmic attentional sampling of continuously visually presented stimuli. Moreover, greater target-distractor theta band phase differences correlated with improved task performance. Our findings show that: 1. Attention separately samples target and distractor representations in sensory memory; 2. These separately sampled streams of information may mutually inhibit one another; and 3. Target discrimination improves when target and distractor sampling rhythms are desynchronized.",

          "abstract": "Implicit (unintentional) biases related to social categories such as race, gender, and age are often seen as impediments to belonging and success in diverse organizations. Indeed, organizations around the world expend considerable effort and resources to implement educational programs with the stated goal of addressing — and even eradicating — such biases. However, in recent years, implicit bias education has come under scrutiny for several reasons, including via claims that implicit bias (a) is inherently unchangeable, (b) has no real-world analogs, (c) is unrelated to, and takes focus away from, biased behaviors, (d) provides an excuse for discrimination, and (e) is a structural problem and thus requires structural solutions. After refuting these critiques, I introduce the MAIBE checklist to help organizations decide if implicit bias education is worth their investment based on whether it (a) includes measurable benchmarks (rather than assuming success), (b) foregrounds epistemic agency (rather than treating individuals as passive consumers of information), (c) is integrated into a larger toolbox (rather than administered in isolation), (d) is broad (rather than light-touch), and (e) is evidence-based (rather than unscientific). I conclude by calling for extended collaboration between academic psychologists and organizational decision-makers to synergistically improve both basic science and institutional practices.",

Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial lexical activation and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception, and a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, especially lower-L2-proficiency listeners. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

Developed collaboratively with survivors of war, disaster, and systemic violence, F.A.S.T. reflects principles of participatory action and prioritizes co-creation, equity, and embodied healing. Rather than relying on verbal disclosure or intensive cognitive processing, F.A.S.T. emphasizes physiological regulation, safety, and immediacy, aligning with polyvagal theory and global mental health priorities for scalable and culturally adaptable interventions. The framework is structured around a number of core foundations, including: polyvagal-informed regulation, the Power Threat Meaning Framework, ex juvantibus reasoning, depotentiation through minimal exposure, and empowerment through self-help and peer-to-peer support. Its approach, including Trauma Tapping Technique, Lymphatic Breathing Techniques, F.A.S.T.-Adapted Self-Havening, and a further Toolbox of Techniques of Adaptive Methods for Context-Dependent Practice, offer low-threshold, non-invasive regulation tools that can be applied individually, within communities, or alongside clinical care.

To investigate the effect of Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on memory performance and slow-wave activity (SWA) in older adults with insomnia disorder. 2. To determine whether changes in SWA are linked to improvements in memory performance. 3. To assess how the individual therapies of CBT-I treatment contribute to these effects. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from 104 older adults with insomnia disorder enrolled in a clinical trial examining the impact of CBT-I, Behavioral Therapy (BT), and Cognitive Therapy (CT) on insomnia severity. Participants were randomized to six sessions of BT, CT, or CBT-I (combined BT and CT). They underwent polysomnography and RBANS memory testing ––assessing immediate (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, Figure Recall, and List Recognition)–– at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Linear-mixed effects models examined the impact of treatment on memory and SWA. Regression analyses examined relationships between changes in SWA and memory following the treatment. Results: Improvements were identified in immediate memory (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, and Figure Recall). The analysis did not reveal significant changes in SWA following treatment. However, there was a significant positive association between improvements in List Learning and increases in SWA. There were no differences in outcomes among the treatments. Conclusions: These findings suggest that BT, CT and CBT-I may enhance memory performance in older adults with insomnia disorder, with a potential link between SWA and immediate memory performance.",

Parents and teachers can facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, but only if they associate excessive hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, with ADHD. \nObjectives:\nThis study was designed to determine how parents and teachers in Trinidad &amp; Tobago perceive children’s ADHD-related behaviours, as compared with Canadians. It also explored the influence of ADHD-specific knowledge and attitudes on their perceptions. \nMethods:\nWe sampled parents and teachers from Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Canada (n = 380), using four brief vignettes about a child exhibiting behaviours consistent with four mental health conditions. After reading each vignette, participants rated their perception of the children’s behaviours and then completed ADHD knowledge and attitudes scales. We analyzed the data using a series of multilevel models. \nResults:\nOur findings indicate that although parents and teachers in Trinidad &amp; Tobago perceive children’s ADHD symptoms as indiscipline or low motivation more so than Canadians, this country-level difference was non-significant when controlling for knowledge of ADHD; attitudes had no discernible impact. \nDiscussion/Conclusion:\nCountry-level differences appear to be strongly shaped by variation in knowledge about ADHD, highlighting psychoeducation as a critical first step toward improving parents’ and teachers’ accurate identification of symptoms. This, in turn, could benefit children with undiagnosed ADHD by increasing the likelihood of earlier diagnosis and treatment. However, sociocultural differences in interpreting symptoms as illness may further contribute to contrasts between Trinidad and Tobago and Canada.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to map the breadth and latent structure of paranormal beliefs have been challenged by inconsistent findings, largely due to conceptual clarity and the use of incompatible instruments. To address this, we developed the 67-item Comprehensive Paranormal Belief Scale (CPBS), derived from 29 existing measures, and administered it to an undergraduate sample (N = 287). The CPBS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α = .97) and acceptable-to-good reliabilities for 12 subscales (αs ranging from .71 to .87). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a bifactor structure comprising a general paranormal-belief factor alongside five specific dimensions: Psychic powers, Superstition, Supernatural beings, Material divination, and Traditional religious beliefs (CFI = .93, TLI = .93, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .075). Hierarchical regressions revealed that psychological variables, particularly psychosis proneness and experiential thinking, accounted for substantial incremental variance beyond socio-political factors (ΔR-squared ranged from 7.9% to 31.1%), among which spirituality emerged as the strongest predictor. However, distinct predictor profiles for individual dimensions also emerged, further illuminated by canonical correlation analysis. The debated status of traditional religious beliefs within the paranormal domain is also discussed. Limitations include the homogeneous undergraduate sample and several culturally specific items, highlighting the need for cross-cultural validation.",

          "abstract": "With growing interest in ecologically valid stimuli and the proliferation of recognition and classification algorithms, environmental sounds are increasingly a topic of interest and study. However, there is a lack of consensus as to which sound categories should be selected, and which exemplars should represent these categories. Indeed, many existing datasets include only one exemplar per sound class. This is not characteristic of the actual acoustic environment and can lead to brittle and unrepresentative computational solutions and experimental results. Importantly, the existing literature provides relatively little information about how human listeners perceive the recognizability, similarity and representativeness of acoustically and perceptually varying sounds. Here, we introduce the Environmental Sounds (EnviSounds) dataset. It provides data from over 1000 human listeners performing different tasks (recognition, similarity judgement, goodness of fit) on 53 commonly encountered environmental sound categories of human, natural and man-made sounds, each represented by 10 different exemplars. We provide behavioural indices of within-class similarity and goodness of exemplar for all samples. Furthermore, we include normative data for recognition and identification latency, accuracy, and imageability, enabling researchers to select items for experiments based on pre-defined criteria across these dimensions. With this dataset, environmental sounds can be considered at various levels of complexity: sounds produced by the same sources varying in their acoustics (within-class acoustic variability) and acoustically similar sounds produced by different sources (between-category confusion). The dataset can be used for specifying training sets with individual sound sources, defining the categorical boundaries, or providing additional variables to building prediction models.",

We quantified motor\nsimilarity between each observer and stimulus kinematics and examined its impact on neural\nrepresentations within the action observation network. Motor similarity sharpened affective\nrepresentations in inferior frontal gyrus: cross-validated classifiers trained on high-similarity\ntrials decoded valence reliably above chance and outperformed classifiers trained on low-simi-\nlarity trials. In contrast, motor similarity attenuated univariate BOLD responses in inferior pa-\nrietal lobule, consistent with reduced prediction error under more precise priors.

Affective inten-\nsity further modulated neural precision in inferior frontal gyrus, revealing an interaction\nbetween social salience and embodied priors. Together, these converging neural and behavio-\nral results adjudicate between competing accounts by demonstrating a principled double dis-\nsociation: representational sharpening in inferior frontal gyrus without increased activation,\nalongside attenuation in inferior parietal lobule under higher similarity, supporting a hierar-\nchical predictive coding framework for social perception.

          "abstract": "Biased information processing plays an important role in mental disorders. This study investi-gates biases in value-based decision making and how links to psychological resilience can be accounted for by individual differences in the cognitive and neural processing of affective in-formation. Decision making was studied in 82 people (41 female, 41 male; age: 18–37 years) using a cost-benefit integration task. Neural activity was recorded via fMRI, cognitive pro-cessing modeled with an evidence-accumulation model. Choice bias was positively associated with self-reported resilience (particularly the facet ‘acceptance’) – and this association was me-diated by differences in the neural processing of affective information during decision making: Participants with a more positive bias and higher resilience showed stronger increases in neural activity in response to loss in ten prefrontal and parietal brain regions – and stronger decreases in response to gain in the right inferior frontal junction. Cognitive-computational modeling re-vealed that more positive biases were associated with lower sensitivity to and lower valuation of negative information – along with relatively higher sensitivity to and higher valuation of positive information. Notably, higher valuation of positive information was associated with stronger neural responses to negative information in dACC and bilateral insula. Finally, bias and resili-ence were associated with differential functional connectivity between prefrontal seeds, midbrain, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest that stronger activation of brain regions associated with cognitive control – specifically in response to negative information – promotes a positive cognitive bias in affective decision making that may support resilience to mental disorders.",

Using survey data from 784 Chinese consumers, we show that migrants from small to large cities exhibit significantly higher AI acceptance than non-migrants, and that this acceptance fully mediates their greater purchase intention. The effect is sequentially transmitted through enhanced self-esteem. Personality traits also play a role. Openness and conscientiousness increase acceptance, whereas neuroticism reduces it. However, the positive effect of openness is attenuated among individuals who remain in small cities. Gender dynamics reveal an asymmetry: men report higher overall AI acceptance but lower purchase intention toward female AI presenters. Finally, both greater monthly expenditure and broader product category diversity enhance AI acceptance, although among migrants the benefit of high expenditure diminishes when combined with high diversity, a pattern we refer to as the “complexity paradox.” By integrating environmental transitions with psychological traits, this study extends the Technology Acceptance Model and provides actionable insights for targeting migrants and optimizing AI influencer design.",

          "abstract": "Social cues affect psychological and physiological processes governing energy allocation across domains, but their effects on energy expenditure during physical activity remain unclear. We conducted two within-subjects field experiments with competitive rowers in the UK to test whether social support cues affect perceptions of effort and fatigue, energy expenditure, and physical outputs. In Study 1, 26 adolescents completed time-to-task- failure rowing trials while viewing photos of a supportive person or a stranger. In Study 2, 25 adults completed 20-minute fixed-pace trials followed by 2km time trials under three conditions: stranger photo, supportive person photo, or supportive person photo plus companion present. Social support conditions led to longer rowing times (Study 1), faster 2km times (Study 2), and less perceived fatigue during fixed-pace trials. Energy expenditure increased with longer exercise times, while energetic efficiency remained constant across conditions. Findings suggest social support can increase energy expenditure during physical activity via reducing fatigue.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that selective attention can be strategically directed to prioritize items of higher ‘value’ in working memory. This work has typically been limited to tests of feature binding using simple ‘unitized’ colored shapes as memoranda. The current study explored whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiments 2a and 2b). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2a and 2b found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across these experiments, there was no evidence for interaction between binding condition and prioritization; participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space or modality. The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, and suggest that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of material.",

We assessed symptom improvements associated with treatment elements, represented by modules within modular psychotherapy.\n\nMethods: Data from six clinical trials of the MATCH modular psychotherapy were combined (N=490; 5403 sessions; 6-15 years) to test effects of modules grouped into seven common treatment principles: Feeling Calm (e.g., relaxation strategies), Increasing Motivation (e.g., contingency management), Repairing Thoughts (e.g., cognitive restructuring), Solving Problems (e.g., problem solving), Trying the Opposite (e.g., exposure), Engagement/Psychoeducation (e.g., building rapport), and Future Planning (e.g., planning skill use). Multi-level models with autoregressive covariance controlled for previous symptoms, session number, and baseline symptoms; accounted for temporality with each session occurring prior to associated outcomes; importantly, we modeled associations between outcomes and between- and within-person use of treatment principles. Measures included weekly youth- and caregiver-reported internalizing, externalizing, and total symptoms, plus idiographic top problems.\n\nResults: A between-person effect linked Future Planning (B’s=-.369 — -.368; p’s&lt;.05) to better outcomes. Better within-person effects were observed for Increasing Motivation (B’s=-0.087 — -0.057; p's&lt;.05), Trying the Opposite (B’s=-.087 – -.056); p’s&lt;.05), and Future Planning (B=-0.146; p&lt;.001). Six outcomes showed worse within-person effects for Engagement/Psychoeducation (B’s=.036 — .099; p’s&lt;.05); efforts to build engagement drove this finding; those efforts were associated with less use of skills-focused principles.\n\nConclusions: Increasing Motivation, Trying the Opposite, and Future Planning were associated with especially good outcomes; therapists’ engagement attempts were associated with less focus on skill-building, and poorer immediate outcomes. Results may inform youth psychotherapy decision-making research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Research indicates autistic defendants are treated more leniently than non-autistic defendants. However, it is unclear whether this is caused by positive perceptions of autistic people, or because autism is a relevant mitigating factor. Across two studies we tested how mock jurors evaluated autistic defendants in autism relevant and irrelevant criminal cases to better understand when and why autistic defendants receive leniency. Further, we provided some of the participants with educational information about ASD allowing these participants to recognise autism as a relevant mitigation for criminal cases for which autistic traits can be a risk factor (assault and stalking cases, but not burglary cases).\nDefendants with ASD only received lower sentences when autism was a relevant mitigation (assault and stalking), but not when autism was irrelevant (burglary). Thus, participants did not simply give preferential treatment to autistic defendants, but considered how ASD was related to the offense. However, providing information about autism weakened these effects, indicating educating people about autism may not always benefit autistic defendants.\nOur study highlights the importance of nuanced messaging about autism. While explaining how autistic characteristics can explain criminal behaviour may reduce perceptions of criminal responsibility, it may also imply greater dangerousness or risk of reoffending.",

          "abstract": "How do we create new language? Drawing on the observation that some languages—such as Pirahã—are almost entirely without a number system, this work explores what other features of human language could be fundamental yet remain unrealized. We propose the super language framework, a modular approach for iterating new forms (e.g. phonetic or morphological containers) and interpretations (e.g. semantic or pragmatic functions) on top of any base language. The resulting augmented variants are organized into a typology serving as a roadmap for experimentation. As a simple proof of concept, we present StegaPhone, a super language prototype that hides binary data within deliberate mispronunciations (e.g. “swim” vs. “svim”), thereby extending a phonetic layer into a parallel communication channel. To operationalize the framework, we outline a transformation engine—a rewrite-based system capable of covering the space of possible language modifications in a standardized, invertible manner. We argue that this “tip of the spear” architecture enables rapid language development and productive feedback loops across the domains in which it may be applied. Finally, we situate the significance of such a heuristic approach by considering the central role of language in communication, cognition, machine interfaces, and beyond, underscoring how new features have, and can continue, to impart transformative capabilities onto their operators.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers usually make sense of regression models by interpreting coefficient estimates directly. This works well enough for simple linear models, but is more challenging for more complex models with, for example, categorical variables, interactions, non-linearities, and hierarchical structures. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to making sense of statistical models. The central idea is to abstract away from the mechanics of estimation, and to treat models as “counterfactual prediction machines,” which are subsequently queried to estimate quantities and conduct tests that matter substantively. This workflow is model-agnostic; it can be applied in a consistent fashion to draw causal or descriptive inference from a wide range of models. We illustrate how to implement this workflow with the marginaleffects package, which supports over 100 different classes of models in R and Python, and present two worked examples. These examples show how the workflow can be applied across designs (e.g., observational study, randomized experiment) to answer different research questions (e.g., associations, causal effects, effect heterogeneity) while facing various challenges (e.g., controlling for confounders in a flexible manner, modelling ordinal outcomes, and interpreting non-linear models).",

No one path into extremism has been identified in the literature, with no specific profile of those who engage in radicalisation, extremism and/or terrorism existing. The GLM allows for a focus on individuality and identity, accounting for the variation of individual’s found to hold extremist views.

          "abstract": "Background: Explanatory frameworks for mental disorders have an important effect on stigmatisation and clinical attitudes, with mechanistic biological explanations often yielding mixed or negative effects on prognostic optimism and empathy. Evolutionary framings may offer functional, non-pathologizing explanations which could reduce stigma and empower patients, but few attempts have been made to test this empirically.\n\nAims: This study aimed to experimentally test whether a brief educational intervention based on an evolutionary explanation of anxiety, compared to a genetic explanation, would influence clinicians’ attitudes in directions consistent with anti-stigma goals.\n\nMethod: In a pre-registered, multi-site, double-blind experiment, 171 practicing mental health clinicians across the UK and Ireland were cluster-randomised by session to receive a 30-minute educational presentation on either evolutionary or genetic explanations for anxiety. Pre- and post-session questionnaires assessed clinicians’ optimism regarding patient recovery, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, expected patient willingness to share diagnoses and engage in help-seeking behavior, and the perceived usefulness of the information. Data were analysed using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression and linear regression.\n\nResults: Compared to the genetic explanation, clinicians rated the evolutionary explanation as substantially more useful for patients (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.05, 95% Credible Interval [CI] [2.46, 10.28]) and for clinicians (OR = 3.10, 95% CI [1.62, 5.81]). These showed very large mean effect sizes, of 1.07 SD (95% CI [0.65, 1.50]) and 0.76 SD CI (95% CI [0.38, 1.17]). In comparison to the genetic explanation, the evolutionary explanation was also anticipated to increase public willingness to seek psychiatric help (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [0.93, 3.35]) and share a diagnosis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.88, 2.97]). It also increased optimism about patient recovery (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.71, 3.46]), and the perceived effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.84, 3.10]). Furthermore, it increased clinicians’ belief in the functional usefulness of negative emotions (β = 0.25 SD, 95% CI [0.49, 0.01]).\nConclusions: Distinct explanatory frameworks may be a potent determinant of clinicians' and patients’ attitudes. This study provides robust evidence that framing anxiety through an evolutionary lens can be a powerful tool to foster more optimistic and destigmatized perspectives, compared to a genetic explanation. In particular, clinicians overwhelmingly rated evolutionary explanations of anxiety as highly useful in comparison to genetic explanations. Integrating evolutionary explanations into mainstream clinical education presents an under-explored opportunity with numerous potential benefits.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

          "abstract": "Successful coordination of infant attention and parent speech during free play supports infants' language development. Parents' responsive linguistic input reduces uncertainty in label-referent associations and provides information at moments of infants' increased attention and receptiveness. While infants frequently lead the dyads’ focus of attention, parent speech has been shown to scaffold infants’ attention towards fixated objects. So far, however, little is known about the qualitative characteristics of parent speech during such interactions, and their effects on infants' attention. Here, we analysed the role of the content and communicative intent of caregivers' speech to their 18-month-old infants (N = 31) during free play when infants or parents led an interaction, and when parent speech sustained infant attention. Interactions were most likely to be infant-led, both temporally and topically, and parents' topically aligned, but not misaligned speech sustained infants' attention. Qualitative analysis of speech types revealed mostly object- and play-focused speech in interactions with familiar objects, but a broader range of speech types and more questions in interactions with novel objects. We hypothesize that speech in interactions with familiar objects is structured by shared experience, whereas the lack of common ground with novel objects induces parents to use more varied speech to engage their infants.",

          "abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) equipped with general learning algorithms, but no linguistic knowledge, can learn to associate words with objects in naturalistic scenes when trained on head-mounted video recordings from a single child’s first-person experience. Similarly, ANNs can master syntax when trained on a similar amount of linguistic data a child experiences in a few years. These findings have been taken to challenge the view that innate linguistic priors play a role in child language acquisition. Here I show that the training environments and learning resources of ANN and humans are poorly matched, and accordingly, conclusions regarding human language priors are not merited. I also review three sets of findings that strongly suggest ANNs are missing human inductive biases: (1) children (but not ANNs) create new well-structured languages when only exposed to degraded ones; (2) ANN (but not humans) learn impossible and possible human languages in similar ways with similar facility; and (3) humans (but not ANNs) show a critical period for language learning. In this last case, adding an “innate” inductive prior to the ANN results in better ANN-human alignment. Just as is the case regarding claims of ANN-human alignment in the domain of vision, conclusions regarding ANN-human alignment in the domain of language is characterized by a lack of severe testing of hypotheses.",

Workplace conditions can either safeguard or intensify these challenges, with implications for maternal mental health and wellbeing. Aim: To explore the psychosocial experiences of mothers returning to work following maternity leave, focusing on the experience with workplace support and sleep deprivation. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted using an open-ended online survey. Twenty-five mothers in the UK with an infant under two years of age who had recently returned to work or were return following maternity leave. Participants were recruited via mother-and-baby groups, social media, and personal networks using purposive sampling. Reflexive thematic analysis was used, with analytical attention to maternal mental health, workplace structures, and sleep-related challenges. Findings: Five interrelated themes were developed as follows: Making Ends Meet, Losing Myself; The Bittersweet Return; Workplaces That Work (or Don’t); Running on Empty; and This Isn’t Just My Struggle. Conclusions: Returning to work within the first two years postpartum is shaped by financial necessity, identity negotiations, disrupted sleep, and highly variable workplace support. Findings highlight the need for compassionate, flexible, and inclusive workplace policies that recognise the ongoing caregiving demands of new mothers and support their health and wellbeing during this transition.",

Study 1 (N=973) shows that undergraduates who endorse IIB are more likely to pursue careers benefiting future generations, with legacy concerns mediating this link. Study 2 (N=795) finds that professionals with greater intergenerational concern report higher job satisfaction via legacy motivation and work meaningfulness. Finally, a pre-registered experiment (Study 3; N=1,240) demonstrates that reflecting on one’s intergenerational impact increases legacy motivation, meaningfulness, and, in turn, job satisfaction.

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

Of cognitive factors, pseudoscientific beliefs, lower scores on the actively open-minded thinking scale, and higher preference for anecdotal information were related to increased tendency to believe in epistemically suspect claims related to COVID-19. Of social factors, lower trust in governmental institutions and science and scientists, and the use of alternative media were associated with the endorsement of epistemically suspect claims about COVID-19. Men were more likely to endorse epistemically suspect claims than women, and the support decreased with age. The present results suggest that epistemically suspect beliefs about COVID-19 are not generally common among the Finnish population. The results suggest that battling the spread of health-related misinformation, like COVID-19 conspiracy theories, may require actions that target different cognitive and social factors, such as the thinking style of individuals; trust felt towards governmental institutions, science, and mainstream media; and the content circulating in social and alternative media.",

          "abstract": "The MultiModal Imitation Task (MMIT) has been developed to jointly assess the imitation of sentence, prosody, and gestures in children. The MMIT focuses on multimodal language abilities and includes four scores (sentence imitation, prosody imitation, gesture imitation, MMIT total). Psychometric properties of the tool were analyzed on a sample of 235 typically-developing children of 3 to 6 years of age. The results showed good validity and reliability of the tool. The MMIT had excellent internal consistency and interrater reliability, suggesting that the items are coherent and intercorrelated and the scoring system is reliable. The MMIT showed adequate convergent validity with other previously validated and standardized tests to assess sentence and prosody imitation. The relevance and adequacy of the MMIT items were confirmed by expert evaluations. Overall, the MMIT is a valuable, reliable, appropriate, and practical tool for the assessment of multimodal imitation skills in children of preschool and primary school ages.",

          "abstract": "Effective self-regulated learning depends on metacognitive monitoring and control abilities, which allow learners to recognise what they do not know and adjust their learning behaviour to address knowledge gaps. However, children’s metacognitive abilities are still developing, which can hinder their ability to select relevant information effectively. This work examines whether providing feedback on children’s knowledge tests can assist their metacognitive monitoring and control processes, improving their ability to target information-seeking to fill knowledge gaps. In two experiments, 5-9-year-old children (N=203) completed a word-learning task on a tablet. They were then tested on their knowledge of the novel word-object associations and asked to report their (un)certainty in their answers. In the first experiment, children received feedback after each test trial. In both experiments, children received summary feedback at the end of the test. Afterwards, they could select some of the objects to hear their labels again and were tested on their recognition of the label-object associations once more. In both experiments, feedback boosted children’s ability to strategically seek information to fill their knowledge gaps. Moreover, when given feedback after each test trial, children based their uncertainty judgments on their previous performance. While this resulted in younger children’s uncertainty judgments to better reflect their performance, older children’s judgments were less accurate than without feedback. Importantly, children’s information-seeking was better guided by feedback than by their own subjective uncertainty, indicating that feedback provides a valuable external means for metacognitive control. Overall, the findings underscore the role of feedback in fostering the development of metacognition and self-regulated learning in childhood.",

          "abstract": "Intelligent systems—from autonomous vehicles to decision support tools—are reshaping everyday activities, yet their adoption is often tempered by users’ perceived risk. Perceived risk significantly influences users' decisions to adopt or reject such systems, highlighting the critical need to understand and mitigate them. However, existing measurement tools for assessing perceived risk remain inadequate, limiting effective intervention and research efforts. To address this gap, we developed and validated a multidimensional scale of perceived risk in intelligent system interaction, focusing on three representative safety-critical domains: autonomous vehicles, medical decision support systems, and financial decision support systems. Step 1 involved item generation based on literature analysis. Step 2 employed exploratory factor analysis to refine the scale structure (N = 644). In Step 3, confirmatory factor analyses and additional validation procedures (N = 639) confirmed a robust six-factor model: Third-Party Risk, Operational Cost Risk, Social Appraisal Risk, Probability and Severity Risk, Affective Risk, and Performance Integrity Risk. The final scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including reliability, discriminant validity, and predictive validity for user trust, satisfaction, and intention to use. This scale offers researchers and practitioners a rigorously validated instrument for diagnosing perceived risk in safety‑critical intelligent systems and guiding targeted mitigation strategies that can enhance acceptance, usability.",

Here we revisit this debate using one of the largest Think-Aloud datasets to date—44,038 paired transcripts and choices in risky decision-making. Our results make three contributions. First, concurrent Think-Aloud analyzed with large language models (LLMs) surpasses classic cognitive models and neural networks in predicting behavior, showing that verbal reports contain generative information beyond behavior alone. Second, Think-Aloud generalizes across individuals with only a few examples, reflecting shared cognitive patterns. Third, Think-Aloud guides LLMs toward more human-like reasoning. Together, these findings position Think-Aloud as a scalable complement to behavioral measures, reopening a foundational debate in cognitive science and informing human-aligned AI.",

          "abstract": "Although absolute pitch (AP) is often celebrated as a rare musical gift, Western tonal music relies on relative pitch (RP), where meaning depends on intervals to the tonic. This contrast furnishes a natural test bed for cognitive control: AP is an automatic, stimulus-bound code, whereas RP requires context-dependent computation. We tested 50 non–music-major students spanning the AP proficiency continuum on a movable-Do solfa-naming task under three tonal contexts of rising difficulty (fixed C major, fixed B major, randomly shifting keys). AP gave an overall advantage, yet error pattern and response time analyses showed systematic strategy switching among AP possessors: (i) AP use in C major, (ii) pitch name transposition in B major, and (iii) interval/chord listening in random keys, with individual differences. Non AP participants relied on RP across conditions. Thus, scale note identification recruits adaptive strategy selection governed by AP proficiency, tonal context, and cognitive load, illustrating cognitive control in a naturalistic musical task and motivating tailored ear training in music education.",

          "abstract": "People often predict how they might feel in the future, with varying degrees of accuracy.  Such affective forecasts can centre around periods of time (e.g., tomorrow, next week) and/or specific events (e.g., an upcoming meeting). Affective forecasts for quotidian events or periods of time are the building blocks of everyday decision-making. Yet, most affective forecasting research has focused on forecasting accuracy for rare and consequential events, such as election results and romantic break-ups. Therefore, in two intensive longitudinal datasets, we tested everyday forecasting accuracy in general and in relation to specific unpleasant events. In Study 1—a week-long experience sampling study—participants (N=209) provided (i) one weekly forecast about their feelings over the next week, and (ii) daily forecasts about their feelings the next day. Participants also rated their (i) daily affect each evening, and (ii) their momentary affect nine times each day. In Study 2—a two-week daily diary—participants (N=69) nominated an upcoming unpleasant event each day and forecasted their affect in relation to that event. Each evening, participants rated how they felt when this event occurred. We found that participants could predict when a day/event would make them feel better/worse than usual, showing relative accuracy, but sometimes made small errors in forecasting their absolute affect levels, showing absolute inaccuracy. These findings suggest that people make smaller forecasting errors in everyday life than for major events, which likely aids everyday decision making, for example by informing the use of future-oriented affect-regulation strategies (e.g., situation selection).",

          "abstract": "Objective. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) offer scalable solutions to traditional barriers in mental healthcare. Acceptability of DMHIs might differ among patients with differing level of symptoms and relational difficulties. This study investigated how a person’s psychological profile, including their level of mental health symptoms, epistemic trust, and attachment security, predicts their acceptance of AI-based interventions (avatars, chatbots) versus human-delivered teletherapy. \nMethod. Using cluster analysis on survey data from 1,612 (potential) patients and clinicians recruited via Prolifc, we identified three distinct psychological profiles: “Avoidant-not trusting,” “Secure-trusting-healthy,” and “Young-anxious-gullible-symptomatic.”\nResults. Results showed a paradoxical pattern: Individuals in the two most vulnerable clusters (“Avoidant-not trusting” and “Young-anxious-gullible-symptomatic”) demonstrated significantly higher acceptance of AI-based DMHIs. In contrast, the psychologically healthier “Secure-trusting-healthy” cluster showed the lowest AI-based DMHI acceptance and the highest acceptance of teletherapy. Also, having therapy experience as provider or patient was associated with lower AI acceptance in general. \nConclusion. These findings suggest that AI-based interventions may be uniquely suited to reach individuals who struggle with human-to-human therapeutic relationships, thereby serving as a critical entry point to care for those who need it most. However, those vulnerable people might also miss out on the relational learning that takes place in human-based therapies.",

          "abstract": "As educational systems evolve, ensuring that assessment items remain aligned with content standards is essential for maintaining fairness and instructional relevance. Traditional human alignment reviews are accurate but slow and labor-intensive, especially across large item banks. This study examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can accelerate this process without sacrificing accuracy. Using over 12,000 item–skill pairs in grades K–5, we tested three LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o) across three tasks that mirror real-world challenges: identifying misaligned items, selecting the correct skill from the full set of standards, and narrowing candidate lists prior to classification. In Study 1, GPT-4o-mini correctly identified alignment status in approximately 83–94% of cases, including subtle misalignments. In Study 2, performance remained strong in mathematics but was lower for reading, where standards are more semantically overlapping. Study 3 demonstrated that pre-filtering candidate skills substantially improved results, with the correct skill appearing among the top five suggestions more than 95% of the time. These findings suggest that LLMs, particularly when paired with candidate filtering strategies, can significantly reduce the manual burden of item review while preserving alignment accuracy. We recommend the development of hybrid pipelines that combine LLM-based screening with human review in ambiguous cases, offering a scalable solution for ongoing item validation and instructional alignment.",

          "abstract": "Background: Explanatory frameworks for mental disorders have an important effect on stigmatisation and clinical attitudes, with mechanistic biological explanations often yielding mixed or negative effects on prognostic optimism and empathy. Evolutionary framings may offer functional, non-pathologizing explanations which could reduce stigma and empower patients, but few attempts have been made to test this empirically.\n\nAims: This study aimed to experimentally test whether a brief educational intervention based on an evolutionary explanation of anxiety, compared to a genetic explanation, would influence clinicians’ attitudes in directions consistent with anti-stigma goals.\n\nMethod: In a pre-registered, multi-site, double-blind experiment, 171 practicing mental health clinicians across the UK and Ireland were cluster-randomised by session to receive a 30-minute educational presentation on either evolutionary or genetic explanations for anxiety. Pre- and post-session questionnaires assessed clinicians’ optimism regarding patient recovery, the efficacy of psychosocial interventions, expected patient willingness to share diagnoses and engage in help-seeking behavior, and the perceived usefulness of the information. Data were analysed using Bayesian cumulative ordinal regression and linear regression.\n\nResults: Compared to the genetic explanation, clinicians rated the evolutionary explanation as substantially more useful for patients (Odds Ratio [OR] = 5.05, 95% Credible Interval [CI] [2.46, 10.28]) and for clinicians (OR = 3.10, 95% CI [1.62, 5.81]). These showed very large mean effect sizes, of 1.07 SD (95% CI [0.65, 1.50]) and 0.76 SD CI (95% CI [0.38, 1.17]). In comparison to the genetic explanation, the evolutionary explanation was also anticipated to increase public willingness to seek psychiatric help (OR = 1.79, 95% CI [0.93, 3.35]) and share a diagnosis (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.88, 2.97]). It also increased optimism about patient recovery (OR = 1.58, 95% CI [0.71, 3.46]), and the perceived effectiveness of psychosocial interventions (OR = 1.62, 95% CI [0.84, 3.10]). Furthermore, it increased clinicians’ belief in the functional usefulness of negative emotions (β = 0.25 SD, 95% CI [0.49, 0.01]).\nConclusions: Distinct explanatory frameworks may be a potent determinant of clinicians' and patients’ attitudes. This study provides robust evidence that framing anxiety through an evolutionary lens can be a powerful tool to foster more optimistic and destigmatized perspectives, compared to a genetic explanation. In particular, clinicians overwhelmingly rated evolutionary explanations of anxiety as highly useful in comparison to genetic explanations. Integrating evolutionary explanations into mainstream clinical education presents an under-explored opportunity with numerous potential benefits.",

          "abstract": "Access to mental health care is shaped by two interdependent dimensions: availability and affordability. Prior research has emphasized shortages of psychiatrists and provider counts, but has rarely considered affordability alongside availability or included the broader psychotherapy workforce. This study addresses these gaps by analyzing over 460,000 psychotherapists listed in the Psychology Today directory, which provides consumer-facing data on fees and insurance acceptance. We constructed county-level indices of availability (providers per 100,000 residents) and affordability (ten-session cost relative to disposable income) across 2,565 U.S. counties. Results show persistent rural–urban disparities: provider density was highest in metropolitan cores and lowest in rural and conservative counties, while financial burdens were systematically greater outside large metropolitan areas, especially in the South. Although availability and affordability frequently overlap, important divergences emerge, including counties with providers present but financially inaccessible. Regression analyses reveal that income is the strongest predictor across both indices, with political partisanship and racial/ethnic composition also shaping access. By integrating supply and cost, this study empirically reframes accessibility as multidimensional and identifies regions most affected by dual disadvantages. Findings highlight affordability as a distinct axis of accessibility and underscore the need for targeted workforce and financial interventions, including Medicaid expansion.",

Random-effects models estimated pooled correlations for total symptoms and four core OC symptom dimensions (symmetry/ordering, unacceptable thoughts, checking/responsibility, and contamination/washing). Moderator analyses examined clinical status and cultural orientation.\n\nResults:\nAcross studies, self-compassion was moderately and negatively associated with OC symptom severity (r = –0.34, 95% CI [–0.39, –0.30]), with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 40%). All four symptom dimensions were inversely associated with self-compassion, with the strongest association emerging for unacceptable thoughts (r = –0.41). Neither clinical status nor cultural orientation significantly moderated effects. Funnel plot symmetry and fail-safe N analyses indicated minimal publication bias.\n\nDiscussion:\nFindings suggest that lower self-compassion is reliably linked to greater OC symptom severity across studies, samples (clinical vs. community), and cultures (individualist vs collectivist), particularly for unacceptable thoughts. These results highlight self-compassion as a potential therapeutic target in OCD, warranting investigation in longitudinal and interventional studies.\n\nKeywords: obsessive-compulsive; OCD; self-compassion; meta-analysis",

          "abstract": "Menstrual distress is common among menstruating people and can have a profound negative impact on mental health and well-being. Romantic partners can support dealing with emotional and physical stress, yet their role in dealing with menstrual distress specifically remains underexplored. Adopting a biopsychosocial perspective, this qualitative study aims to shed light on the experience of menstrual distress within romantic relationships. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 individuals (aged 19-59, living in Austria), who were in romantic relationships (n = 23 heterosexual, n = 2 homosexual, n = 5 open, n = 6 committed, n = 17 monogamous, n = 3 queer, n = 1 casual). Indeed, romantic partners play a crucial role in shaping both the impact of and coping mechanisms for menstrual distress. Due to the intimate nature of romantic relationships, partners influence experiences of menstrual distress, whether actively engaging with the topic or not. Supportive relationships fostering authenticity, communication, and teamwork enhance coping, whereas negative partner responses can perpetuate negative stereotypes, stigma, and symptom trivialisation. To enhance individuals’ and couples’ well-being, educational campaigns should raise menstrual health awareness early, and couples may benefit from guidance in managing the challenges effectively.",

          "abstract": "In a recent landmark effort, an international collaboration of cognitive scientists produced Psych-101, the largest behavioral dataset on human cognition described in natural language, comprising over 10 million human decisions across 160 psychological experiments. Building on this resource, the authors fine-tuned a pretrained large language model (LLM) to predict human choices in these experiments, called Centaur. While Centaur demonstrates impressive predictive performance—especially compared to domain-specific cognitive models—we find that much of its advantage stems from leveraging sequential dependencies in human choices. Over-reliance on such dependencies risks marginalizing the task-driven mechanisms that are also central to explaining human behavior. By reanalyzing the original Centaur model through controlled experiments that isolate task information and choice history, we find that Centaur outperforms domain-specific cognitive models even when no psychological task is provided, yet underperforms in other tasks where choice history is removed. These findings suggest that Centaur may have learned a shortcut that is insensitive to psychological tasks.",

          "authors": "Domenic Groh",
          "abstract": "The Test-Retest Coefficient (TRC) is a central metric of reliability in Classical Test Theory and modern psychological assessments. Originally developed by early 20th-century psychometri-cians, it relies on the assumptions of fixed (i.e., perfectly stable) true scores and independent error scores. However, these assumptions are rarely, if ever, tested, despite the fact that their violation can introduce significant biases. This article explores the foundations of these assump-tions and examines the performance of the TRC under varying conditions, including different sample sizes, true score stability, and error score dependence. Using simulated data, results show that decreasing true score stability biases TRC estimates, leading to underestimations of reliability. Additionally, error score dependence can inflate TRC values, making unreliable measures appear reliable. More fundamentally, when these assumptions are violated, the TRC becomes underidentified, meaning that multiple, substantively different data-generating process-es can yield the same coefficient, thus undermining its interpretability. These findings call into question the TRC’s suitability for applied settings, especially when traits fluctuate over time or measurement conditions are uncontrolled. Alternative approaches are briefly discussed",

          "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), including teletherapy and artificial intelligence (AI) powered mental health interventions, such as chatbots and AI avatar-based therapies, have become increasingly prominent, enhancing accessibility and continuity of care while reducing costs. Although these tools are technically feasible and more widely available, the real-world uptake relies on the support of clinicians. Research suggests that factors such as clinicians’ demographic information, professional experience and general attitudes towards technology, influence therapists’ acceptance of DMHIs. The study investigated clinicians’ attitudes toward these DMHIs. A total of 678 clinicians participated, completing various measures on demographics, professional background, AI usage, and acceptance of AI-based intervention formats. Results indicated that technological factors, especially positive attitudes towards AI and previous mental health chatbot experience, were the most significant predictors of clinicians’ levels of acceptance, explaining a substantial portion of the variance in the acceptance of both AI chatbot (34%) and AI virtual therapist (38%) interventions. Understanding these predictors of clinicians’ acceptance is crucial for developing effective digital therapeutic tools and encouraging clinicians to integrate emerging technologies into mental healthcare. Further training and exposure to new technologies should be provided in graduate programs.",

Results showed that neurodivergent students exhibited higher anxiety levels across measures, including mathematics and statistics anxiety. However, only cognitive and somatic anxiety and social anxiety explained individual variance in neurodivergent status after taking into account the effects of other measures. Despite differing anxiety levels (which showed variability between different neurodivergences), neurodivergent and neurotypical students were equivalent in cognitive reflection scores, suggesting similar levels of analytic thinking skills (including reasoning about mathematical content). In both the neurotypical and neurodivergent groups, higher levels of cognitive reflection were associated with male gender, less fear of negative evaluation, and lower mathematics and creativity anxiety, replicating and extending previous work.

          "abstract": "Core features of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (e.g., low empathy, lack of guilt, callousness) are underpinned by emotion processing deficits including dysfunction in emotion reactivity (ERc) and emotion regulation (ER). Additionally, recent research has suggested the presence of heterogeneity in CU traits, such that the primary variant is biologically rooted and marked by hypoarousal, whereas the secondary variant is thought to develop as a response to maltreatment and is marked by hyperarousal. To date, physiological measurement of ERc and ER processes via the parasympathetic nervous system have focused on static methods of measurement; however, dynamic approaches may provide a more nuanced picture of reactive and regulatory processes. The current study sought to identify whether CU trait variants differed on ERc and ER as indexed by both static and dynamic objective physiological markers with the goal of improving our understanding of CU trait development and informing future treatment targets. Participants consisted of 636 youth ages 12-18 recruited from juvenile detention centers. A latent profile analysis identified CU variants using CU traits, anxiety, and posttraumatic arousal and avoidance. Groups were subsequently compared on static and dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) indices of ERc and ER. Only one dynamic measure of ER (i.e., RSA inertia) uniquely differentiated primary and secondary groups, whereas static measures provided little discriminative utility. The current findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of CU trait heterogeneity with respect to emotion processing, allowing us to more effectively target variants in the treatment context.",

An online experiment with UK Premier League supporters (N = 900) tested the effects of ingroup versus outgroup identity appeals on recycling intentions. Across all conditions, reported intentions were high (&gt;88%), with no consistent advantage for ingroup appeals. To assess real behavior, we tested the same group identity-based recycling interventions in a football season-long field experiment at a Norwegian Premier Division stadium (N = 5,712), where visiting fans from 14 clubs were exposed to either an ingroup or an outgroup appeal. Results showed that ingroup appeals alone did not significantly increase recycling rates. However, when combined with a visible group-level social comparison framed as inter-club competition, recycling rates nearly tripled. Two follow-up experiments (N = 3,063) confirmed the key psychological mechanism: a motivation to contribute to the ingroup's success. These findings demonstrate that leveraging social identities can increase PEB in public settings, offering a novel theoretical link and practical strategies to encourage sustainable consumer behavior.",

Building on theorizing on time in media effects research, we propose four patterns of how short-term effects on situational well-being unfold: they may follow processes of ephemerality (fleeting effects), inertia (delayed onset), reversal (changing directions) – or there are no changes over time.

          "abstract": "Cognitive skills tend to grow and change in interdependent ways across development, yet it remains unclear whether (a) early patterns of cognitive coupling depend on social-skill development and (b) whether individual differences in such coupling have predictive value for later behavioral outcomes. We addressed these questions using eight repeated assessments from the NICHD–SECCYD longitudinal study, tracking children from early childhood through adolescence. Using continuous-time structural equation models, we modelled dynamic, reciprocal interactions among cognitive (e.g., vocabulary, attention, memory, executive functioning) and social (e.g., assertion, cooperation, responsibility, self-control, peer competence) domains from age 4.5 to 15 years. Cognitive traits showed stronger overall growth and rank-order stability than social traits, whereas social-emotional skills displayed tighter internal coupling. Executive functioning emerged as a central connector across domains, showing robust cross-domain associations with multiple social skills. Children who exhibited more behavioral problems at age 15 had weaker early cross-domain trait correlations—particularly between (rather than within) cognitive and social domains—indicating lower early developmental integration. By adolescence, these children showed increased cohesion within the cognitive domain but reduced coupling with social traits, suggesting a shift toward domain-specific rather than integrated development. These findings highlight how early differences in the co-development of cognitive and social abilities may shape later behavioral adjustment, supporting a dynamic, systems-level view of developmental risk and adaptation.",

          "abstract": "Effective visual perception surmounts noise, partial information and dynamic changes in stimuli, resulting in perceptual completion that is often studied using illusory contour (IC) stimuli. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from humans yield a characteristic response – the ICeffect – the VEP difference between responses to the presence vs. absence of ICs with multiple phases at ~150-200ms and ~240-400ms post-stimulus onset. To address how motion signals and an individual’s capability to discriminate motion may contribute to perceptual completion as indexed by the ICeffect, we recorded 128-channel VEPs from 20 healthy adults. On each trial, they indicated which of two stimulus arrays was perceived to move (through linear changes in stimulus size), independently of the presence/absence of ICs. Participants were sub-divided based on a median split in task performance: those “adept” and “non-adept” at detecting moving stimuli.  Over the 240-329ms post-stimulus period, responses from “adept” individuals were characterized by distinct topographies depending on whether stimuli were moving, whereas for “non-adept” individuals the same topography characterized responses to both moving and static stimuli. Furthermore, the VEP topography characterizing responses to moving ICs positively correlated with an individual’s motion discrimination accuracy. Source modelling of this ICeffect included regions of the lateral inferior occipital cortices, parahippocampal cortices extending into the insula, the precentral cortex, and middle frontal cortex and underscores the role of both low-level and high-level cortices in IC perception.  Collectively, these data highlight the interplay between motion discrimination and perceptual completion processes.",

          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

          "abstract": "Visual foraging lies at the intersection of visual perception, decision-making and action planning. An attractive feature of this paradigm is that it generates a rich stream of sequential decision data. However, this presents a number of challenges for analysis. To this end, we have developed FoMo, a robust and flexible generative model for spatial-sequential data. Building upon initial work by Clarke et al. (2022b), we present FoMo 2.0, which incorporates spatial structure allowing us to model organised spatial behaviours. We test the model over a range of secondary data sources and show that incorporating these parameters improve model accuracy, predominantly due to improvements for a subset of participants who use grid-following strategies. FoMo therefore allows us to explain results that would previously have been categorised as outliers. A real strength of this generative modelling approach is that it can account for individual differences across the wide range of summary statistics that have previously been used to explore human and non-human animal behaviour, providing a unified framework for analysing these data.",

          "abstract": "Single-graded submissions are the norm for undergraduate level writing assignments. These do not allow for students to take feedback into consideration to refine their literacy skills, leading to modest progress during post-secondary education. Feedback may be seen as judgmental, with no way to improve their writing. Last, this style of writing does not reflect the real-world editorial process like peer-review. ESL students or those from marginalized demographics may be at a further disadvantage when graded on their writing. To address this, we developed and implemented a standardized writing assignment structure that modelled scientific peer review, dubbed the incentivized improvement method (IIM). Student submitted an initial draft that was evaluated based on the effort of submission, irrespective of errors. The rubric was open-ended and students received very little guidance on their initial submission, but were rather told to explore what they believed was appropriate to include in their work, which fostered creative and student-driven learning. Initial submissions received extensive comments from graders and students revised their work for an additional set of marks. After piloting this system in smaller courses, the IIM was implemented in two large undergraduate statistics courses (total N = 361). An anonymous survey recorded feedback from students (N = 143) across both classes. Overwhelmingly, students agreed that the IIM assisted in improving their writing, critical thinking, and developing additional literacy skills relative to single-submission assignments. Graders also noted that the quality of revised submissions exceeded expected academic performance. Notably, ESL students found the IIM quite effective in developing their English language skills. Importantly, many students’ qualitative feedback indicated that they would prefer the IIM in other STEM-related courses. In conclusion, the IIM, a standardized revision-based writing assignment, is an effective method to improve literacy skills in a diverse undergraduate student population.",

          "abstract": "The success and failure of human coordination critically depend on the ability to anticipate and adapt to both one’s own and others’ actions. While theoretical models emphasize the central role of predictive mechanisms, empirical studies often rely on simplified tasks that do not capture the sensory, motor, and social complexity of real-world joint action. Consequently, it remains unclear which among the many behavioral, cognitive, physiological, demographic, and relational factors truly contribute to coordination success.\nHere, we introduce a quantitative framework to address this gap by identifying key predictors of performance in a fast-paced ball-hitting task, performed both individually (individual-action) and in a turn-taking format with a partner (joint-action). Using high-resolution multimodal tracking of eye and body movements and heart rate, combined with machine learning and Bayesian modeling, we show that coordination success is primarily associated with the similarity in predictive styles between partners, rather than with general anticipatory ability alone. Well-coordinated pairs—defined by sustained, accurate ball exchanges—exhibited similar timing and patterns of anticipatory saccades in the individual-action task and were more synchronized in their predictions of both their own and their partner’s actions during joint performance. In contrast, demographic and relational variables (e.g., gender, height, familiarity), as well as global physiological and motor activity (e.g., overall movement, heart rate), showed minimal association with coordination outcomes.\nBy reverse-engineering the behavioral signatures of successful coordination, our study highlights alignment in action anticipation as a key mechanism and offers a data-driven foundation for improving joint performance in both human–human and human–robot interaction.",

          "abstract": "Music and language are both hierarchically structured: syllables combine into words, and meters are superimposed on musical beats. Statistical Learning (SL) is a learning mechanism that drives speech segmentation and word learning through computation of transitional probabilities between syllables. Individual differences in SL ability are predictive of further language development, and the current study investigated whether Rhythmic Ability (RA; beat/meter perception in rhythmic stimuli) is a mechanism correlating with SL in six- to nine-month-old infants. We further explored whether RA of the parents predicted infant RA and/or SL.\n\tWe used EEG to measure infants’ neural entrainment in two conditions: (1) a speech segmentation SL condition in which transitional probabilities between syllables were the only cue to segment the speech stream into words; (2) a RA condition exposing infants to a syncopated rhythm, yielding a 4/4 meter. We correlated neural entrainment to the words in the SL condition with the meter in the RA condition. Parents completed standardized tasks measuring RA and were asked about their solo and joint (parent-child) engagement with music.\n\tResults revealed a relationship between neural entrainment indexing SL and RA in infants, which was unaffected by infant age. This relationship was specific to neural entrainment to words and meters, suggesting overlapping neural mechanisms for processing items at hierarchically similar levels. We found no evidence that parental RA predicted infant RA or SL. However, frequency of parent-child joint musical engagement appears to have a positive effect on infant RA, paving the way for further studies on this topic.",

          "abstract": "Remembering past events usually takes less time than their actual duration—events are temporally compressed in memory. A recent study found that this compression is not systematic but emerges when continuous events exceed approximately 9 s. Unexpectedly, however, remembering shorter events (3-6 s) took more time than their actual duration. Here, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms behind this increased replay duration of short events. In Experiment 1, we developed a corrected measure accounting for recall initiation time – the time needed to access the beginning of the event. With this correction, the longer replay times for short events disappeared, suggesting the effect was partly due to unmeasured recall initiation time. In Experiment 2, we examined the potential role of a central tendency bias by exposing participants to different ranges of event durations. Replay duration was influenced by the event’s relative position within the duration range, consistent with a central tendency bias. However, for events longer than 9 s, temporal compression occurred consistently across all conditions. Together, these findings suggest that while central tendency influences replay duration, temporal compression systematically emerges when events exceed a few seconds, likely reflecting memory capacity limits in representing continuous experiences.",

          "authors": "Andrea De Bartolo; Yuying Huang; Hamza Qayumi; Kaja Kinga Jasińska",
          "abstract": "Canada has welcomed over 100,000 Syrian refugees since 2015, many of whom have faced displacement-related challenges that shape their socio-emotional well-being. Refugee children, in particular, are at heightened risk for socio-emotional difficulties due to their developmental sensitivity to adversity, exposure to traumatic events, and resettlement stressors. Assessing children’s socio-emotional well-being often relies on both parent-reports and child self-reports; however, discrepancies between these reports commonly occur, and the factors influencing such discrepancies are not well understood, particularly in displaced populations. The present study examined predictors of parent-child discrepancies in reports of socio-emotional well-being and explored whether such discrepancies were associated with children’s learning outcomes. Participants were Syrian refugee children (N = 55, Mage = 14.42) who were resettled in Canada for an average of six years. Results revealed that children consistently self-reported more socio-emotional problems than their parents reported. Moreover, an extended period of displacement significantly predicted greater parent-child discrepancies, suggesting that resettlement-related factors and acculturation influence parent-child discrepancies. Interestingly, discrepancies were not associated with children's learning outcomes. The findings suggest that, while parent-child communication barriers may contribute to discrepancies, differences in how socio-emotional constructs are understood and reported by parents and children. These findings underscore the importance of including multiple informants in socio-emotional well-being assessments and carefully considering cultural and contextual factors when designing assessments, specifically given the complex dynamics in displaced families. Future research is important to advance the literature to determine whether assessments of socio-emotional well-being should be adapted for specific population, as suggested by the present findings.",

          "abstract": "Attention plays a critical role in reading and lies at the core of the theoretical debate between parallel and serial processing. However, direct measurements of attention have long remained elusive. Recently, Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT) has shown promise in directly measuring covert attention allocated to parafoveal words. RIFT involves flickering the background of the target word(s) at an imperceptible frequency (≥60Hz), but imperceptibility does not necessarily equate to the absence of a cognitive effect. The current study examined the potential impact of the RIFT paradigm on eye movements. High- and low-frequency target words were embedded in one-line sentences and displayed randomly in three condition blocks: no tagging, invisible tagging at 60Hz (i.e., RIFT) and visible tagging at 30Hz. Linear Mixed-Effect modelling and Divergence Point Analysis revealed a robust frequency effect, with high-frequency words processed faster than low-frequency words, but no significant differences across the three conditions in terms of its magnitude or onset latency. Overall fixation durations (irrespective of lexical frequency) did not differ between the no tagging and RIFT conditions, but were significantly longer in the visible tagging condition, suggesting that deliberately drawing attention to the tagging area actually slowed down reading. Furthermore, a post-experiment questionnaire indicated relatively low RIFT awareness. These findings suggest that RIFT is a valid tool for measuring attention during that does not interfere with word processing and highlight its potential for application in ecologically valid settings involving eye movements.",

          "abstract": "Cultural products share information from which people can derive knowledge. From this knowledge, a common vision can emerge to achieve a goal. Information shared by cultural products can concern topics related to the natural world and, benefitting from scientific knowledge, could contribute to the achievement of the so desired sustainable development. However, information about nature in cultural products may also have negative effects and accentuate the psychological distance from environmental issues. This article aims to review and discuss studies that highlight both the positive and negative effects of nature-related communications in the cultural entertainment products of visual mass media. The focus is on visual media because they have the potential to effectively and intuitively communicate complex concepts such as environmental issues. We essentially point out the negative psychological effects related to the representations of nature disseminated by such products, and propose a classification of these effects based on the Model of the undesirable effects of communication campaigns. Our results highlight a categorization of a wide range of negative psychological effects, of social and personal character, that can be generated by cultural products that aim to raise awareness of environmental problems. The present review provides a new dimensional perspective that can be used, on the one hand, by researchers of nature representations to frame the phenomenon and, on the other hand, by producers of visual cultural products to avoid the inclusion of involuntary messages with potentially negative effects.",

We explored how the combination of i) window size, ii) window overlap, iii) prewhitening and iv) use of Peak-Picking (PP) algorithm affected several indices of IPS strength and stability, as well as their ability to discriminate between real and surrogate dyads. \nThe original results of the stufy were overall replicated, with all IPS indices successfully discriminating genuine from surrogate synchrony regardless of parameter selection. By contrast, the selection of parameters had a greater influence when distinguishing between task and baseline IPS. Moreover, the PP algorithm tended to overestimate synchrony strength, thereby hindering discrimination. Importantly, measures of synchrony stability proved effective in distinguishing genuine from surrogate synchrony. Based on our multiverse results, we provide recommendations for researchers applying WCC analysis to study cardiac IPS synchrony.",

          "abstract": "Emotional eating (EE) - eating in response to emotions rather than hunger - has high clinical relevance, yet its underlying mechanisms (how?) remain poorly understood. Further questions relate to interindividual differences (who?), and the specific foods (what?) around which EE occurs. To address ‘how’, we investigate whether reaction time-based food approach biases – reflecting motivational tendencies – covary with affect in daily life. To address ‘who’ and ‘what’, we consider trait EE alongside hedonic and goal-related food characteristics. In 76 participants with dietary goals, we measured positive and negative affect and approach bias towards goal-congruent and -incongruent foods on nine midday assessments using ecological momentary assessment and a mobile approach-avoidance task; hedonic food characteristics were assessed with food-specific craving ratings in the evening. Trait EE was assessed using the Salzburg Emotional Eating Scale. There was no direct association between affect and approach bias, nor one moderated by goal-congruency. Instead, affect and approach bias covaried on days with high craving: negative affect was linked to higher approach bias, while positive affect was linked to lower approach bias, especially in participants reporting more intake during negative affect or less intake during positive affect (trait EE), respectively. Our results indicate temporally dynamic relationships between affect and approach biases (how?) that did not emerge as a function of specific food characteristics (what?) but on high craving days (when?) – particularly in trait emotional eaters (who?). Hence, eating behavior might be altered through food approach tendencies during hedonic states opening avenues for mechanistic research and context-sensitive eHealth treatments.",

A sample of 401 adult students (Mage = 20.81, SD = 2.24) reported perceived awareness, sharing intention, and sharing tendency for pro-right, pro-left, anti-right, and anti-left misinformation content on social media. Descriptive analyses revealed a selective diffusion tendency of misinformation rather than a uniform spread. Pro-right narratives were largely disregarded, whereas anti-right claims attracted the greatest engagement, consistent with negative partisanship. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that prior exposure to ideologically congruent content significantly predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond demographic controls, supporting the view that exposure fosters normalization of falsehoods. Right-wing authoritarianism predicted greater willingness to share pro-right and anti-left misinformation, while left-wing authoritarianism selectively predicted anti-right sharing, indicating asymmetrical dispositional pathways. Importantly, effect sizes from chi-square tests were modest, and many participants refrained from sharing content even when they judged it credible. These findings challenge alarmist accounts of an unchecked misinformation epidemic and dismiss assumptions that misinformation is primarily right-driven. Instead, results suggest that misinformation often functions less as mass persuasion than as a tool of strategic antagonism, warranting theoretical frameworks that extend beyond simple left–right dichotomies.",

          "abstract": "During the processing of linguistic dependencies, the presence of a non-dependent word—referred to as a distractor—can sometimes complicate the identification of the correct subject. This phenomenon, known as similarity-based interference, provides a valuable testing ground for competing theories of sentence processing and has garnered significant interest in the field of psycholinguistics. One prominent theory, cue-based retrieval, suggests that the parser initiates a search for the relevant linguistic dependent at the retrieval site (e.g., the verb) based on a set of retrieval cues. In this work, we explore the use of lexicon-specific cues set by classifiers in the retrieval of noun dependents in Mandarin Chinese to provide evidence for the cue-based retrieval mechanism. A further open question is whether the distractor must intervene between the co-dependents (so-called retroactive interference) or whether the distractor can appear to the left of the dependent elements (so-called proactive interference). Previous work has suggested that proactive interference is weaker than retroactive interference, i.e., that the distractor has to intervene between the co-dependents to influence the dependency completion process. Using self-paced reading and A-Maze tasks, and Bayes Factors for hypothesis testing, we found robust evidence for a predicted interference effect in retroactive configurations, but no interference in proactive configurations.

          "authors": "Ava Momeni; Paul Metzak; Maddie Evora; Aida Momeni; Amber Lu; Helen Hsiao; Todd Stephen Woodward",
          "abstract": "Among the cognitive impairments characteristic of schizophrenia, deficits in cognitive control are particularly prominent. In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined the spatial patterns and task-induced blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) changes associated with attentional control deficits in participants with schizophrenia relative to neurotypical participants. We employed a cognitive paradigm that required participants to alternated between three judgment tasks (i.e., identifying colours, parity, or letter case), while being presented with stimuli comprised of  one (univalent), two (bivalent), or three (trivalent) dimension(s). Three cognitive modes were detected: (1) Multiple Demand (MD), (2) Language (LAN), and (3) Default mode B (DM-B). Participants with schizophrenia showed impaired task performance, muted but sustained activations of the MD mode, hypo-activations of the LAN mode, and hyper-deactivations of the DM-B mode relative to neurotypical participants. Thus, attentional control impairments in individuals with schizophrenia are likely due to disrupted activity of the MD, LAN, and DM-B modes. Additionally, in participants with schizophrenia, the sustained activation of the MD mode in the Trivalent condition was associated with higher scores on positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), while the reduced activation of the LAN mode in the Trivalent condition and the pronounced deactivation of the DM-B mode in the Univalent condition were associated with higher scores on negative symptoms (i.e., poverty of speech and flattened affect). Our findings highlight the contributions of fMRI to individualized medicine due to symptom-specific effects, and identifying potential targets for neuromodulation techniques that aim to restore BOLD activity and improve cognitive function in schizophrenia.",

          "abstract": "This paper uses elements of fractal geometry to describe the distribution of income among individuals. It shows the existence of a stochastic fractal relationship between a country’s output and income inequality: the higher the level of income inequality, the lower the country’s output. The framework thus allows us to isolate the impact of inequality on output from that of average growth. A parallel between this framework and a welfarist approach to distributional analysis is also discussed. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

          "title": "The Sextuple Helix Innovation Model. Understanding the Knowledge Production of Artificial Intelligence in Culture- and Creativity-Driven and Sustainable Innovation Ecosystems",
          "authors": "Lutz Peschke",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Sextuple Helix Innovation Model as a novel framework for understanding the role of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in culture- and creativity-driven as well as sustainable innovation ecosystems. Building on the evolution from the Triple Helix (university–industry–government) to the Quintuple Helix (including the media-based/culture-based public and the natural environment), the proposed model adds GenAI as a sixth helix. Unlike previous views of AI as a mere tool, this paper conceptualizes GenAI as an independent knowledge producer with its own knowledge economy, engaged in mutual exchanges with human and institutional actors. The argument is grounded in a constructionist epistemology and knowledge economy theory, validated through a scoping review of scholarly literature across creative industries, cultural policy, and innovation studies. The review reveals that while GenAI augments human creativity by enabling co-creation, ideation, and democratization of cultural production, it simultaneously raises challenges such as curatorialization of labor, reduced diversity of outputs, and threats to artistic autonomy. The framework of mutual creativity emphasizes reciprocal influences: human creativity shapes AI outputs just as AI reshapes human creative processes. By positioning GenAI as an epistemic agent, the Sextuple Helix Innovation Model reframes discourses beyond the dominant narratives of disruption and regulation. It highlights opportunities for transforming labor markets, enabling sustainable cultural practices, and expanding innovation ecologies through “phygital” recombination of digital and traditional forms. At the same time, it underscores the need for critical awareness of biases, cultural sensitivity, and ethical implications inherent in AI-driven knowledge production. Ultimately, the paper argues that recognizing GenAI as a helix in its own right not only deepens our understanding of knowledge economies but also paves the way for creativity- and sustainability-oriented innovation paradigms where human and non-human actors co-produce knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Concern over falling birth rates, and the pronatalist movement in the United States and elsewhere, are increasing as fertility rates decline and societies grow older. Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

          "title": "Eco-digital Posthumanism: Definition, Genealogy, and Research Agenda within the EcoAI Framework",
          "authors": "Gianfranco Rubino",
          "abstract": "The concept of Eco-Digital Posthumanism stands as a theoretical horizon within the EcoAI (Rubino, 2025) Framework, envisioning a posthumanist orientation through which humanity, non-human entities, and technological infrastructures co-constitute shared worlds. \nGrounded in a relational ontology, this perspective refuses ontological separations between ‘human’, ‘environment’, and ‘technology’; instead, it frames them as intra-acting, constitutive elements in dynamic assemblages. Drawing on Karen Barad’s notion of intra-action (Barad, 2007), Donna Haraway’s concept of sympoiesis (Haraway, 2016), and Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethics of relationality (Braidotti, 2013), Eco-Digital Posthumanism offers a robust ontological and ethical basis for reconsidering human-technology-environment relations as fundamentally entangled.\nThe related EcoAI framework proposes that emergent eco-technologies — including sensing infrastructures, AI-driven environmental monitoring, and digitally mediated communal platforms — are not mere tools, but active mediators that shape both material reality and collective subjectivity. In this light, humans are reconceived as eco-technological intra-agents: their agency is neither purely individual nor detached but arises in dyadic and poly-nodal entanglements with environments and technologies. The ethical imperative intrinsic to this view is to design infrastructures and learning ecologies that foster mutual care, multispecies attentiveness, and distributed co-agency.\nA vital tension animates the formation of the Eco-Digital Humanism theory: on one side, the ecological system demands renewed forms of relationality between humans, environments, places, and presences. This demand emphasizes physical co-presence, material engagement, and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledge, embodied awareness, and ecological responsiveness. Here, educational media play a key role: Antonio López defines ecomedia literacy as the critical capacity to comprehend and engage with the reciprocal ecological “footprint” and cultural “mindprint” of media systems (López 2020, DOI:10.4324/9780203731109). This socio-pedagogical pillar grounds the theory in media-ecological practice. It calls for pedagogies and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledges, somatic awareness, and ecological attunement.\nOn the other hand, stands the rise of an immaterial relational geographies: social media, algorithmic platforms, influential digital narratives, ephemeral trend dynamics, and hyper-mediated connectivity craft relational spaces that lean toward an individualistic massification which often replace embodied interaction with curated digital self-expression and mediated connectivity with risks of disembedding relationality. These forces often substitute co-present engagement — with its embodied gestures, proxemics, and spontaneous nonverbal communication — with curated digital self-expression and algorithm-driven interaction. The communication shifts from embodied co-construction to performative self-branding, from tangible immediacy to mediated simulacra. José van Dijck and colleagues analyse how these platforms shape public life and values through infrastructural power (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal 2018, DOI:10.23860/MGDR-2018-03-03-08). Moreover, scholars like Couldry and Mejias warn of data colonialism, where personal data are appropriated in ways akin to digital exploitation (Couldry &amp; Mejias 2019, DOI:10.1177/1527476418796632). These critical sociological perspectives highlight how algorithmic systems can erode embodied co-presence and place-based relationality. This tension must be at the heart of Eco-Digital Humanism: it calls for technologies, pedagogies, and AI systems that restore and augment embodied, place-rooted relational ethics, rather than further eroding them.\nEco-Digital Posthumanism therefore envisions a middle path: techno-ecological designs and curricular frameworks that honour the ecological imperative for reciprocity, material co-presence, and affective attunement, while resisting the flattening of relationality that results from algorithmic mass individualism. In this, Eco-Digital Posthumanism embeds both philosophical depth and sociological grounding (López, van Dijck, Couldry &amp; Mejias), extending ecological posthumanism (as developed by Oppermann, 2016;) and material ecocriticism (Iovino &amp; Oppermann, 2014), by providing a mediation-centred, operational lens for guiding education, ethical design, and the governance of AI-mediated environments.\nIn sum, Eco-Digital Humanism posits that humans, non-humans, and technological systems co-create worlds; that ecological instances of sustainability necessitate relational, place-embedded forms of being and that the rising immaterial relational geographies without proper literacy threaten to separate us from those embodied ecologies. The theory thus demands a reconfiguration — through EcoAI Framework — of pedagogy, policy, and design, so that the digital infrastructures serve ecological relationality rather than displace it.",

          "authors": "Nguyen Thanh Trung; Truong Thi Hoai Linh; Nguyen Tri Khoa",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the bidirectional dynamics between credit growth and banking stability in the context of Vietnam, where the financial system is dominated by banks and the macroprudential framework is strongly strengthened over the period 2008–2024. Using a quarterly panel dataset of 29 Vietnamese commercial banks (Q1/2008–Q4/2024) and a Panel VAR (PVAR) model to handle endogeneity, the study quantifies the time-varying responses of credit growth (CRE) and the stability indicator Z-score to structural shocks. The main results show that: (i) a positive shock to banking stability increases credit in a statistically significant and persistent manner across multiple quarters; (ii) a credit growth shock does not have a significant impact on Z-score in the short–medium horizon; and (iii) the forecast variance decomposition (FEVD) shows asymmetry: Z-score variation is largely “autogenerated”, while CRE variation is increasingly explained by stability shocks (approximately 9–10% in the 10th quarter). Granger causality tests confirm a unidirectional relationship from stability to credit. The findings imply a “stability-first, credit-quality-later” policy priority order: strengthening capital and earnings quality, cross-cyclical provisioning discipline, and maintaining macroprudential tools that help expand credit supply sustainably without sacrificing systemic safety. The study contributes quantitative evidence in emerging markets, complementing the international literature that often emphasizes the credit-to-crisis channel, and suggests extensions to nonlinearities/thresholds and bank-specific heterogeneity.",

          "abstract": "Gender disparity remains a critical concern in sociological research and global policy discourse. In alignment with social mobility theories, the elimination of gender inequality has gained international attention, exemplified by the World Economic Forum’s Global Social Mobility Index (GSMI). Although gender equality is a core objective of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), its formulation from a social mobility perspective remains underexplored in the context of Bangladesh. This study aims to examine the impact of intergenerational social mobility on gender equality in Bangladesh. Using an explanatory research design, the study develops a social mobility model of the Gender Inequality Index (GII) and employs a household survey conducted through a multi-stage sampling technique. Findings indicate that the downward socioeconomic status (SES1) of parents reinforces gender inequality, whereas the upward mobility (SES2) of their children contributes to its reduction. The study concludes that fostering upward social mobility could be instrumental in addressing gender inequality across future generations in Bangladesh. These findings hold consistent across varied datasets, sample frames, and model specifications.",

          "abstract": "This research aims to examine the current state of integrating artificial intelligence into education and training processes from the perspectives of teachers, academics and students. The systematic review method, a qualitative research approach, was employed in conducting the research. An evaluation was conducted based on research theses in Turkey, focusing on education and training, and including artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) applications for teachers, academics, and students. As a result of the search in the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) thesis center, 71 theses were identified by searching the keyword \"artificial intelligence\" in the title and abstract sections of the theses related to \"Education and Training\". The data obtained from the theses were analyzed by the content analysis method. An evaluation was conducted on the use of artificial intelligence technologies in education by examining their distribution according to years, sample groups, study areas, topics, variables addressed, and the results of these variables. According to the findings, there has been a significant increase in the studies on the use of AIEd in the last year. Artificial intelligence is primarily used in language teaching, followed by studies in computer programming and science. Artificial intelligence supported teaching environments, creating course materials with AI, and using tools such as chatbots in teaching processes are among the popular topics. Studies on AIEd have examined numerous variables, examining students' cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning outcomes. While the use of AI has been found to positively impact academic achievement, metacognitive behaviors, and sustained learning, skill-based learning has also yielded positive results in variables such as writing and reading skills in foreign language teaching, problem-solving skills, and creativity, as well as affective learning outcomes such as attitude, satisfaction, and motivation. While teachers and academics' awareness of AI is high, their readiness and anxiety levels are moderate. While teachers stated that they need practical in-service training on the educational use of AI, they have been identified as having some pedagogical, ethical, and technical concerns regarding the use of AIEd. These results are thought to guide new research on the use of AIEd.",

Methods: This study aimed to analyze patients’ experience of the implementation of telemedicine in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh City). Samples from different categories of patients were randomly selected following opportunity sampling techniques. The study population included 332 participants (male and female). For data collection, we used a questionnaire consisting of 8 items. The questions were rated using a 5-point Likert scale (agree, strongly agree, average, disagree, and strongly disagree). Results: A total of 67 (19.5%) participants reported that they use telemedicine only for medical consultation, while 47 (13.7%) said that they use it for diagnosis and treatment as well. The participants revealed that telemedicine saves them time and money. However, they admitted that telemedicine negatively affected their relationship with the service providers. Finally, patients described communication challenges and a lack of confidence in accessing telemedicine. Conclusions: The study concluded that the main barriers to the use of telemedicine services are a lack of confidence in accessing telemedicine, difficulty communicating due to the use of different languages and dialects, and the fact that these services are not suitable for uneducated people.",

          "authors": "Katerina Havrankova",
          "abstract": "This study presents a structured attempt at deciphering the Voynich Manuscript, focusing on folio 78r (from the so-called balneological section depicting bathing women), folio 70v (the Zodiac Capricorn or “Goat” folio from the astrological section), and three herbal folios. The central hypothesis is that the text represents an existing language—most plausibly an archaic form of Basque—recorded phonetically and written with unfamiliar symbols in place of ordinary letters.\n\nThe analysis combines identification of vowels and recurring letter patterns with systematic comparison to Basque vocabulary and morphology, yielding partial but consistent matches. Evidence also points to contact with Old French, Castilian, Gascon, and Latin, reflecting the multilingual environment of late medieval Navarre.\n\nThe herbal folios align with descriptive plant entries typical of medieval herbals, mentioning stems, joints, sap, bitterness, and preparations such as decoctions. Folio 78r, usually interpreted as part of the balneological section, is here read as a description of water channels, basins, and flowing currents, consistent with the illustrations of bathing women. Folio 70v, traditionally identified with Capricorn in the zodiac cycle, is interpreted as a text describing cyclical or seasonal processes, in line with its astrological imagery.\n\nAlthough the translations remain provisional, the findings suggest that the manuscript is unlikely to represent an invented language. Instead, it may be a distorted record of existing speech and knowledge, intentionally obscured through phonetic variation and a disguised script.\n\nThis version integrates methodological refinements and interpretive notes into the main text, while earlier draft material has been removed. The results provide linguistic leads, structural insights, and a testable framework that may serve as a foundation for further philological and contextual research.",

          "abstract": "In this paper I argue that there are many paths forward for a problem that often seems to have no solution at all: the methodological, theoretical, and analytical distinctions that drive the many distinct modes of doing anthropology. The approach I describe aims to help trace dense resonances between branches of anthropological theory that often seem categorically distinct and to add precision, depth, and ultimately generativity to the points at which they are in fact distinct. I do this by introducing a new metatheoretical framework and generative grammar for understanding the relationships between theories of ritual and social process. The starting point for this is the differences themselves between competing or distinct kinds of theory. By developing two multimodal axes, expressing high-dimensional rather than binary forms of differences, a much higher-dimensional, generative space opens up for finding productive resonances and tensions across wide domains of inquiry, ultimately helping to build generative forms of reflexivity for each.",

This study applies machine learning techniques to predict early retirement using Wave 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), incorporating demographic, financial, social, and psychosocial predictors, including the CASP-19 quality-of-life scale. Four tree-based algorithms (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) were compared, with ensemble methods explored to optimize performance. XGBoost achieved optimal performance (ROC-AUC = 0.674, accuracy = 65%), while ensembles provided marginal improvements. Feature importance analysis revealed age as the dominant predictor, followed by aging attitudes, social connections, and financial stress. An ablation study showed CASP-19 adds minor incremental predictive value, with minimal performance decline when excluded. Application to working populations achieved 54% accuracy with self-reported retirement expectations, highlighting gaps between algorithmic predictions and individual intentions. These findings show comprehensive psychosocial assessment enhances prediction beyond traditional economic indicators, informing targeted workforce planning.",

We adopt a cross-case study approach, drawing main sources from government statistics, regulations, social media narratives, and online news. Using the NVivo 12 Plus software, we coded and annotated the research source. Our research revealed that in four case studies, tourism soundscapes emerged as the primary tourist attractions, with other attractions only marginally contributed. Presenting music or acoustic stages enabled tourism industry to reap benefits, particularly for local community and regional income. However, it is important to emphasize sustainability issues, thus, the continuous increased in music soundscape in nature has led to the formation of collaborations among tourism actors, with local communities “Pokdarwis” posed as the principal driving force behind destination development. This study demonstrates that human-manufactured soundscapes have the potential to increase visitor numbers and outperform natural soundscapes in natural destinations.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing online offender mobility. Drawing on multidisciplinary insights, we extend two established criminological models for studying offline offending—the geometry of crime and crime journeys—by adapting their core concepts to cyberspace and developing a topology in which the cyber place is defined and becomes the unit of analysis. Just as offenders travel before, during, and after committing crime offline, we argue they also undertake trips before, during, and after committing cybercrime, and that like offline journeys these cybercrime journeys comprise identifiable and measurable components. We further distinguish between human journeys (what offenders perceive) and data journeys (what happens to the information they transmit). We explicitly demonstrate how concepts from the geometry of crime and crime journeys translate from offline to online crime and mobility. This approach enables the systematic formulation of research questions and the measurement of behavioral patterns, facilitating the generation and accumulation of knowledge on cybercrime offending. The paper illustrates the framework’s theoretical relevance within environmental criminology and its practical application for cybercrime analysis through concrete examples.",

Drawing on the ontological turn in anthropology, agential realism, and processual philosophy, I develop an analytical framework that recognizes algorithms as ontological mediators—entities whose operations participate directly in bringing into being the subjects, temporalities, and social relations they appear merely to process. I introduce three core concepts: ontological mediation, recursive capture, and algorithmic territorialization, supported by methodological innovations in processual ethnography. These tools offer anthropologists new approaches for understanding how computational systems participate in the ongoing constitution of social worlds while remaining attentive to lived experience and cultural meaning.",

Yet this revelatory model, rooted in liberal-democratic contexts, struggles to explain why scandals frequently deepen ambiguity, entrench polarization, or recalibrate legitimacy without resolution. This article develops the concept of scandal as ambivalent governance through three Philippine cases: the Dengvaxia vaccine controversy, Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGOs), and corruption in flood-control projects of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). Building on recent work on trust cultures, relational sovereignties, and constructivation, I argue that scandals are communicative arenas where publics simultaneously affirm and contest authority, extending and withdrawing trust through cultural grammars. Ambivalence is not a democratic deficit but a constitutive condition of communicative life. By theorizing from the Philippines, the framework challenges liberal-democratic models while offering concepts that travel outward, rethinking scandal as a constitutive practice of governance across both South and North.",

          "abstract": "In open-source intelligence (OSINT) research, traditional risk identification methods reliant on expert scoring face growing challenges due to their high subjectivity, cost, and lack of scalability. This study aims to propose and validate an algorithmic framework that transcends expert judgment. Centered on truth discovery, weakly supervised learning, and learning-based ranking, it enables automated, explainable risk identification within complex, multi-source heterogeneous data. The study first constructs a hierarchical-quota sampling system, acquiring and deduplicating data from four source categories: institutional authorities, official statements, mainstream and international reports, and visual materials. Subsequently, a truth discovery algorithm estimates source credibility to replace expert weighting. Weakly supervised labeling functions generate initial annotations, which are then aggregated by generative models to form robust labels. Finally, a learning ranking model dynamically prioritizes risk trajectories, with explainability ensured through Explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP, Grad-CAM). Results demonstrate that this framework reliably identifies risk signals across multiple time windows and control conditions. The classifier achieves PR-AUC improvements exceeding expert baselines, with average absolute error in inflection point localization maintained below 1 hour. It exhibits high consistency and robustness across cross-domain datasets. The study concludes that algorithmic expert-scoring replacement not only excels in accuracy and efficiency but also significantly outperforms traditional models in transparency and reproducibility, offering a systematic, scalable, and cutting-edge approach for OSINT risk research.",

Our approach combines three key elements: dictionary-based identification of policy considerations (developed with LLM assistance), permutation-based statistical testing to identify significant co-occurrences, and network visualization to map thematic clusters. These topic co-occurrence networks reveal the underlying structure of policy discourse on Reddit and illuminate how online political discussions are organized around predictable argumentative frameworks.",

          "abstract": "In November 2024, Iranian musicians Ali Akbar Moradi and Pejman Hadadi toured the US East Coast, performing compositions for the tanbur, a long-necked lute mainly used by the Yarsan followers in western Iran. Despite the largely identical musical content across the concerts, they were all labeled differently. In brochures, artists’ and emcees’ short introductions onstage, and more intimate chats after the concerts, their music might be identified as Iranian, Persian, Kurdish, and/or Yaresan. While some of these titles might be awkward or avoided in Iran due to sociopolitical concerns, they may be deemed suitable for promoting this music among American audiences or the Iranian diaspora in the United States.\nBy comparing the different labels used during Moradi’s 2024 East Coast tour and the way his recordings have been categorized in Iran, this paper examines how labeling processes reflect broader sociopolitical concerns and constraints. Drawing on theories of situational identity (Hall 1996), I argue that social contexts determine not only the way Moradi’s music has been categorized but also the connotations the same category may evoke among different demographics within and outside Iran. In this study, I use participant observation and unstructured interviews with artists and facilitators during and after the events, as well as investigating the labels used for Moradi’s previous recordings in online music streaming databases. This study shows how a seemingly innocuous concert series can serve as a lens for understanding Iran's complex sociopolitical landscape, ethnic/national factions, and ideological perspectives.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Social norms, understood as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, can help resolve collective action problems by making salient collectively beneficial equilibria. However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

          "abstract": "This essay employs a critical cultural analysis to examine Beres Hammond’s Putting Up Resistance as a thematically complete reggae composition. Grounded in Afro-Caribbean philosophy, Black radical thought, and Rastafarian epistemology, the analysis positions the song not merely as entertainment but as a cultural text and sonic archive of resistance. By engaging with Hammond’s lyrics, delivery, and thematic structure, the paper argues that the song exemplifies reggae’s emancipatory ethos through its synthesis of systemic critique, emotional and familial love, and a spirit of resilience. Methodologically, the paper combines lyrical close reading with historical and philosophical contextualisation, drawing on Caribbean and diasporic cultural studies to highlight reggae’s role as both critique and affirmation. Autobiographical reflection is incorporated not as a confession but as a methodological stance consistent with postpositivist traditions, situating the scholar within the interpretive framework of Caribbean intellectual praxis. Ultimately, Putting Up Resistance is presented as more than a song: it is a site of lived cultural production and a testament to reggae’s continuing capacity to articulate hope, resistance, and communal survival in the face of ongoing injustice.\nKeywords: Reggae music, Cultural resistance, Rastafarian epistemology, Caribbean cultural studies, Afro-Caribbean philosophy",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the gross volatility (variance), which includes the excess risk ALPHA, of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and risk volatility (which does not affect the former while following a blended normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to assets with a face value denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that options are equity bonds. Our examples show how to compute a firm’s debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misvaluation theory.",

Expecting that the T-bill risk largely reflects a country’s inflation risk or macrorisk, we measure the risk as a one-year payment’s risk to be comparable across various assets. We suggest that the risk-free rate approximately reflects the expected inflation effect, and that the inflation risk reflects the unexpected inflation effect or investment opportunity cost. To simplify the formulas, we also examine if the two returns can be computed independently. We employ two factors to model the risk-free rate, which the market expects the current monetary policy to bring towards the neutral level over a certain period. The 4-factor models include a factor constant over maturity to capture the depreciation cost of inter-bank short-term lending. We thus use different models to split T-bill returns into the risk and the risk-free rate with repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors, thereby solving the model factors. The 4-factor independence model outperforms all the other models on average explaining 99.3% of the US T-bill returns. The T-bill metrics represent the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets.",

          "abstract": "Persistent macroeconomic imbalances, long‑run deflation, and entrenched inequality are often interpreted as outcomes of market incompleteness or failures. This paper offers an alternative perspective by developing a dynamic equilibrium framework for open economies that incorporates asset‑side mechanisms. Within this framework, and by re‑examining the transversality condition (TVC) as an asset‑valuation criterion, such persistent imbalances can emerge as structural outcomes of optimal behavior rather than anomalies. The model yields the relationship:Rt-ρ=n+Da-U(θa)/Uc; This relationship shows that the gap between the asset return (Rt) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the combined effects of capital diffusion (Da), population growth (n) and preference terms (U(θa)/Uc). This reinterpretation explains how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist, and frames equilibrium as a dynamic configuration shaped by interdependence across economies and agents, beyond the traditional price‑clearing mechanism. The results align theory with observed realities and offer tools for policy design, including structural selection of the steady state, policy control of capital flows, and asset‑dynamics‑based policy reconstruction.",

          "abstract": "This paper, based on three research vignettes featuring methodological reflections from visual and multisensory research on international migrations conducted in Norway and Poland, introduces the concept of multisensory positionality. Grounded in the theoretical discussions around positionality developed in migration studies (Anthias 2002, 2008, 2020; Yuval-Davis 2006), and supported by sensuous scholarship (Stoller 2010; Howes 2020), multisensory positionality is a holistic, intersectional approach that recognises the body and senses as crucial aspects of positionality for both the researcher and participants. The paper highlights how these embodied experiences actively shape the negotiation of meaning between people and spaces, both in a research context and as part of the migration experience. As an analytical concept, multisensory positionality addresses the opportunities and limitations arising from the embodied, multisensory experiences of the research participants. It bridges migration and sensory studies by situating the sensory aspects of people’s identities within their broader life-worlds, including the impact of structures and power relations. \nKeywords: Multisensory Positionality, Migration, Positionality, Creative Research, Visual Methodologies.",

Women more often prioritized Ph.D. completion before age 30 and transitioned to parenthood after 35, whereas men tended to become parents during doctoral studies, often with three or more children by age 40. Early parenthood was associated with the largest gender gaps in long-term scientific citations, favoring men; these disparities disappeared among those who became parents after age 35. Men were also more likely to secure and remain in academic positions regardless of parenthood timing. These findings highlight persistent challenges for early-career mothers and underscore the need for institutional policies to better support parenting responsibilities alongside career progression.",

While most interventions adopt a uniform, one-size-fits-all approach, emerging evidence suggests that the effectiveness of loneliness interventions depends on individual psychological traits and the structure of social environments. Previous work has shown that mental health outcomes are shaped not only by personal vulnerabilities but also by complex feedback processes embedded in social networks. However, it remains unclear which types of interventions work best for which individuals, and how social context modulates these effects. We develop and apply an agent-based model that simulates mental health on a continuum with loneliness as a latent state at its lower end. The model is shaped by baseline resilience, self-reinforcement, and social influence mechanisms, across a realistic synthetic population. We target these mechanisms for specific individuals and varying proportions of their social networks. Outcomes for the individual and sequential neighbors are compared to a counterfactual. We use a random forest model and compute SHAP values that identify which features of the individuals and their social networks predict intervention success.\nWe show that interventions improving baseline resilience consistently benefit individuals, particularly those with low socioeconomic status embedded in moderately diverse networks. In contrast, interventions targeting self-reinforcement or peer influence exhibit greater variability and may produce adverse effects in overly homogeneous or fragmented contexts. Surprisingly, classical network centrality metrics fail to explain these patterns; instead, similarity in baseline and mental health traits across social layers emerges as a strong predictor of intervention efficacy.\nThese findings suggest that personalization based on social and psychological similarity is more informative than topological metrics when designing interventions for loneliness. The results challenge assumptions about “scaling up” interventions and highlight the importance of tailoring to social context and individual vulnerability. \nMore broadly, our approach demonstrates how computational models  can capture the complex interplay between individual traits and cumulative, self-consistent social feedbacks, offering a concrete framework for designing socially aware, targeted public health interventions.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Social norms, understood as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, can help resolve collective action problems by making salient collectively beneficial equilibria. However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

Using V-Dem data on gender traditionalism in origin countries and survey data from four\nWestern European societies (N ≈ 18,000), the authors analyze how cultural legacies, parental\nsocialization, and peer contexts shape gendered participation in leisure associations. Results show\nthat girls from more gender-traditional countries participate markedly less in leisure associations than\nthose from gender-egalitarian backgrounds, underscoring persistent cultural legacy influences. At the\nmicro-level, parental socialization of traditional gender values significantly shapes girls’ participation\nbut only partially mediates cultural legacy influences from origin countries. Additionally, peers also\ninfluence gendered behaviors, often amplifying or mitigating gender gaps in leisure association\nparticipation, highlighting the dual cultural pressures of parental and peer environments.

Показано, що мотиви донорів не пояснюються однією теорією міжнародних відносин, натомість потрібна синтезована оптика, яка поєднує ліберальні, реалістичні, конструктивістські і критичні підходи з тристороннім нексусом (Humanitarian-Development-Peacebuilding: гуманітарно-розвитково-миробудівним). На цьому перетині формується портфельна логіка, що передбачає охоплення всіх трьох компонентів нексуса, мінімізуючи ризик ігнорування будь-якого з них. Теоретичний синтез ілюструється підходами ЄС, Північної Європи, Великої Британії, США та інших донорів, де темпи й масштаби підтримки визначаються поєднанням географії загроз, політичних циклів, оборонно-промислових спроможностей й умовності реформ. У цій моделі розбудову миру замінює «мирочутливість», яка пріоритезує програми, що зміцнюють соціальну гармонію та згуртованість.\nПрактичним внеском роботи є аналітична «матриця HDP × мотивації донорів», яка систематизує типи нелетальних інтервенцій на перетині чотирьох логік і трьох напрямів HDP.

Ключова умова ефективності це поєднання невідкладних і структурних інтервенцій на основі довгострокового фінансування, локалізації та прозорого управління.\nСтаття також окреслює типові вузькі місця імплементації нексуса у воєнних і післявоєнних умовах, а саме фрагментацію координації, несумісність бюджетно-правових рамок, різні часові горизонти та дефіцит даних. Запропоновані механізми їх подолання через спільні очікувані результати, уніфіковані підходи до моніторингу, відкриті дані та залучення громад до рішень. Таким чином, робота пропонує cпосіб перетворення різнорідних мотивацій донорів на спільні траєкторії стабілізації та відновлення, підвищуючи довіру між донорами й реципієнтами та знижуючи ризики довгострокової залежності від допомоги.",

          "abstract": "The substantial number of food-insecure households in Nigeria and the problem of regional and socioeconomic disparities in food security are raising issues of food system transformation and justice. While knowledge of the gap is of public interest, the empirical validation of the gap is scant and the components of the gap linked to differences in socioeconomic characteristics and income inequality have not been investigated for Nigeria. This paper investigated the socioeconomic disparity in food security and a child’s diet quality. The specific objectives were (1) to profile the socioeconomic inequalities in food security and a child’s diet quality, and (2) to determine the relationship between food insecurity and a child’s dietary quality. The study employed Round 6 of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS6) data for Nigeria. A model was specified using a two-stage least-squares (2SLS) regression and analyzed using Stata MP Version 14. Results revealed 80.53% of households were food insecure, with a more pronounced estimate for the rural sector (81.95%) compared to the urban sector (78.08%). This was found to be statistically significant. As wealth ranking of households increased from poorest to richest, the proportion of households in food insecurity declined for the rural sample and for the pooled. The regression result showed that food insecurity decreased the likelihood of children having a quality diet and was statistically significant for rural areas and for the pooled sample (National). Thus, promoting programmes that enhance food access, availability, and utilization, targeted at the rural and urban poor, as well as diverse diets for children, are paramount",

          "abstract": "The study examines two dimensions of inequality acceptance in Sweden: income differences and welfare chauvinism, as well as their association with populist attitudes. Based on original survey data collected from 2019 to 2022 (three pooled cross-sections, random samples of the adult population), the study reveals substantial social (by class) and political (by partisanship) divides regarding how redistributive ambitious and socially inclusive the welfare state should be, challenging assumptions of strong sociopolitical consensus. Welfare chauvinism is found to be more politically divisive than approval of income differences, with the sharpest divides emerging in the exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness held by voters of the non-mainstream (radical) right party, the Sweden Democrats. The results suggest that conflicts over inclusivist versus exclusivist conceptions of social rights and welfare deservingness could become central in Swedish politics, potentially shifting away from the universalist principles that underpin its social democratic welfare state model.",

The literature finds a wide gap in labour productivity between sectors, but there is limited empirical evidence for rural Nigeria. This paper examined the nature of labour productivity in rural Nigeria using Nigeria’s national data and a regression-based decomposition technique.  Overall, the paper found that labour use in the farm sector was 17% less productive than labour in the nonfarm sector.  From the regression results, factors such as years of schooling, age as a measure of experience, household size, land size, access to social infrastructure and urbanization, and technical change contributed to driving the labour productivity gap in rural Nigeria. From the results, education, social capital, and infrastructure matter for labour productivity and earnings convergence between farm and nonfarm sectors. Rural development programmes addressing these problems will significantly contribute to a better business environment to increase labour productivity.",

The objective is to uncover potential cultural narrative risks and pathways of external influence. Methodologically, the study combines Competitive Hypothesis Analysis (CHA) with red team logic modelling, embedding the STEMPLES framework (Symbols, Timing, Events, Information, Processes, Leadership, Externalities, Structure) to conduct a multidimensional analysis of the event's symbolic risks, narrative imbalances, process vulnerabilities, and leadership behaviour. Findings indicate that the Wuhan University Party Committee's high-frequency exchanges with Japan between 2019 and 2025, coupled with the semi-autonomous operational mechanism of the Japanese alumni association, provided ‘soft influence pathways’ for cultural infiltration and misinterpretation of public discourse. The ‘red circle + white chair’ design, interpreted by the public as symbolising the ‘Japanese flag,’ exposed deficiencies in political sensitivity oversight during major ceremonies. Although no conclusive hostile intelligence networks or financial irregularities were identified, evidence indicates that uncontrolled symbolism and narrative gaps amplified opportunities for external narrative manipulation. In conclusion, this paper advocates establishing cross-departmental risk mitigation mechanisms to strengthen political security reviews of visual and narrative design. This should form a closed-loop system comprising ‘pre-event screening, in-process intervention, and symmetrical post-event responses’ to prevent symbolic missteps from strategic exploitation. Such measures offer valuable insights for universities' security governance in international cooperation and cultural exchange.",

In this work, I explore the notion of ‘National Parks’ as home and ponder the following three reflective questions: How has the establishment of ‘National Parks’ served as a form of domicide? Are protected areas being protected for all people or from certain people? How are people included and excluded from home in U.S. ‘National Parks’ today?",

          "abstract": "Master’s thesis submitted to Jagiellonian University (CEERES Erasmus Mundus MA Program), 2025. \n\nIn contemporary Poland, the politics of memory have emerged as a key site of national identity formation and political legitimacy. The Law and Justice Party (PiS) has emerged as a pivotal political force in shaping historical narratives, rendering collective memory a tool of governance, a means of exclusion, and a device for populist mobilisation. While attempts to post-communist European memory politics have continued to rise, comparative, digital, and discourse analyses of how mnemonic narratives evolve within the same political party over time remain rare. This thesis examines how PiS has served as a \"mnemonic warrior\" during the 2015 and 2023 election campaigns by analysing how narratives of victimhood, betrayal, and national purity are constructed, reinterpreted, and disseminated through both traditional and new media. Using a mixed-methods design combining Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Digital Ethnography, the study examines party manifestos, media coverage, and social media accounts. The research employs the Discourse-Historical Approach to CDA and uses tools such as 4CAT and Zeeschuimer for gathering and analysing online material. Through examination, clear consistency in PiS's practices of memory is identifiable, and these hinge upon selective victimhood, elite delegitimisation, and historical revisionism. But the 2023 campaign demonstrates an intensification of digital approaches, particularly on X (formerly Twitter), where previous stories are re-authored in emotive, moralising, and exclusionary narratives aimed at constructing a closed memory community. The study contributes to the understanding of right-wing populist actors weaponising memory to advance polarisation and suppress pluralism. It highlights the necessity of temporally comparative and interdisciplinary study of memory politics, particularly in relation to increasing influence.",

Others project resolve, vowing to continue their duties unperturbed. We fielded an original survey experiment to understand the ways in which a politician's response to violent threats can affect public tolerance for and perceived severity of these threats as well as support for the politician in the aftermath of the threat. We posit that after experiencing a threat of violence politicians can either (1) express their personal fear/concern regarding the threat, (2) express their strength/resilience in light of the threat, or (3) not comment on the threat. We also investigate which approach proves most impactful for women politicians, who often face heightened threats. We find that strong responses are beneficial for both men and women politicians and women face a bind as vulnerable and strong responses garner different effects on public opinion. Overall, our results provide insight into how elected officials might best respond to threats and harassment, with additional attention paid to gender differences in strategy effectiveness.",

Starting with the analysis and speculative elaboration\non Allan’s theory of cosmological shifts in international orders during Western modernity,\nwe associate the Anthropocene discourse as an inaugurating moment in the consolidation of the Planetary’s scientific cosmology, grounded in the astrobiology’s metabolic perspective on complex adaptive systems. The narrative of the paper offers a genealogy of\nthis perspective, including the most recent research about information metabolisms and\nbiosphere-technosphere coupling in astrobiology, which paves the way for the explanation\nof the economy itself as a metabolic entity. After the review of adjacent philosophical positions associated with ecological economics and the theory of complex adaptive systems,\nthe paper concludes with remarks on the Planetary as a cornerstone of an international\norder that yields economic imperatives governed by a generic view of the Earth as a member of a potentially large and diverse category of habitable planets.",

          "abstract": "Studies about the transition to a circular economy (CE) often focus on high-level questions of resource use and consumption, addressing questions of technical innovation and industrial production. Yet a transition to a circular economy is a societal issue. In this study, we respond to criticisms that the CE often portrays individuals as passive user-consumers, and investigate how smaller-scale actors - people working in the CE at the local level - are engaging in the transition. We present findings from empirical data gathered through thirty semi-structured interviews with professional CE practitioners working in public (local government), private (SMEs – small-medium sized enterprises) and third sector (charities/social enterprises) organisations in the UK. Drawing on insights from sustainability transitions and intermediary actors, we find that individuals working within organisations and small businesses adopt a role as intermediary actors at the smaller scale. We call these actors ‘everyday intermediaries’ and demonstrate how they take on a role to mediate the CE to wider society, working to connect actors, resources and skills across the CE, and to translate the behaviours and practices necessary for a successful transition to CE to the everyday context. We add to the growing body of literature about the contributions of social science in understanding the transition to the CE and empirically demonstrate the active and engaged role of smaller-scale actors in bringing change.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety and worry about climate change have been associated with poorer mental health. We examined whether different climate beliefs, the cognitive component of climate anxiety, were associated with symptoms of psychological distress. We also tested whether political efficacy moderated the potential associations between climate beliefs and psychological distress, as perceptions of inadequate government response may amplify climate anxiety. We applied longitudinal data and cross-lagged panel network models in the UK Household Longitudinal Study (N =61,761). Our results showed that 1) the association between climate beliefs and psychological distress was bidirectional, 2) belief in consequences was most clearly associated with increased distress while associations between beliefs in responsibility and inevitability and the distress symptoms were more mixed, and 3) those who perceived that individuals can affect political decisions seemed to be most vulnerable to the negative effects of climate crisis on mental health.",

          "abstract": "The risk of experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) is closely tied to attitudes justifying IPV at individual, couple and societal levels. We analysed how women’s IPV risk varies with their own and their spouse’s attitudes, local community acceptance and country-level gender equality. Using data from 148,421 couples across 30 low- and middle-income countries and 34 Indian states, we estimated Bayesian regression models via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with uninformative priors. IPV justification and IPV experience varied significantly across and within countries. Women’s risk was more strongly associated with their own attitudes than with their husbands’ attitudes. Community-level justification independently increased risk, while higher country-level gender equality was linked to lower IPV exposures. The association between neighbourhood norms and women’s risk was moderated by spousal attitudes, with the association strongest among couples in which neither partner justified IPV. Country-level gender equality consistently reduced women’s risk regardless of couples’ attitudes. These findings suggest that focusing solely on couples where husbands perpetrate IPV is insufficient. Sustainable prevention efforts must also address community norms and structural gender inequality.",

Drawing from the dynamics of affects, as\ndrivers for action, in Jeanne Favret-Saada’s ethnography of rural sorcery, the article develops\nthe model further to resolve this shift. This new model emphasizes that, for Pollock, artworks\nare used to experience a specific affect, the pursuit of which guides his creative process, both\nfor individual artworks and the development of his entire body of work.

We use three LLMs to measure the degree of incivility and character attacks used by each candidate, and provide evidence of the validity of these measures. We find that both incivility and (especially) character attacks are robustly associated with lower vote share, controlling for factors found to be relevant to these elections in prior research and several new factors including LLM measures of ideological extremism and populism. The effects continue to be significant with controls for early and mid-campaign polls, indicating the negative relationship between hostile rhetoric and vote share does not just reflect underdog candidates strategically going negative early in campaigns.",

          "title": "Ukrainian Refugees in Switzerland 3 Years On: A First Look",
          "authors": "Valeriia Hett; Didier Ruedin",
          "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to present initial findings from an ongoing empirical study of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, living under temporary protection Status S, notably their socio-economic integration, interaction with public services, and future aspirations. Data are drawn from an ad-hoc online survey started in March 2025, which includes N=1470 participants to date and demonstrates reasonable levels of representativeness across demographic and labour indicators. Findings indicate that despite the persistent uncertainty and structural limitations imposed by the temporary legal framework, many Ukrainian refugees are actively seeking employment, learning local languages and participating in education. These trajectories reflect not only functional participation in host society government structures, but also strategic forms of adaptation under conditions of legal ambiguity. The absence of a clear path to permanent residence does not stop integration efforts, but it influences their form, embedding them within a framework of temporariness and limited planning horizons. At the same time a lack of accessible and consistent information, particularly regarding administrative procedures and about support services, continues to be a significant barrier. In practice, however, Ukrainian refugees tend to compensate for institutional complexity through informal networks and self-navigation strategies. While more respondents express a desire to remain in Switzerland, their capacity to plan for the future is fundamentally shaped by the temporary and conditional nature of their legal status. Although Swiss institutional resources are generally perceived as more trustworthy than Ukrainian ones when it comes to accessing support, many refugees face barriers in reaching these sources, including linguistic and administrative complexity. The inability to access stable, long-term institutional frameworks reinforces a mode of existence defined by limited predictability and fragmented engagement with the state. These preliminary findings contribute to understanding how temporary protection operates not only as a legal category, but also a socio-political condition that determines access, restricts belonging and structures the temporal and institutional aspects of movement.",

          "authors": "Fabian Rüsenberg; Nadine Fleischhut",
          "abstract": "Climate services and co-production efforts aim to support adaptation by making climate information useful and usable. Yet many services and research projects prioritize improving data quality over understanding decision-making needs. This limits insights into what we define as true demand: the actionable need for information that would improve decisions, if conditions allowed. Here, we present a systematic sectoral analysis grounded in behavioral theory exploring whether, where, and how better climate predictions could improve decisions. We apply this approach to two climate-sensitive sectors in Germany: agriculture and forestry. Using expert focus groups (N = 24), we identify key adaptation decisions and analyze current decision strategies. Drawing on the COM-B model for behavior (B) change, we examine the capabilities (C), opportunities (O), and motivation (M) necessary to use climate predictions in practice. Our findings reveal that foresighted adaptation is often constrained by gaps in knowledge, lack of opportunity, or limited motivation. These constraints diminish the perceived importance of climate predictions on the subseasonal to decadal timescale or prevent their use, with decision-makers instead relying on past experience and heuristics such as worst-case planning. Nevertheless, experts expressed interest in improved predictions---particularly for variability and extremes across intra-annual to multi-year timescales---that could inform decisions. True demand may remain masked, blocked, or unexpressed if decision-makers lack the capabilities, opportunities, or motivation to recognize, act on, or articulate it. Our approach provides a systematic way to assess where and how predictions could improve decisions, shifting the focus from better data to better decisions.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the variability of age at first marriage across birth cohorts, genders, education levels, and races. The argument for the deinstitutionalization of formal marriage suggests that formal marriage has become more individualized over the past few decades, and people have more autonomy in deciding the timing of their first marriage as the cultural conformity pertaining to marriage as an institution decline. This may contribute to a growing variability of age at first marriage in recent cohorts. However, as the process of deinstitutionalization differs across genders, education levels, and races, the changes in cultural conformity regarding formal marriage may also differ, leading to divergent changes in the variability of age at first marriage among these social groups. Using the 2008-23 American Community Survey (ACS) data (n=13,737,325) and OLS regression models, our results show a U-shaped trend over cohorts: the variability was least diverse among cohorts born between 1925 and 1949. In addition, we find an interaction effect of gender and race. Further, highly educated people tend to have less variability in marriage age than those with less education. This study contributes to our understanding of the heterogeneous changes in cultural conformity regarding the timing of first marriage and the deinstitutionalization of formal marriage in the United States.",

We then conducted a registered report megastudy (N=13,544) testing the effects of the 10 most-cited climate change messaging strategies on Americans’ pro-environmental attitudes and behavior. Six messages significantly affected multiple preregistered attitudes, though effects were small (≤ 15% of the Democratic-Republican gap) and similar in magnitude across messages. Persuasiveness varied little across party lines, contradicting theories predicting heterogeneous effects for targeted messages. No message increased pro-environmental donations, highlighting the challenge of influencing costly behaviors through messaging alone. The most impactful messages influenced multiple mediating variables, limiting identification of the specific mechanisms driving effects. Taken together, these results identify several persuasive strategies, yet also highlight important limits of short-form messages for increasing Americans’ support for action to address climate change.",

          "abstract": "This article examines how Filipino TikTok users negotiate the viral “Diploma o Diskarte” debate through humor, revealing ambivalence as a constitutive modality of digital participation. Using multimodal critical discourse analysis of widely circulated videos and reception analysis of audience comments, we show that diskarte—Filipino resourceful agency—is neither a fixed trait nor a simple binary of compliance and resistance. Instead, it emerges as a communicative repertoire enacted across a continuum of survivalist, strategic, relational, entrepreneurial, and subversive practices. Humor operates as both critique and camouflage, allowing users to surface structural inequities while preserving social harmony. From these patterns, we inductively generate the Diskarte Continuum Framework, a culturally grounded model that theorizes ambivalence as central to communicative agency in precarious conditions. By foregrounding vernacular epistemologies, this study demonstrates how qualitative theorizing from the Global South advances broader debates in communication about media ambivalence, agency, and digital culture.",

          "abstract": "A quarter of a century has passed since the late Terry Crowley summed up the academic consensus that the creole language Bislama poses no immediate threat to any of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. Does this remain true today? Since that time, evidence both quantitative and qualitative has been accumulating that indicates Bislama is indeed gaining ground at the expense of Vanuatu’s Indigenous languages. In a targeted review of this evidence, this article brings together and assesses the insights of linguists, ethnographers, and others on the causal mechanisms that explain an ongoing shift towards Bislama. It thereby provides both a critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a provisional causal framework for understanding current threats, predicting future threats and, potentially, intervening to prevent future threats. Language endangerment and extinction is a global issue with devastating implications for communities worldwide—one which Vanuatu, the world’s most linguistically diverse country, has thus far remained resilient in the face of. However, this review of the available evidence warns that Bislama will continue to disrupt intergenerational transmission of Indigenous languages unless a suite of inter-related mechanisms can be counteracted.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on three large-scale pre-registered survey experiments (N=3516) in the UK, this article investigates how perceived asylum-seeking legality, public preferences for refugee relocation, and inclusionary attitudes are shaped by symbolic and strategic boundaries. We first show that the authenticity of identity documents, identity markers, flight reasons, origin, and family ties drive perceived legality. The second experiment reveals that relocating refugees to participants’ local areas while maintaining high levels of residential segregation dampens willingness to welcome them. Further, respondents differentially welcome refugees depending on their origin, occupation, religion, and language skills. We term this layered moral calculus “bounded humanitarianism”, illustrating how symbolic boundaries translate into social and spatial exclusions. Finally, through a third experiment, we test two interventions: perspective-taking and loss-framed cost-information, finding that only perspective-taking boosts support for asylum seekers’ rights (e.g., right to work and expedited decisions), whereas loss-framed information treatment fails to reshape inclusionary attitudes. Our findings bridge boundary-making theory and asylum policies by showing how symbolic boundaries around identity and meritocratic worth shape attitudes towards asylum seekers and refugees and how perspective-taking interventions can challenge the potential exclusions.",

Using a large language model, we analyze video transcripts from social media platform Parler, measuring message intensity across four domains: hostility to outgroups, claims of conservative injustice, negative emotions, and violence. We link these to county-level right-wing event data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project. Event-history analysis using proportional hazard models estimated the effects on right-wing activity rates in U.S. counties, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and other demographic factors. The results support our conjecture that counties with more intense postings across all four domains would have significantly higher rates of right-wing activity.",

Prior to the rise of generative AI, automation primarily affected routine-intensive occupations, driving employment polarisation and disproportionately exposing certain groups—particularly women—to displacement risks. While training can mitigate these risks by facilitating reskilling, access is highly unequal: employer-sponsored programs often favour workers whose skills complement technology, and mothers face additional constraints due to time poverty from unpaid care. Using the 2022 EU Labour Force Survey Job Skills module covering 26 European countries, we investigate how exposure to automation influences training participation, with a focus on gender and motherhood. We further explore whether access to formal childcare alleviates barriers to training and reduces participation gaps.",

Using a sample of front-page articles from 12 local newspapers across different circulation tiers and 3 national newspapers, the research analyzes sentiment scores and issue coverage. I find that local newspapers, especially those with smaller circulations, consistently employ a more positive tone compared to national newspapers overall and on specific issues. Contrary to expectations, local newspapers became more positive over time, widening the sentiment gap with national outlets. The study suggests that the decline of local news and increased reliance on national sources may expose readers to more negative content overall. These findings have implications for understanding how changes in the media landscape could impact public perceptions and civic engagement. They also suggest greater attention should be paid to low-circulation local newspaper, who are often excluded from content analyses of local news.",

          "abstract": "Relational values, care, and stewardship actions fundamentally shape human-wildlife coexistence, yet there is a gap between understanding and explicitly incorporating these approaches in conservation practice. \nIn this study, we co-produce a relational framework with various research partners, including Indigenous communities, to demonstrate how relational values and care can be more effectively understood and applied through conservation policy/strategy.  \nThis study adopts a relational approach, acknowledging the diverse values, perceptions, and interactions that shape coexistence. Using a transdisciplinary methodology, the study examines human-wildlife coexistence in two contrasting social-ecological systems in South Africa: the Garden Route and the Kalahari. We engage local actors as research partners and develop participatory workshops, collaborative timelines, and focus group discussions to identify the relational values underpinning coexistence, explicitly focusing on the dimensions of care, knowledge, and agency associated with stewardship actions. \nDistinct stewardship positions emerged, reflecting different visions of human-wildlife interactions and conservation. Indigenous research partners notably highlighted transformative stewardship, promoting an inclusive worldview that integrates humans and wildlife through mutual respect and cultural recognition. Conversely, other research partners demonstrated varied stewardship positions ranging from adaptive to sustainability-focused action.\nThe findings underscore the need to explicitly incorporate relational values and care dimensions into conservation strategies, highlighting their potential to enhance legitimacy, credibility, and effectiveness in addressing social-ecological complexity. This relational framework supports practical, inclusive, and context-sensitive conservation actions that consider and leverage the diversity of human-nature relationships.",

          "abstract": "This article advances an anthropology of algorithms by examining their role as ontological agents that shape subjectivity, intimacy, and cultural life. Rather than treating algorithms as neutral tools, it situates them as infrastructures that co-produce desire, mediate affect, and govern social relations across labor, consumption, and everyday interaction. Drawing on historical genealogies, ethnographic insights, and conceptual innovation, the article introduces new terms—ontological modulation, preemptive intimacy, algorithmic atmospheres, probabilistic description, computational affect, and ethical resonance—to capture the lived experience of computational mediation. It argues for anthropology’s critical role in understanding algorithms as constitutive of social worlds, demanding fresh theoretical and methodological vocabularies.",

          "abstract": "Technological innovations have signaled a shift in the journalistic field, enabling a wider\nrange of actors to participate in public discourses and challenge the hegemonic power\nstructures of traditional journalism from the outside. Consequently, historical notions of\nalternative media have expanded to encompass a variety of new actors within and beyond the\nboundaries of the journalistic field, with some explicitly claiming to focus on issues of\ndiversity. This study examines the role orientations of peripheral journalistic actors who\nprioritize journalistic diversity in their work. It also explores how they use their role\norientations to position themselves within the journalistic field and its periphery. Based on 18\nin-depth interviews with Austrian peripheral actors, the study finds that while their role\norientations diverge from those of more traditional media, they share similarities with\nlongstanding normative ideas of progressive alternative media. Further, they employ their\ncognitive and normative role orientations as boundary markers to distinguish themselves from\nthe practices of more traditional media.",

Prior to the rise of generative AI, automation primarily affected routine-intensive occupations, driving employment polarisation and disproportionately exposing certain groups—particularly women—to displacement risks. While training can mitigate these risks by facilitating reskilling, access is highly unequal: employer-sponsored programs often favour workers whose skills complement technology, and mothers face additional constraints due to time poverty from unpaid care. Using the 2022 EU Labour Force Survey Job Skills module covering 26 European countries, we investigate how exposure to automation influences training participation, with a focus on gender and motherhood. We further explore whether access to formal childcare alleviates barriers to training and reduces participation gaps.",

Activist organizations have emerged from cybercriminal networks, including subversive groups that intervene in international affairs and espouse radical political ideas. To explain this phenomenon, I argue that hacking networks can become politically activated through individual interaction within the context of networks. I develop a theory of political mobilization in illicit digital networks, which explains how strong ties can form in the context of online and anonymized settings. To test this argument, I build a novel dataset of website defacements conducted by hacking groups. I construct this dataset by scraping over 394,000 self-reported defacements. Using these data, I show how political ideas and activities diffuse through hackers’ social networks. This research contributes to our understanding of how political activity emerges from online networks, showing that illicit digital activity can foster political mobilization and radicalization.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy theories are widespread, varied, and socially consequential. While research has identified psychological and social correlates of conspiracy endorsement, debate continues over whether there is a general predisposition toward conspiratorial thinking and whether it should be treated as pathological. We argue that dominant theoretical efforts overlook the cultural dynamics that sustain conspiratorial worldviews. By reviewing empirical and philosophical work, we propose that conspiracy theories are best understood as culturally evolved epistemologies—frameworks that can prescribe what counts as evidence, who is trustworthy, and how to handle disconfirmation. Drawing on cultural evolutionary theory and network psychometrics, we show how this perspective can explain the persistence of conspiracy subcultures, their diversity, and their integration with broader belief systems. Finally, we discuss how artificial intelligence can accelerate the spread of conspiracy narratives, increasingly become the subject of new conspiracy theories, and at the same time offer novel tools for mapping, analyzing, and countering them.",

          "abstract": "This is working paper and I would like to find collaborators with data for future papers. \n\nDespite the growing relevance of digital platforms, many academics remain hesitant to fully embrace social media for scholarly communication. Institutional discouragement, limited time, privacy concerns, misinformation, reputational risks, and fears of cancellation or censorship are among the key barriers.\n\nThis reluctance represents a missed opportunity, especially for institutions with limited resources. Universities without repositories, those unable to afford expensive journal subscriptions, struggling to support open-access publishing, or lacking dedicated communications staff could benefit significantly from the accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and global reach of social media.\n\nThis paper presents an international literature review, drawing insights from editorials and scholarly articles. It highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the use of social media as a rapid and effective tool for disseminating scientific knowledge.\n\nThree case studies, including two research projects at the University of Cambridge, demonstrate the potential of social media to mobilise findings and amplify research impact.

          "abstract": "The article offers an integrated historical–philosophical reconstruction of the evolution of the philosophy of science from its ancient foundations to post- nonclassical and contemporary approaches in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). It shows how the ontology/epistemology/axiology triad structures the field, while successive methodological paradigms (rationalism, empiricism, positivism, neo- Kantianism, logical empiricism/neo-positivism, and post-positivism) repeatedly rearticulate the criteria of scientificity. Particular attention is paid to global evolutionism and synergetic as integrative frameworks for understanding open, non- linear, and far-from-equilibrium systems. The analysis argues that digital transformation and the diffusion of AI require a clarified ontology of cognition, a principled distinction between computation and thinking, and an ethical infrastructure (virtue ethics, responsibility, relationality, and algorithmic participation) to safeguard human dignity within hybrid human–algorithm decision loops. The practical upshot is an orientation toward explainability, reproducibility, accountability, and open procedures of truth assessment that secure science as a public practice rather than a collection of statistically adequate outputs.",

We draw on the long-running Newborn Starting Cohort from the German National Education Panel Study, linked with administrative records on mothers’ employment biographies (NEPS-SC1-ADIAB, 2012-2021) and expert-coded occupational task data. Extending previous research providing mixed findings on mathematical and verbal competencies after age 5, we examine cognitive and non-cognitive child development between ages three and nine. Results from OLS-models show small but statistically significant associations between mothers’ highly specialised, analytical job skills and children’s vocabulary scores, while links with math, science, and socio-emotional behaviour were modest. Other types of job tasks showed only small associations with any child outcome. Additional fixed-effects models provide little support that changes in maternal occupations influence child development. Overall, our findings suggest a limited role of occupation-specific skills in the intergenerational transmission of educational inequalities.",

          "authors": "Esra Cansu Çan Beton; Zehra Taskin",
          "abstract": "Ottoman miniature collections represent a layered cultural heritage that combines artistic, historical, social, and intellectual dimensions. Yet, access to their content is often limited by catalogue records that provide only minimal descriptive information. This discussion paper explores how computational access can expand the study and reuse of such collections by presenting a dataset of 435 Ottoman miniatures, enriched with detailed bibliographic metadata and expert-assigned thematic tags. An original multi-level classification scheme was developed. Tagging was carried out through a custom web interface, preparing the dataset for analysis through thematic network analysis, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.\nThematic co-occurrence analysis revealed clusters such as political figures, religious motifs, and urban settings, demonstrating the interpretive value of tagging beyond traditional cataloguing. Supervised learning with MobileNetV2 achieved 63% training accuracy and 49% validation accuracy, showing the model’s capacity to identify dominant themes while also exposing the limits of small and imbalanced datasets. Unsupervised clustering produced visually coherent groups, but low Silhouette scores and high Davies-Bouldin indices confirmed that thematic boundaries were not strongly separable through visual features alone.\nThe findings highlight the need to combine computational methods with expert knowledge. While supervised approaches support targeted classification and unsupervised approaches enable exploratory insights, both benefit from integration with rich metadata. This study demonstrates how Ottoman miniatures can serve as a model for applying machine learning and network analysis to cultural heritage collections, offering transferable lessons for digital humanities research.",

          "abstract": "This paper critically examines AI-driven learning personalization, identifying seven interconnected problems: technological determinism, widening educational disparities, privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, neglect of human relationships, trivialization of learning, and commercialization. These challenges represent fundamental issues affecting educational values and social equity rather than mere technical difficulties. Adopting a sociotechnical systems perspective, the study reveals that current AI-driven personalization often reflects commercial priorities over pedagogical expertise, resulting in pseudo-personalization that undermines authentic learning. The research proposes a hybrid educational model that leverages AI for basic skill acquisition while preserving human-centered aspects including creative thinking, critical analysis, and emotional support. Key recommendations include reaffirming public education values, promoting open-source educational technology, establishing educational data sovereignty, and redefining educator roles. The findings emphasize that genuine learning individualization cannot be resolved through technological solutions alone. The future of education depends on careful integration guided by educational philosophy and value judgments that prioritize human development over market-driven metrics, requiring educators to critically evaluate technology rather than accepting commercial solutions uncritically.",

          "abstract": "Using longitudinal data from the Houston Independent School District, this study examines the role of English learner (EL) status in predicting college enrollment and completion. Drawing from the sociological frameworks of categorical inequality and leveled tracking, we argue that EL status serves as a label that may limit students’ college-level course-taking in high school, specifically Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and dual credit courses, and postsecondary opportunities. We compare four groups of students: students never classified as EL, ELs who were reclassified in elementary school, ELs who were reclassified in middle school, and ELs who were reclassified in high school or never reclassified. We find that EL–never-EL gaps in postsecondary outcomes vary by the timing of reclassification, but are largely explained by sociodemographic, academic, and school-level factors. We also show that ELs reclassified in later grade levels take fewer college-level courses in high school than never-EL students and ELs reclassified in earlier grade levels. Finally, through nonlinear variance decomposition, we determine that a substantial portion of EL gaps in postsecondary outcomes is explained by EL gaps in college-level course-taking during high school. We conclude by sharing potential strategies from district staff that may enable EL students to complete college-level coursework during high school, with the goal of expanding their postsecondary opportunities.",

Analyzing data from a 2024 Pew Research Center poll, this visualization describes the views of U.S. survey respondents on the issue of declining birth rates, with about half (49%) of respondents expressing a negative view of the trend. Those most likely to offer this view are politically conservative, attend religious services more often, and they are more likely older, male, married, and more highly educated. Second, they are more likely to view climate change, racism, and gun violence as not serious problems, and to view illegal immigration and the state of moral values in the country as serious problems. Thus, the negative perception of falling birth rates is generally associated with right-leaning concerns and identities in the U.S. (with the exception of education).",

          "authors": "Aziz Tuffi Saliba; Mariana Ferolla Vallandro do Valle",
          "abstract": "In the time since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, several states have closed their borders and imposed travel restrictions to contain the proliferation of the disease, which, in turn, has left hundreds of thousands of people unable to return to their countries of nationality or residence. This Article analyzes the compatibility of these measures with the right to return to one's country and the right to family and private life, to the extent that these rights may obligate states to allow a person to reenter a country. Part I analyzes who is entitled to claim said rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European and American Conventions on Human Rights, and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. After this delimitation, this Part further assesses how international travel restrictions adopted in response to the pandemic interfere with these rights, as well as what obligations states have to secure them. Part II evaluates whether these interferences might qualify as lawful limitations and derogations under human rights law and concludes that they most likely do not. The satisfaction of the requirement of necessity, indispensable for lawful limitations and derogations, is disputable, since the scientific evidence available does not seem to support the efficiency of travel bans in containing the spread of disease. Moreover, there are several cases of persons stranded for long periods or in dire material conditions, putting into question the proportionality of these measures. There is thus a strong case for invoking state responsibility in these situations.",

          "abstract": "Kenya stands at a critical demographic inflection point, transitioning from a young, rapidly growing population \ntoward an aging society with declining fertility rates. This paper examines the nascent demographic crisis in \nKenya through the lens of inadequate social security systems and their cascading effects on reproductive \nbehavior, family formation, and long-term economic sustainability. Drawing on comparative analysis with \nGreece, Japan, and South Korea; nations that have already experienced severe demographic transitions, this \nstudy argues that Kenya's current trajectory toward population decline represents a preventable crisis requiring \nimmediate policy intervention. Through analysis of demographic data, economic indicators, and social welfare \nstructures, this research demonstrates that strengthening social security systems represents the most effective \nintervention to reverse declining birth rates and prevent the economic stagnation experienced by aging societies \nglobally. The paper proposes innovative financing mechanisms, including a dedicated retirement savings \ncomponent within Kenya's VAT structure, to create sustainable social security that can break the cycle of \npoverty-driven demographic decline. This research contributes to the growing literature on demographic \ntransitions in sub-Saharan Africa while providing actionable policy frameworks for preventing demographic \ncollapse in developing economies. \n\nKeywords: Demographic transition, social security, population decline, Kenya, aging society, fertility rates, \neconomic development",
