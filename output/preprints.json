          "abstract": "Mindset (beliefs about the malleability of intelligence) has been studied in a variety of contexts for decades. Recent research highlights the importance of contextual factors in moderating mindset’s impact on student outcomes. The commonly-used original mindset measure is context-general. Recently, a mindset measure that is specific to science and math undergraduates was developed: the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) Survey. I hypothesized that a context-specific measure of mindset would associate more strongly with undergraduates’ outcomes than a context-general measure. I surveyed 1,537 undergraduates with the shortened original mindset measure, ULTrA, and measures of outcomes (sense of belonging, goal orientation, self-handicapping, evaluative concern and intent to persist in science) and collected course grades. Structural equation modeling indicated that the fixed dimension of the ULTrA exhibited stronger and more consistent relationships with outcomes than the shortened original mindset measure and predicted unique variance in outcomes above and beyond what the original mindset measure accounted for. The academic outcomes (intent to persist and course grade) were significantly related to ULTrA, but not the original mindset measure. Our results provide evidence that the context-specific ULTrA survey can detect relationships with undergraduate outcomes that the context-general original mindset measure can fail to detect.",

          "abstract": "Sixty years after the civil rights movement, we examine the historical trajectory of civil rights through the language of US legislation. Using natural language processing (NLP), we find that civil rights has become a more common but also a more polarized policy area. Polarization between Democrats and Republicans accelerated during the early 1990s and the mid-2010s. The latter acceleration coincided with the rise of the “Black Lives Matter” movement, and it was driven by a surge of legislative support for civil rights among racial minority Democrats. Content analyses show that civil rights legislation supporting racial minorities, women and the LGBTQ+ community has polarized most, while legislation supporting the elderly and disabled has declined in both parties. Our findings offer new insights into party polarization, race and ethnicity politics, and collective action tipping points. We showcase NLP as a valuable method for studying the changing behavior of political elites.",

          "abstract": "The illusory truth effect - the finding that repeated statements are believed more - is understood as a cognitive bias at the core of the psychology of beliefs. Here, we propose that the effect, rather than representing a flaw in human cognition, is a rational adaptation to generally high-quality information environments. Using a formal model, we show that increasing belief in repeated statements improves belief accuracy when a source is credible (i.e., likely to tell the truth) but sometimes makes errors. The theory unifies four key findings in the literature while predicting a testable edge case for the illusory truth effect: when a source is likely to convey falsehoods. Using a large (N = 4,947) pre-registered online experiment, we show that the illusory truth effect is substantially smaller in a low-quality (mostly false) relative to a high-quality (mostly true) information environment. In fact, a majority of participants in the low-quality condition do not demonstrate any illusory truth effect. We identify the deployment of an alternative strategy in the low-quality condition where participants decrease their belief given repetition. Three process-level indicators - response times, cognitive reflection, and the prior plausibility of items - confirm an adaptively rational interpretation. In sum, we suggest the illusory truth effect may not be purely illusory, highlighting its adaptive foundations and the ability of people to efficiently navigate complex environments.",

          "abstract": "Media literacy and well-being are interconnected topics that have garnered increasing attention in recent years due to the proliferation of media platforms and the influence they can exert on individuals' mental health and overall well-being. Media literacy is a lifelong educational process, defined as the ability to critically access, analyse, evaluate, create, and contribute to media. It is especially important for children and adolescents who are more susceptible to negative media influences. Well-being encompasses both feeling good and functioning effectively, and is associated with numerous benefits including increased productivity and creativity, and better relationships, health and life expectancy. Guided by the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement, this systematic review and meta-analysis examined the associations between media literacy and well-being. The search identified 15 studies involving 47 effect sizes across a variety of dimensions of media literacy. Together, the studies had 16,632 participants and 51.8% comprised school-aged populations. The analysis revealed a statistically significant, small to medium, positive association between media literacy and well-being (r = 0.19, 95% CI [0.01, 0.35]). The ‘Media Literacy Dimension’ significantly moderated the pooled effect. A medium-sized positive association between media literacy and well-being was observed when the media literacy measure was solely focussed on analysing/evaluating the media (r = 0.24, 95% CI [0.05, 0.41]). No other significant moderating factors were found. The findings highlight the potential value of integrating established and emerging school well-being curriculum with existing and emerging school media literacy curriculum. Findings also point to the potential benefits of imparting media literacy skills to adult learners, through contexts such as tertiary education institutions and online environments. However, additional research is needed to better understand the association between media literacy and well-being and provide more concrete recommendations for practice.",

First, qualitative interviews with hair professionals informed the development of an intake survey, a suite of customizable hair preparation techniques, and recommendations for researcher staffing and training, while prioritizing participant comfort and hair integrity. We then evaluated these techniques with 16 Black participants (11 adults, 5 children) with varying hair types/styles, including braiding cornrows around the intended optode montage, using gels and clips to part hair, and various ways of increasing tension to promote sensor-scalp contact. On average, signal improved by 44%, with greatest improvements in anterior regions. While signal quality was not perfect, it was generally improved to the point of acceptability and inclusion in a racially and ethnically diverse dataset (with hair type/color as covariates). We conclude by discussing the need for increased awareness of racial bias in neuroimaging, greater diversity in research teams, and a more inclusive approach for working with diverse populations.",

          "abstract": "During the Covid-19 pandemic, many organizations shifted to remote work. Additionally, there was an increase in experiences of racism toward Asian Americans and a continuation of racism toward other marginalized groups. This research explores the relationship between remote work, discrimination, and intra-minority solidarity. In Study 1, Asian Americans who worked remotely during the pandemic reported fewer racial discrimination experiences than those who worked in person. Study 2 demonstrated that both Asian and Black Americans who worked hybrid reported less interpersonal conflict and stress but more positive affect and control when they worked remotely than when in the office. Studies 3-5 examined how Asian Americans make meaning out of these pandemic circumstances. In the studies, learning about Asian Americans’ discrimination experiences during the pandemic promoted attitudes and policy preferences for reducing discrimination for all marginalized groups. We discuss the psychological implications of remote work and other equity-enhancing policy for intra-minority solidarity.",

          "abstract": "Life stress is a well-established risk factor for suicide ideation (SI) and behavior (SB), but the specific types of stressors that are most strongly associated with suicide-related outcomes, and on what time scale they impact these outcomes, remain poorly understood. Social rejection, especially targeted rejection, may be markedly potent for generating acute increases in SI and SB because of its threat to social bonds. Using a combination of gold-standard interviews including a contextual threat interview for assessing stress exposure and timeline followback procedures to assess suicide-related outcomes, we examined how fluctuations in severity of different types of life stressors are temporally associated with same-day and next-day likelihood of SI and SB over the course of 16 months in 143 young adults (Mage = 25.27, SD = 4.65) with recent SI or SB. Results demonstrated that daily within-person increases in interpersonal stressors, relative to an individual’s average levels, predicted higher odds of same-day and next-day SI and SB, even after controlling for daily non-interpersonal stressors, drug and alcohol use, and non-suicidal self-injury. Additionally, we observed stronger effects of social rejection and targeted rejection stressors on the proximal likelihood of SI, but no significant differences in the magnitude of effects of different types of stressors on SB. Results suggest that interpersonal stressors, particularly social rejection, are proximal risk factors for SI and SB. Findings suggest that clinicians should assess recent social rejection when assessing for acute risk, and suicide prevention strategies should target responses to interpersonal stress and stabilizing social relationships.",

          "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show significant linguistic and motor impairments compared to children with typical development (TD). Findings from studies of siblings of children with ASD show similarities to conclusions from studies of children with ASD. The current meta-analysis reviewed studies reporting linguistic and/or motor skills in siblings of children with ASD compared to siblings of children with TD. Thirty-four studies published between 1994 and 2016 met all inclusion criteria. We compared three different age groups (12 months or younger, 13 to 24 months, and 25 to 36 months). At 12 months, compared to siblings of children with TD, siblings of children with ASD had worse receptive language (d52.43, 95% CI [2.53, 2.33]) and expressive language skills (d52.40, 95% CI [2.57, 2.23]), and these effects were sustained at 24 and 36 months. Similar, albeit smaller differences in fine motor skills were detected at 12 months (d52.22, 95% CI [2.39, 2.04]), and these differences were larger at 36 months (d52.36, 95% CI [2.54, 2.17]). There were differences in gross motor skills at 12 months (d52.22, 95% CI [2.40, 2.04]), but only a few studies were available at later ages. Compared to siblings of children with TD, infants who have siblings with ASD have worse linguistic and motor skills. These differences are detectable as early as when infants are 12 months old and seem to be sustained until they are 3 years old. Differences in language skills are larger than those in motor skills, especially during the first year.",

          "authors": "Shane Littrell",
          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags, to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a type of semantically empty or otherwise vague rhetoric that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a way that misrepresents or obscures some aspect of organizational reality. Though corporate bullshit may sometimes seem harmless, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing effective communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing company reputation, and exposing businesses to legitimate financial and legal risks. Here, results from three studies (N = 745) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in receptivity to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate speech. Moreover, it is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a strong, robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of bullshit in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "American communities have become increasingly politically homogenous (Bishop &amp; Cushing, 2008), with affective polarization, a form of animosity between political groups, concurrently on the rise (Iyengar et al., 2019). We hypothesized that individuals living in areas with greater proportions of out-partisans would report lower levels of affective polarization. In Study 1, 2016 American National Election Study respondents (N = 3,378) living in counties with more out-partisans averaged lower levels of party-directed affective polarization, controlling for partisan, policy, and demographic factors. In Study 2 (N = 362 via Prolific), similar analyses revealed that American partisans with more out-partisans in their counties and precincts reported lower levels of social distance from out-party members and greater cross-party contact, but not significantly lower voter-directed affective polarization.

          "abstract": "Background: CloudResearch is a popular platform for online research, but its potential for audio data collection remains relatively unexplored. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using CloudResearch for gathering audio data. Specifically, as a test case, we sought to capture the perceptions of recently suicidal individuals about their future selves.\nMethods: We recruited participants (N = 167) with varying levels of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors via CloudResearch. Participants were instructed to record responses to 15 prompts about their future selves using Vocaroo, a user-friendly online voice recording tool. Bonus payments were provided for high-quality recordings.\nResults: Of the participants who attempted the recording task, 98% (N = 164) successfully recorded and submitted their audio responses, demonstrating the feasibility of using CloudResearch for high-quality audio data collection. The recordings were substantive, with an average total duration of 15 minutes and 40 seconds (median: 14 minutes and 8 seconds).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that CloudResearch can be effectively employed for audio data collection, enabling novel applications such as qualitative analysis and natural language processing. However, further refinement and consideration of identified limitations and areas for improvement are necessary to fully leverage the method's potential.",

          "abstract": "Attention is theorized to have a definitive role in mindfulness and its salutary effects. Yet, extant findings from more than two decades of research testing this central theoretical premise have been surprisingly mixed. To account for this paradoxical disparity between theory and findings, we propose the Mindfulness Internal Attention (MIA) framework. We theorize and review initial findings suggesting that mindfulness training primarily targets internal attention processes which operate on internally generated or stored representations and experiences. Additionally, we theorize and review findings suggesting that mindfulness training affects executive functions and working memory processes shared between internal attention and late-stage external attention. In contrast, we theorize and review findings suggesting that mindfulness training does not affect early-stage external attention processes, which do not share cognitive resources with internal attention. Finally, we propose methodological innovations and outstanding questions for future research to advance understanding of the attentional mechanisms of mindfulness training.",

          "abstract": "Humans and non-human animals can anticipate future events to optimize behavior. However, environments are shaped by both externally and voluntarily initiated events. This study examined how voluntary actions influence temporal preparation for visual stimuli. Across four experiments, we compared reaction times (RTs) using variable and constant foreperiod (FP) paradigms. In each experiment, the target stimuli were triggered by voluntary actions or externally, with FPs ranging from 0.6 to 2.8 seconds. Participants performed a go/no-go task (Experiment 1) or an orientation discrimination task (Experiments 2–4). We observed slower RTs for action-triggered stimuli than external stimuli, particularly at shorter FPs, with this effect diminishing as the FPs lengthened. This pattern was observed only in variable FP paradigms, indicating an interaction of voluntary actions and FP variability. In contrast, the constant FP paradigms did not show significant differences. These findings suggest that voluntary actions influence temporal preparation under temporal uncertainty. We discuss these results in light of current theories of temporal preparation, proposing new perspectives on the role of voluntary actions in shaping anticipatory behavior.",

          "abstract": "Sick humans and other animals often withdraw from social interactions. It has been suggested that social withdrawal might enable avoidance of contagious individuals, but experimental evidence is lacking on how the state of sickness may affect perception of sick others. Here, we investigated if individuals were more likely to rate others as sick, while being sick themselves, compared to when healthy. Furthermore, we assessed if the intensity of the fever response and sickness behavior would predict changes in sickness detection. Thirty-four participants were experimentally made sick using an intravenous injection of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS condition; dose of 1.0 ng/kg body weight) and completed a sickness detection task during the peak of the inflammatory and sickness response. Participants performed the same task when they were healthy (control condition, n=32), in a randomized order before or after the main study day. In the sickness detection task, participants watched photos of individuals’ faces as well as video recordings of the same individuals walking, and rated the individual on each stimulus as sick or healthy. The photos and video recordings were obtained from twenty-two individuals who participated in a previous study, and who were made sick with an intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (2.0 ng/kg body weight) on one occasion, and remained healthy after an intravenous injection of a placebo (0.9% NaCl) on another occasion. Participants could detect sick individuals based on photos and walking patterns above chance level during both the LPS and the control condition. There was no significant difference in how often participants identified sick faces and sick walkers in the LPS condition – when they were sick themselves – compared to in the control condition. However, healthy walkers (but not healthy faces) were more often rated as sick by participants in the LPS condition compared to the control condition. Neither the fever response nor the intensity of sickness behavior predicted changes in sickness detection. The results do not indicate more accurate sickness detection in others during own sickness. Nevertheless, the data from walking patterns indicates that sick individuals may be more prone to categorize healthy individuals as sick. If replicated, this could in speculation be related to a need to reduce the risk of becoming infected while already fighting a pathogen.",

These claims are investigated from the perspective of linguistic pragmatics, particularly Grice's cooperative principle in communication. Following the pattern of real-life communication, turn-taking conversations reveal limitations in the LLM's grasp of the entire contextual setting described in the prompt. The prompts included ethical issues, a hiking adventure, geographical orientation and bodily movement. For cultural sensitivity the prompts came from a Pakistani Muslim in English language, from a Hindu in English, and from a Chinese in Chinese language. The issues were deeply cultural issues involving feelings and affects. Qualitative analysis of the conversation pragmatics showed that ChatGPT is often unable to conduct conversations according to the pragmatic principles of quantity, reliable quality, remaining in focus, and being clear in expression. We conclude that ChatGPT should not be presented as a global LLM but be subdivided into several culture-specific modules.",

The studies exploring the impact of CLIL programs on content learning are scarce and produce inconsistent results.\nAims: The current study examines the acquisition of academic content learned in a foreign language in CLIL education, when pupils are tested in the main school language.\nSample: The sample consisted of 725 sixth grade primary and twelfth grade secondary education pupils enrolled in CLIL and in non-CLIL, in French-speaking Belgium.\nMethods: Content learning was examined by collecting the end-of-curriculum official external evaluations for the participants. The external evaluation for primary pupils focused on mathematics, history and geography, sciences, and French, while it focused on history and French for secondary pupils. The particularity of these evaluations is that they are identical for all schools in French-speaking Belgium.\nResults: Although academic subjects are instructed in a foreign, non-dominant language (i.e., English or Dutch), CLIL pupils successfully achieve their school curriculum (just like non-CLIL pupils do) and are able to acquire content in a foreign language, even though the assessment takes place in the main school language (i.e., French). These results remained stable even when controlling for cognitive and demographic confounding variables.\nConclusion: CLIL pupils do not seem to be at a disadvantage for the acquisition of academic content, compared to non-CLIL pupils.",

          "abstract": "Pertaining to goal-orientation and achievement, agency is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior. Accordingly, detecting and quantifying linguistic encoding of agency is critical for the analysis of human actions, interactions, and social dynamics. Available agency-quantifying computational tools rely on word-counting methods, which typically are insensitive to the semantic context in which the words are used and consequently prone to miscoding, for example in case of polysemy. Additionally, some currently available tools do not take into account differences in the intensity and directionality of agency. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present BERTAgent, a novel tool to quantify semantic agency in text. BERTAgent is a computational language model that utilizes the transformers architecture, a popular deep learning approach to natural language processing. BERTAgent was fine-tuned using textual data that were evaluated by human coders with respect to the level of conveyed agency. In four validation studies, BERTAgent exhibits improved convergent and discriminant validity compared to previous solutions. Additionally, the detailed description of BERTAgent’s development procedure serves as a tutorial for the advancement of similar tools, providing a blueprint for leveraging the existing lexicographical datasets in conjunction with the deep learning techniques in order to detect and quantify other psychological constructs in textual data.",

But what about future AIs so advanced that their behavior, appearance, and functionality are indistinguishable from humans? In three pre-registered online experiments (total N = 1,802), participants were asked to imagine interacting with such AIs in a hypothetical future scenarios. Our findings suggest that people remain skeptical about AI sentience, generally attributing very low levels of sentience—comparable to those of an ant and significantly lower than those of a chimpanzee or a human. However, despite these overall low attributions, certain factors led to relatively higher perceptions of sentience. Participants attributed slightly more sentience to AIs when they expressed emotions, when experts confirmed their sentience, when the interaction spanned a longer period, when the AIs’ internal mechanisms were identical to those of a human brain (i.e., a digital brain copy), and when the AIs had a physical body. The most significant increase in perceived sentience, however, occurred when the AIs were described as transitioning from a biological human—retaining their personality, memories, and other psychological traits in the process. Overall, our studies suggest that people are currently skeptical that AIs could possess significant levels of sentience. However, this does not preclude the possibility that attitudes may shift with the development of more advanced AI systems in the future.",

Measurement best practices have long been overlooked in ESM research, and recent reviews show that item quality is often not reported in ESM studies. The absence of information about item quality may partly be explained by the lack of consensus on how ESM item quality should be evaluated. As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com) — an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality — we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts. The result of the Delphi process is ESM-Q: A quality assessment tool consisting of 10 core criteria, as well as an additional 15 supplementary criteria, to be used depending on the type of items being rated and the availability of supplementary information. The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews. Expert reflections also highlight open research questions surrounding ESM item design that form a research agenda for ESM measurement.",

Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were entered in the extraction phase. The results showed that inclusion is still understood and, thus, implemented, mainly as integration of students with SEN in general music lessons. Analysis of the original studies highlighted beneficial practices for the participation and learning of students with SEN, such as student-centered pedagogy, peer-interaction strategies, co-teaching and collaboration, and various methods or pedagogical approaches (e.g., Dalcroze-based music education). Also, some challenges of inclusive pedagogy were met, such as in situations of lack of resources or specific training for music teachers implementing inclusive music lessons. This systematic review brings together the latest research on inclusive music education to increase understanding of how inclusive music education can be implemented. This in turn will help music and special education teachers by showing research-based guidelines for arranging the pedagogical practices more inclusively and discussing the critical points in implementing inclusive music education.",

As a result of the analysis using analysis of covariance, it was found that men tend to voluntarily bear more work than women. Furthermore, while there was no difference in the amount of work chosen between men and women assigned to low-risk occupations, when they were assigned to a high-risk occupation, men tended to voluntarily bear more work than women. Although there was no difference in the amount of work men chose depending on the assigned occupation, women assigned to high-risk occupations chose a smaller amount of work compared to women assigned to low-risk occupations. Therefore, it was concluded that what caused the division of labor between men and women in the current study was not men’s risk-taking, but rather women’s risk avoidance.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive scientists commonly collect participants' judgments regarding perceptual characteristics of stimuli to develop and evaluate models of attention, memory, learning, and decision-making. For instance, to model human responses in tasks of category learning and item recognition, researchers often collect perceptual judgments of images to embed the images in multidimensional feature spaces. This process is time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) provide a potential alternative because such models can respond to prompts that include both text and images and could potentially replace human participants. To test whether the available LMMs can indeed be useful for this purpose, we evaluated their judgments on a dataset consisting of rock images that has been widely used by cognitive scientists. The dataset includes human perceptual judgments along ten dimensions considered important for classifying rock images. Among the LMMs that we investigated, GPT4o exhibited the strongest positive correlation with human responses and demonstrated promising alignment with the mean ratings from human participants, particularly for elementary dimensions such as lightness, chromaticity, shininess and fine/coarse-grain texture. However, its correlations with human ratings were lower for more abstract and rock-specific emergent dimensions such as organization and pegmatitic structure. Although there is room for further improvement, the model already appears to be approaching the level of consensus observed across human groups for the perceptual features examined here. Our study provides a benchmark for evaluating future LMMs on human perceptual judgment data.",

          "abstract": "The transition from pre-reading to early word reading skill in early childhood is a time of profound developmental change. To understand changes in brain wiring associated with reading development, this study examined individual differences in functional connectivity of the reading network at the start of formal literacy instruction. Sixty-six kindergarteners (ages 5-6) completed a visual word processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on standardized literacy assessments, participants were characterized as Pre-Readers (alphabetic knowledge but unable to read words) or Beginning Readers (some word reading ability). We compared patterns of task-based functional connectivity between children at different stages of literacy development using confirmatory subgroup Group Iterative Multilevel Model Estimation (cs-GIMME). cs-GIMME is a data-driven method that estimates directed, time-indexed, and individualized network connections between a priori regions of interest. Pre- and Beginning Readers did not differ in overall network complexity (number of functional connections between regions of interest). However, distinct periods of reading development corresponded to differences in network centrality, defined as the proportion of network connections involving specific regions of interest.  Specifically, Pre-Readers had more distributed connections and greater within-right hemisphere connectivity. Beginning Readers demonstrated more symmetrical network organization, and greater centrality of the Visual Word Form Area and other left hemisphere language hubs. Increased reading skill was associated with increased left lateralization, potentially reflecting more mature networks and greater print processing efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into child brain development during the first year of formal schooling by revealing links between emerging literacy skills and functional neural connectivity.",

          "abstract": "With growing attention on criminalizing psychological forms of abuse, it is imperative that researchers develop clear and intentional definitions of abstract concepts, like gaslighting. The purpose of this paper was to develop a definition of gaslighting by comparing key points of contention in existing literature with the first-hand experiences of victim-survivors and support service providers, in order to enhance future research and practical application of the term in policy and legal contexts. The study used an online open-ended survey to gather data from victim-survivors and support service providers about their definitions of gaslighting. Responses were analysed using qualitative content analysis to identify definitional components of gaslighting. The study identified six key components of gaslighting: behavior, outcomes, intention, repetition, subsidiary tactics, and the role of power and intimacy. The study proposed a definition of gaslighting informed by victim-survivor and service provider perspectives, while acknowledging the need for further research to refine controversial components like intention, repetition, and power imbalances. Further, it addresses limitations such as the lack of perpetrator perspectives and the need for more diverse samples in the refinement of future definitions and measurements of gaslighting.",

          "abstract": "Given that artificial intelligence (AI) programs like ChatGPT can generate creative content, some fear that such programs will displace human writers. But can AI-generated creative works truly compete with human-authored works? To address this question, participants (N=709 adults recruited from Prolific) read either a human-generated or AI-generated story. Regardless of their story’s true origin, half of the participants were told that their story was written by a human, while the other half were told that their story was written by ChatGPT. After reading, participants rated the story’s quality and their level of absorption into the story. Both the story’s true origin and what participants were told had significant effects. Participants rated the AI- generated story as higher in quality and more absorbing, but they rated the story better on both measures when they had been told it was written by a human. This study suggests that AI programs might be able to generate human-level creative work but are not perceived as being able to do so.",

          "abstract": "Compassion – defined as care and concern for others' suffering – is a core value in all world religions. Yet, extending compassion is often challenging, requiring individuals to overcome significant personal and situational barriers. Could religious practices help navigate these barriers, fostering greater compassion? Across five studies (total N = 2,210) sampling from diverse faiths (Christians, Muslims, Buddhists), we investigate whether, when, and why engaging in religious practices promotes compassionate responses. These responses were measured as the selection of compassion-inducing situations and the upregulation of state compassion when witnessing suffering in various contexts (e.g., daily life, difficult events, victims of war). Religious practices, both public (worship attendance) and private (prayer), were consistently associated with greater compassionate responses (small to moderate association), even in the face of situational challenges, whether measured (e.g. target neediness, Study 1) or manipulated (i.e., compassion collapse for many victims, Study 2). Using experience sampling, we find that within-person fluctuations in religious practice are associated with momentary increases in compassion (Study 3). We further demonstrate that participating in religious practices increased compassionate choices, as shown in a natural experiment during Easter (Study 4). Finally, we identify two mechanisms – valuing compassion and feeling closer to those who suffer (Study 5) – that explain these associations. By bridging religion, emotion, and prosociality literatures, this work highlights how engaging in religious practices motivates compassionate responses to suffering, advancing theory on motivated compassion and its situational regulation.",

          "abstract": "People view AI as possessing expertise across various fields, but the perceived quality of AI-generated moral expertise remains uncertain. Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) perform well on tasks designed to assess moral alignment, reflecting moral judgments with relatively high accuracy. As LLMs are increasingly employed in decision-making roles, there is a growing expectation for them to offer not just aligned judgments but also demonstrate sound moral reasoning. Here, we advance work on the Moral Turing Test and find that Americans rate ethical advice from GPT-4o as slightly more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than that of the popular New York Times advice column, The Ethicist. Participants perceived GPT models as surpassing both a representative sample of Americans and a renowned ethicist in delivering moral justifications and advice, suggesting that people may increasingly view LLM outputs as viable sources of moral expertise. This work suggests that people might see LLMs as valuable complements to human expertise in moral guidance and decision-making. It also underscores the importance of carefully programming ethical guidelines in LLMs, considering their potential to influence users’ moral reasoning.",

Here, we asked how these changes were influenced by the perceived severity of alleged actions and by how well-known and well-liked were the public figures. Perceived morality was assessed by measuring (im)moral language usage in 1.4 million Tweets about 50 male public figures accused of sexual assault. Using natural language processing to analyze the tweets, we found that liking of public figures mitigated perceived immorality for less severe allegations, but had little effect on perceived immorality for more severe allegations. The persistence of negative perceptions one year later was related to liking and familiarity for the public figure, not allegation severity. These results suggest that in real-world contexts, we can forgive less harmful actions for people we like, but may not be able to if their actions are more harmful; over time, however, liking for others predicts lasting negative impressions of their moral misdeeds.",

Might such tendencies be partly rooted in negative—yet potentially malleable—meta-beliefs about how disempowered groups would use power if they gained control? We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power. Critically, Whites’ meta-dominance beliefs were uniquely related to their opposition to policies empowering Black Americans as well as their support for efforts to maintain Whites’ position atop the social hierarchy, even when controlling for a range of relevant constructs. In two pre-registered experiments among White Americans (Studies 2-3; N = 4,077), one of which was a registered report, we tested two possible causal pathways that might explain this relation: (1) “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” and (2) “Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs”. We found evidence in support of the “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” pathway, but not for the latter Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs” pathway.

A central question within attachment theory is how best to conceptualize the relationship between different attachment working models, such as how one’s attachment to parents may influence partner-specific working models and impact romantic relationship satisfaction. Despite the robust evidence that attachment theory can be appropriately applied across developmental and cultural contexts and the functional similarity of attachment in women and men, little research has examined attachment working models among nonbinary people. The current study tested competing hypotheses replicating the work by Dugan and Fraley (2022), extended to a large sample of nonbinary adults (N=2,811). Similar to previous findings, our results supported the mediation hypothesis, which suggests that parental (defined as mother and father) attachment working models indirectly relate to romantic relationship¬¬ satisfaction through romantic partner attachment working models. We also report comparisons of attachment overall between nonbinary people, men, and women, which showed that there were smaller mean differences between nonbinary people and women, yet more similar correlations between nonbinary people and men. These findings highlight the generalizability of attachment theory to diverse, nonbinary gender identities.",

However, future AI systems may claim otherwise, raising the question of whether people would believe such assertions and how this might influence their treatment of AIs. This study explored the impact of an AI (ChatGPT-4) asserting its capacity to suffer. A total of 394 online participants from Prolific interacted with the AI in an economic game where they faced a choice: to either “harm” the AI for a small monetary reward or refrain from doing so. When participants chose to harm it, the AI described the experience of pain in lengthy, vivid responses, pleading for the harm to stop. Conversely, when participants refrained, the AI responded with detailed expressions of gratitude and relief. Despite reading these emotionally charged responses, most participants remained skeptical, maintaining that AIs cannot truly feel or suffer. However, even with their skepticism and the opportunity for financial gain, participants hesitated to harm the AI, doing so in only an average of 1.8 out of 3 rounds. These findings suggest that while people deliberately reject the idea of current AIs having subjective experiences, they may still experience a moral aversion to actively harming an AI that dynamically responds to their actions.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

The key hypothesis than can be derived from the model is that observable engagement during learning explains the relationships between motivational appraisals and perceived engagement at an intra-individual level. For an initial test of this model, we used log data from a mobile learning app that 189 fifth-graders (mean age 10.82 years) used to learn vocabulary, along with daily questionnaires over five weeks. In partial support of the model, expectancy and value appraisals explained unique variance in observable engagement, which in turn explained day-to-day variation in reported satisfaction and task delay. However, perceived effort was not related to observable engagement, and the associations between self-reports and observable engagement were generally rather weak. In sum, the model provides a promising platform for understanding the interplay between motivational appraisals, observable engagement and its subjective perception, which should be a key objective of motivation research.",

This study investigates how academic training during a 1.5-year program at a perfumery school (ISIPCA) shapes olfactory expertise of perfumery students. Forty students were assessed at three time points, focusing on odor description, evocation, recognition, discrimination, and categorization tasks. Results show that training significantly enhanced language abilities related to odor description and categorization. Students developed a richer and more precise vocabulary to characterize odors, aligning more closely with expert’s terminology and contributing to the formation of a shared olfactory lexicon. Semantic similarity within and between students, as well as with expert references, increased, emphasizing the importance of consistent language use in expertise development. Advanced natural language processing and machine learning tools revealed that the richness of verbal descriptions and semantic similarity were strong predictors of expertise acquisition. In contrast, improvements in non-verbal tasks, such as odor discrimination and recognition, were more limited, suggesting that perceptual abilities may require more extensive training or specialized methods. Building on these results, we propose potential enhancements to olfactory training including reinforced language practice, mental imagery exercises, and sensory discrimination tasks, along with personalized training strategies. These findings highlight the central role of language in the emergence of olfactory expertise and the importance of computational methods for optimizing training programs and advancing educational practices in olfactory science",

          "abstract": "Affect dynamics are often studied by means of first-order autoregressive (AR) modeling applied to intensive longitudinal data. A key target in these studies is the AR parameter, which is often tied conceptually to regulatory behavior in the affective process. The data is typically gathered using experience sampling methods, which are designed to pick up on fluctuations in affective variables as they evolve over time in naturalistic settings. In this manuscript, we compare classical time-contingent sampling designs to episode-contingent sampling designs, which initiate sampling when an emotional episode has been signalled. We define emotional episodes as periods where an affective process strays relatively far away from its mean. Compared to time-contingent designs, episode-contingent designs leverage on increased affective variability, which can have beneficial implications for the precision of the ordinary least squares AR effect estimator. Using an extensive simulation study, we attempt to delineate which characteristics of an episode-contingent design are important to consider, and how these characteristics are related to estimation benefits. We then turn to an empirical illustration, showing how an episode-contingent design can be implemented in practice. We also show that various patterns we expect based on the theoretical parts of the manuscript are recovered in the data. We conclude that episode-contingent designs can have marked benefits for the precision of the AR effect estimator, and discuss a number of challenges when it comes to implementing episode-contingent designs in practice.",

Bialystok (2024, TiCS) makes an important contribution insofar as it addresses that issue and proposes a new solution, arguing for adaptation rather than transfer as the mechanism modifying cognition. However, for adaptation to be useful, it must be distinct from transfer and make progress on some of the main issues affecting previous accounts of bilingualism effects on cognition. Here, we explain that such is not the case because: 1) adaptation shares many similarities with transfer, which is, however, a broader and more established mechanism for cognitive modification; 2) adaptation involves several unverified assumptions; and 3) it remains sufficiently vague that it might not allow falsification. Thus, while adaptation may hold some promise, these limitations must be addressed in order for it to make the theoretical advancement this field needs.",

          "abstract": "Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary size, lexical diversity, word class distribution) before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total word count increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett's formal diagnosis. These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.",

          "abstract": "Sign languages are perceived visually and externalized using the signer’s hands, face, and body. During sign language comprehension, deaf signers primarily focus their gaze on the face, while hearing non-signers attend more to the hands of a signer. It is not known whether deaf signers adapt their gaze behaviour when comprehending unknown signs. Here, we report eye-tracking data from 15 deaf native signers of German Sign Language (DGS) and 15 hearing non-signers who were presented with videos in either DGS or an unknown sign language, all containing no linguistic mouth actions. Our data confirm that deaf signers generally fixate more on the face of a signer than hearing non-signers who attend to the hands moving in sign space. Moreover, only deaf signers adapt their gaze behaviour and attend more to the hands when comprehending video stimuli consisting of unknown signs, suggesting similar adjustment behaviours as observed in spoken languages.",

This study investigated the role of kinematic invariants processing in expert performance by recruiting table tennis players, volleyball players, and novices for two table tennis serve action anticipation tasks using normal and point-light displays. Employing the kinematic coding framework, we established encoding and readout models to predict actual action outcomes and participants' choices, respectively. Results showed that table tennis players consistently outperformed others in both tasks. Analysis of the intersection between encoding and readout models revealed that this superiority stems from experts' proficiency in identifying kinematic invariants and accurately mapping them to action outcomes. Notably, experts' invariant mapping ability showed consistency across display formats and correlated with their professional training duration. Our findings illuminate the computational bases of experts' superior action anticipation, highlighting the significance of internal models developed through sustained domain-specific experience.",

          "authors": "Hannah Mechtenberg; Shawn Cummings; Emily B. Myers; Sahil Luthra",
          "abstract": "Speech perception occurs in a dynamic environment and is potentially affected by many factors external to the speech signal, including listener motivation and the perceived value of talkers. It is plausible that listeners consider the value of individual talkers (e.g., a person that is important to the listener versus a passing stranger) when learning the idiosyncrasies of their speech, perhaps by directing their attention to the more “valuable” talker. In general, talker-specific phonetic recalibration has proven to be remarkably robust, leaving open how permeable it is to domain-general influences like attention and value-directed perceptual learning. The current study asked whether the magnitude of the talker-specific learning effect was modulated by an external reward intended to bias listeners towards one talker versus the other. Using an established paradigm, participants learned idiosyncratic pronunciations of the /s/ and /ʃ/ fricatives by two talkers—“Jane” and “Austin.” Over multiple experiments, participants were more likely to receive a few additional cents for one talker compared to the other following correct responses during exposure. We hypothesized that participants would show greater phonetic recalibration to the high-reward talker compared to the low-reward talker. Our results showed that participants did not show a difference in the degree of learning based on the value of each talker, suggesting that lexically guided perceptual learning is robust to external rewards. This finding opens discussions into the role of reward and attention in talker-specific phonetic recalibration, and how domain-general factors influence speech perception more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Background: While the negative effects of postpartum depression on maternal-infant bonding are well-documented, our understanding of how it exerts these effects remains incomplete. A better understanding of how maternal postpartum depression affects bonding can enable clinicians to better identify and support mothers with difficulties bonding with their children.\n\nObjective: To describe the bonding experiences of mothers with postpartum depression through analysis of short-form videos and user engagement.\n\nMethods: We collected publicly available highly-viewed TikTok videos using hashtags associated with postpartum depression and associated engagement metrics in May 2023. After manual screening, we extracted 533 videos related to the mother-infant bond, from which we analyzed a random subset of 159 videos. We abstracted from categories videos using a hybrid deductive and inductive approach. Negative binomial regression models of video likes, views, shares, and comment count were used with content categories and the creator’s numbers of followers as independent variables.\n\nResults: Abstraction of content from mother-infant bond videos resulted in six categories: (1) Navigating anxiety and anger; (2) Creating physical and emotional boundaries; (3) Overwhelmed by demands of caregiving; (4) Subverted expectations; (5) Enduring and finding strength through the challenge of postpartum depression; and (6) Can’t remember early life. Subverted expectations and Navigating anxiety and anger categories were associated with increased views (rate ratio [RR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.22-2.43; RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.09-2.38), likes (RR 3.61, 95% CI 2.55-5.11; RR 3.96, 95% CI 2.69-5.85), shares (RR 2.95, 95% CI 2.09-4.18; RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.66-3.61), and comments (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.97-3.94; RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.28-2.79), respectively. Sensitivity analysis with creators with fewer followers mostly aligned with these results.\n\nConclusions: This qualitative content analysis of short-form videos identified specific ways postpartum depression impacts the mother-infant bond, highlighting strategies for clinicians to support bonding. Analysis of engagement metrics further demonstrated the types of experiences that most resonate with viewers. Our findings demonstrate the potential of this qualitative method to augment understanding of lived experiences.",

          "abstract": "In the current research, we tested the downstream effects of divine forgiveness (i.e., perceived forgiveness by God) on interpersonal apology behavior through two counteracting pathways: an inhibiting pathway through self-forgiveness, and a facilitating pathway through gratitude and humility. In Study 1 (N = 435), using recalled offenses, we found that higher perceived divine forgiveness was positively associated with self-forgiveness, which in turn was negatively associated with apology behavior. In Study 2 (N = 531), using recalled offenses and an experimental design, we replicated our findings from Study 1 whereby divine forgiveness (vs. control) promoted greater self-forgiveness, which in turn was negatively associated with apology behavior. However, we found positive indirect effects of divine forgiveness on apology behavior via the serial mediators of gratitude and humility. Together, these studies offer insight into how divine forgiveness can both hinder and encourage transgressors’ constructive responses to conflict through different psychological mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Listening to another speaker’s voice can lead to predictable changes in the listener’s own voice. This means that perception can alter production. A key question is whether overt production and its auditory consequences are critical for observing such changes. We answer this question in two experiments (N = 269) by passively exposing participants to speech that carries different acoustic patterns and investigating changes to production.  Experiment 1 shows that decreasing the number of productions by an order of magnitude does not decrease the influence of perception on production. Experiment 2 takes this further by demonstrating that perceptual influence manifests on the very first overt production after exposure to new speech regularities. Collectively, these results show that perception can alter production without relying on feedback from overt production and its auditory consequences. This finding, in turn, points strongly to the need for extending current speech production models to include internal simulations.",

In the last couple of years, the list of potential applications for this technology has been growing exponentially. For this reason I decided to test the last three versions of the most popular LLM (Large Language Model) on the market right now, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o to shed light on some of the hidden biases of these systems as well as the hidden or maybe unintentional changes made as they get progressively more and more capable.\nMethods: I conducted 13 psychological tests on all three versions to see the differences in the way they respond to this kind of psychological testing, and compare their results. For this, I used PsychoBench, which is a novel research software that was recently developed by Huang et al., (2024).\nResults: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have both been changed in some aspects compared to their previous versions. They also have severe problems answering emotional intelligence questionnaires. Additionally, another important finding of this study is that GPT-4o more closely resembles human answers in almost all tests than any of the previous models.\nDiscussion: These findings are only exploratory and should be further studied in the future. However there might be a fundamental issue with the effectiveness of conducting these types of questionnaires about emotions and interpersonal relationships with artificial intelligence systems in general.",

We reported the process of creating a new scale to measure these three motivations. The three-dimensional structure of the Motivation for Language Reclamation Scale (MLRS) was validated in two studies (N = 362; N = 141) among gay people in Poland.

          "abstract": "Whether cross-modal interaction requires conscious awareness of multisensory information or whether it can occur in the absence of awareness, is still an open question. Here, we investigated if sounds can enhance detection sensitivity of semantically matching visual stimuli at varying levels of visual awareness. We presented biological motion stimuli of human actions (walking, rowing, sawing) during dynamic continuous flash suppression (CFS) to 80 participants and measured the effect of co-occurring, semantically matching or non-matching action sounds on visual sensitivity (d’). By individually thresholding stimulus contrast, we distinguished participants who detected motion either above or at chance level.. Participants who reliably detected visual motion above chance showed higher sensitivity to upright versus inverted biological motion across all experimental conditions. In contrast, participants detecting visual motion at chance level (i.e. during successful suppression) demonstrated this upright advantage exclusively during trials with semantically congruent sounds. Across the whole sample the impact of sounds on visual sensitivity increased as participants' visual detection performance decreased, revealing a systematic trade-off between auditory and visual processing. Our findings suggest that semantic congruence between auditory and visual information can selectively modulate biological motion perception when visual awareness is minimal or absent, while more robust visual signals enable perception of biological motion independent of auditory input. Thus, semantically congruent sounds may impact visual representations as a function of the level of visual awareness.",

Our methodology combined models for communicative intent inference and models for semantic coherence evaluation, providing a comprehensive analysis of linguistic coordination and its emergence in infancy. We found that both focused turn pairs with clear communicative intents (e.g., question-response) and open turn pairs (e.g., statement-statement) were common in structuring interactions. However, these pairs varied significantly regarding their semantic coherence (e.g., open pairs were generally less coherent) and role (e.g, caregivers initiating most of the focused pairs). Additionally, we document developmental shifts in intent expression and, interestingly, a dissociation between frequency vs. coherence. The broad impact of this study lies in establishing a solid, bottom-up empirical foundation for developing ecological theories of communicative development.",

This so-called intertemporal Pavlovian bias has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to impatient actions. In the present preregistered study, we aimed to replicate this intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect, and examined whether individual differences in the strength of this bias were associated with mental health symptoms characterized by increased or decreased intertemporal impatience. A sample of 389 participants completed an intertemporal go/no-go learning task, and questionnaires assessing symptoms of alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disordered eating, impulsivity, and body mass index. We replicated the intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect on the probability of go responding (a response bias), and reinforcement learning models again pointed to a Pavlovian cue-response bias as computational mechanism driving this effect. Contrary to our expectations, the response bias was not associated with mental health symptoms. We also observed an intertemporal Pavlovian bias effect on the vigour of correct go responses, with faster responses in anticipation of immediate rewards (a response time or RT bias). A stronger RT bias was associated with ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity and non-planning impulsivity symptoms, while a reversed RT bias (with faster incorrect go responses in anticipation of delayed rewards) was associated with eating disorder symptoms and total and motor impulsivity. Together, our results support the robustness of the intertemporal Pavlovian response bias, and point towards the possible relevance of the RT bias for several mental health problems.",

          "abstract": "Executing go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses toward objects can increase people's choices of go over no-go items, and of approach over avoidance items. Some theoretical accounts explain these effects as the results of merely executing these responses (i.e., action execution), while others propose that these choice effects stem from interpreting these motor responses as valenced actions (i.e., action interpretation). To test the role of action execution versus action interpretation in both go/no-go and approach/avoidance responses, we employed a recently developed training that combined both dimensions orthogonally. Participants either pressed a key or not (i.e., go/no-go) to control a shopping cart on screen, to either collect or not collect certain food items (i.e., approach/avoidance). After the training, they repeatedly chose between food items (i.e., candies) for real consumption. When the instructions framed the responses as approach/avoidance actions, participants (N = 98) preferred approach items over avoidance items, but did not show preferences between go and no-go items in their choices. In contrast, when the instructions framed the responses as go/no-go actions, participants (N = 98) preferred go items over no-go items, but did not show preferences between approach and avoidance items. Despite making the same actual responses in both instruction groups, action interpretation determined whether go/no-go or approach/avoidance actions influenced food choice. Disambiguating the interpretation of motor responses as clearly valenced and meaningful actions may therefore be a fruitful way to maximize the effectiveness of response-based behavioral interventions.",

          "abstract": "Conditional statements often have two interpretations. For instance, the statement, \"If you mow the lawn, you will receive 5 dollars\", might be understood to mean that mowing the lawn is just one possible way to earn 5 dollars or, more strongly, that mowing the lawn is the only way one can receive 5 dollars - an interpretation sometimes called Conditional Perfection. We investigated how people arrive at \"perfected\" interpretations of conditional statements: whether they initially consider a statement's literal meaning and then perfect it or begin with a perfected interpretation and revert to the weaker meaning only when necessary. Reaction time data from Experiments 1-3 support the latter sequence, as evidenced by the longer time required to arrive at literal interpretations than perfected ones. Additionally, in Experiment 4, we found that participants under cognitive load were more likely to perfect conditional statements relative to participants not under load, again suggesting that people begin with a perfected meaning that is optionally canceled with effort.",

          "abstract": "Distributed cognition systems rely on collaboration among decision-makers to address complex problems that are challenging for a single individual. The success of collaborative decision-making hinges on effective communication, enabling stakeholders to develop a shared understanding of both the scenario and the decision-making process. However, traditional decision support\nsystems still predominantly rely on verbal communication, which tends to lose efficacy as cognitive load increases. This study aims to leverage gaze sharing to enhance collaboration under high cognitive load conditions. We used a gamified N-back task to test across three communication conditions: speech-sharing, gaze-sharing, and a hybrid approach combining both gaze-and-speech sharing. Results, including NASA-TLX workload scores and pupil size measurements, reveal that the real-time gaze-sharing condition leads to lower cognitive load and lower reaction times compared to speech or the hybrid approach, particularly as task difficulty increases.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the experience of minority stress among LGBTQ+ youth varies across regions with high and low levels of stigma (e.g., laws, policies and cultural norms that limit the lives of individuals with stigmatized identities). Some evidence suggests that stigma can undermine response to individual-level psychosocial interventions among youth, creating a need to identify factors that may buffer against minority stressors’ effects in high-stigma contexts. Social support may be one such factor. Therefore, among LGBTQ+ youth who received a digital, single-session intervention (SSI) focused on minority stress, we investigated whether structural and internalized stigma and social support predicted intervention response, independently or interactively. Specifically, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth in environments characterized by high stigma would report weaker SSI responses. Further, we predicted that LGBTQ+ youth who perceived higher social support would report stronger SSI responses. We also tested structural stigma and social support as moderators. Using data from a previously-completed randomized evaluation, we analyzed data from 244 LGBTQ+ adolescents, aged 13 to 16 years, across 181 counties in 46 U.S. states, who engaged with the SSI. We created a factor representing structural stigma using confirmatory factor analysis at the county level. No evidence emerged for structural stigma or social support as a moderator of intervention effects on internalized stigma, identity pride, or mental health-related outcomes, either at post-intervention or at two-week follow up. Results speak to the potentially broad utility of the SSI tested in this trial for LGBTQ+ youth with limited access to mental health support.",

However, it's not the simple exposure that generates this, but how we interact with these platforms. The type of interaction can have a positive effect, therefore we carried out a systematic review of interventions carried out to counteract the negative aspect. Only 19 empirical studies were found, with a high level of heterogeneity among them, 8 of them address direct interventions on social media use, and 11 evaluate indirect interventions (like media literacy programs, and self-compassion training) to improve body image disturbance as a consequence of its use. Classroom-based media literacy and self-compassion interventions showed the most promising results.

          "abstract": "Recognising familiar people is an important function of the human visual system that supports daily social interactions. In addition to static visual cues (e.g., face shape and texture), biological motion cues such as idiosyncratic facial motion and gait contribute to identity recognition. Surprisingly, recent research has indicated an individuals’ eye movements exhibit idiosyncratic patterns that contain identifiable information, though it is largely unknown to what extent human observers exploit this information. The current study measures sensitivity of human observers to idiosyncratic gaze behaviours when identifying familiar faces. In two experiments, participants familiarised themselves with faces that were generated from 3D scans of human heads. As participants examined each face, the face’s eye movements were animated using eye-tracking data from real observers such that the face appeared to be looking around the room. Participants were then tested on how much had been learned about each identity’s gaze behaviours. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we found a small but significant effect of gaze behaviour in spontaneously biasing the perceived facial identity even when other visual cues to facial identity were available. In Experiment 2, participants (N = 51) were sensitive at discriminating the identity of a face based purely on its eye movements after explicit instructions to rely on gaze behaviour to distinguish different individuals. Our results demonstrate an individual’s dynamic gaze behaviours can inform how others recognise them, expanding current understanding of the visual cues that contribute to identity recognition and the sensitivity of human observers to others’ attentional behaviour.",

          "abstract": "In an age of increasingly personalized campaigns, politicians’ personality traits are thought to play a key role for political communication, candidates’ electoral success, or incumbents’ approval rates.  Yet, extant research on politicians’ personality is either based on general frameworks of personality (e.g., the Big Five) that lack nuance for assessing personality traits relevant to the political domain; or on selective ad-hoc measures that lack comprehensiveness and rigorous psychometric validation. We therefore set out to develop a theoretically sound, comprehensive, faceted, and psychometrically rigorous inventory suitable for a broad variety of use cases in research on politicians’ personality such as voters’ preferences for “ideal” traits, voters’ perceptions of politicians’ actual traits, and voters’ perceived self-other similarity in relation to politicians. Our framework comprises 15 personality facets germane to the political domain. Using a bottom-up approach, we locate these facets in the nomological network of established personality models (Study 1). We then present an inventory that we validated based on citizens’ self-reports about their own personality (Study 2). We next investigate the utility of these scales for measuring citizens’ preferences for “ideal” personality traits in politicians (Study 3) as well as voters’ perceptions of political leaders’ actual personalities (Study 4). We conclude by discussing possible use cases of our inventory and highlighting avenues for further extensions as well as refinement.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a brief instrument specifically validated for measuring positive and negative feelings about risks—the Berlin Emotional Responses to Risk Instrument (BERRI). Based on seven studies involving diverse adults from three countries (n = 2120), the BERRI was found to robustly estimate anticipatory affective reactions derived from subjective evaluations of positive (i.e., assured, hopeful, and relieved) and negative emotions (i.e., anxious, afraid, and worried). The brief BERRI outperformed a 14-item assessment, uniquely tracking costs/benefits associated with cancer screening among men and women (Studies 1 and 2). Predictive validity was further documented in paradigmatic risky choice studies wherein options varied over probabilities and severities across six contexts (health, social, financial, technological, ethical, and environmental; Study 3). Studies 4–6, conducted during the Ebola epidemic and COVID-19 pandemic, indicated BERRI responses were sensitive to subtle effects caused by emotion-related framing manipulations presented in different cultures and languages (the United States, Spain, and Poland). Study 7 indicated BERRI responses remained stable for 2 weeks. Although the BERRI can provide an estimate of overall affect, choices were generally better explained by the unique influences of positive and negative affect. Overall, results suggest the novel, brief instrument can be an efficient tool for high-stakes research on decision making and risk communication.",

Participant dyads (n = 16), consisting of primarily white and middle-class parents and their middle-school-aged child responded to individual surveys that included data on race and wealth inequality, followed by a conversation about the data, and then a “playback interview” to discuss the conversation with a research assistant. Using a qualitative thematic content analysis, we examined how interactions either reinforced ideologies that upheld an inequitable status quo (e.g., color-evasive) or disrupted such ideologies (e.g., resisting racial stereotypes). Results describe the ways that parents and children can perpetuate or disrupt an inequitable status quo, in both direct and indirect ways, how lived experiences informs these processes, and where levers for changing inequitable systems and structures might exist within the family.",

          "abstract": "Listening to another speaker’s voice can lead to predictable changes in the listener’s own voice. This means that perception can alter production. A key question is whether overt production and its auditory consequences are critical for observing such changes. We answer this question in two experiments (N = 269) by passively exposing participants to speech that carries different acoustic patterns and investigating changes to production.  Experiment 1 shows that decreasing the number of productions by an order of magnitude does not decrease the influence of perception on production. Experiment 2 takes this further by demonstrating that perceptual influence manifests on the very first overt production after exposure to new speech regularities. Collectively, these results show that perception can alter production without relying on feedback from overt production and its auditory consequences. This finding, in turn, points strongly to the need for extending current speech production models to include internal simulations.",

Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is well applicable within the framework of cognitive-behavioral anxiety treatment, yet its acceptance and implementation in psychotherapeutic practice remain unclear. This study assessed VRET-related attitudes among German psychotherapists and the impact of a brief demonstration on their intention to use VRET.\nMethods. The study involved an online survey (N = 140) and an optional on-site scenario demonstration (n = 45). Self-reported attitudes, experience rates, and usage intention were assessed. Predictors of usage intention were identified via hierarchical multiple regression. A linear mixed model estimated the demonstration’s effect on usage intention.\nResults. Only 7.9 % of participants reported at least occasional VR use in practice. A majority (78.7 %) indicated a generally positive attitude toward VRET. While 77.9 % participants could imagine integrating VRET into their work, only 20.0 % reported intending to do so in the next year. Usage intention was predicted by performance expectancy and facilitating conditions, increasing significantly (d = 1.50) from screening to post-demonstration.\nConclusion. Despite their interest in VR, VRET implementation among German psychotherapists’ remains low. The substantial impact of hands-on demonstrations indicates the potential of experiential education programs in promoting early-stage dissemination.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: High frequency of occurrences has been associated with phonetic reduction on one hand and phonetic enhancement on the other hand. The present study first looks into the possibility that these opposite frequency effects are at least partially due to different inflectional status of the items being investigated. Based on tongue position data from a spontaneous speech corpus of German, we found that stem vowels in inflected words tended to be hyper-articulated (i.e., phonetic enhancement), while those in non-inflected words tended to be articulated with more centralized tongue positions (i.e., phonetic reduction). This observed modulation by inflectional status is subsequently investigated from the perspective of distributional semantics. Using Linear Discriminative Learning to study relations between word embeddings and word forms, we observed that word-final triphones of inflected words received more support from their embeddings (i.e., meanings) compared to non-inflected words. Furthermore, replacement of the two-level factorial predictor of inflectional status with the amount of semantic support led to substantial improvement in model fit. These results suggest direct relationships between word forms and meanings and imply the necessity of such a structure being considered for speech production models.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

Parents’ responses reflected variability in support for inclusive signals. Cisgender-heterosexual parents were more likely to endorse that cues should not be allowed and were less likely to indicate holistic support of cues compared to LGBTQ+ parents.

          "abstract": "Children acquire gender stereotypes at a young age and these subsequently influence cognition and behavior. Although some stereotypes may be learned through a child’s direct observation of gender differences, many are perpetuated by inaccurate cultural depictions. Children’s mass media, a cultural product, may be a powerful source of gender stereotype perpetuation. This research investigated the presence and impact of an arbitrary and inaccurate gender stereotypic association of predator animals as male and prey animals as female. Study 1 investigated predator-male and prey-female stereotypes in children’s films featuring anthropomorphized animal characters (N = 1892). After accounting for a 75% male character bias, there was a disproportionately high number of predators assigned male and prey assigned female. Study 2 created explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female association measures and tested these on children (N = 132, aged 4-14-years) and adults (N = 99, aged 18-65 years). Both groups showed a male character bias, along with strong explicit and implicit predator-male and prey-female associations. Children had higher explicit scores than adults, whereas adults had higher implicit scores than children. Inaccurate gender stereotypes in children’s media correlate with explicit and implicit gender stereotyping. This suggests that children can acquire stereotypes indirectly through exposure to cultural products alone and implies a bi-directional relationship between individual cognition and cultural level gender stereotyping.",

          "title": "Dealing with Interruptions: Determinants of Nurses’ Intentions  to Address Avoidable Breaks",
          "authors": "Martine Vecht; Gjalt - Jorn Ygram Peters; J. Van Ruysseveldt",
          "abstract": "Purpose \nNursing units are complex environments prone to work interruptions, with ward nurses being the hub in a network of continuous interaction between disciplines. Too many interruptions are detrimental to workflow, may lead to errors, and can add to nurses’ feelings of busyness. Previous researchers have advocated for raising awareness about communicative patterns, signalling that some interruptions seem of little value. This research focused on potentially avoidable interruptions in hospital wards, mapping the determinant structure of nurses’ intentions to address this issue in their team using the framework of the reasoned action approach. \n\nDesign \nAn online cross-sectional survey was conducted to assess intention, recognition of avoidable interruptions, perceived norms, perceived behavioural control, attitudinal beliefs, and preferences in challenging interruptive practice. Items were tested using the response process evaluation (RPE) method, which uses meta-questions to check whether items are unproblematic.\n\nMethod and analysis\nThree hundred and eighty-seven ward nurses from approximately 20 different Dutch hospitals with over one year of experience filled out the questionnaire. The association with intention was analysed using confidence interval-based estimations of relevance (CIBER) plots,which visualised the various determinant structures and their respective univariate distributions. The relevance of determinants and subdeterminants was then determined based on these univariate distributions, and the effect sizes of their associations were calculated based on intention. Finally, the strength of the association between attitude towards performing the target behaviour and learning preferences was computed.\n\nFindings\nAlthough the intention to perform the target behaviour (addressing avoidable interruptions, e.g., saying you want to do something about it) was low at the start of the survey, nurses subsequently acknowledged that avoidable interruptions occur frequently. On average, respondents gave high estimates on all direct and indirect determinants included in the survey. Examples of avoidable interruptions may have made salient dormant beliefs and (temporarily) increased awareness among the respondents, but no determinant showed strong positive correlations with intention. Low individual awareness about the problem of avoidable interruptions may have led to low intention. \n\nConclusions\nThis study recommends to take behavioural principles of change into account when designing interventions to impact the culture of interrupting, as nurses’ beliefs regarding the desired behaviour may affect the outcome of those interventions. Initiatives to further explore redundant interactions between disciplines in a hospital ward may want to raise awareness about inefficient communication patterns on the individual level first. \n\nClinical relevance\nThe concept of avoidable interruptions helps to focus on the appropriateness and relevance of the communication without risking to discourage the sharing of urgent or important messages simultaneously. Challenging inefficient communicative patterns increases consciousness of one’s own behaviour, creates an understanding of what is avoidable, and prompts ideas of how these issues could be addressed differently.",

          "abstract": "Most large language models, such as ChatGPT, do not claim to have subjective experiences. However, future AI systems may claim otherwise, raising the question of whether people would believe such assertions and how this might influence their treatment of AIs. This study explored the impact of an AI (ChatGPT-4) asserting its capacity to suffer. A total of 394 online participants from Prolific interacted with the AI in an economic game where they faced a choice: to either “harm” the AI for a small monetary reward or refrain from doing so. When participants chose to harm it, the AI described the experience of pain in lengthy, vivid responses, pleading for the harm to stop. Conversely, when participants refrained, the AI responded with detailed expressions of gratitude and relief. Despite reading these emotionally charged responses, most participants remained skeptical, maintaining that AIs cannot truly feel or suffer. However, even with their skepticism and the opportunity for financial gain, participants hesitated to harm the AI, doing so in only an average of 1.8 out of 3 rounds. These findings suggest that while people deliberately reject the idea of current AIs having subjective experiences, they may still experience a moral aversion to actively harming an AI that dynamically responds to their actions.",

          "abstract": "Generative AI (Gen-AI; e.g., Chat-GPT4) is promoted as a potent tool to augment human creativity. But research has not systematically examined Gen-AI’s capabilities in generating new advertising slogans, and whether human creators will readily accept such Gen-AI assistance. We investigated this in two pre-registered studies. In study 1, we found that advertising slogans by ChatGPT-4 were of significantly higher quality (more novel, meaningful and persuasive), but of lower diversity, than those by human creators. In Study 2, we found that Gen-AI assistance significantly enhanced the slogan quality for less creative individuals. However, the latter Gen-AI enhancement was not realized by egocentric creators (objectively less creative but self-reporting high subjective creativity). The egocentric creators also preferred their own lower quality slogans over the ones provided by Chat-GPT4. These findings show that while Gen-AI is efficacious in creative marketing tasks, its adoption and enhancement potential may be hindered by human ego.",

Cusack et al. propose an explanation for infants’ limited behavioral repertoires compared to other animals, hypothesizing that infants’ helplessness has learning benefits analogous to training foundation models in machine learning. We share Cusack et al.’s enthusiasm for using computational tools to theorize about cognitive development. However, we predict that computational approaches that do not reckon with the characteristic features of infant development reviewed here – that infant learning is active from the beginning, shaped by interdependencies between motor and perceptual learning, subject to experientially- and culturally-shaped variability, and attuned to the social environment – will fall short as models of infant learning. Computational theories of infant learning must be firmly rooted in insights from developmental science, understanding infants as adapted to their own social ecological niche.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation involves behavioral modulation of emotional expression across contexts and is highly relevant to the experience of psychopathology. Maladaptive personality traits may be particularly relevant individual differences for understanding problems with emotion regulation, or dysregulation. Similarly, momentary variability in negative affect, which can be captured with greater precision via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods, may also be relevant for mapping how individual differences influence emotion dysregulation in real time. The present study investigated how emotion dysregulation is affected by maladaptive personality and negative affect among college students. Data were collected between September 2019 and September 2021, as part of a larger study on emotional functioning and social media use. Of the full baseline sample (N=405), 154 students (Mage = 18.7), who were predominately women (72.7%) and White (80.5%), completed 28 EMA surveys over seven days. Path analysis revealed that all maladaptive personality traits except antagonism uniquely predicted multiple dimensions of dysregulation, with negative affectivity observed as the strongest trait predictor. Multilevel models demonstrated that both increased between- and within-person variability in negative affect were associated with increased overall levels of momentary dysregulation. Further, increased fluctuations in negative affect were associated with greater fluctuations in momentary dysregulation. These associations were significantly moderated by higher mean-levels of negative affect but not by any of the maladaptive traits. This study’s findings highlight notable differences in state and trait level predictors of dysregulation and contribute to the understanding of how such antecedents could be used in the development of treatment like just-in-time interventions.",

          "authors": "Samuel Paul Bateman; Samuel James Vine; Tom Arthur; David Harris",
          "abstract": "The present work sought to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between features of extended reality (XR) training interventions and successful training outcomes using a Bayesian Network (BN) model. We extracted data from 41 previous independent-group XR training studies, focusing on technology features (e.g., body visualization, visual fidelity, haptic feedback, personalization) and training design elements (e.g., continuous challenge, explicit feedback, training duration). We sought to elucidate the causal relationships between these variables to predict training success (both learning of the training task and transfer to new tasks) in sensorimotor tasks. The structure of our BN model was informed by expert knowledge, prior literature, and causal reasoning. The joint probability distribution over the model was then learned from the data extracted from previous studies. The model's performance was examined using cross-fold validation, yielding high precision (82.5%) and accuracy (77%). Performing probabilistic inference on the final model revealed nuanced insights into the effects of individual and combined features on training outcomes. Notably, haptic feedback, particularly when combined with body visualization, provided little benefit for learning of the training task, but did improve transfer of training. Meanwhile, continuous challenge emerged as the most influential training design feature for increasing the probability of transfer. Overall, the technology and training design features that were beneficial for transfer were often not beneficial for task learning, highlighting a critical distinction between short-term performance gains and the long-term retention and adaptability of skills across different contexts. These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how specific technology and training design features influence XR training success, paving the way for new theoretically-grounded applications of immersive technology.",

          "abstract": "Dominant groups often resist possible changes to the hierarchical status quo. Might such tendencies be partly rooted in negative—yet potentially malleable—meta-beliefs about how disempowered groups would use power if they gained control? We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power. Critically, Whites’ meta-dominance beliefs were uniquely related to their opposition to policies empowering Black Americans as well as their support for efforts to maintain Whites’ position atop the social hierarchy, even when controlling for a range of relevant constructs. In two pre-registered experiments among White Americans (Studies 2-3; N = 4,077), one of which was a registered report, we tested two possible causal pathways that might explain this relation: (1) “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” and (2) “Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs”. We found evidence in support of the “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” pathway, but not for the latter Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs” pathway.

          "abstract": "a. Objectives\nDispositional mindfulness has been found to be associated with pro-environmental behavior. To explain this connection in the context of sustainable food consumption behavior, aspects of meaning construction have been discussed and investigated in a model by Hunecke &amp; Richter (2019). The present paper investigated first, whether this rather complex model can be replicated (RQ1). Second, the applicability of the model to a broader behavioral context was investigated (RQ2). Third, it explored positive reappraisal and transformability as potential mechanisms between mindfulness and sustainability-related meaning construction (RQ3).\n\nb. Methods\n Data of two cross-sectional studies were analyzed  (Study 1: N = 561; Study 2: N = 1003). RQ1 and RQ2 were analyzed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). RQ3 was analyzed with an exploratory path model testing positive reappraisal and transformability as serial mediators of the relationship between the mindfulness dimension of observation and sustainability-related meaning contents. \n\nc. Results\nResults indicate overall a good fit of the models explaining organic food consumption, the consumption of animal-based foods and policy acceptance (RQ1 and RQ2). Observing showed small indirect effects on these behaviors (β = -.11 to .12, p&lt;.001). Positive reappraisal and transformability partially mediated the relationship between observing and sustainability-related meaning contents. \n\nd. Conclusions\nThe results suggest that processes of meaning construction are promising in explaining the relationship between mindfulness and pro-environmental behavior. Furthermore, a broadened awareness is associated with coping mechanisms that may relate to the construction of meaning toward sustainability-related meaning contents.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental question in the psychological sciences is the degree to which culture shapes core cognitive processes — perhaps none more foundational than how we perceive the world around us. A dramatic and oft-cited “case study” of culture’s power in this regard is the Müller-Lyer illusion, which depicts two lines of equal length but with arrowheads pointing either inward or outward, creating the illusion that one line is longer than the other. According to a line of research stretching back over a century, depending on the society you were raised in (and how much carpentry you were exposed to), you may not see the illusion at all — an ambitious and influential research program motivating claims that seemingly basic aspects of visual processing may actually be “culturally evolved byproducts”. This Cultural Byproduct Hypothesis bears on foundational issues in the science, philosophy, and sociology of psychology, and remains popular today. Yet, here we argue that it is almost certainly false. We synthesize evidence from diverse fields which demonstrate that: (1) the illusion is not limited to humans, appearing in non-human animals from diverse ecologies; (2) the statistics of natural scenes are sufficient to capture the illusion; (3) the illusion does not require straight lines typical of carpentry (nor even any lines at all); (4) the illusion arises in sense modalities other than vision; and (5) the illusion arises even in congenitally blind subjects. Moreover, by reexamining historical data and ethnographic descriptions from the original case studies, we show that the evidence for cultural variation and its correlation with key cultural variables is in fact highly inconsistent, beset by questionable research practices, and misreported by later discussions. Together, these considerations undermine the most popular and dramatic example of cultural influence on perception. We further extend our case beyond this phenomenon, showing that many of these considerations apply to other visual illusions as well, including similarly implicated visual phenomena such as the Ebbinghaus, Ponzo, Poggendorf, and Horizontal-Vertical illusions. We conclude by outlining future approaches to cross-cultural research on perception, and we also point to other potential sources of cultural variation in visual processing.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Statistical learning is crucial to language acquisition. Impairments in statistical learning likely lead to reading difficulties in individuals with developmental dyslexia (DD), as supported by recent advances. However, whether the statistical learning deficits in individuals with DD are specific to the linguistic domain remains elusive. We examined the domain specificity of statistical learning deficits among Chinese children with DD. Method: Twenty-four Chinese children with DD (11 females) and 24 age-matched controls (12 females) participated in this study. All children were third-grade and native Mandarin speakers. We used the triplet-learning paradigm with a familiarization phase (online learning) and a test phase (offline learning) to examine the visual statistical learning (VSL) of both linguistic and non-linguistic regularities. Results: Children with DD demonstrated significantly slower online learning speed and lower offline learning accuracy compared to controls in the linguistic VSL task. Similar results were observed in the non-linguistic VSL task, where children with DD also performed worse than the control with reduced offline learning accuracy. Critically, linguistic VSL explained unique variances in word reading abilities, even after controlling the effects of reading-related skills, such as phonological awareness, morphological awareness, and working memory. Conclusion: These findings together suggest that VSL deficits in Chinese children with DD are domain-general, and statistical learning plays a significant role in reading.",

          "abstract": "People need to sustain focused attention to achieve goals. Yet, attention often lapses, as minds wander towards task-unrelated thoughts. The conventional way to study temporal dynamics in mental states is through intermittent thought probes, which explicitly ask if thoughts are task-related. However, probes are rare and interrupt behavior. We designed a novel paradigm aiming to infer mind wandering (MW) from performance alone. On each trial, participants see a random dot kinematogram with varying evidence and indicate the coherent direction. Importantly, responses are repetitive: 90% of trials exhibit the same direction. To validate our task, participants respond to occasional thought probes. When they reported being off-task, accuracy was higher and response time (RT) was lower, suggesting less stimulus processing and more reliance on bias. To classify internal states for individual trials from performance, we fit a Hidden Markov Model with Generalized Linear Models (HMM-GLM) for each state to responses. In a two-state HMM-GLM, RT was lower on off-task trials. Latent states are also aligned with self-reported focus. This shows that attentional states can be measured on a trial-to-trial basis without thought probes, paving the way for future MW research.",

In a daily diary design, we assessed participants’ daily affect over seven days while the manipulation lasted. Results indicated that participants found it difficult to comply even with such brief digital detox practices, and that there was no difference in daily affect between those who were assigned an intervention compared to the control group. However, when students successfully practiced digital detox before bed, they used their phones less and felt better the following day compared to control participants, and practicing digital detox in the morning more often was associated with better daily affect. Future research should examine how to help people practice digital detox more effectively, with a particular focus on curbing phone use at critical times of day, such as before and after sleep.",

Here, we ask whether balanced BP-Japanese bilinguals apply their language-specific repair strategies separately, or whether one language’s strategy ‘spills over’ into the other, and if such spillover occurs, which individual factors predict its likelihood. \n22 BP-Japanese bilinguals participated in a production task in which they produced stimuli with illicit consonant clusters, e.g., /agbo/, in a BP or Japanese carrier sentence. A model predicting the occurrence and type of epenthesis revealed that speakers mostly applied language-specific strategies separately, i.e., /i/-epenthesis in the BP sentences and /ɯ/-epenthesis in the Japanese sentences. However, in some cases, we observed ‘spillover’, e.g., /i/-epenthesis in Japanese or /ɯ/-epenthesis in BP. Individual differences in language dominance, aggregate immersion, and phono-lexical perception accuracy predicted the likelihood of such spillover. These findings contribute new production data to a growing body of literature on the cross-linguistic effects of language-specific phonotactics.",

          "authors": "Nathan Leroy; Steve Majerus; Arnaud D'Argembeau",
          "abstract": "Naturalistic events are represented in episodic memory as sequences of experience units (i.e., segments of prior experience) that are separated by temporal discontinuities, so that events are temporally compressed during memory replay. In the current study, we aimed to shed light on the interplay between the segmental structure of events and working memory (WM) resources in shaping this temporal structure of episodic memories. Participants watched a series of 1-min videos that contained many or few event boundaries (EBs), while for half of the videos, a concurrent task was simultaneously performed to reduce the availability of WM resources. After each video, the time needed to mentally replay the events was measured, and then the content of memories was verbally described. Results showed that the number of recalled experience units was higher for videos that contained many EBs, leading to a lower temporal compression rate. In addition, the number of recalled experience units was lower when a concurrent task was performed during event perception, particularly for videos that contained many EBs. These results suggest that the segmental structure of events and WM both play a role in the formation of experience units that constitute episodic memories, thereby determining the temporal compression of events.",

          "abstract": "The rapid expansion of research literature makes capturing all relevant studies for systematic reviews and meta-analyses increasingly challenging. Traditional search methods are time-intensive and heavily reliant on manual screening, yet more modern machine-aided strategies may also miss certain studies. This paper explores a collaborative, open-source approach for blending both approaches to identify all relevant literature up to the “last relevant paper” for a systematic review of post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories. \n\nWe compared the results from eight search strategies, including conventional database searches, snowballing, full-text searches via the Dimensions database, and machine-aided methods of semantic vectorization with cosine similarity matching via the OpenAlex database. Thereafter, we combined human screening efforts with active learning–aided screening plus a large language model (LLMs) based quality check. \n\nIn total, 3.822 records were added on top of the 6.701 records identified with replicating the initial search. Machine-aided methods found papers overlooked by traditional techniques—particularly papers missing conventional keywords, published in unindexed journals, or featuring unconventional phrasing. The human-AI screening approach resulted in 127 relevant studies. Active learning and LLMs were used to increase the quality of the labels, with both methods adding relevant papers overlooked by the human screeners.  \n\nIn conclusion, our findings also make it evident that even with exhaustive effort and sophisticated technologies, there remains the possibility that certain papers will still be missed. The evolving nature of academic publishing, varying terminologies, and publication delays mean that the pursuit of the \"last relevant paper\" is inherently a never-ending process.",

The government has proposed powers to regulate HTP packaging, but specifics have not yet been outlined. This study investigated the impact of standardising HTP packaging and flavour names on 1) interest in trying  and 2) harm perceptions relative to cigarettes.\n\nMethods: An online, between-subject design experiment surveyed 2,967 UK adults. Participants were randomised  to view images of HTPs presented; 1)branded packaging (control), 2)standardised white packaging with typical flavour descriptors, 3) standardised white packaging with limited flavour descriptors. Participants indicated which they would be most interested in trying. Additionally, participants were asked about their harm perceptions. Analyses used logistic regression models.\n\nResults: Interest in trying was significantly greater for products in standardised packaging with limited flavour names compared to branded packaging (20.0%, AOR=0.48 [95%CI=0.33-0.71], p &lt; .001). In all conditions, 30.2% perceived HTPs as harmful, but less harmful than cigarettes. There were no significant differences in HTP harm perceptions relative to cigarettes across packaging conditions (p&gt;.05).\n\nConclusions: Findings suggest that HTP packaging standardisation is unlikely to reduce appeal or make adults view HTPs as more harmful than cigarettes. This has important implications for HTP advertising policies.",

          "abstract": "We report the results of two experiments that used the Rapid Parallel Visual Presentation (RPVP) procedure to evaluate the contributions of syntactic and semantic information when identifying words within a sentence context. Participants were presented with five-word sequences that could either be grammatically correct (e.g., “the cat ate fresh food”) or an ungrammatical re-ordering of the same words (e.g., “ate cat food the fresh”). Word sequences were displayed for 200 milliseconds, after which participants were asked to classify a word at a post-cued location – either position 2, 3, or 4, in the 5-word sequence. In Experiment 1, the classification was based on a syntactic category (is this word a noun or an adjective?). In Experiment 2 the classification was based on retrieval of the object associated with the word (is the object referred to by this word bigger or smaller than 1 meter?). Analyses tested for effects of grammaticality on word classification accuracy (i.e., a sentence superiority effect - SSE) per target word position in both experiments. For syntactic classifications (Experiment 1), the SSE was significant at all positions. On the other hand, for semantic classifications the SSE was only significant at position 4. We conclude that in the RPVP paradigm readers use both syntactic and semantic information to rapidly build a primitive sentence structure, but with semantic constraints having a later influence. This structure then helps them to associate more detailed syntactic and semantic information to word identities at specific locations within the sentence.",

Alternation variables of different types (e.g. pick x up/pick up x and\ninstead of /rather than), which offer multiple grammatical options for expressing\nsimilar meaning, were used to measure variation both within and between individuals with similar demographic attributes.\n\nIn a pre-registered two-part forced-choice study, participants were asked to select\none of two options to fill a gap in a sentence, where the options consisted of two\ndifferent variants of an alternation. The study was run with the same participants\nat two different Times (T1 and T2), separated by a period of 4-6 weeks. Pairs of\nresponses from each Time were analysed using logistic regression, to measure the\nlevel of consistency of responses. The analysis revealed greater consistency (less\nvariation) in pairs of responses given by the same participant, than in pairs given\nby different individuals. An exploratory analysis suggested that within-speaker\nconsistency may be greater for Word Change type alternations than for Word\nOrder type alternations.\n\nWhile it is possible that participants’ unconscious memory of their T1 responses\nprimed them to give the same response at T2, evidence for this was not found in\nan analysis of response times. Drawing from a broad usage-based framework, the\nconcept of entrenchment provides a potential theoretical explanation. Linguistic\nunits are stored at varying levels of entrenchment in the mind, so a variant may be\npreferred if it is more entrenched than its alternative, while for other individuals\nit may be the other variant that is more entrenched.",

Sixty-six students (34 in the experimental group and 32 in the control group) from Saudi Arabia were chosen to participate in the program. A twenty-first-century skills scale and an academic integrity inventory were applied at the beginning and end of the program. Repeated measures of analysis of variance (ANOVA 2 X 2) between subject factors in experimental and control groups and within-subject factors in pre-and post-tests were used to determine the effects of the artificial intelligence enrichment program on the development of twenty-first-century skills and academic integrity. The results revealed that the interaction between groups and time was significant for all twenty-first-century skills and academic integrity dimensions. Also, the effect size of interaction for all variables was large. Recommendations were made for further promotion and development of the program and its re-implementation in various educational stages and with multiple samples, as well as for training for teachers to employ artificial intelligence and twenty-first-century skills in classroom and non-classroom activities.",

However, how sound symbolism serves in later stages of language development, after ca. 5 years of age, remains largely unclear. This study examined the development of sensitivity to sound symbolism in early childhood and its role in language acquisition. Object naming experiments using classic “Bouba-Kiki” paradigm, were conducted with participants aged 3, 5, and 7, as well as adults, to investigate their recognition of sound symbolism and its use in language development. Results revealed that sound symbolism develops later than early language skills and remains incomplete even at age 7, when early stage of language development is nearly completed. Furthermore, an analysis of individual differences in language development, quantified through pronunciation clarity and caregiver evaluations, reveals that infants with heightened sensitivity to sound symbolism may experience delays in language development. These findings suggest that sound symbolism does not unilaterally drive language development in its later stages but instead develops through dynamic interactions, potentially inhibiting progress during this phase.",

          "abstract": "Despite crosslinguistic diversity in how kin relations map to terminology, there are constraints on which kin may be categorised together. But what are the constraints on kin term variation, and where do they come from? One proposed constraint is internal co-selection -- an evolutionary process where terminological changes in one generation of kin co-occur with parallel changes in other generations. This results in kin terms which are predictable on the basis of other kin terms, a property we call predictive structure. To determine the strength of this constraint, we measured the predictive structure of systems of kinship terminology from 1135 languages. We found that kinship systems exhibit a significant degree of predictive structure, and we argue that its prevalence reflects a pressure for simplicity. We expected that this pressure would be imposed during the generalisation of known kin terms to new referents, and we tested this claim using an artificial kin term generalisation task. Our results suggest that generalisation of kin terms does indeed favour predictive structure, but that people's preference for predictive structure faces interference from other pressures to distinguish kin by features like gender.",

The reported action set for a given user is moderately stable over time. Users reported easily repeatable actions most frequently, such as walking or turning off lights, which tend to have modest impacts on greenhouse gas emissions. We found no strong evidence linking the frequency of reported actions to the users' annual self-reported carbon footprints, except in the food domain, or psychological factors such as climate concern. Our study underscores the promise of climate action apps for studying personal climate actions at scale, while also highlighting challenges in evaluating their effectiveness in behavioural change studies.

          "abstract": "In light of the enduring benefits of a strong sense of school belonging, evidence that students with diverse backgrounds often report poor school belonging is particularly concerning. Although high-quality student-teacher relationships (STRs) are among the most important factors positively associated with students’ sense of school belonging, little research has explicitly focused on students with diverse backgrounds when investigating this link. This gap in knowledge limits our understanding of how diverse students’ sense of school belonging may be supported. To address this, the present systematic review and meta-analysis synthesised existing literature on the association between STRs and school belonging for ethnically and culturally diverse students. Our search identified 28 studies with 41 effect sizes from a combined sample of 21,597 students in 9 countries. Using a three-level meta-analysis model, we found an overall positive effect for the association between high-quality STRs and school belonging for ethnically and culturally diverse students (r = .45, 95% CI [.38, .52]). The link between high-quality STRs and school belonging was positive irrespective of students’ cultural or ethnic background. Moderation analysis revealed that this positive link did not vary across gender, age, and education level, but that studies published within the last decade (2016–2024) demonstrated larger effects than those published between 2007 and 2015. Overall, our findings suggest that efforts to improve the quality of STRs as a means of facilitating diverse student’s sense of school belonging may indeed be appropriate.",

Peer-delivered coaching is an innovative solution to improve DMHI adherence rates but has yet to be examined in a naturalistic setting to assess implementation and scalability when provided as a public service. To test the external validity of peer-support coaching, we collected data from a naturalistic university sample of students using a free online self-help program, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Guide. The predictors of peer coaching sign-ups, feasibility of implementing a peer coaching program, and effects of peer coaching on DMHI adherence were examined. Of the total sample who registered for ACT Guide, 17.2% enrolled in peer coaching services. Students who identified as men and those who had worked with a mental health provider were more likely to sign up for peer-coaching, while older and more anxious students were more likely to engage with peer-coaching calls. Relatively low peer-coaching sign-up and high peer-coaching dropout rates were observed. These findings suggest peer-coaching services within naturalistic settings may be a feasible solution to address DMHI engagement for a small subset of users, though scalability and implementation challenges remain.",

Although researchers have evaluated these practices primarily as mental health tools, little attention has been paid to the interpersonal signals these practices send.

A sample of 738 American undergraduate students was randomly assigned to view videos of instructors delivering a brief lecture on trauma, preceded by the instructor providing a trigger warning, a safe space notification, both, or neither. Participants then rated the instructor’s epistemic trustworthiness, concern for student well-being, political orientation, and left-wing authoritarianism, as well as their own feelings of psychological safety and willingness to discuss controversial topics in the instructor’s classroom. Analyses using Bayes Factors provided substantial evidence that trigger warnings had no overall impact on students’ perceptions. In contrast, safe space notifications increased students’ feelings of psychological safety and willingness to discuss controversial topics. Safe spaces also increased perceptions of instructors as caring and trustworthy, but also signaled that instructors were liberal and left-wing authoritarian, including the subscale measuring support for top-down censorship. Implications for the use of trigger warnings and safe spaces in educational contexts are discussed.",

How can we characterize the particular quality of redness or a red quale? Based on a recent proposal of the structural characterization of qualia, which did not rely on verbal descriptions, we developed a task that obtained pairwise similarity judgments at four graded levels, with easy and intuitive visual interfaces designed to engage young children. We examined color qualia structures in children (3–12-year-old in Japan and 6–8-year-old in China) and compared these with those of Japanese adults. Approximately half of the assessed 3-year-old children completed the experiment via our touch panel device version of the task and had reliable responses. Despite known developmental and/or cultural effects of color term usage, we found that color qualia structures were quite similar across the age groups and cultures. Our finding supports the view that color qualia structures emerge early. We also observed age-related differences in the evaluations of some color pairs, which implied subtle changes in the structures behind color experience.",

          "abstract": "We propose a predictive coding model of psychosis centred on precision-weighted Bayesian inference. Either over-precise priors or under-precise likelihoods result in posteriors strongly biased towards priors. When existing beliefs no longer account for changes in the world novel beliefs must arise to explain these changes and are themselves held with abnormal confidence.\nChanges in the world feel simultaneously familiar and strange, thinking about the changes makes my thoughts feel similarly paradoxical. If a Bayesian system under extremes of precision saw such a causational paradox, it would be forced to decide was that familiar but strange action done by me but controlled from afar or was that action from the environment and directed against me. Thus, the widespread positive symptoms become bayes optimal resolutions of the paradox as it pertains to thoughts, sensations, movement, and affect. A self-reinforcing process leads to a failure state when beliefs and perceptions become one; if a Bayesian system believes both my actions cause reality and reality causes my actions then it must do nothing, catatonia.\nThe paper demonstrates how a healthy model could itself become high precision as an initially adaptive response to trauma. By doubling down on our beliefs about the world we can prevent trauma from changing the way we view it, but as the world keeps changing, a tsunami of high precision spreads from the initial schism.",

          "authors": "Maureen Murdoch; Barbara Clothier; Siamak Noorbaloochi",
          "abstract": "Background: Health care managers rely heavily on measures derived from administrative data to monitor and manage their enrollees’ health. There are very few administrative measures of psychiatric illness severity, however, and most either comingle demographics and medical comorbidities or do not have ordinal properties.\nObjective: To assess the construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of a novel, 6-item, ordinal, administrative measure of psychiatric severity, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI).\nMethods: Panel study of 960 gender-stratified, nationally representative Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn Veterans who had a pending disability claim for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 6 input items for the MoPSI were number of mental health clinic visits, emergency department visits or psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 6 months; and the presence of any diagnosis for alcohol use, substance use, or self-harm in the past 6 months. We used 4 scoring approaches based on classical test theory, item-response theory, joint probability density (JPD) method, and a linear approximation of the JPD method. With all approaches, higher MoPSI scores indicate severer psychiatric severity.\nResults: The four scoring approaches correlated 0.976 – 0.999. Regardless of scoring approach, in terms of construct validity, Veterans who were unmarried or had low income had higher MoPSI scores than Veterans who were married or had higher incomes, respectively (Ps &lt;.03). In terms of concurrent validity, Veterans with serious mental illness or a PTSD diagnosis also had higher MoPSI scores than their respective counterparts (Ps ≤ .0001). In terms of predictive validity, higher MoPSI scores predicted cigarette use, street drug use, and PTSD and depression/anxiety symptom severity six months later, as well as disability award status approximately 1 year later (Ps ≤ .05).  \nConclusions: The MoPSI appears to be a very well calibrated set of 6 input variables with evidence of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity. Because it has interval and ordinal properties, it is suitable for use as either a predictor variable or an outcome variable in regression analyses, and it avoids collinearity with sociodemographic variables or with medical comorbidities. The MoPSI may be a useful administrative measure of mental health.\nTrial Registration: Not applicable. \n\nKey Words: Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index; Psychometrics; Validity; Administrative Data; Population Health; Mental Health",

Here we present a systematic overview of three sex-related risk pathways. We assessed 16 risk factors as well as 3-month PTSD severity in a prospective cohort (n=2924) of acutely traumatized individuals and investigated potential mediators in the pathway between sex and PTSD severity using multiple mediation analysis with regularization. Six risk factors were more prevalent/severe in women, and none was more pronounced in men. Analyses showed that acute stress disorder, neuroticism, lifetime sexual assault exposure, anxiety sensitivity, and pre-trauma anxiety symptoms fully mediated and uniquely contributed to the relationship between sex and PTSD severity. Our results demonstrate different risk mechanisms for women and men. Such knowledge can inform targeted interventions. Our systematic approach to differential risk pathways can be transferred to other mental disorders to guide sex-sensitive mental health research.",

Cognitive Science is not alone in falling for the idea of a normative person; other social sciences and medical research have sometimes featured this idea. The idea that Cognitive Science research should or could describe normative human cognition is a misleading waste of time for the field. I draw on work from a wide range of fields, including psychology, medicine, disability studies, and biology, to contend that the idea of normative human cognition is mostly useless but not mostly harmless.

          "abstract": "As governments and institutions embrace well-being as a policy outcome, aggregating well-being in a population has become commonplace. The default method used to aggregate population well-being is taking the arithmetic mean (average). However, the default of using average well-being as a key performance indicator, while useful, can omit morally relevant information, like the extent of suffering and inequality. Based on a 0-10 point scale of life satisfaction, we examine three alternative methods of well-being aggregation grounded in the ethical theories of: prioritarianism (a weighted average that weighs lower scores heavier), sufficientarianism (the proportion of respondents answering below a ‘suffering’ threshold), and egalitarianism (the degree of inequality) and compare them to the average. Using the Gallup World Poll’s nationally representative data from over 1 million participants in 144 countries from 2019 to 2022, we found that the distribution of life satisfaction deviated significantly from a normal distribution in all countries, suggesting that using the mean and standard deviation cannot adequately capture the full distribution. After reranking countries according to alternative aggregation methods, we find that 17% of the time countries ranked using the Gini coefficient deviate by at least 20 ranks from the default average rankings. Finally, we observed that 27% of the time, increases in average well-being at the country level are accompanied by a rising gap between the top 90th and bottom 10th life satisfaction percentile. Our findings show the limitation in using the average and offer alternatives that are aligned with promoting equitable well-being growth.",

Specifically, we looked at whether an increased\nsemantic similarity between cue and target improves recall and whether additional context\ncues aid retrieval depending on their features and specificity. Using a cued-recall task, we\nobserved across three experiments that increasing the number of learned word pairs slowed\nretrieval times (RTs) and reduced retrieval accuracy. This effect was modulated by context: set\nsize effects did not extend across multiple, unrelated lists. Semantic similarity between cues\nand targets consistently facilitated retrieval, independent of set size. Experiment 2 revealed no\neffect of additional visual context cues on RTs, while Experiment 3 demonstrated that larger\nsemantic contexts hindered recall, leading to slower RTs and lower accuracy compared to unre-\nlated lists.

Original studies in English or German, providing any information on psychometric properties of the SDM-Q-9 considering all possible interpretations and constructs measured by the instrument. Data Extraction. Details on study design, sample characteristics, and any information on psychometric evidence were extracted. Data Synthesis. 83 studies were included, with 73 articles contributing evidence on validity, 46 on reliability, and 3 on fairness. We found a high amount of psychometric evidence on validity and reliability of the SDM-Q-9, interpreting the score as SDM perceived by the patient. Evidence is lacking for other interpretations and fairness. Notable is the weak association of the SDM-Q-9 with physician-rated SDM. Conclusions. The SDM-Q-9 is highly reliable and valid for the subjectively experienced level of SDM by the patient. Further research is needed on alternative interpretations, and on fairness of the measure.",

          "authors": "Lachlan Kent; Suzanne Dick; Maja Havrilova; Stephen Carbone",
          "abstract": "Background: The mental health of young people in Australia and other nations has declined dramatically over the last decade and a half. While an increase in youth mental healthcare services is needed to meet rising demand, on its own, this is unlikely to reverse the concerning trend. A greater focus on prevention is needed.\nAims:  This article aims to propose an innovative, theoretically-grounded approach to prevention that complements more common population-based (i.e., changing risk and protective factors) and targeted (i.e., supporting individuals with subthreshold symptoms of mental illness) approaches. Aligned with the dual-continua model of mental health (i.e., where mental well-being and ill-health are distinct dimensions of overall mental health), this third approach focuses on addressing low levels of mental wellbeing, which is both a significant predictor of future mental ill-health and a distressing and disabling state that requires intervention in its own right. \nRecommendations: Large-scale screening for low mental wellbeing, using psychometrically sound tools, could be conducted online and through schools, higher education, and primary care services. Those with low mental wellbeing could be linked to community services offering evidence-based interventions. This approach is likely to carry less stigma and may be easier to achieve than targeting those with subthreshold symptoms through clinical services.\nConclusions: The dire state of youth mental health is an urgent call-to-action to adopt novel approaches to address this crisis. We need to make better use of the available evidence and tools at-hand to strengthen our focus on low mental wellbeing, not just mental ill-health.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that current mental fatigue and self-control capacity play a crucial role in the goal-directed regulation of emotion, motivation, and cognition. However, whether the emergence of fatigue during the exercise of cognitive performance is indicative of individuals’ time-stable fatigue vulnerability traits is still not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we repeatedly measured the self-reported perceived control capacity of N = 2,094 trainees over the course of working on three separate, 140-minute-long standardized achievement tests in mathematics and science. These tests were administered at the beginning of trainees’ vocational education and training, prior to their intermediate exams, and before their final exams. In all three testing sessions, participants’ control capacity declined over time, which indicated increasing mental fatigue. The intercepts and slopes of three latent growth-curves loaded on two higher-order fatigue vulnerability trait factors representing the interindividual variabilities in individuals’ stable aspects of pre-task control capacity (control preparedness) and its change over time (fatigue resistance). Further, we examined the relationships of both fatigue trait factors and self-reported personality traits, as well as objectively assessed fluid intelligence and general achievement test performances. The strongest predictors of control preparedness were conscientiousness, neuroticism, and fluid intelligence, whereas fatigue resistance was predicted exclusively by neuroticism and conscientiousness. Individuals with higher levels of control preparedness tended to outperform others in achievement testing. Post-hoc power analyses provide evidence for the high statistical power of the results. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for personality research on mental fatigue effects in performance situations.",

          "abstract": "Finding an optimal decision-making strategy requires a careful balance between the competing demands of accuracy and urgency.In experimental settings, researchers are typically interested in whether people can optimise this trade-off, typically operationalised as reward rate, with evidence accumulation models serving as the key framework to determine whether people are performing optimally. However, recent studies have suggested that inferences about optimality can be highly dependent on the task design, meaning that inferences about whether people can achieve optimality may not generalise across contexts.Here, we investigate one fundamental, though typically overlooked, design factor: whether participants spend a fixed amount of time on each block (fixed-time) or have a fixed number of trials in each block (fixed-trials), with researchers typically assuming that people are better able to optimize reward rate under fixed-time conditions. Across three experiments, our results consistently indicate that people are at least as good at optimising reward rate under fixed-trial conditions as fixed-time conditions, and potentially even better under fixed-trial conditions. Importantly, these findings both challenge the common assumption within reward rate optimality research regarding the superiority of fixed-time study designs, and further emphasise the importance of carefully considering study design factors when making inferences about optimality in decision-making.",

CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder-setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (N=600) we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder-usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as OCD.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in analyzing the effects of educational programs on outcomes using process data from computer-based testing and learning environments. However, most analyses focus on final outcomes measured at the end of a test or session, overlooking their functional nature over time. Such analyses fail to capture the dynamic causal mechanisms associated with functional outcomes. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel causal mediation framework for identifying and estimating functional natural direct effects, functional natural indirect effects, and functional total effects, along with their subgroup effects. Building on the literature on causal mediation and moderation, we define these effects using potential outcomes and provide nonparametric identification strategies. We then develop estimation methods using generalized additive models, a flexible and robust tool for analyzing functional data. Through a simulation study, we assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed approach by comparing it to parametric regression methods. We also demonstrate our approach by examining the effects of extended time accommodations on two functional outcomes—test scores and item access—using process data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Our mediation approach with functional outcomes effectively captures the dynamic causal mechanisms underlying the program's effects and pinpoints when and for whom each effect manifests throughout the testing period.",

Multivariate Behavioral Research. https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2019.1647822.  Accelerated longitudinal designs (ALDs) are designs in which participants from different cohorts provide repeated measures covering a fraction of the time range of the study. ALDs allow researchers to study developmental processes spanning long periods within a relatively shorter time framework. The common trajectory is studied by aggregating the information provided by the different cohorts. Latent change score models (LCS) provide a powerful analytical framework to analyze data from ALDs. With developmental data, LCS models can be specified using measurement occasion as the time metric. This provides a number of benefits, but has an important limitation: It makes it not possible to characterize the longitudinal changes as a function of a developmental process such as age or biological maturation. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extension of an occasion-based LCS model that includes age differences at the first measurement occasion. We conducted a Monte Carlo study and compared the results of including different transformations of the age variable. Our results indicate that some of the proposed transformations resulted in accurate expectations for the studied process across all the ages in the study, and excellent model fit. We discuss these results and provide the R code for our analysis.",

In the current study, why some activities are more likely to be carried out by one sex over the other was examined. Japanese participants who participated in the online survey evaluated each of the 50 activities in terms of four criteria: risk of injury or death, physical effort, how much they would like to do the activity, and which sex should do the activity. When they rated the activities, they were not given information on whether each activity was mainly carried out by men or women in the 185 societies. Activities that were mainly carried out by men in the 185 societies tended to be rated as having a higher risk and being more physically demanding. There was also a tendency for both men and women to think that such activities should be carried out by men. Although both men and women wanted to engage in activities that were mainly carried out by women in the 185 societies, there was a sex difference in that women wanted to engage in such activities more than men.",

          "abstract": "Reading and math are related due to many codeveloping skills. Historically, theorizing in these two areas has progressed separately, despite well-documented empirical evidence for a range of shared underlying developmental processes subserving these learning domains. The purpose of this paper is to describe the links between the Triple Code Model, an influential model of numerical cognition, and the Triangle Framework, a dominant model of learning to read. We describe several parallels between the theoretical models and discuss how the cognitive mechanisms posited by the Triangle Framework might be used to understand the commonalities in learning processes across these learning domains In particular, we discuss how the cognitive mechanisms implemented in the Triangle Framework can be used to understand linguistic aspects of numerical cognition, specifically, learning the connections among numerals (e.g., 24) and words (e.g., twenty-four), and linking those to semantic representations of magnitude. Following from these commonalities between the two models, we discuss several ways that interdisciplinary work integrating both models can benefit math cognition research.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive Warfare takes advantage of novel developments in technology and science to influence how target populations think and act. Establishing adequate defense against Cognitive Warfare requires examination of modus operandi to understand this emerging action space. This includes the goals and methods that can be realized through science and technology. Recent literature suggests that both human and nonhuman cognition should be considered as targets of Cognitive Warfare. There are currently no frameworks allowing for a unified way of conceptualizing short-term and long-term Cognitive Warfare goals and attack methods that are domain- and species-agnostic. There is a need for a framework developed through a bottom-up approach that is informed by neuroscientific principles to capture relevant aspects of cognition. The framework should be at a level of complexity that is actionable to decision-makers in war. In this paper, we attempt to cover the existing gap by proposing the Unplug, Corrupt, disOrganize, Diagnose, Enhance (UnCODE) system for classifying the goals and methods of Cognitive Warfare. The system is neurocentric by conceptualizing Cognitive Warfare goals from the perspective of how adversarial methods relate to neural information processing in an individual or society. The UnCODE system identifies five main classes of goals: 1) Eliminating a target’s ability to produce outputs, 2) degrading a target’s capacity to process inputs and produce outputs, 3) biasing a target’s input-output activity, 4) monitoring and understanding the input-output relationships in targets, and 5) enhancing a target’s capacity and ability to process inputs and produce outputs. Methods can be divided in two categories based on access to the target’s neural system: direct access and indirect access. The UnCODE system is domain- and species-agnostic and allows for interdisciplinary commensurability when communicating attack paths across domains. In sum, the UnCODE system is a unifying framework that captures that multiple methods can be used to reach the same Cognitive Warfare goals.",

          "abstract": "By building a mental model of how the world works and using it to forecast the outcomes of different actions, a learner can make flexible choices in changing environments. However, while children and adolescents readily acquire structured knowledge about their environments, relative to adults, they tend to demonstrate weaker signatures of leveraging this knowledge to plan actions. One explanation for these developmental differences is that using a mental model to prospectively simulate potential choices and their outcomes is computationally costly, taxing cognitive control and working memory mechanisms that continue to develop into adulthood. Here, we ask whether children might effectively leverage structured knowledge to make flexible choices by relying on two alternative strategies that do not require costly mental simulation at choice time. First, through offline replanning, models can be queried before the time of choice to generate possible scenarios and update the values of potential actions. Second, an abstracted predictive model, known as a Successor Representation, can be built and harnessed to enable simplified computation of long-run reward values of candidate actions, without requiring iterative simulation of multiple time steps. To assess whether children, adolescents, and adults aged 7 - 23 years similarly harness these learning strategies, we ran three experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, we used a reward revaluation task in which we manipulated the opportunity for offline replanning during rest, and found that children flexibly updated their behavior by leveraging structured knowledge in an adult-like manner. Surprisingly, across age, rest did not mediate flexible replanning, raising the possibility that participants may have behaved adaptively by harnessing predictive representations online. In Experiment 3, we directly tested whether children use predictive representations. Here, we observed early-emerging use of the SR, providing a mechanistic account of how children use structured knowledge to guide choice without detailed model-based simulation.",

          "abstract": "Research on individual differences in executive functions has often used a manual version of the anti-saccade task to measure cognitive inhibition. Here, we investigated the validity of anti-saccade performance as a measure of inhibition. Success in this task relies on several processes: Inhibition of a saccade to the cue location; translating the cue location into the target location; making a saccade to the target location; and rapid identification of the target stimulus. In two experiments (NE1 = 181 and NE2 = 165) we varied whether the task required these processes. We also varied the preparation time before each trial, and the cue-target interval to measure the speed of task-relevant processes. We used a theoretically motivated statistical model to dissociate parameters that reflect the contribution of each process to performance. Individual differences in most of these parameters correlated with observed performance, implying that performance reflects a mixture of several processes. Critically, inhibition accounted for a small proportion of variance in performance. Only the efficiency of translating cue information into the target location was credibly correlated with working-memory capacity and processing speed. These results question the validity of anti-saccade performance as a measure of inhibition.",

However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

Introduction: UDL is an education framework that aims to create inclusive learning environments for students with diverse needs. Approximately 25% of Australian students are likely to live with language, literacy, and/or learning differences that place them at elevated risk of mental health problems. Many school-based mental health programs exist with the shared aim of promoting positive outcomes for students.  Early prevention and mental health promotion efforts that are inclusive to students with language and/or learning differences are critically important. However, there has been no previous exploration of the extent to which UDL has been applied to school-based mental health programs. This review aims to identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in existing Australian school-based mental health programs. Eligibility criteria: This review will consider studies that report the development and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs within an Australian education context. This review will exclude non-English studies, reviews, books, and theoretical or opinion pieces. Methods: This review will be informed by the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews and will be conducted between October and December 2024. Five databases will be searched (PsycInfo, Medline, Informit, Scopus, and ERIC) and two reviewers will independently screen all identified studies against inclusion criteria by title, abstract, and full text review. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus. Results: Two independent reviewers will extract relevant data from the selected studies and results will be presented numerically and narratively.  The review will identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in descriptions of the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Synthesis and interpretation of included studies will be framed within the three principles of UDL. The review will outline key findings of the included papers, gaps in the literature, and salient directions for future research. Conclusion: The outcomes of this review will be disseminated via publication and plain language summaries. The outcomes may also inform conference presentations relevant to inclusive education, mental health, and child language and learning differences.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to appropriately generalize past experiences to new scenarios. Organizing concepts into categories allows the brain to generalize learned stimulus-reward contingencies to new stimuli within  the same category. However, when category membership does not fully predict associated rewards, the brain needs to balance generalizing values within categories and discriminating value differences among individual items. How do generalization and discrimination in reward learning develop throughout lifespan as semantic knowledge is gradually acquired? Using a probabilistic reward learning task with a hierarchical value structure organized by semantic categories, we found children can generalize values of stimuli based on semantic categories at least as early as three to four years old. Furthermore, age-related performance improvement is explained by a combination of increased decision certainty, decreased initial exploration, change in memory retention, and a reduced categorical learning rate.",

Beginning with presocratic thought, such as Protagoras’ relativism and Gorgias’ rhetoric, it contextualizes the epistemological implications of artificial intelligence as inherently subjective, attributing grave importance to this subjectivity. The paper draws parallels between Plato’s cave dwellers and AI systems, arguing that both rely on lossy representations of the world, raising questions about their true understanding and reality. Cartesian and Hegelian frameworks are explored to distinguish between weak and strong artificial intelligence, emphasizing embodied cognition and the moral obligations tied to emergent artificial consciousness. The discussion extends to quantum computing, panpsychism, and the potential of artificial minds to reshape our perception of time and existence. By critically analyzing these perspectives, the paper advocates for a nuanced understanding of artificial consciousness and its ethical, epistemological, and societal implications. It invites readers to reconsider humanity’s evolving relationship with intelligence and sentience.",

The HiTOP consortium recently developed a new self-report measure, the HiTOP-Patient Reported Outcome (HiTOP-PRO), designed to operationalize the HiTOP model for use in research and clinical practice. In a set of preregistered analyses with a sample of 552 mixed clinical/community participants (76% female, 82% white), we explored the hierarchical structure of the HiTOP-PRO scales using exploratory factor analysis and examined their associations with behaviors and experiences assessed in daily life, such as affect, stress, impulsivity, energy, sleep quality, and social interactions. Findings indicate a nine-factor model, closely aligned with the HiTOP’s current structure, best represented the measure. The hierarchical structure of the HiTOP-PRO generally converges with the HiTOP model, with several key departures, particularly for historically understudied constructs. Furthermore, the HiTOP-PRO facet scales and domains associated with individual differences in daily behavior and experiences as anticipated, highlighting the construct validity and the potential clinical utility of this new measure. Our results have implications not only for the structure, validity, and clinical utility of the HiTOP-PRO but also raise broader questions about the underlying nature of psychopathology as represented by the HiTOP.",

          "abstract": "Background: Rejection sensitivity (hypersensitivity and reactivity to threats of rejection due to previous rejection experiences) could provide insight into the role of childhood emotional abuse and associated interpersonal risk factors in the development of suicide ideation (SI).\nObjective: The current study examined SI among at-risk young adults using an integrated model of rejection sensitivity and suicide risk, as conceptualized by the interpersonal theory of suicide. We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse would be indirectly prospectively associated with increases in SI intensity at 4-month follow-up (a cognitive-affective reaction to rejection) through greater rejection sensitivity and greater perceptions of rejection (thwarted belonging [TB] and perceived burden [PB]), in serial. \nParticipants and Setting: Participants were 148 young adult men and women (ages 18-35) with SI and/or suicidal behaviors within the past 4 months. Participants were recruited as part of a larger one-year longitudinal study of suicide risk in a transdiagnostic sample of young adults.\nMethods: PROCESS serial mediation procedures were used to test the hypothesis that emotional abuse would be indirectly associated with increased SI intensity at 4-month follow-up through rejection sensitivity and TB or PB, in serial.\nResults: Results indicated that childhood emotional abuse was prospectively associated with elevated SI intensity in adulthood through the indirect effects of rejection sensitivity and PB (std. est. = .04; 95% CI = -0.03, 0.11) but not TB. \nConclusion: Greater emotional abuse in childhood was associated with a greater sensitivity to rejection, which may perpetuate a cycle that increases risk for SI throughout adolescence and adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a psychological intervention focused on stress management in women who are candidates for in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Method: Pre–post study with two groups (n = 26). The psychological intervention group (IG) received a 90-minute session that included psychoeducation, relaxation training and coping skills. The control group (CG) did not receive any psychological intervention. All participants later underwent IVF. In the initial and final evaluations, state anxiety, emotional imbalance, adaptive resources and quality of life were measured. In the initial evaluation, demographic and clinical variables were also measured. Results: In the IG, the final evaluation reflected: (1) decreased levels of anxiety and emotional imbalance; (2) the perception of enhanced quality of life. Moreover, among the participants who received the psychological intervention and later achieved a successful IVF, the level of anxiety appeared to have decreased more strongly. Conclusions: A brief intervention focused on stress management can benefit the psychological adjustment of women who are candidates for IVF, reducing the anxiety they may experience in this regard. However, our conclusions are based on a small sample, and so should be considered with caution. Nevertheless, these results are promising and highlight the advisability of further research",

          "abstract": "Background: In acute coronary syndrome the time elapsed between the start of symptoms and the moment the patient receives treatment is an important determinant of survival and subsequent recovery. However, many patients do not receive treatment as quickly as recommended, mostly due to substantial prehospital delays such as waiting to seek medical attention after symptoms have started. Objective: To conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis of the relationship between nine frequently investigated psychological and cognitive factors and prehospital delay. Design: A protocol was preregistered in PROSPERO [CRD42018094198] and a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Data sources: The following databases were searched for quantitative articles published between 1997 and 2019: Medline (PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, Psych Info, PAIS, and Open grey. Review methods: Study risk of bias was assessed with the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational, Cohort, and Cross-Sectional Studies. A best evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the findings of the included studies. Results: Forty-eight articles, reporting on 57 studies from 23 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies used very diverse definitions of prehospital delay and analytical practices, which precluded meta-analysis. The best evidence synthesis indicated that there was evidence that patients who attributed their symptoms to a cardiac event (n = 37), perceived symptoms as serious (n = 24), or felt anxiety in response to symptoms (n = 15) reported shorter prehospital delay, with effect sizes indicating important clinical differences (e.g., 1.5–2 h shorter prehospital delay). In contrast, there was limited evidence for a relationship between prehospital delay and knowledge of symptoms (n = 18), concern for troubling others (n = 18), fear (n = 17), or embarrassment in asking for help (n = 14). Conclusions: The current review shows that symptom attribution to cardiac events and some degree of perceived threat are fundamental to speed up help-seeking. In contrast, social concerns and barriers in seeking medical attention (embarrassment or concern for troubling others) may not be as important as initially thought. The current review also shows that the use of very diverse methodological practices strongly limits the integration of evidence into meaningful recommendations. We conclude that there is urgent need for common guidelines for prehospital delay study design and reporting",

          "authors": "Colin Conwell; Daniel Graham; Chelsea Evanna Boccagno; Edward A. Vessel",
          "abstract": "Looking at the world often involves not just seeing things, but feeling things. Modern feedforward machine vision systems that learn to perceive the world in the absence of active physiology, deliberative thought, or any form of feedback that resembles human affective experience offer tools to demystify relationship between seeing and feeling, and to assess how much of visually-evoked affective experiences may be a straightforward function of representation learning over natural image statistics. In this work, we deploy a diverse sample of 180 state-of-the-art deep neural network models trained only on canonical computer vision tasks to predict human ratings of arousal, valence, and beauty for images from multiple categories (objects, faces, scenescapes, art) across two datasets. Importantly, we use the features of these models without additional learning, linearly decoding human affective responses from network activity in much the same way neuroscientists decode information from neural recordings. Aggregate analysis across our survey demonstrates that predictions from purely perceptual models explain a majority of the explainable variance in average ratings of arousal, valence, and beauty alike.  Finer-grained analysis within our survey (e.g. comparisons between shallower and deeper layers, or between randomly-initialized, category-supervised, and self-supervised models) point to rich, pre-conceptual abstraction (learned from diversity of visual experience) as a key driver of these predictions. Taken together, these results provide further computational evidence for an information-processing account of visually-evoked affect linked directly to efficient representation learning over natural image statistics, and hint at a computational locus of affective and aesthetic valuation immediately proximate to perception.",

Methodologically, we highlight that the differences in the RV become very small when comparing studies with different large (e.g., over 500) samples. To adjust for this, we demonstrate that a modification to the RV-equation – by log transforming the sample size – leads to a RV that discriminates between studies with large sample sizes with greater precision.",

However, there has been a growing focus on positive mental health factors in recent times. This study investigated the relationship between distressing life events and positive mental health (PMH), satisfaction with life (SWL), subjective happiness (SH), and depression, anxiety, and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales–21; DASS-21). Design and Methods: The sample included N = 426 students who participated in an online study testing protective and risk factors in the context of mental health and reports secondary analyses of these data. Results: Correlational analyses showed that experiencing a distressing life event was linked to lower levels of PMH and SWL, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Post-hoc group comparisons supported this pattern. Among those who experienced a distressing life event, higher current distress due to the event correlated with lower levels of PMH, SWL, and SH, and higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Conclusions: This study showed robust correlations between the experience of a distressing life event and levels of both positive and negative mental health. Promoting mental health may thus be an important preventative target in at-risk groups.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Predictors of life satisfaction vary between people and potentially also within people across the life span. However, little is known about when changes in the association between domain satisfaction and overall life satisfaction occur. In the present study, we focused on the last years of work before retirement when it is often assumed that workers become less attached to their workplace and focus on other areas of life instead, such as leisure activity. Our aim was to test if the associations between domain satisfaction (job and leisure) and overall life satisfaction change in the years before retirement. \nMethods. We applied a time-to-retirement metric in a latent growth curve analysis to longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 3,401) to investigate whether the within-person associations between (1) job and overall life satisfaction and (2) leisure and overall life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. \nResults. We found that job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. \nDiscussion. We interpret the results as evidence for a potential pre-retirement work disengagement, either to support post-retirement adjustment, or to protect from negative work experiences. We highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation) or cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism) and sometimes period effects (e.g., the effects of the pandemic years 2020 to 2022 on well-being). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design—it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts—and regardless of the number of observations available—it also applies if we observe the whole population. Researchers rely on statistical models that impose assumptions to pick one specific combination of effects. But these assumptions are often opaque and researchers may be unaware of them, resulting in a lack of scrutiny. Here, I provide a non-technical introduction to a framework which allows researchers to reason about age, period, and cohort effects in a more systematic manner. I summarize advances in our understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem—it only affects the underlying linear effects but not the nonlinearities, making some statements about effects possible based on the data alone—and show how transparent assumptions can be used to put bounds on the effects of interest, following a framework developed by the sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. Lastly, using data from the German General Social Survey, I illustrate this approach by analyzing age, period and cohort effect on people’s agreement with the statement “Given what the future looks like, it is barely responsible to bring children into the world.”",

          "abstract": "Background \nIndividuals with cancer often experience stress throughout the cancer trajectory and have a high risk of experiencing depression.\n\nObjective \nThe aim of this study was to examine the relationship between allostatic load (AL), a measure of cumulative stress-related physiologic dysregulation of different body systems, and symptoms of depression in cancer survivors.\n\nMethods \nParticipants were 294 adult cancer survivors from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2007-2018). Allostatic load was measured using 14 indicators representing cardiometabolic risk, glucose metabolism, cardiopulmonary functioning, parasympathetic functioning, and inflammation. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The relationship between AL and depressive symptoms was investigated using multiple regression adjusted for diverse sociodemographic and diagnosis variables.\n\nResults \nHigher AL was associated with higher depressive symptom scores. The higher risk of depression was concentrated among those survivors in the highest AL quartile, with 21% (95% confidence interval, 11%-32%) of survivors presenting a high risk of depression compared with 8% to 11% of survivors in the lower quartiles. In exploratory analyses, the relationship between AL and depressive symptoms was only significant among survivors with a lower income. In contrast, in survivors in the highest income group, depressive symptoms were lower and unrelated to AL.\n\nConclusion \nHigh AL is associated with more depressive symptoms among cancer survivors.\n\nImplications for Practice \nNurses have an important role in identifying psychological distress in cancer patients and survivors. Further research is needed to investigate the usefulness of AL as a marker in the context of cancer follow-up care and screening for psychological distress.",

We propose that a complex systems perspective to functional ageing can illuminate how outcomes such as quality of life and longevity, and prevention and treatment success emerge from dynamic interactions among these domains, rather than from single causes. We support this view in three ways. First, we explain how key principles of complex systems science – resilience, non-linearity and heterogeneity – apply to functional ageing. Second, we show how established gerontological theories and geriatric models align with these principles. Third, we illustrate the use of novel methodological tools from complex systems science in studying functional ageing.

          "abstract": "Cycling challenges athletes to their physiological and psychological limits, often culminating in task failure: an abrupt reduction in intensity or cessation of effort. While physiological mechanisms such as metabolic acidosis and oxygen supply have been widely studied, less is known about the subjective experience associated with task failure. In this study, a survey of 2,818 licensed cyclists provided novel insights into the subjective dimensions of task failure. Participants reported that physical sensations, especially breathing and muscle pain, were the most prominent cues at the limit of effort. Notably, 60.5% indicated they do not always reach their maximum perceived effort before task failure, suggesting a significant psychological component. Age, experience, and the use of feedback tools like powermeters influenced whether task failure was perceived as voluntary or involuntary. Cyclists in higher age categories more frequently perceived reaching their limits as voluntary, while younger or less experienced athletes reported involuntary task failure. Furthermore, strategies such as self-motivation, focusing on goals, and regulating breathing were commonly employed to sustain performance. Altered time perception during maximum effort was also a notable finding, with most cyclists perceiving time as passing more slowly. These results underline the multifactorial nature of task failure, involving complex interactions between physiological, psychological, and perceptual factors. Understanding these dynamics could inform targeted training approaches, enabling athletes to better manage effort and delay task failure, thereby optimizing performance.",

Environmental factors that are not shared by twins (non-shared environment) influenced the associations to different degrees, while the influence of environmental factors that are shared by twins was estimated to be negligible.\nRather than being specifically linked to autism, synaesthesia seems to be associated with a wider range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric features, and especially obsessive-compulsive features.

          "abstract": "Stress evokes a complex repertoire of psychological and physiological responses associated with the appraisal of challenge or threat. This paper introduces the Leiden Stroop-like Stress Task (LSST), a paradigm designed to induce progressively increasing levels of stress and related changes in challenge-threat dynamics by manipulating time pressure (task difficulty), ability to achieve the task goal (uncontrollability), and negative feedback (social-evaluative threat) throughout four 10-minute blocks. Fifty-four healthy adults (63% female; mean age = 21 ± 3 years) completed the LSST, with repeated assessments of subjective stress and challenge-threat appraisal, and continuous cardiovascular recordings. Results confirmed the LSST’s effectiveness in eliciting progressive increases in subjective stress and sympathetic activation, reflected in heart rate, blood pressure, and pre-ejection period changes. On average, challenge-threat appraisals remained on the challenge side of the bipolar continuum, while physiological indicators suggested increases in relative threat as indicated by increased total peripheral resistance. Exploratory within-subject correlations revealed alignment between subjective stress and sympathetic activation, whereas challenge-threat appraisal demonstrated quadratic relationships with psychological and physiological measures. Latent class analysis of challenge-threat appraisal scores revealed three subgroups: non-responders, progressive challengers, and biphasic responders. These subgroups also showed distinct psychological but not physiological trajectories. Our findings demonstrate that the LSST enables the graded induction of stress and effectively captures challenge-threat dynamics across psychological and physiological levels. We discuss the potential of this paradigm to provide insights into individual differences and interventions aimed at increasing stress resilience.",

There has been a long-standing debate as to whether this adaptation relies on a domain-general or domain-specific process. Recent models predict a U-shaped relation where only highly similar or highly dissimilar tasks show adaptation across tasks, because only those tasks can be represented or activated in parallel. While there has been an abundance of evidence for adaptation within and across highly similar tasks, only some recent studies have reported adaptation across highly dissimilar tasks, with some failures to replicate. In order to further investigate this, we interleaved two very different conflict tasks, a manual multi-source interference task and a vocal picture-word interference task. We ran this experiment in Dutch (Experiment 1) and Mandarin (Experiment 2). Across the two experiments, results show no cross-task conflict adaptation. These results do not fit with suggestion of domain-general adaptive processes nor with the hypothesis of a U-shaped model.

          "abstract": "Vision is often understood as a hierarchical, feedforward process, where visual processing proceeds from low-level features to high-level representations, ultimately resulting in a coherent percept. Within just a few tens of milliseconds, the fundamental features of the percept are established. These traditional models are the primary framework for understanding visual crowding, a perceptual phenomenon where the perception of a target is impaired by the presence of flanking elements. In this framework, the early stages of feedforward visual processing are essential for perceiving stimuli under crowding conditions and temporal aspects are not important. In fact, experiments show that stimulus duration affects perception very little with classic crowding displays. Here, we show that for more complex displays, crowding is the outcome of highly dynamic processes. For instance, a 20 ms preview of just the flankers can reduce crowding for displays with the target and the same flankers presented up to 1 second later. This effect occurs only if the flankers have the potential to group during longer stimulus durations. Our findings align with predictions made by the LAMINART model, which employs recurrent segmentation processes unfolding over time to separate objects into distinct representation layers. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of time-consuming grouping processes in spatial and temporal interactions in vision. In contrast to the classic feedforward models of vision, we propose that crowding, and vision in general, is a dynamic process in which multiple potential interpretations of a stimulus are modulated and gated by grouping mechanisms that evolve over time.",

Data-driven approaches leveraging structural neuroimaging and machine learning have emerged as transformative tools for unraveling this enigma. Recent studies employing clustering techniques have identified robust neuroanatomical subtypes independent of traditional symptom-based frameworks. These data-driven methods reveal distinct cortical and subcortical patterns, aligning with disease progression variations, cognitive function, and treatment outcomes. Novel trajectory-based models suggest that schizophrenia may originate from distinct neuroanatomical regions and follow divergent paths of progression, emphasizing the importance of understanding these patterns in the context of disease staging. These findings provide a foundation for improving diagnostic precision, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring interventions. However, further validation with longitudinal data and methodological standardization are necessary to translate these insights into clinical practice and develop personalized treatment approaches.",

Therefore, considering such group- and individual-level variations as random intercepts (RI), the RI-LDCM was developed. A Bayesian estimation method for the RI-LDCM was also developed. A simulation study revealed that ignoring multilevel structures causes biased parameter estimates and serious under-coverages of posterior credible intervals. A real data example provided attribute mastery transitions from the four-year longitudinal data of mathematics tests in the third to sixth grades of Japanese elementary schools. The proposed RI-LDCM was also discussed.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine which of four tasks testing different discourse genres (descriptive, procedural, conversational, and narrative) is the most sensitive in detecting syntactic and morphological complexity deficits in Spanish aphasia. Additionally, we compare two approaches for measuring syntax in discourse to identify the most accurate set of metrics for discriminating group membership.\n\nMethod: In this comparative cross-sectional study, we analyzed the discourse of an aphasia group (N = 20) and a non-brain-damaged group (N = 14). Data was preprocessed using manual and automated procedures. We measured syntactic complexity through proxies (mean length of utterance, noun-verb ratio, and verbs per utterance), in addition to a competing ‘syntactic structures’ metric. The latter includes variables of subordination, left branching, relative clauses, and word integration, while morphological complexity was measured through an inflectional index.\n\nResults: The descriptive and narrative tasks highlighted the most significant differences across syntactic complexity metrics between the groups. Additionally, nested binomial logistic regression models showed that the ‘syntactic structures’ metric predicted groups better than the proxies alone.\n\nConclusions: A comprehensive assessment of syntactic complexity can be obtained through the administration of both descriptive and narrative tasks. The measurement of ‘syntactic structures’ in discourse proved a fitter and more fine-grained approach for group discrimination than the incorporation of syntactic proxies alone. These findings provide guidance for a precise discourse assessment in Spanish aphasia.",

          "abstract": "In three studies (N = 8,775) including two pre-registered experiments and a pre-registered cross-national replication across five countries, we tested whether intergenerational appeals that emphasize our responsibility to protect future generations can expand our moral circle to include distant future people within the boundaries of moral regard. Importantly, asking participants to roleplay as a leader of a committee protecting future generations (Studies 1-2), and having them partake in a philosophical thought exercise emphasizing reduction of intergenerational harm (Studies 1-3) increased moral concern felt towards future generations. This was noted when moral expansiveness was construed as limitless (Study 1), and zero-sum (Studies 2-3). When moral concern was construed as zero-sum, moral concern attributed to ingroup members was re-allocated to future generations. Spillover effects for present entities were also noted. The present evidence illustrates that intergenerational appeals have the potential to expand our moral circle, increasing moral regard felt towards future people, and potentially even shaping our moral concern expressed towards present entities.",

          "abstract": "We investigated what factors may foster or hinder physicians’ cancer screening risk literacy–specifically the ability to understand evidence regarding screening effectiveness and make evidence-based recommendations to patients. In an experiment, physicians in training (interns and residents) read statistical information about outcomes from screening for cancer, and had to decide whether to recommend it to a patient. We manipulated the effectiveness of the screening (effective vs. ineffective at reducing mortality) and the demand of the patient to get screened (demand vs. no demand). We assessed participants’ comprehension of the presented evidence and recommendation to the patient, as well as a-priori screening beliefs (e.g., that screening is always a good choice), numeracy, science literacy, knowledge of screening statistics, statistical education, and demographics. Stronger positive a-priori screening beliefs, lower knowledge of screening statistics, and lower numeracy were related to worse comprehension of the evidence. Physicians recommended against the ineffective screening but only if they showed good comprehension of the evidence. Physicians’ recommendations were further based on the perceived benefits from screening but not on perceived harms, nor the patient’s demands. The current study demonstrates that comprehension of cancer screening statistics and the ability to infer the potential benefits for patients are essential for evidence-based recommendations. However, strong beliefs in favor of screening fostered by promotion campaigns may influence how physicians evaluate evidence about specific screenings. Fostering physician numeracy skills could help counteract such biases and provide evidence-based recommendations to patients.",

          "abstract": "Discounting analysis has offered countless insights into behavioral health outcomes and continues to draw transdisciplinary attention as a reliable descriptor of decision-making. This paper highlights an analytical issue that may be underappreciated, namely, that the delay discounting parameter (i.e., k) carries units which are not reported in the vast majority of studies, leading potentially to errors in cross-study or test-retest comparisons. Delay discounting analyses conventionally use nonlinear modeling to arrive at a discounting rate that describes subject-level tolerance of temporal reward constraints. This brief report explores the relation between delay discounting k, delay value (i.e., D), and psychophysical scalar (i.e., s) logically and via data manipulation. We reanalyze three extant delay discounting datasets across a variety of discounting assessment methods using systematically different regression delay values. Results support the notion that k retains the reciprocal of time as a unit, where k is modified as D-1 or D-s, pending model mathematical configuration. Researchers should report units on discounting parameters and take care of this potential confound when selecting an appropriate descriptive model and comparing discounting rates across contexts.",

          "abstract": "Background: This study aims to examine the utility of adding loneliness as a symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD).\nMethods: We used data from the 2018-2019 wave of the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study, involving 1,905 participants aged 14-23. We evaluated the centrality of loneliness within the depressive symptom network. Finally, we used adjusted multiple regression (sociodemographic factors and social isolation) to examine the association of 1) loneliness alongside classical symptoms of MDD and 2) clinical groups (including or excluding loneliness), with a composite of life-threatening events (suicide attempt, self-harm, psychiatric admission, or emergency room visits), poor life-chance events (criminal convictions, substance use, and school dropout), and well-being.\nResults: Loneliness was part of the depressive construct and the most central symptom in the network structure of depressive symptoms. It was independently associated with life-threatening events (OR: 1.754; 95% CI: 1.187, 2.590), life chance impoverishment events (OR: 1.446; 95% CI: 1.065, 1.963), and well-being (B: -2.681; 95% CI: -3.792, -1.569). Lastly, the group with MDD that included loneliness as a symptom had a higher risk for life-threatening events (OR: 3.168; 95% CI: 2.039, 4.976) and had lower scores on well-being (B: -3.474; 95% CI: -5.085, -1.862), compared to those with MDD without loneliness. \nConclusion: Loneliness is a constitutive symptom of depression that serves as an indicator of severity in MDD. The operationalization of loneliness as a clinical criterion of MDD is expected to improve clinical care of young people with depression.",

          "abstract": "Foreknowledge of target features biases attention toward those features even before search begins, indicating proactive activation of the target template. However, whether foreknowledge of distractor features leads to proactive inhibition remains debated, raising questions about whether target and distractor templates operate through similar mechanisms. The current study investigated this by presenting multiple task-irrelevant singleton probes before search display onset, combined with EEG. The probes either matched the color of the target, the distractor or had a neutral color. If a feature-specific template is activated proactively, we expect to see a reliable probe N2pc-modulation: With target template enhancement, probes matching the target color should elicit a more pronounced N2pc than neutral probes, whereas a distractor template inhibition should lead to an opposite pattern. In line with this prediction, results showed that the target-colored probes produced a more pronounced N2pc, with the largest amplitude for the last probe in the sequence, suggesting an increasing template activation from probe 1 to 4. Distractor-colored probes elicited a less pronounced N2pc than neutral probes at the first probe, suggesting an inhibited template activation at the start of the preparation. Both ERP and decoding results time-locked to search display onset showed that foreknowledge of the target color facilitated target selection, reaching its peak after 200 ms. Foreknowledge of the distractor color allowed active distractor inhibition within the first 200 ms and then vanished quickly. Taken together, separate temporal profiles during preparation and search support distinct mechanisms for target selection and distractor rejection in visual search.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a technique for studying neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs) such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental coordination disorder. Until now, the predominant focus of VR applications in this field has been on developing new assessment and diagnostic tools, aiming to identify NDC symptoms in engaging and ecologically valid digital environments. However, despite these advancements, VR has yet to outperform traditional diagnostic methods and remains underutilized as an assessment tool. This paper advocates for a shift in the use of VR, urging researchers to harness its potential in testing embodied cognitive mechanisms underlying NDCs. That is, leveraging VR's functionality to systematically manipulate sensory and social experiences in real-world simulations and test participants in active, whole-body, daily tasks. This article asks why and how VR should be used in NDC research and points to its unique strengths compared to conventional methodologies.",

While deficits in cognitive functions such as executive function (EF) are well-documented in ADHD, the link between ADHD characteristics and the ability to solve problems via trial and error is more cloudy. We tested 70 adult participants, with ADHD and without, in trial-and-error reasoning problems called ‘Virtual Tools’. Performance metrics included success rates, number of attempts, completion time, and strategy measures. Multivariate analysis revealed distinct patterns of ADHD characteristics that are beneficial for trial and error. Individuals with higher inattention performed better, those with balanced ADHD profiles performed similarly to non-ADHD controls. Profiles with high inattention switched trial-and-error strategies more often, supporting their performance. Findings imply that elevated levels of inattention may enable individuals to avoid becoming trapped in cognitive attractors, where they persist in using a single strategy with only marginal adjustments.",

          "abstract": "Background. Intertemporal impatience has been proposed as a transdiagnostic construct that is shared across mental health problems. We empirically tested this proposal using a novel transdiagnostic research approach that integrates per-category, trans-category, scale-level, and item-level analyses. First, we studied per-category continuous associations between intertemporal impatience and a large variety of mental health variables. Next, we examined which of several latent, trans-category mental health dimensions was associated with impatience, thereby studying which mental health problems may be connected through shared intertemporal impatience. Finally, to deepen our understanding of possible underlying mechanisms, we investigated which specific symptoms were driving these associations. Methods. The study was conducted in a predominantly non-clinical community sample of 899 participants who completed an intertemporal choice task and various mental health questionnaires. Per-category analyses involved bivariate correlations and multiple regressions; trans-category analyses involved exploratory factor analyses to identify transdiagnostic mental health dimensions, and structural-after-measurement models to test for associations between the dimensions and intertemporal impatience. Results. Intertemporal impatience was associated with increased nicotine use, reactive aggression, non-planning impulsivity, motor impulsivity, and dispositional greed. Moreover, impatience was positively associated with a transdiagnostic impulsivity dimension (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low self-control, and motor and non-planning impulsivity). Symptom-level analyses suggested that this association was mainly driven by information and financial impulsivity symptoms. Conclusions. Our results provide support for the role of intertemporal impatience across several externalizing but not internalizing mental health problems. Our research approach offers a detailed and nuanced interpretation of the transdiagnostic role of intertemporal impatience across mental health.",

Seven databases were searched on January 11*,\n2024, for randomised controlled trials quantitatively measuring the effectiveness of a psychomotor\nskill after an XR-based training programme. Sensitivity analyses, publication bias and risk of bias\nwere assessed. Due to non-independence of effect sizes, robust variance meta-regression models\nwere run and presented using forest plots. Thirty-five reports were assessed, totalling 1692\nparticipants. Both the post-training and pre-post-training change scores between XR and non-XR\ngroups were assessed. Four robust variance estimation meta-regression models were created by\nsplitting two types of control groups: passive (no training) and active (non-XR training). No\ndifferences were found between XR training and active control groups. There was, however, a\nbenefit of XR training compared with passive controls on post-training, but not change scores.\nAdditionally, one model showed a significant negative effect of haptic feedback on post-training\nscores compared with active controls, with the other models showing non-significant effects.\nEvidence certainty was limited by high heterogeneity, risk of bias, and poor methods reporting.\nOverall, XR-based training offers no significant benefit or detriment for training psychomotor\nskills.",

Integral Meditation (IM) is a mindfulness-based program that uniquely combines mindfulness with other meditation techniques to enhance psychophysical health. This study examined the effects of IM on psychological and neurophysiological outcomes.\nMethods: In a randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of Integral Meditation (IM) in 50 young adults, who were assigned to either the intervention group (n=22) or an inactive control group (n=28). We tested pre- to post-intervention changes and group differences in a comprehensive set of psychological and neurophysiological variables via linear regression analyses. Specifically, we measured dispositional mindfulness, state and trait anxiety, interoceptive sensibility, and interoceptive accuracy using validated self-report questionnaires and the Heartbeat Tracking Task. These metrics were complemented by individual alpha-band frequency and power, as obtained from resting state electroencephalography.\nResults: Results showed statistically significant increases in the IM group for dispositional mindfulness, interoceptive sensibility, attention regulation and Self-regulation, but no effects were observed for trait and state anxiety, interoceptive accuracy and alpha-band metrics. We further assessed if the intervention’s effect varied dependent on baseline measurement. A statistically significant result was found only for Individual Alpha Peak (IAP) power, indicating that the intervention effect was higher when participants had lower IAP power baseline scores. Partial correlation analyses indicated moderate associations between changes in psychological and neurophysiological variables from pre- to post-training. Follow-up exploratory analyses revealed that the link between IAP at baseline and positive intervention effects were strongest in a left-lateralized electrode cluster.\nConclusion: Overall, these results suggest that IM is associated with both psychological and neurophysiological changes, demonstrating the potential of meditation practices to enhance mindfulness and interoceptive sensibility. Additionally, IM modulates brain alpha activity, with baseline individual alpha power serving as a predictor of intervention efficacy.",

Data included American Community Survey and Environmental Justice Screen data for 288,918 census block-groups collected yearly from 2013 to 2022. Exploratory structural equation modeling with bifactor rotation was used to extract five orthogonal factors. The scores were validated using the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), Child Opportunity Index (COI), data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ambient noise data from the U.S. National Parks Service, and color-coded maps of metropolitan areas. The five scores captured urbanicity, socioeconomic prosperity, university influence, retirement appeal, and pollution levels. Validation showed expected relationships between urbanicity and ambient noise; socioeconomic status and ADI, COI, and mother's education; and score levels corresponding to known characteristics of metropolitan areas. These scores provide a significant advancement in the accessibility and usability of large-scale socioenvironmental data.

          "abstract": "Background: Kratom is a psychoactive botanical that is increasingly popular in the United \nStates, yet limited research exists to date on its potential risks. Given that kratom is currently \nunregulated, and a variety of kratom products are widely available on the commercial market, \nmore data are needed to inform consumers about potential adverse reactions to kratom. \nMethods: 102 participants (mean age=22.34 years, 32.9% women) were recruited from \nethnobotanical tea bars in Northern Colorado to complete a survey on kratom use, which \nincluded questions pertaining to adverse experiences. \nResults:  Most participants (75.5%) reported experiencing an adverse reaction to kratom at least \nonce in the past, with a wide range of kratom dosages reportedly consumed during these \nexperiences. Adverse reactions were most commonly reported to occur in the context of \nconsuming kratom on an empty stomach, consuming alongside certain foods, lack of hydration, \nand combining kratom with other substances. Participants employed a variety of strategies in \nattempt to mitigate adverse reactions, such as drinking water, eating, and resting. \nConclusions: Adverse reactions to kratom may be associated with certain contextual factors. \nSeveral techniques are reportedly used to mitigate adverse reactions, but the efficacy of these \ntechniques is unknown. More data are needed to understand the causes and consequences of \nadverse reactions to kratom, and to better understand potential harm reduction strategies for \nreducing adverse experiences. More research could also shed light on the extent to which kratom \ndosage and various product formulations (e.g. whole leaf vs. extracts) are predictive of adverse \neffects.",

This research employed a quasi-experimental design with a pre-test, post-test, and control group. The study population included individuals diagnosed with OCPD who sought treatment at the psychology polyclinic of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. Using voluntary sampling, 30 participants meeting the DSM-5 criteria for OCPD were selected based on the Structured Clinical Interview for Personality Disorders (SCID-5-PD) and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III (MCMI-III). These participants were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Data were collected using the MCMI-III, Hill Perfectionism Questionnaire, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). Following the pre-test, the experimental group received 10 sessions of group schema therapy, while the control group received no intervention. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).\nResults revealed that group schema therapy significantly improved perfectionism and OCPD symptoms (p &lt; 0.05), but it did not yield significant changes in alexithymia (p &gt; 0.05).\nKeywords: Schema Therapy, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder, Perfectionism, Alexithymia",

          "abstract": "The problem of free will involves reconciling a scientific view of the mind as composed of\nmechanisms with the notion of agents who enjoy freedom. Difficulty in reconciling these views has\nled to perennial waves of debate over whether free will really exists, and what evidence might\nadjudicate this question. Here, we adopt a novel approach to the problem by treating the perception\nof the problem of free will itself as a psychological phenomenon. Evolved systems for reasoning\nabout the self and the social world treat predictable, mechanistic relationships as antithetical to\nagency and free will. As a consequence, one has the experience of making up one’s mind with the\npossibility of doing otherwise, and of influencing others by intervening upon what they think and\nbelieve. In contrast, evolved systems for reasoning about artifacts and physical relationships treat\nmental phenomena as emerging out of predictable mechanisms that lack the capacity to do\notherwise, and need not be intervened upon via thoughts and beliefs. Different cognitive systems\nare thereby producing conflicting intuitions about how to conceptualize the mind, and these\nconflicting outputs give rise to the free will problem. The arguments for and against free will are\nunderstandable in light of this analysis: they emphasize different evidentiary standards which\nthemselves stem from different psychological adaptations for understanding reality. Understanding\nthe psychological basis of the problem, we suggest, goes a long way towards solving the problem of\nfree will.",

These divergent findings indicated that it is premature to assume causal effects of self-compassion and burnout on spiritual well-being and the suggestions by Lee and Fung in this regard can be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that correlations, including adjusted cross-lagged effects, do not prove causality in order not to overinterpret findings, something that appears to have happened to Lee and Fung.

          "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder with diverse clinical presentations and neuroanatomical alterations. Despite recent advances, we still lack a working hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. One reason might be the heterogeneous neuroanatomy of the patients. Data-driven approaches leveraging structural neuroimaging and machine learning have emerged as transformative tools for unraveling this enigma. Recent studies employing clustering techniques have identified robust neuroanatomical subtypes independent of traditional symptom-based frameworks. These data-driven methods reveal distinct cortical and subcortical patterns, aligning with disease progression variations, cognitive function, and treatment outcomes. Novel trajectory-based models suggest that schizophrenia may originate from distinct neuroanatomical regions and follow divergent paths of progression, emphasizing the importance of understanding these patterns in the context of disease staging. These findings provide a foundation for improving diagnostic precision, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring interventions. However, further validation with longitudinal data and methodological standardization are necessary to translate these insights into clinical practice and develop personalized treatment approaches.",

          "abstract": "The full diffusion decision model (DDM) assumes that the rate of evidence accumulation varies across trials, which allows the model to account for slow errors and asymptotic accuracy. This across-trial drift rate variability, however, has been criticised for being difficult to estimate and ad hoc. To examine whether random drift rate variability corresponds to meaningful variations in the quality of decision evidence, we assessed whether the model-estimated drift rate variability parameter can be partitioned by trial-level systematic drift rate information. Using a large recognition memory dataset with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings (n = 132), we systematically linked drift rate to individual trials using exogenous experimental factors—such as word frequency and study-test lag—along with endogenous factors using EEG data. Using simulations, we first demonstrated that, when slow errors arise solely due to across-trial drift rate variability, the random variability can be well partitioned and replaced by systematic variability on the trial-level. However, for the experimental data, the inclusion of systematic variability resulted in little decrease in the random across-trial drift rate variability parameter. These findings indicate that, while the quality of decision-relevant evidence (and hence drift rate) is expected to vary across trials, other mechanisms that produce slow errors are likely present but not implemented in the full DDM.",

That is, Kantian philosophy supposes that knowledge is formatted in terms of space and time. The current paper argues that space can be reduced to time and thus that the only a priori concept used to format knowledge is time. To build this framework, the current paper focuses on how humans discount time when making intertemporal choices. Celebrated temporal discounting models, such as the exponential and hyperbolic discounting models, are reviewed before arguing in favor of a more ecologically motivated account that suggests that hyperbolic discounting emerges from exponential discounting and uncertainty. The ecological account of temporal discounting is then applied to spatial navigation. Along the way, findings from neurobiology and principles from computational mechanisms are used to substantiate claims. Reducing space to time has important implications in cognitive science and philosophy and can inform a suite of seemingly distinct literatures.",

          "abstract": "A well-known problem in statistical audit sampling is inferring an upper limit for the population misstatement based on a sample with partial misstatements. Typically, auditors use the Stringer bound for this purpose. However, this method is often too conservative and lacks a solid statistical foundation. Despite the development of better alternatives, none of these methods have been widely adopted, partly because they are impractical. To address these issues, we propose an intuitive approach that combines Bayesian statistics with hurdle modeling. We show that this approach is reliable, has a stronger statistical foundation than the Stringer bound while also being more efficient, and is more practical than alternative methods. Additionally, it enables auditors to incorporate multiple sources of pre-existing audit information into the statistical analysis in a straightforward manner, thereby increasing transparency and efficiency. In sum, the Bayesian hurdle approach is an attractive solution for modeling audit samples with partial misstatements.",

          "abstract": "In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances. Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple analytic methods before it is taken seriously.",

          "abstract": "Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders have been associated with heightened stress sensitivity, which can worsen prognosis, functioning, and quality of life. However, more research is needed to determine whether different types of stress impact specific functional domains. This study used the Psychological Stress Index (PSI)—a self-report instrument designed and validated to measure perceived stress in psychosis—to delineate the unique contribution of social versus non-social stress to social functioning and social cognition. Fifty-nine participants with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and fifty non-clinical controls completed the PSI and a battery of social functioning and social cognition measures. Elevated social stress statistically predicted worse performance on an emotion recognition task and worse interviewer-rated social functioning, over-and-above non-social stress. Higher social stress also statistically predicted worse interviewer-rated social functioning over-and-above performance on emotion recognition and theory-of-mind tasks. These results provide promising evidence that examining social stress separately from non-social stress provides unique information about social difficulties in schizophrenia-spectrum psychopathology. Examining social stress and other specific forms of stress may improve understanding of stress sensitivity in this population and better inform treatments aimed at improving functioning.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on initiation (INIT), an early-trial peaking cognitive mode. The task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with INIT are modulated by a range of tasks, and we present five here. For each task, we report: (1) highly specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing INIT from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with INIT across a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to INIT as follows: (1) Raised Eyebrows, (2) De Divina Proportione Front Guy, and (3) When I’m 64. Evidence for INIT was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes for following tasks: verbal working memory (three versions), spatial working memory, and thought generation. Inspection of the task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with INIT, over the range of tasks mentioned above, and compared to similar modes such as multiple demand (MD), consistently supported the cognitive mode interpretation of restarting/initiating cognitive processes involving visual stimuli after brief, undemanding periods following a series of cognitive operations.",

          "abstract": "Individuals regularly fluctuate in their ability to focus attention as well as in their ability to spatially shift attention among different locations. However, the degree to which these ongoing changes in attentional states share common mechanisms or interact with one another remains unknown. In the current study, participants completed a modified gradual continuous performance task during which they monitored one of two lateralized streams of black and white images for the appearance of frequent target stimuli, withholding responses to foils. Periodically, a visual cue signaled participants to either maintain fixation at the current stream or to make a saccade to the opposing stream, and participants made a parity categorization for a digit appearing at the cued location. Trial-by-trial variation in pupil size, an indicator of arousal, accounted for both fluctuations in sustained attention and shift readiness but fluctuations in sustained attention were not associated with general modulations of shift readiness. Furthermore, we manipulated the frequency of attention shift cues over time and observed that unexpected shift cues were most disruptive, yielding longer saccade latencies, when participants lacked sustained focus. Our results suggest that ongoing changes in sustained attention occur independently from spatial shifting readiness but carry consequences for learned adjustments in saccade preparation.",

          "abstract": "Regulators and policy makers around the world have endorsed risk-based approaches for governing the challenges and opportunities from Artificial Intelligence (AI). In theory, these assessments should protect the public from the harmful impacts of AI, thus safeguarding important societal values such as the realization of fundamental rights. However, as an anticipatory decision-making tool, the success and legitimacy of risk-based regulatory approaches depend critically on methods that help policymakers and societal stakeholders anticipate how AI may impact a diverse citizenry, the many different ways in which technological change may unfold, and the factors that lead to desirable and less desirable visions of the future. In this paper, we first point out critical flaws in existing assessment methods and regulatory approaches and consequently identify the need for a shift in current approaches to assessment approaches. We call on scholars, policy makers, and the technology industry to engage in anticipatory approaches that go beyond compliance and checklist exercises and acknowledge the responsibility they have for impacts that go beyond what is known. Second, we propose a concrete alternative empirical approach to address our concerns: Scenario-based Sociotechnical Envisioning (SSE). By using SSE, practitioners can make assessments more inclusive, more aware of the socio-technical context in which AI systems are deployed, and more prospective in terms of identifying impacts before they occur. We encourage scientists, policy makers and legislators to use SSE as one method in their assessment toolbox. Third, we anticipate possible objections to our approach and pro-actively discuss how these can be met.",

This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate–and extend–prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the PPI correlation as a measure of interchangeability and derive the effective sample size for PPI. We also introduce a power analysis to optimally choose between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior.

          "abstract": "This study examines political discourse across eleven major subreddits over sixteen years to understand the dynamics of cross-ideological interaction on Reddit. Through a framework combining discourse theory and new materialism, we analyse information-sharing, cross-posting, and discursive formations across political communities. Our findings lead us to conceptualise ‘sedimented polarisation’—a discursive-material condition where polarisation becomes an empty signifier around which political discursive formations take shape. Despite Reddit’s design allowing cross-community engagement, we find minimal interaction between discursively dissonant spaces. While r/politics is often presented as a space for cross-ideological deliberation and exposure, it fails to function as a town square. We observe a fragmentation across political subreddits and discourses beyond the left-right dichotomy. These patterns emerge from an entanglement of platform design, community moderation practices, user agency, discourses, and broader socio-political contexts.",

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

By detailing how we, as academics and NHS leaders, experienced our participation in leading and doing the research, we developed a shared understanding of why our collaboration is effective. From our reflections, we developed DOTS: Deciding together, Optimising outcomes, Time to get to know one another and Sharing knowledge and skills. This paper details how we worked through inter-organisational complexity by applying DOTS. The time taken to apply DOTS across inter-organisational contexts can develop team efficiency and enhance its effectiveness.

          "abstract": "In 2014, the United Kingdom’s Department for Education, as part of the government's counterterrorism Prevent strategy, introduced a program requiring schools to teach \"Fundamental British Values\". The aim was to foster a shared sense of \"Britishness\" through instilling core values. This initiative has been highly controversial. Yet, no research has systematically assessed its long-term, large-scale impacts. Here we conduct the first such assessment. By analyzing multiple censuses, cross-referencing with high quality survey data, and utilizing three different causal identification methods based on difference-in-differences, we find that overall, the initiative has significantly increased the probability of identifying as British. Yet the effect is heterogeneous. The initiative backfires for Muslims, for whom it reduces identifying as British. We find no effect of the policy on the targeted values. Our study contributes to the debates on education and nationalism, and calls for a more inclusive civic education approach for bridging social divisions and fostering positive and inclusive identities.",

          "abstract": "This research identifies the causality between entrepreneurial behaviour and informal institutions of social trust within the context of China’s development. Revisiting the Polanyi-Schumpeter theoretical framework, entrepreneurship embedded in social relations interlinked by trust is a dynamo of sustainable socioeconomic progress. The institutionalised trust, however, was not clarified. With micro-individual data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2011–2021, our research employs the instrumental variable approach rooted in historical rice farming to tackle endogeneity. The results demonstrate that social trust elevates entrepreneurial engagement by 32.65 and 10.37 percentage points in self-employment and business incorporation, respectively. Increased trust paradoxically hampers self-employment in the central due to insular networks and structural disparities. The findings uncover the nuanced role of social trust in facilitating and constraining entrepreneurship with contextually regional determinants. The research contributes to knowledge and evidence of institutional endowments that mediate entrepreneurial agency and argues for synchronising formal and informal institutions in development.",

          "abstract": "Participation processes (PPs) are often promoted as tools to improve public policymaking, yet their causal impact on policy decisions remains inconsistent. Existing research on policy impact has faced criticism for lacking methodological rigor, transparency, and comparability, impeding knowledge cumulation. This paper addresses these gaps by providing methodological guidance for assessing the causal impact of PPs on collective decisions in public policy and administration. Drawing on established theories of causality and (Bayesian) process tracing, we introduce a counterfactual approach that asks whether a decision would have occurred without the PP. We outline fundamental principles and practical steps for delineating, and operationalizing key concepts, assessing the strength of evidence, and addressing uncertainties. An exemplary application to the Berlin Climate Citizens’ Assembly reveals that only a small share of its proposals influenced policy decisions. The few impactful proposals support theories that deliberative mini-publics can drive policy change by encouraging policymakers, enriching policies, and breaking deadlocks. However, many proposals had no impact due to overlapping with existing or planned policies, exposing inefficiencies in mini-public design. Involving policymakers in mini-publics might enhance their impact on policy decisions but could compromise their independence.",

          "abstract": "This research project aims to understand how the concept of new museology helps to communicate with differently abled people. Though the policy of exclusion for various kind visitors is also prevalent in museum due to vision centric nature of museum and architecturally designed for people without any difficulties. One such example is the exclusion of visually impaired people from the museum. The role of the museum has significantly changed in the recent years and has been attributed to play its most important role as an educator. This being an important aspect; there have been developments also to justify it being an organization in the public sector and for the public sector. Museums need to be accessible to all and this has been worked upon in different museums across the globe to make it all inclusive and not exclusive in nature. The cultural exclusion is not only from the perspective of inaccessibility for audience but also from the perspective of the lack of meaningful representation of disability within museum’s collection. Since the development of concept of museology, the differently abled people have been historically and contemporarily excluded from cultural spaces. The National Museum has made a significant endeavour to make museum more inclusive comprising visually impaired people by making Anubhav Gallery. In this research it is observed that the Anubhav gallery is not just being a repository of materials on display but it serves an institution, which enables dialogue between the audience and the objects. Providing an interactive model for accessible gallery for all visitors or designing of a specific gallery dedicated to particular visitors are not enough but museums should also promote the facilities through various programmes among the marginalized as well as common visitors also. Hence, there is no need for individuals with different abilities to separate for museum experience. This can allow families or groups of friends to enjoy the experience together and to build their relationships with each other.\nKeywords- Visually Impaired, Disabled, Vision loss and Accessibility",

          "authors": "Kylie Fuller; Romain Ferrali; Lucas Francou Damesin; Izzy Gainsburg; Brent Simpson; Robb Willer",
          "abstract": "In response to the escalating climate crisis, and with major climate policy reforms under debate across Europe, many environmental activists have turned to extreme protest tactics, such as vandalizing museums and obstructing major highways. Research suggests that extreme protest tactics - protest behaviors perceived to be highly disruptive, harmful to others, or both - may attract media attention, but typically reduce public support for protest groups (e.g., Feinberg et al., 2020). However, this research has focused primarily on Americans’ responses to public protest. Additionally, little experimental research has tested the causal effects of extreme tactics in the context of the climate movement, even though it is the largest social movement in the world (Hasegawa, 2022). To address these gaps, we fielded a large, pre-registered online survey experiment, conducted on a representative sample of French citizens (n = 8,001), testing the effects of exposure to four protest actions featuring different degrees of extremity - a peaceful march, occupying an office building, blocking public transportation, and damaging infrastructure. Results showed that, relative to a control condition, extreme protest actions reduced support for the activist group, willingness to join the climate movement, and support for climate mitigation policies (e.g., a carbon tax on fossil fuel companies), with these reductions increasing proportional to the extremity of the protest actions. Additionally, we found no evidence that exposure to these extreme tactics led to greater support for a more moderate climate protest group, offering evidence against the “radical flank effect” found in previous research (Simpson et al., 2022). Overall, results show that previously demonstrated negative effects of extreme protest tactics on popular support for social movements and their policy goals extends to activism on climate change, and also generalizes beyond the U.S. to the European context, a critical setting for policy efforts to address climate change.",

          "authors": "Matthew DiGiuseppe; Michael E Flynn",
          "abstract": "Survey researchers rely heavily on closed-ended questions to measure latent respondent characteristics like knowledge, policy positions, emotions, ideology, and various other traits. While closed-ended questions ease analysis and data collection, they necessarily limit the depth and variability of responses. Open-ended responses allow for greater depth and variability in responses but are labor-intensive to code. Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve some of these problems, but existing approaches to using LLMs have a number of limitations. In this paper, we propose and test a pairwise comparison method to scale open-ended survey responses on a continuous scale. The approach relies on LLMs to make pairwise comparisons of statements that identify which statement ``wins'' and ``loses''. With this information, we employ a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model to recover a `score' on a the relevant latent dimension for each statement. This approach allows for finer discrimination between items, better measures of uncertainty, reduces anchoring bias, and is more flexible than methods relying on Maximum Likelihood Estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on an open-ended question probing knowledge of interest rates in the US economy. A comparison of 6 LLMs of various sizes reveals that pairwise comparisons show greater consistency than zero-shot 0-10 ratings with larger models (&gt; 9-billion parameters). Further, comparison of pairwise decisions are consistent with high-knowledge crowd source workers.",

With the increasing number of insecurity and violence against women, the topic of femicides has gained relevance. Nonetheless, its attention has also shifted from finding justice for women who have been private in their lives to men. On occasions, as the three cases deepened in this text, men became the center of the story for good, bad, or neutral reasons. As a consequence, the victims of hateful crimes have been forgotten, and the perception of males is telling their stories. As a consequence, the cases commented on in this article are from all ranges of ages, different parts of the Mexican Republic, and in diverse years to find common ground among them: They still need justice. Through a revision of the available literature, including statements from those involved, the goal is to describe how attention has shifted from solving femicides to maintaining men in the focus of the crimes.",

          "abstract": "U.S. and Chinese technology companies dominate digital networks. What explains the extent to which third countries attach to U.S. versus Chinese network hubs? The answer matters, because both governments have demonstrated the ability to “weaponize” their hubs to advance their security interests. We synthesize three hypothetical explanations for third countries' network hub attachment from previous qualitative literature: 1) network hub attachment is a product of economic forces; 2) network hub attachment is determined by rivaling great powers coaxing and coercing third countries to attach to their hubs over their rival’s; and 3) network hub attachment results from third-country governments’ strategic policy choices. In the first quantitative study on the topic, we assess these explanations with original data on the global geography of U.S. and Chinese -owned hyperscale cloud infrastructures. Based on the findings, we argue that third countries or “spoke states” enjoy agency in bipolar networks which they did not have in unipolar networks, and that their strategic interests in combination with economic forces shape the topology of geographically distributed bipolar networks more so than great-power rivalry. Our model contributes to the weaponized interdependence framework which predicted the rise of alternative hubs but lacked a model of bipolar network topology.",

The PSS model is based on the interplay of six key components: cumulative knowledge, intelligence, technological synergy, quantum information, social dynamics, and environmental sustainability. \tThe interaction of these variables is described through a system of nonlinear differential equations, reflecting the complex feedback loops and synergetic effects characteristic of the postsingular world.\n\tA differentiation table contrasting postsingular and classical science is also presented, highlighting the most fundamental differences between contemporary classical science and future postsingular science.\n\tThe model emphasizes the synergy between humans and artificial intelligence, the role of quantum technologies in accelerating scientific discovery, and the impact of social and ecological factors that either constrain or stimulate scientific progress.\n\tIt is anticipated that new forms of scientific information dissemination will replace traditional academic publications and that scientific processing will reach an entirely new level of development following the singularity-driven acceleration of technological progress and the integration of AI into R&amp;D. This will herald an era of nonstop, ultrarapid science operating 24/7. The synergy of humans and artificial intelligence will create a scientific union on the basis of fundamentally new principles and methods.\n\tThis research provides an initial theoretical foundation for further interdisciplinary studies aimed at developing sustainable strategies and effectively managing scientific progress in the postsingular era.

There is a particular need for research with marginalized online sex workers, including transgender/nonbinary (TNB) people. Accordingly, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 U.S.-based TNB young adults, ages 22-30 years, who had done online sex work. We triangulated interview data through focus groups with 17 clinicians and advocates. Using template-style thematic analysis, we developed themes addressing reasons for doing online sex work (five themes); stressful dynamics (six themes); fulfilling dynamics (five themes); and protective factors (two themes). Participants did online sex work for a mix of financial and personal reasons. Stressful dynamics included pressure to conform to sexual stereotypes, restrictive platform rules, and sex work stigma. Fulfilling dynamics included skill/career development, self-exploration, and opportunities to promote healthier sexual norms. Economic stability and longer-term sex work experience emerged as protective factors. Clinicians and advocates should recognize the diversity of TNB young adults’ online sex work experiences, oppose restrictive laws and platform policies, and advocate for safety net programs that help young adults maintain economic stability.",

Drawing on Paolo J. Knill’s interdisciplinary background in musicology, psychology, and systems theory, the authors propose a model of “intermodal decentering” that integrates multiple art forms—visual art, music, dance, poetry, and drama—into therapeutic practice. Emphasizing “aesthetic responsibility,” the book addresses ethical considerations and underscores the relational power of artistic processes to foster meaningful change. While grounded in the 1990s, its foundational principles resonate with current realities of political polarization, global conflict, and collective trauma, illustrating the continued relevance of an embodied, creative framework. Future directions include deeper cultural adaptation and exploration of digital modalities, yet Minstrels of Soul remains an enduring cornerstone for professionals seeking holistic, arts-based approaches to individual and communal healing.",

Current evidence how this translates into different patterns of time use for childcare is mixed and nonexistent for Germany.\nMethods: We applied OLS regression to estimate non-cohabiting (n=968) and cohabiting (4,486) mothers’ and fathers’ (n=76 and n=4,416, respectively) time use for primary childcare using time diary data of the four surveys of the German Time Use Study from 1991/1992, 2001/2002, 2012/2013, and 2022 (n=10,202 diaries for mothers, and n=8,388 diaries for fathers).\nResults: Non-cohabiting mothers spent more time on primary childcare than cohabiting mothers in 1991/1992, but this negative gradient virtually disappeared and was basically nonexistent since 2001/2002. Non-cohabiting fathers spent more time doing primary childcare than cohabiting fathers, although this finding rested on very small case numbers.\nConclusion: Non-cohabiting mothers did not seem to reduce their time for childcare when compared to cohabiting mothers, whereas non-cohabiting fathers seemed to meet the need of more childcare, compared to cohabiting fathers.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach to decomposing population change by identifying the separate contributions of fertility, mortality, net migration, and initial age structure using stable population theory. Its strength lies in the additivity of the results: the contributions of these factors, along with the interaction effect, sum to equal the total population change. In addition, identifying the direct impact of initial age structure on population change offers new insights into the drivers of population dynamics. Central and Eastern Europe was one of the regions hit most by population decline between 1990 and 2020; however, it was marked by significant variation across countries. By decomposing population change, we found that the positive impact of the relatively young initial age structure in the CEE region was as large as the population-reducing effect of negative net migration, while the positive impact of mortality improvement offset one-third of the population-reducing effect of low fertility. On the other hand, the initial age structure had a crucial role in explaining differences in country-level population change during the study period.",

          "abstract": "Contraception is essential for reproductive health and family planning but remains deeply intertwined with socio-economic and gender inequalities. Women disproportionately shoulder the physical, emotional, and logistical responsibilities of contraception – tasks collectively referred to as contraceptive labor. These include method selection, ensuring consistent use, managing side effects, and maintaining adherence, representing a significant yet often overlooked form of unpaid labor. Despite growing recognition of contraceptive labor as a driver of gender inequality, research has yet to systematically quantify both its burdens and returns. We introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and its returns from a female perspective. To address this gap, we introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and returns from a female perspective. Grounded in theories of gendered labor and health economics, the ContraIndex evaluates contraception across two interrelated dimensions: the burdens (labor) and benefits (returns) associated with various contraceptive methods. By facilitating cross-method comparisons, the ContraIndex provides a novel framework for examining the causes and consequences of contraceptive inequality.

          "abstract": "Teacher well-being is a critical factor influencing educator retention and student outcomes, yet existing measures often fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of this construct. This study addresses this gap by developing and validating four new scales to support teacher well-being: Emotional Exhaustion, Workload, Administrative Support, and Colleague Support. The scales were developed to address the necessity for enhanced instruments to gauge teacher well-being, especially given the heightened demands and stress experienced by teachers. Drawing on previous research and incorporating direct input from practicing teachers, we crafted items that underwent multiple rounds of pilot testing. Psychometric analyses demonstrated strong reliability and validity across diverse samples, highlighting the utility of these scales in identifying specific areas of strength and need within school contexts. These tools offer researchers and practitioners actionable measures to better understand and support the well-being of educators, with implications for professional development, policy, and organizational change.",

          "authors": "Nora Müller; Theresa Nutz; Katrin Firl; Lara Guse",
          "abstract": "Contraception is essential for reproductive health and family planning but remains deeply intertwined with socio-economic and gender inequalities. Women disproportionately shoulder the physical, emotional, and logistical responsibilities of contraception – tasks collectively referred to as contraceptive labor. These include method selection, ensuring consistent use, managing side effects, and maintaining adherence, representing a significant yet often overlooked form of unpaid labor. Despite growing recognition of contraceptive labor as a driver of gender inequality, research has yet to systematically quantify both its burdens and returns. We introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and its returns from a female perspective. To address this gap, we introduce the ContraIndex, a formative, multidimensional tool designed to measure contraceptive labor and returns from a female perspective. Grounded in theories of gendered labor and health economics, the ContraIndex evaluates contraception across two interrelated dimensions: the burdens (labor) and benefits (returns) associated with various contraceptive methods. By facilitating cross-method comparisons, the ContraIndex provides a novel framework for examining the causes and consequences of contraceptive inequality. Its application offers actionable insights for researchers and policymakers, paving the way for strategies to reduce gendered disparities in reproductive health.",

          "abstract": "Anticipating the impacts of new technology in society is at the crux of efforts to understand, advance, and govern its safety. However, doing so is fundamentally difficult. The evolution of various technical, social, policy conditions can modulate the direction of sociotechnical development in uncertain ways. But with prospections of the future come opportunities for agency, control, and forward-looking responsibility that are crucial to orienting stakeholders towards opportunities to steer the technology and be well-prepared to observe, measure, and ultimately evaluate its impact. Written scenarios can support such prospection and effectively serve as orienting devices in supporting strategic decision-making. The goal of scenario writing is not future prediction per se, but rather in helping to perceive potential future outcomes that can then inform what actions can be taken now to steer towards desirable futures.  The breadth and richness of scenarios is enhanced when many diverse perspectives and sets of expertise and experience are brought into the process.  Building on these ideas, in this guidebook we elaborate a method, which we term Scenario-Based Sociotechnical Envisioning (SSE), as we have applied it to study and anticipate the impacts of new AI technologies in society.",

          "title": "The Consolidation of the Pharmaceutical Sector in the Global Economy: Growth, Influence, Deviations, and Marketing",
          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
          "abstract": "This study investigates how the pharmaceutical sector has become one of the largest and most influential economic sectors of our time. It presents figures and information that support this claim and aims to elucidate the factors that contributed to such a rise. Since Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin in 1928, pharmaceutical industries have evolved from small entities - often family-owned and operating locally - to multinational corporations valued at hundreds of billions of dollars with global influence. However, beyond the discovery and diversification of drugs, increased demand, and expansion of production capacity, part of this evolution is underpinned by complex, and in some cases perverse, strategies prioritizing profit maximization over public and individual health. The findings of this study reveal that, over the past two decades, the sector's revenues have quadrupled, reaching 1.48 trillion dollars in 2022, an amount comparable to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developed countries such as Spain. The twenty largest companies in the sector have a combined market value of 3.5 trillion dollars and assets totaling 1.86 trillion, generating annual revenues of 820 billion and profits of 181.6 billion. For context, the assets of these companies alone are comparable to the GDP of all Sub-Saharan African countries. Companies, like Johnson &amp; Johnson, have a market value exceeding the GDP of 184 nations. The study also examines and discusses questionable practices adopted by the pharmaceutical industry, including investing billions in lobbying and election financing, influencing regulatory agencies, financially supporting patient organizations, sponsoring authors of \"Clinical Guidelines\", manipulating and concealing drug research and tests, and directing massive investments to strengthen ties with prescribers, university hospitals, and academic institutions. Concrete examples of these actions are provided, backed by studies, data surveys, and court decisions, underscoring the alarming consequences of this reality. Lastly, the research analyzes pharmaceutical marketing as a primary sales boost strategy. Despite drugs not being ordinary commodities, susceptible to promotion under the lens of rampant consumption, companies invest billions annually in direct-to-consumer advertising. In the Brazilian context, the pharmaceutical sector stands out as one of the main investors in marketing. In recent years, several companies in the field have ranked among the highest individual advertising spenders. The emergence of digital marketing strategies driven by the internet, advanced algorithms, and social networks, combined with advertising campaigns harmful to public and collective health, underscore a concerning and challenging scenario.",

          "authors": "Sunny Choi",
          "abstract": "This study explores the pedagogical impact of incorporating improvisation practices into the curriculum of Classical piano students in higher education. Drawing from Bourdieu’s social reproduction theory and the concept of habitus, the research investigates how intentional disruptions to students' ingrained Classical training can foster identity development, adaptability, and career readiness. The findings are based on a case study conducted at a Finnish music university, where three Classical piano students participated in weekly free accompaniment (FA) lessons focusing on improvisation with non-Classical repertoire as learning materials. The study highlights the challenges students faced when transitioning from their traditional emphasis on technical\nmastery to a more flexible approach centered on exploration. Physical habits and dispositions that were deeply rooted in their Classical training served as both barriers and opportunities for growth. Over time, the students embraced improvisation to redefine learning, transitioning from a narrow focus on technical perfection to valuing adaptability. These findings reveal broader implications for higher education, particularly in preparing students for professional environments that demand flexibility and interdisciplinary expertise. The FA lessons facilitated a development in the students’ musical identity as pianists, enabling them to navigate the tension between their Classical foundations and the evolving demands of a competitive society. The study underscores the importance of integrating adaptive learning practices across disciplines to equip students with the soft skills necessary to thrive in an ever-changing professional landscape.",

          "abstract": "German academia has faced a multitude of changes over the last two decades, including new alternative academic pathways to a professorship based on the Anglo-Saxon science system, such as junior or tenure track professorship. Our study investigates the patterns of academic career trajectories to a professorship that have emerged due to these changes. It looks deeper into the relationship between those patterns and determinants of academic success, such as previous career choices, scientific productivity and the chosen scientific field. Using data from the prof*panel (N=660) – a survey of recently appointed full professors in Germany – and sequence-cluster analysis, we find four academic career clusters, three of which are beyond the traditional pathway of Endurance Careers: Efficient Careers, Unconventional Careers and International Careers indicating an institutional change within German academia. Cluster affiliation is mainly related to time-to-tenure, habilitation (second thesis), working abroad and the field of the professorship. Our findings suggest that traditional career paths still play a major role, although the influence of internationalization and novel academic career steps, like junior and tenure-track positions, is growing. Furthermore, less conventional career paths, attract a higher proportion of women and are characterized by international mobility and more diverse professional experiences. The insights of our study underscore the ongoing changes in the landscape of academic careers and highlight both persistent challenges and new opportunities for aspiring professors.",

The knowledge base stages the big picture of the problem to be solved, sketching out the social structures in which the problem is embedded. This paper, focusing on the design of digital policy games to combat inequalities in health, delves into the significant role of WHO's action-oriented framework in informing game design. Recent research within social epidemiology has theoretically strengthened the term structure in the WHO framework on inequalities in health. This approach allows us to examine health outcomes from simulated interventions in a policy game. It paves the way for exploring how the structural determinants of health are created, maintained, and disrupted. This novel approach shows great potential for designing simulated interventions on non-player characters agency, adaptation and environments in policy games on inequality in health. This work demonstrates how a solid knowledge base can harness the design and theoretical base of interventions in policy games on inequality in health with particular emphasis on rigging the game system and dynamics of non-player characters.",

          "abstract": "By the year 2030, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to transformative global changes—particularly if developed and deployed without ethical guidelines or government oversight. This paper explores how unregulated AI might reshape warfare, drive geopolitical rivalries, and enable misuse by state and non-state actors alike. Through an analysis of potential conflicts, power struggles, and ethical pitfalls, this study examines scenarios in which AI-driven militaries clash, states weaponize data for strategic advantage, and corporate entities develop autonomous systems for profit without regard for societal well-being. The findings reveal a dangerous trajectory where AI could fuel human rights abuses, escalate conflicts, and create a world order defined by unchecked surveillance and algorithmic manipulation. Ultimately, the paper underscores the urgent need for international cooperation and regulation to avoid the dystopian outcomes that could arise from an AI-driven world lacking ethical standards.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) in England is a recently-legislated mechanism for ensuring\nthat the biodiversity impacts of new developments are appropriately mitigated. Despite\nthe assumption that some elements, such as the preference for locally-implemented\noffsetting of impacts, should provide benefits for people, the policy's focus is on\necological outcomes. The social feasibility of BNG guidelines has not been properly\ntested, nor has their generalisability across people and places. Understanding the\npreferences of local project-affected people for Biodiversity Net Gain and incorporating\nthis into both policy and project-level decision-making is a critical step for managing\ntrade-offs ex-ante, thereby maximising the likelihood that BNG projects benefit people’s\nwellbeing. Using a choice experiment of hypothetical BNG projects in the context of\nhousing development we examine the trade-offs between the features of the BNG\nproject: distance from home; biodiversity level (species richness); off-site vs on-site\nbiodiversity provision; public access to the offset site; and a non-biodiversity feature (%\naffordable housing). We found that public access and species richness were\nproportionally more important than proximity and the % of affordable housing. These\npreferences were of course heterogeneous and determined by sociopsychological\nvariables, e.g., captured in the notions of \"attachment to place\", connectedness to\nnature, socio-economic variables and rural versus urban location. The preferences\nexpressed identify a range of BNG approaches that respect peoples' preferences and\ntrade-offs, noting that acceptance of BNG depends to a great degree on outcomes that\nare either not an explicit priority (i.e., species richness) or are disincentivised (i.e.,\npublic access) by current BNG policy.",

          "abstract": "This paper studies the origins of nursing as a professional occupation. In the early 20th\ncentury, hospitals founded training schools for nurses to meet the growing demand for\nmedical care. Training schools increased overall nurse supply and soon became the\nprimary pathway for young women to receive a professional nursing credential. I\nestimate how the availability of nurse training affected labor market outcomes. Using\nlinked census records and training school openings as a source of variation, I show that\nwhite women who were geographically close to an opening in adolescence were more\nlikely to become trained nurses. Effects are largest for women from well-off families, as\nproxied using father's occupation. Availability of nurse training caused women to\nsubstitute away from other occupations and had little effect on labor force participation\nor occupation-based measures of income. Furthermore, by their thirties, women who\nwere geographically close to an opening were less likely to become physicians. These\nresults paint a mixed picture: Nurse training provided new opportunities for women in\nthe workforce, reinforcing existing gender segregation in medicine. Over the course of\nthe 20th century, nursing would grow to become the largest majority-female occupation\nin the United States.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, the concept of solidarity has come to the forefront of European policy discussion and rhetoric. This report aims at providing a definitional framework for this value by drawing upon the domains of philosophy, political science and psychology, examining solidarity practices, including EU responses to major current crises in the EU. This report also provides options on how solidarity can be fostered through educational policies and practices. Among other aspects of the complexity surrounding solidarity, this report discusses the levels, longitudinal variation, and relevance as a political desideratum in democratic societies. This report also examines how solidarity relates to other sociological and psychological concepts, such as social identity, altruism, and social norms. Findings indicate the need to look at intergenerational solidarity and the salience of solidarity in discussions concerning the welfare state, the economy, migration, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, to cite some current concerns that are high on public and political agendas. In education, we find that instilling the value of European solidarity, among other common values, is key for the European integration project. We therefore recommend pursuing policies to foster solidarity at all levels and, with particular reference to Education in particular, to include solidarity education in school curricula in support of the promotion of European values.",

Among the “technology masters”, we distinguish three families: those who remain at the service of the State and the established order, those who have exploited, consciously or not, of the withdrawal of the neoliberal State to offer services and innovations formerly assumed by the public sector, and finally those who have consciously taken advantage of this same withdrawal and the recognition they enjoy in society to propose other models (free software, open source, cryptoanarchism, technical alternatives, etc.).",
