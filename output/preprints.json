          "title": "Tracking transformative agreements through open metadata: method and validation using Dutch Research Council NWO funded papers.",
          "authors": "Hans de Jonge; Bianca Kramer; Jeroen Sondervan",
          "abstract": "Transformative agreements have become an important strategy in the transition to open access, with almost 1,200 such agreements registered by 2025. Despite their prevalence, these agreements suffer from important transparency limitations, most notably article-level metadata indicating which articles are covered by these agreements. Typically, this data is available to libraries but not openly shared, making it difficult to study the impact of these agreements. In this paper, we present a novel, open, replicable method for analyzing transformative agreements using open metadata, specifically the Journal Checker tool provided by cOAlition S and OpenAlex. To demonstrate its potential, we apply our approach to a subset of publications funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and its health research counterpart ZonMw. In addition, the results of this open method are compared with the actual publisher data reported to the Dutch university library consortium UKB. This validation shows that this open method accurately identified 89% of the publications covered by transformative agreements, while the 11% false positives shed an interesting light on the limitations of this method. In the absence of hard, openly available article-level data on transformative agreements, we provide researchers and institutions with a powerful tool to critically track and evaluate the impact of these agreements.",

          "title": "When Hypothesis Preregistration Feeds Into Theory Development",
          "authors": "Agata Bochynska; Giosuè Baggio",
          "abstract": "Study preregistrations and theory development have been proposed as independent strategies for improving the quality, transparency, robustness, and reproducibility of research. Yet, a discussion of how theory and preregistration could interact and complement each other towards improved science is currently lacking. Here, we argue that hypothesis preregistration could stimulate theory development by serving various roles, depending on the availability or quality of theories and hypotheses in a field at any given time. We suggest that, in appropriate conditions, preregistration can increase the quality of hypotheses before they are tested, with indirect beneficial effects on theory development. In fields where theories are less developed or agreed upon, or are lacking altogether, hypothesis preregistration can nudge researchers to improve and share their hypotheses, engaging their community and facilitating accumulation and development of hypotheses. As a field’s theories and hypotheses become more advanced and better understood, hypothesis preregistration can become less important: the theory itself can function as a public repository of hypotheses and can constrain methodological aspects of research. We explore possible relations and synergies between hypothesis preregistration and theory development in a range of scenarios. We conclude with a discussion of implications and recommendations for researchers and meta-scientists.",

          "abstract": "Reproducibility of research is a hotly debated topic, including aspects like causes and \nconsequences of low levels of reproducibility, and the desirability of reproducibility across research \nfields. While some research fields have led the way and introduced various reproducibility practices \nand procedures, the call for efforts to ‘improve’ reproducibility in research has not come without \ncriticisms. Generally, there is ample ambiguity about the desired and most productive way to make \nprogress with reproducibility of research. To study the most desirable way towards this progress,the \ncurrent study uses a future studies methodology to gather perceptions of developments in the \nresearch ecosystem related to reproducibility issues. It draws on input from representatives of four \nmain stakeholder categories: scholarly publishers, funding agencies, qualitative social scientists \nand machine learning researchers. Particularly, it discusses the enablers and barriers that members \nof these stakeholder communities foresee on the road towards a research ecosystem that is more \nconducive to reproducibility.\n\nBased on an initial survey and a series of workshops, the study finds that enablers and barriers can \nbe categorised into five main clusters. The factors most prominently mentioned as potentially \nsupporting or hindering a desired future are located within research culture, including norms, values \nand shared definitions; and in the infrastructure required to engage in reproducibility practices, \nincluding repositories, support staff, and digital infrastructure. Three other clusters of factors put \nforth by participants relate to policy efforts required to incentivise reproducibility practices; training \nand education to empower researchers and support staff to engage in reproducibility practices; and \nthe financial resources required to facilitate the transition towards a desired future and to \nspecifically fund replication studies. This manuscript also identifies several tensions between \nenablers and barriers perceived by diverse stakeholders and concludes with recommendations for \naddressing these.",

          "authors": "Paige Amormino; Abigail Marsh; Kendra Leigh Seaman",
          "abstract": "Early research in behavioral sciences emphasized situational and contextual factors as key drivers of prosocial behavior, with individual differences historically receiving less attention.

          "authors": "Jamie Reilly; Virginia Ulichney; Ben Sacks; Anna Duncan; Sarah Weinstein; Tania Giovannetti; Chelsea Helion; Gus Cooney",
          "abstract": "Our earliest acquired words tend to reference concrete objects that can be seen, heard, touched, and felt. One hallmark of language maturation involves an ‘abstractness shift’ where language is used to convey intangible mental states, emotions, and ideas. Much of our understanding of the trajectory of concreteness in language development ends at early adolescence and is informed by studies of comprehension. We investigated concreteness effects in language production across the span of adulthood with a focus on conversation. We tested two competing hypotheses about abstract word use in conversation as a function of normal aging. The first hypothesis is that a steady accrual of vocabulary knowledge over the lifespan will confer a more expansive abstract lexicon and that older adults will in turn produce more abstract words in conversation. An alternative hypothesis is that aging gradually compromises executive resources that impact abstract word retrieval, leading to a concreteness bias in conversation. We analyzed distributions of abstract and concrete words and cross-speaker alignment within unscripted conversations between adults of different ages (N=1565 conversations, &gt;8 million words, age range 19-66) using a novel computational algorithm (ConversationAlign). Aging was associated with abstract word dropout, a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that high processing demands of conversation (e.g., alignment, topic maintenance) bias lexical retrieval toward concrete word use. We discuss the significance of these results for understanding intergenerational communication and relationships between aging, executive functioning, and lexical retrieval in high-level discourse.",

          "authors": "Patrick C. Trettenbrein; Emiliano Zaccarella; Angela D. Friederici",
          "abstract": "The capacity for language constitutes a cornerstone of human cognition and distinguishes our species from other animals. Research in the cognitive sciences has demonstrated that this capacity is not bound to speech but can also be externalized in the form of sign language. Sign languages are the naturally occurring languages of the deaf and rely on movements and configurations of hands, arms, face, and torso in space. This chapter reviews the functional and structural organisation of the neural substrates of sign language as identified by neuroimaging research over the past decades. Most aspects of sign language processing in adult deaf signers markedly mirror the well-known functional left-lateralization of spoken and written language. However, both hemispheres exhibit a certain equipotentiality for processing linguistic information and the right hemisphere seems to specifically support processing of some constructions unique to the signed modality. Crucially, the so-called “core language network” in the left hemisphere constitutes a functional and structural asymmetry in typically developed deaf and hearing populations alike: This network is (i) pivotal for processing complex syntax independent of the modality of language use, (ii) matures in accordance with a genetically determined biological matrix, and (iii) may have constituted an evolutionary prerequisite for the emergence of the human capacity for language.",

          "authors": "Emily Megumi Schulze; John Schwarz-Torres; Emily Kemp; Herry Patel; William E. Pelham",
          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "authors": "Margaret Ann McMullin; Nathan C. Higgins; Rohit Kumar; Mounya Elhilali; Joel S. Snyder",
          "abstract": "We encounter situations each day that require our auditory system to quickly interpret our surroundings. Auditory scene perception involves complex processes that allow us to identify both the setting and the objects within a scene, which are essential for decision-making, and situational awareness. While there is substantial evidence for distinct cortical regions and pathways supporting visual scene and object recognition, far less is known about how the brain processes complex auditory scenes and objects. This study aimed to determine whether distinct mechanisms underlie auditory setting and object identification and whether these mechanisms interact to aid perception. Participants listened to 200 natural auditory scenes of varying durations (1, 2, and 4 sec) and identified the setting (e.g., café) as well as the objects (e.g., talking, espresso machine, music) within each scene. Overall, performance was highest on the object identification task, and there was a significant interaction between task and scene duration, with a greater benefit of longer durations for the object identification task. Different low- and mid-level acoustic features of the scenes predicted performance on the two tasks. These results suggest that the auditory system employs distinct (and potentially interactive) computations for setting and object identification, allowing for quick interpretation of complex, real-world auditory scenes. The interaction between task performance and scene duration further suggests object and setting identification may operate on different temporal scales; objects might require more time for accurate individuation, while settings may be recognized more efficiently through global properties of scenes, such as openness or naturalness.",

          "abstract": "Background: Anxiety disorders are prevalent among youth and adults. Increasing studies examined the dynamic associations between momentary fluctuations of anxiety and well-being, primarily focusing on the severity of general anxiety. Scant research has explored the co-fluctuations between different anxiety symptoms and mental health outcomes. \nMethod: Using eight items selected from the Screen for Adult Anxiety Related Disorders (SCAARED) scale, the current study evaluated the multi-level factor structure and assessed the subclinical symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP), and panic disorder (PD) in a sample of non-clinical young adults (N = 271, Mage = 18 years, 72% female, 68% non-White) who participated in a 30-day daily diary study. This study also measured participants’ emotional and peer problems using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale, and stress by the College Chronic Life Stress Survey.\nResults: Between persons, GAD, SP, and PD were positively correlated with depressive symptoms, stress, as well as emotional and peer problems. Within persons, both SP and PD were positively associated with stress, peer and emotional problems on the same day. Across days, there was positive reciprocal relation between PD and stress, whereas negative reciprocal link was observed between SP and emotional problems. \nConclusion: Current findings showed dynamic and distinct patterns in the associations between different anxiety symptoms and several mental health outcomes, which emphasizes the need to disentangle between- and within-person variation of anxiety symptoms with intensive longitudinal designs.",

          "authors": "Connor Spiech; Mario Gómez Martínez; Giorgio Lazzari; Virginia Penhune",
          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1) before and after non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and perceived groove. Following stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the left SMA may have disinhibited either the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions themselves. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA plays a critical role in embodied rhythm processing.",

          "abstract": "Impression formation is the process of learning about people—how a perceiver infers another person’s character traits, goals, and preferences and forms their own attitude toward that person. Emerging research shows that impressions are formed through a variety of mechanisms—a multimodal process rooted in different underlying systems of learning and memory. In this Perspective, I describe the roles of episodic, semantic, instrumental, and Pavlovian memory systems in impression formation and updating. By considering the unique and interactive functions of learning and memory mechanisms, this memory systems framework expands and clarifies understanding of how impressions are formed, changed, and expressed in behavior, relative to prior accounts based only on semantic memory models. This framework also illuminates longstanding debates on the nature of implicit social cognition and how social information is represented in the mind.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests there are sex differences in social cognitive abilities, with females typically performing better on tasks involving emotion recognition and mental state attribution. However, many prior studies have demonstrated limited replicability, perhaps due to differences in methods employed or samples studied. Given that social cognition is a key determinant of social functioning, and that social dysfunction represents a transdiagnostic issue in neuropsychiatric populations, understanding sex differences in social cognition among individuals with varying levels of social functioning should broaden our understanding of the etiology, expression, and treatment of psychopathology. The present study examined sex differences in gaze perception, perceptual theory of mind, and social inference abilities in a sample (n = 172; 66.8% female) of adolescents and young adults (ages 14 to 30) ranging from minimal to clinical levels of social dysfunction. Females performed better on tasks involving perceptual theory of mind and eye gaze perception, and these sex differences remained even after accounting for general cognition, age, and psychopathology. Our findings suggest that females may be more sensitive to social signals related to the eyes and may more accurately identify social signals when there is subtle or limited information available. Findings indicate the importance of recognizing sex differences in the presentation of social functioning and, by extension, socially relevant psychopathology. Such differences may have implications for tailoring treatments for social dysfunction.",

          "abstract": "Background: Hue, saturation, and brightness are critical dimensions of color perception, and art students may experience color-related emotions differently from non-art students due to either their specialized training or innate artistic sensitivity. Despite this intriguing possibility, limited research has systematically examined these differences. This study aims to investigate how art and non-art students perceive and emotionally evaluate different colors.\nMethods: Using a questionnaire-based approach, participants rated the emotional valence of colors on a 7-point semantic differential scale, ranging from very negative to very positive. The colors were carefully selected from Munsell's color system, which enabled precise manipulation of hue, brightness, and saturation levels. The study included 36 art students and 36 non-art students, who evaluated colors under controlled experimental conditions.\nResults: The findings indicate that brightness and saturation significantly influence emotional responses to colors. Warmer colors, such as orange, elicited more positive emotional evaluations, whereas cooler colors, such as blue, received less positive ratings. Notably, art students differed from non-art students in their emotional responses, with the former group showing distinct sensitivity to variations in color dimensions.\nConclusion: This study highlights that art training shapes emotional color perception, as evidenced by the differing evaluations of art and non-art students. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how artistic training influences the emotional experience of color and underscore the role of education in enhancing perceptual and emotional sensitivity to visual stimuli.",

A group-hue interaction was observed in the P2 component, with the non-art group showing greater variability in P2 amplitudes across hues. Decoding analysis provided further evidence of distinct neural processing differences between the two groups.\nConclusion: These findings demonstrate that color perception differs between art and non-art groups, particularly in the neural processing of the P2 component. Warm and cool hues elicit stronger emotional and attentional responses, highlighting distinct cognitive mechanisms influenced by artistic expertise.\nKeywords: ERP; color perception; P2; P3; artistic training",

          "abstract": "An increasing number of real-world interventions aim to preemptively protect or inoculate people against misinformation. Inoculation research has demonstrated positive effects on misinformation resilience when measured immediately after treatment via messages, games, or videos. However, very little is currently known about their long-term effectiveness and the mechanisms by which such treatment effects decay over time. We start by proposing three possible models on the mechanisms driving resistance to misinformation. We then report five pre-registered longitudinal experiments (Ntotal = 11,759) that investigate the effectiveness of psychological inoculation interventions over time as well as their underlying mechanisms. We find that text-based and video-based inoculation interventions can remain effective for one month—whereas game-based interventions appear to decay more rapidly—and that memory-enhancing booster interventions can enhance the diminishing effects of counter-misinformation interventions. Finally, we propose an integrated memory-motivation model, concluding that misinformation researchers would benefit from integrating knowledge from the cognitive science of memory to design better psychological interventions that can counter misinformation durably over time and at-scale.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decade, the anxiety-related attentional bias to threat, widely investigated\nthrough the dot-probe task, has faced challenges. First, at an early stage of processing, it\nremains unclear whether this bias follows a static pattern (vigilance) or fluctuates between\nvigilance and avoidance. Second, methodological and theoretical concerns have been raised\nregarding the reliability of the dot-probe task in measuring threat-related attentional bias. The\npresent study aimed to test the hypothesis of a static early expression of attentional bias to\nthreat using both a classical dot-probe task and a novel eye-dot-probe task, in which responses\nwere made via ocular saccades. Additionally, we hypothesized that the relationship between\nattentional bias to threat and anxiety follows an exponential rather than linear trajectory. Non-\nclinical participants completed both tasks along with an anxiety questionnaire. Results\nshowed no consistent relationship between anxiety and either static or fluctuating attentional\nbias in the classical dot-probe task. However, in the eye-dot-probe task, an exponential\nrelationship emerged between anxiety and static attentional bias toward threat, with a\nsignificant bias observed in high-anxious individuals. These findings provide theoretical and\nmethodological insights, suggesting that early attentional bias toward threat is static, best\ncaptured using eye-movement responses, and follows a non-linear relationship with anxiety,\nemerging only beyond a critical threshold.",

Analysis of naming response times (RTs) showed that constraining contexts enable preplanning of both lexical-semantic and phonological representations (Experiment 1). Using a picture-word interference version of the same task (Experiment 2), we found that speakers preplan the phonological form of the whole word, however, only the subset of constraining trials with the shortest RTs indicated preplanning.

          "abstract": "Social video gaming has become an integral part of adolescent life, yet its impact on well-being remains unclear. This longitudinal study examines how social gaming relates to loneliness and depressive mood among adolescents, considering both within-person and between-person associations. Additionally, it explores the moderating roles of gender and age. Data were collected from a large sample of Czech adolescents across four waves, with social gaming assessed using an adapted version of the Social Interaction Potential Assessment (SIPA) tool. A random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was employed to distinguish stable between-person differences from within-person fluctuations over time. Findings revealed that while adolescents who generally played more social games reported higher loneliness at the between-person level, an increase in social gaming was associated with a decrease of loneliness at the within-person level. No direct link between social gaming and depressive mood was observed. Gender differences emerged, with social gaming reducing loneliness and depressive mood for boys but increasing both for girls at within-person level. Additionally, younger adolescents were more likely to increase social gaming in response to depressive mood, whereas older adolescents showed the opposite pattern. These results suggest that while social gaming may provide temporary relief from loneliness, particularly for boys, it may also reflect underlying vulnerabilities, especially for girls. The findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of social gaming’s role in adolescent well-being, considering individual differences in gender and age.",

          "abstract": "There are large differences across individuals in the ability to perceive foreign-accented speech, and the sources of this variability are poorly understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in auditory processing help drive variability in accented speech perception. We asked L1 English speakers to perceive prosodic features in Mandarin-accented English. Individuals who could precisely discriminate pitch and accurately remember melodic sequences, and who placed more emphasis on pitch information during prosodic categorization, were better able to perceive accented speech. Individuals with more musical training also demonstrated enhanced accented speech perception. Finally, we found that better accented speech perception was linked to more robust neural encoding of speech harmonics. These findings suggest that the precision of sound perception and robustness of memory for sound sequences are major factors driving variability in accented speech perception, and so auditory training could potentially help remediate poor perception of accented speech.",

          "abstract": "To perceive speech listeners must decide how to prioritize information from multiple acoustic dimensions. Over the course of language learning, individuals form stable perceptual strategies which reflect the strength of the statistical relationship between values along particular acoustic dimensions and linguistic categories. However, despite this underlying stability, listeners respond to evidence about shifts in the reliability of acoustic dimensions as cues to categorization, changing their strategies. Here we show that such changes are maximally efficient: listeners will adjust after hearing just a single stimulus in which the relationship between acoustic cues diverges from the expected pattern. Furthermore, these shifts in strategy vanish as quickly as they appear, lasting only a single trial before returning to baseline. Finally, we show that shifts in cue weighting are resistant to distraction, occurring equally when speech is presented in quiet versus in informational masking. Speech perception strategies, therefore, are characterized by short-term fluctuation and long-term stability.",

          "abstract": "Interactions with artificial agents (e.g. robots and avatars) are becoming increasingly commonplace. While research has established that user beliefs, or an artificial agent’s appearance, can shape social outcomes with artificial agents, little is known about how these factors interact. We used virtual reality (VR) with eye- and motion-tracking, to examine the extent to which people attend to and use an agent’s gaze in a collaborative task. Participants initiated and responded to joint attention bids using hand gestures, while coordination could be implicitly facilitated by attending to the agent’s eye gaze. However, this did not result in any behavioural differences. Participants persistently used these gaze cues, reflected in coordination accuracy, face-looking frequency, and reaction times. Participants who *believed* their partner was human, rather than an AI system, subjectively reported more gaze-following and positive social experiences. When the agent *looked* like a human, rather than a robot, participants looked less frequently at the eyes, responded faster, and reported more negative social experiences. Our data suggests that social AI systems are approached more like humans than computers, irrespective of explicit beliefs about their humanness. Furthermore, when the artificial agent appeared in a non-human form, believing that it was human- rather than AI-controlled improved subjective experiences, highlighting how beliefs about AI systems may shape subjective social outcomes. This suggests that disclosure around the true intentional stance of artificial agents (e.g., in online VR contexts) may be important for shaping subjective social outcomes.",

Across two samples collected in separate countries (UK and Germany; N = 658 and 972 respectively), a large number of male and female names were rated on multiple social traits, with mean trait ratings for each name then being entered into a Principal Components Analysis. In both samples, and for both male and female names, the same four component structure was found: these included components corresponding with valence/warmth, dominance/competence, age, and familiarity.

          "authors": "Alfio Ventura; Christopher Starke; Francesca Righetti; Nils Köbis",
          "abstract": "Loneliness is a pressing global health issue, yet traditional interventions often fall short due to scalability limitations and the individualized experiences of loneliness. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled synthetic relationships (SRs)—ongoing associations with AI companions designed to simulate human-like social bonds. SRs offer, among other aspects, constant availability, adaptability, and emotional responsiveness, which potentially address loneliness. However, their growing integration into social life raises critical psychological, ethical, and societal questions. This paper examines the opportunities and risks of SRs through the lens of relationship science, psychology, and AI companionship research. We first highlight how existing loneliness interventions face the challenges of availability, scalability, and personalization. We then outline how SRs present a novel alternative to overcoming these challenges. Drawing mainly on social penetration, attachment, and interdependence theory, we analyze how SRs may foster companionship, reduce social anxiety, and improve interpersonal skills, potentially mitigating loneliness. However, we also identify significant risks, including emotional over-reliance, distorted social expectations, and privacy concerns. The widespread adoption of SRs may reshape human-human relationships, altering norms of intimacy and social connection. To navigate these challenges, we outline a research agenda promoting interdisciplinary theory development longitudinal studies, drawing on representative samples to address the ethical concerns of SRs. We argue that SRs hold promise as a social intervention when ensuring they complement rather than replace human relationships. By integrating interdisciplinary insights, this paper provides a foundation for understanding and guiding the responsible design of SRs for addressing loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Rationale\n\nSince the earliest LSD research, psychedelics have been claimed to enhance autobiographical memory. Revisiting and processing autobiographical memories has further been suggested to be a major component of the therapeutic action of psychedelics. However, modern psychedelic research has largely neglected autobiographical elements of psychedelic experiences, and many vital questions remain unanswered.\n\nObjectives\n\nWe present and discuss six open questions related to psychedelics and autobiographical memory: 1. Do psychedelics enhance autobiographical recall? 2. Is recall and processing of significant autobiographical (e.g., traumatic) memories a common part of psychedelic experiences? 3. Do psychedelics promote the development of false or inaccurate memories? 4. How do autobiographical memories change if they are recalled and reconsolidated under the effects of psychedelics? 5. What are memories of psychedelic experiences like? 6. Are autobiographical experiences under psychedelics of particular importance for their therapeutic effects?\n\nResults\n\nWe present the background and current limited state of evidence for each question and provide suggestions on how future studies could best address them. \n\nConclusions\n\nBesides advancing basic research, answering these pressing questions is highly relevant for the possible therapeutic use of psychedelics, both in terms of developing and optimizing new interventions and for avoiding iatrogenic harms. Ideally, future psychedelic-assisted interventions could harness the possible synergies between the effects of psychedelics and existing memory-based therapies.\n\nKeywords: Psychedelics, autobiographical memory, LSD, psilocybin",

          "abstract": "Successful personalized treatment requires a thorough understanding of the complex dynamic processes underlying disorders. Intensive longitudinal methods (e.g., experience sampling) that ask patients to complete multiple-item questionnaires several times a day are ideally suited for this. However, collecting such data entails severe patient burden, especially for those with low energy and little concentration (e.g., patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue and/or psychological disorders such as Somatic Symptom Disorder). This burden is currently predominantly lightened with single-item measures, but these cannot validly capture complex conditions, leading to a catch-22 situation: Capturing complex dynamic processes and effective personalized treatment require intensive longitudinal patient data on multiple-item questionnaires, but patients cannot provide this type of data because it is too taxing. To solve this problem, we developed a personalized missingness design that presents an individualized and time-varying minimal subset of items on each occasion, thereby striking an optimal balance between thoroughly mapping patients’ symptoms and keeping the number of items a person needs to answer to a minimum. The design builds on multilevel factor analyses to determine which sets of items are most informative, which can change over time. Expert-informed simulations validated our new design. While the design can be universally applied to any measurement of (psychological) symptoms (e.g., to inform cognitive behavioral therapy), we tailored our simulations to patients suffering from Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue in collaboration with experts in Psycho-Oncology. In the near future, the design will be implemented in the widely used experience sampling app m-Path in collaboration with the developers.",

          "abstract": "Effort is a critical component of daily goal pursuit, both as the work invested in achieving a goal and as the subjective experience that accompanies it. While the roles of work and reward have been extensively studied in decision-making, relatively little is known about the influence of other cognitive and motor contributors when selecting between actions. Progress feedback, i.e., information on one’s progress towards a goal, has been suggested to be intrinsically valuable. In this pre-registered study, we tested whether people preferred physical work involving progress feedback, even when it was accompanied by more work. We further examined whether preference for progress feedback could be explained by lower perceived effort, improved effort exertion characteristics, or mental health factors. Participants (n=114) performed an online effort-based decision-making task, choosing between options with progress feedback (PF+) or with no progress feedback (PF-). We recorded continuous movements during effort exertion with mouse-tracking. Overall, participants preferred to receive progress feedback. Preference for progress was positively associated with social motivation, as measured using the Apathy Motivation Index, but not with traits previously linked to information seeking. At a group-level, participants did not rate PF+ trials as less effortful compared to PF-. Progress feedback did not improve effort exertion efficiency, as movements in PF+ were more variable and less smooth than movements in PF-. These results suggest that progress feedback is innately valuable despite its potential costs. The correlation with social motivation highlights a potential link to external validation, which warrants testing in future studies.",

It also showed that when division of labor does occur, men undertake more costly tasks than women. However, it is still unclear whether men always undertake high-cost tasks and women always avoid such tasks. Therefore, it was examined when men and women do and do not undertake a high-cost task. \n\nMethods \nUsing an online scenario experiment, 1247 participants from four countries were randomly assigned to one of two conditions (compete/choose) to determine whether participants differed in their likelihood of making a high-cost choice depending on the relationship with their imaginary opposite-sex partner. \n\nResults \nOverall, men were more likely than women to make a high-cost choice, and both men and women who participated in the compete condition (participant loved their imaginary opposite-sex partner) were more likely to make a high-cost choice than those who participated in the choose condition (participant was loved by their imaginary opposite-sex partner). In addition, all observed effects were consistent across the four countries. \n\nConclusion \nThe results of the current study support the mutual mate choice model in that women can be competitive to obtain a desirable mate, but also support the males-compete/females-choose model in that men overall have a greater tendency to compete for a potential mate.",

People vary in how they handle this uncertainty, with some experiencing greater discomfort in ambiguous situations. We propose that individuals with higher uncertainty avoidance process facial impressions in a more fine-grained manner, suggesting a specific cognitive strategy to manage this uncertainty. Across two studies, we found that both individuals (Study 1: N = 105) and cultures (Study 2: N = 10,552, 40 regions) with higher uncertainty avoidance formed more distinctly separated personality trait impressions from faces. The relationship between uncertainty avoidance and impression separation was mediated by the strength of trait concept dissociations that individuals held (Study 1). This tendency to separate different personality traits may help reduce the ambiguity of social judgments. Our findings reveal how even basic cognitive tendencies shape social perception at both individual and cultural levels.",

          "abstract": "In relationship science, researchers have generated a wide array of constructs and corresponding self-report measures to characterize, explain, and predict relationship quality – the foremost studied outcome in the field. Collectively, however, the boundaries among these variables remain unclear. In the current research, we examined the extent to which measures of relationship quality and other important relationship constructs are empirically separable from one another. Across two studies of US census-matched participants (total N = 3,439), we applied latent variable techniques (e.g., exploratory bifactor analysis) on broad pools of items representing various prominent relationship-specific constructs. Results revealed robust evidence that a single general factor Q (representing global relationship sentiment) accounts for a vast majority of common variance across distinct relationship measures. Thus, respondents appear to draw primarily on their overall global relationship evaluations when reporting on an array of presumably-distinct relationship facets. This is consistent with a ‘sentiment override’ perspective. Our findings provide novel empirical evidence for a relationship-specific response bias that challenges prevailing assumptions and practice in the field, including the widespread use of self-report methods to capture meaningful aspects of relationship functioning.",

          "abstract": "Flora et al. (1992) found that intense noise increased impulsive responses during a task in which college students chose between smaller-sooner (SS) and larger-later (LL) options to earn points exchangeable for money (SS – impulsive option; LL – self-control option). Furthermore, the removal of the aversive noise did not result in increments in LL responses, and vice versa (i.e., self-control preference continued when the noise was later introduced). Considering human physiological responses to pictures of human mutilation resemble those produced by aversive stimuli (e.g., heart rate changes), we explored if the disruptive effects of aversive stimuli on self-control behavior could be reproduced with images of mutilation. Matching-to-sample trials depicting the images of mutilation were interspersed between the choice trials with different probabilities (Random-Time 0 s, 20 s, and 30 s). A delay-discounting task was introduced before and after the choice task to obtain k and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, which were used to explore a relationship with performance during the choice task. A within-subjects design with 24 participants was implemented. Each probability of matching mutilation images was an experimental condition. Initial exposure to high probability of matching overall produced indifference (~ 50% LL responses). Proportion of LL responses increased when the probability of the images was reduced. Participants not initially exposed to the images developed preference for the self-control option and maintained it during subsequent conditions when probability of matching images changed. Delay-discounting measures were not related to performance during the choice task, possibly because of a magnitude effect (smaller reinforcers are discounted more steeply than larger reinforcers). Future studies must address the divergent results in this line of research, especially the fact that noise and visual stimulation produced mostly indifference, whereas cold water (Flora et al., 2003) is the only stimulus that has been shown to increase impulsive choice beyond indifference.",

          "abstract": "Decades of scholarship on gender have shown that women are judged to be more caring and more communal than men. Here we use multiple methods (N = 5,376) to test an intriguing claim entailed by this work: People think that women are morally superior to men. Using reverse-correlation methods, we show that mental representations of the face of “a morally good person” is a woman’s face. Next, using a novel profile-generation task, we find that people are more likely to ascribe more morally good traits to women than to men, both when they are spontaneously thinking of a woman (vs. a man) and when they are assigned to do so. Further, using a large database of 1,864 normed behaviors, we find that behaviors associated with moral goodness are also stereotyped as feminine. Finally, we use a novel impression updating task to explore a potential consequence of this phenomenon. Specifically, we find that immoral behavior is more diagnostic for women than men. As a result, equivalent moral transgressions lead to larger negative character updating for women than for men. In sum, these findings reveal that moral goodness is closely linked to gender concepts: people think women are morally superior to men.",

          "authors": "James B. Wyngaarden; Tania Giovannetti; Bart Krekelberg; David Victor Smith",
          "abstract": "Financial exploitation of older adults has become an increasingly urgent public health issue, with annual losses exceeding $10 billion in the US annually. This exploitation often stems from age-related cognitive deficits, such as impairments in working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are linked to deterioration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A critical yet understudied component of age-related cognitive decline is confirmation bias—the tendency to interpret new information in a way that conforms to one’s pre-existing beliefs. As older adults focus more on present-oriented goals related to social and emotional satisfaction, their ability to recognize and respond to exploitative situations may decrease. This problem worsens with the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, increasing vulnerability to fraud. Despite these links, little is known about how confirmation bias is associated with future cognitive decline and risk for fraud. Two main challenges impede progress: the lack of knowledge about the latent processes that shape confirmation bias in this population, and the reliance on correlations between brain responses and behavior that do not clarify causal mechanisms. To address these issues, this chapter provides an overview of confirmation bias and its connection to aging. It then addresses adverse effects of confirmation bias before highlighting strengths of noninvasive brain stimulation as a method of investigating these relationships further.",

          "abstract": "Of the 330 million residents of the United States, over 40 million were born abroad. Such individuals are routinely referred to using labels such as “alien,” “foreigner,” and “noncitizen.” In this multimethod project relying on data from 5,437 U.S. citizens in experimental studies and 193,649 U.S. citizens in archival studies, we examine implicit (automatic) evaluations of non-Americans in the United States, their effects on impression formation, and their ecological correlates in the form of real-life outcomes. In Studies 1A–1C, the labels “alien,” “foreigner,” and “noncitizen” were found to be highly and similarly implicitly negative. In Studies 2A–2D, applying these labels to specific individuals created immediate implicit negativity toward them, irrespective of their gender or race. Finally, pro-American/anti-foreigner implicit evaluations predicted anti-immigrant policy positions at the level of individuals (Study 3A), and a conceptually and statistically related implicit White–American/Asian–foreign implicit stereotype predicted anti-immigrant voting patterns in 18 relevant ballot initiatives at the level of U.S. counties (Study 3B). Across studies, implicit anti-foreigner bias generalized across participant demographics but was somewhat stronger among men and political conservatives. Together, this work highlights the cognitive underpinnings and real-world correlates of robust and pervasive anti-foreigner biases in the United States.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nThe recent increase in online health information-seeking prompted extensive user appraisal of encountered content. Information consumption depends crucially on the quality of encountered information and the user’s ability to evaluate it; yet, within the context of online, organic search behavior, few studies take into account both these aspects simultaneously.\n\nObjectives:\nWe aimed to explore a method to bridge these two aspects and grant even consideration to both the stimulus (webpage content) and the user (ability to appraise encountered content). We examined novices and experts in information retrieval and appraisal to demonstrate a novel approach to studying Information Foraging Theory: Stimulus-Engagement Alignment (SEA).\n\nMethods:\nWe sampled from experts and novices in information retrieval and assessment, asking participants to conduct a 10-minute search task with a specific information goal. We employed an observational and a retrospective think-aloud protocol to collect data within the framework of an interview. Data from three streams (think-aloud, human-computer interaction, and screen content) were manually coded in the ROCK standard and subsequently aligned and represented in a tabularized format with the R package {rock}. SEA scores were derived from designated code co-occurrences in specific segments of data within the stimulus data stream versus the think-aloud and human-computer interaction data streams. \n\nResults:\nSEA scores represented a meaningful comparison of what participants encountered and what they engaged with. Operationalizing codes as either “present” or “absent” in a particular data stream allowed us to inspect not only which credibility cues participants engaged with the most frequency, but also whether participants noticed the absence of cues. Code co-occurrence frequencies could thus indicate case-, time-, and context-sensitive information appraisal that also takes into account the quality of information encountered.\n\nDiscussion:\nEmploying SEA allowed us to retain epistemic access to idiosyncratic manifestations of both stimuli and engagement, but also, via utilizing the same coding scheme and designated co-occurrences across participants, be able to pinpoint trends within our sample and subsamples. We believe our approach lends a powerful analysis encompassing the breadth and depth of data, both on par with each other in the feat of understanding organic, online search behavior.",

          "abstract": "Co-rumination, defined as when individuals perseverate on problems with each other, focus excessively on negative feelings, and cyclically discuss the causes and consequences of problems, is often examined from the perspective of the person seeking support about a problem or by averaging both dyad members’ individual ratings of co-rumination. This approach muddles how each dyad member contributes to the “co” of co-rumination and may have implications for understanding prior work that has shown associations between co-rumination and intrapersonal and interpersonal well-being. We leveraged state space grids to examine co-rumination as a dyadic and dynamic system, as constituted by the temporal unfolding of each dyad member’s self-rated social rumination throughout their discussion. From 2019-2020, 85 primarily White and female college-aged close friend dyads engaged in a support discussion. After, friends viewed their recorded discussion and rated their individual contributions to the co-rumination process (i.e., social rumination) every 30 seconds across the eight-minute conversation. Results revealed that the more both dyad members got “stuck” engaging in mutually high social rumination (i.e., co-rumination), the more they perceived each other as responsive and supportive and viewed the problem as more solved. In contrast, the more that only the person disclosing the problem was stuck in high levels of social rumination or when dyads more flexibly engaged in social rumination, the more individuals with the problem benefited from the conversation, but responders benefited less. Examining co-rumination dyadically and dynamically can reveal when and for whom co-rumination processes are associated with costs and benefits.",

          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1) before and after non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and perceived groove. Following stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the left SMA may have disinhibited either the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions themselves. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA plays a critical role in embodied rhythm processing.",

We propose a distracted-from-doing-good hypothesis: compared with distraction-free environments, distracting environments lead people to rely more on the default options, particularly self-serving ones. In a preregistered experiment, participants made repeated allocation decisions involving monetary trade-offs between personal gain and charity donations. We manipulated the default type (prosocial vs. self-serving), the presence (vs. absence) of distractions and measured individual differences in mind wandering and social value orientation. Results did not support the hypothesis but offered valuable insights: On average, participants were more likely than chance to accept prosocial defaults, and they accept more prosocial than self-serving defaults. We found evidence that some individuals use self-serving defaults to justify selfish decisions, particularly those with a prosocial orientation. Interestingly, the aggregate effects were driven by 60 percent of participants; the remaining 40 percent were uninfluenced by defaults, acting according to their social preferences. Individual differences in mind wandering—how easily one is distracted—further moderate the default effects. We discuss how the results inform our understanding of prosocial behaviors in combination with individual heterogeneity and how defaults are a good tool to promote overall prosociality.",

However, substantial barriers impede engagement in traditional forms of these interventions. Innovations in mobile health offer an avenue for overcoming barriers associated with traditional MBIs. This paper examines the potential of a particular mobile health innovation – Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) – as a strategy to enhance the accessibility, acceptability, and efficacy of MBIs. Methods: We discuss the historical context, conceptual foundations, motivation for adoption, and empirical evidence supporting the potential of EMIs. Additionally, we explore the conceptual intersections between EMIs and both traditional contemplative sources and contemporary secular MBIs. Furthermore, we describe empirical studies integrating EMIs into MBIs (i.e., meditation-based [MB]-EMIs). Results: Studies have demonstrated diverse approaches to integrating EMIs into MBIs. These studies exhibit variability in key dimensions, including the MBI with which the EMI is integrated and the characteristics of the EMI itself. MB-EMIs have therapeutic potential, but there are many important scientific questions about them that have not yet been answered. Discussion: Future studies should continue to examine the impact and safety of meditation-based EMIs, leverage innovations in passive data collection, explore user experiences, develop these interventions for and with marginalized populations, and emphasize informal meditation practice.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

However, international students tend to underutilize and benefit less from traditional mental health services compared to their domestic counterparts.

Methods: We explore the definition, types, and efficacy of DMHIs. We outline the unique promise of these interventions in reducing barriers to health service access encountered by international students. To illustrate these points, we discuss example studies of DMHIs for international students. Results: Recent studies have supported the potential benefits of DMHIs for improving international students’ psychological distress, well-being, and help-seeking outcomes. However, many scientific questions remain unsolved. Discussion: To optimize the potential of these interventions for international students, researchers should conduct well-powered randomized controlled trials, examine correlates of intervention use, design single-session interventions, co-develop interventions with the international student community, integrate interventions within the larger system, incorporate ecological momentary assessment and digital phenotyping, and leverage immersive and interactive digital technology.",

          "abstract": "The UK education system is failing to meet need, leading to an attendance and school anxiety crisis. However, the system faults those disproportionately and most visibly struggling - namely Neurodivergent and SEND learners - as outliers instead of warning signs. Only through acknowledgement of systemic internal mechanisms can the complexity and scope of the education crisis be addressed. In this commentary, we explore school anxiety through the underlying systemic mechanisms within neuro-normativity, epistemic injustice, and consequent affordances. Specifically, we argue that the rigid adherence to neuro-normative academic standards inherently fosters a loss of inclusivity and poor teacher knowledge and attitudes. Student camouflaging, or behavioural changes aimed at minimising overt Neurodivergent characteristics, may, thus, arise to navigate neuro-normativity, exacerbating school anxiety.

          "authors": "Chenyu Li; Gidon T. Frischkorn; Klaus Oberauer",
          "abstract": "Filtering is a cognitive mechanism that regulates how information is encoded into working memory. It minimizes the retention of irrelevant information while facilitating the maintenance of task-relevant information. While prior studies have examined the filtering of task-irrelevant distractors, it remains unclear whether information that needs to be briefly processed—but not maintained—can be partially filtered out. To address this, we developed a novel complex-span task involving three conditions: a pre-cue condition, where stimuli are identified as memory items or distractors before they are processed thus allowing for filtering; a retro-cue condition, where this information is given only after processing, preventing filtering; and a control condition without distractors. Across three experiments, memory performance in the pre-cue condition was comparable to the retro-cue condition but worse than the control condition. Additionally, using the Memory Measurement Model (Oberauer &amp; Lewandowsky, 2019), we estimated the memory strength of distractors and found the same strength of distractors retained in working memory in both pre- and retro-cue conditions. These findings suggest that information requiring processing cannot be selectively filtered out during encoding into working memory.",

          "abstract": "The UK education system is failing to meet need, leading to an attendance and school anxiety crisis. However, the system faults those disproportionately and most visibly struggling - namely Neurodivergent and SEND learners - as outliers instead of warning signs. Only through acknowledgement of systemic internal mechanisms can the complexity and scope of the education crisis be addressed. In this commentary, we explore school anxiety through the underlying systemic mechanisms within neuro-normativity, epistemic injustice, and consequent affordances. Specifically, we argue that the rigid adherence to neuro-normative academic standards inherently fosters a loss of inclusivity and poor teacher knowledge and attitudes. Student camouflaging, or behavioural changes aimed at minimising overt Neurodivergent characteristics, may, thus, arise to navigate neuro-normativity, exacerbating school anxiety. Ultimately, this piece advocates for a paradigm shift away from pathologizing a context-driven problem as inherent to neurodivergence, and instead calls for recognising ‘school anxiety’, and other educational consequences, as signals of a deeper systemic issue.",

Yet, it is to date unclear how precisely relevant factors are shaping referential choice and which of these are most important during discourse production across languages. Using computational modeling on a naturalistic corpus of spoken narratives across 16 diverse languages, we systematically investigated the predictability of 16 functional factors on referential choice. We moreover used a novel technique from explainable artificial intelligence to get precise insights into the decision making processes of our models, in order to draw inferences on the precise relationship of the factors with referential choice. We show that 1) referential choice is multifactorial, 2) anaphoric distance, referent salience in local discourse, and syntactic function a referent is allocated to, are most predictive of referential form, 3) many other factors discussed prominently in the literature, like referent competition, topic persistence or the presence of agreement, have little to no predictive power, 4) and that these factors are generally shared across languages, with large differences across languages mostly pertaining to idiosyncratic properties of languages, such as word order or the expression of nominal number. Our study is the first large-scale study of referential choice across diverse languages using naturalistic corpus data.",

In two experiments (N = 187), participants interacted with members of two groups in an interactive social decision task. Prior to the task, participants were exposed to positive or negative group stereotypes that were moral or nonmoral in content. Although players from each group were, on average, equally likely to provide reward feedback, participants formed choice preferences for players from positively-stereotyped over negatively-stereotyped groups. Importantly, this effect was stronger and more resistant to change when stereotypes contained moral content. Computational modeling indicated that moral stereotypes induced more extreme initial reward expectancies and influenced how reward associations were updated over time. Additionally, moral stereotypes generalized more strongly to subsequent evaluations of novel group members, suggesting that the biasing effect of moral stereotypes on learning contributed to group-level prejudice.",

          "abstract": "We have recently found that during naturalistic encoding (freely viewing images without knowing a memory test will follow) bigger images are remembered 1.5 times better than smaller images. These results supported our hypothesis that larger images recruit more visual system processing resources from earliest processing stages, and this leads to higher quality signals transferred downstream to higher visual- and memory-related areas resulting in better memory. It is unclear, however, if these results represent naturalistic vision outside the lab. Here in a more naturalistic-like and less-controlled online experiment (n=132) we successfully replicated our lab-based findings and consistently found that larger images were remembered more than 1.7 times better than smaller images. Our replication (performed on desktops and laptops) provides stronger evidence that bigger images are better remembered in more naturalistic-like environments outside the lab. These results provide initial insights on how visual physical salience affects cognitive performance during everyday visual behavior. Given the enormous increase in usage of handheld devices for multiple everyday purposes as communications with practitioners and education it is valuable to investigate in future studies how visual physical salience transferred through such communication channels influences perception, comprehension, learning, and memory.",

          "abstract": "The capacity for voluntary action is a distinctive feature of human minds. However, experimental studies of volition struggled to capture defining features of human voluntariness. Here we developed a competitive game which incentivised participants to innovate their action choices to find the right time to avoid a collision with an opponent who predicted the timing of the participant’s action choice. One group of participants received explicit information about the competitor’s action-selection rules, while a second group had no information about the competitor. Both groups showed increased behavioural stochasticity when adapting to a competitor who punished participant’s choice biases. However, the group who had no explicit information generated their action choices in a way that avoided the action that the competitor was likely to take. In contrast, the group who explicitly knew the competitor’s action-selection rules avoided the same action they took in preceding trials so that the competitor could not easily exploit the participant’s behavioural patterns. These findings suggest that people can develop beliefs about other agents in the social environment within which they work, and can adapt voluntary action choices accordingly. However, explicit explanations about the other agent facilitate model-based planning in the voluntary generation of novel action patterns.",

This is a well-replicated effect, demonstrated across a wide variety of task factors and age groups. However, it is not clear if individuals with symptoms of ADHD are able to do this effectively, as there is some evidence this group struggle to allocate attention in working memory tasks. Two experiments were conducted online to investigate this. Participants were presented with series of four coloured shapes, and asked to report the colour of each shape in a counterbalanced order following a brief delay. In some trials (equal value condition), all shapes were equally valuable with the correct recall of each shape gaining the participant 2 points. In other trials (differential value condition), the first item presented during the encoding phase was more valuable than the rest (5 point for the first item vs 1 point for the other items). Trial-by-trial feedback was either provided (Experiment 1) or omitted (Experiment 2). Across both experiments, there was a clear prioritization effect at the first (targeted) serial position, with higher accuracy in the differential value condition relative to the equal value condition. There were also clear costs at some of the less valuable serial positions. These effects did not differ as a function of ADHD symptoms. There were also no significant correlations between scores on the Adult ADHD Self-Report Screener and the prioritization effects. Taken together, this demonstrates that the ability to prioritize particularly valuable information in working memory is not impaired in individuals with symptoms of ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Joint attention is a pivotal mechanism of human social cognition. Traditionally, joint attention has been experimentally investigated by means of the gaze cueing task in screen-based settings. Recently, the gaze cueing task has been implemented in more naturalistic and interactive settings with the embodied iCub robot, allowing for the investigation of concurrent factors influencing joint attention. Previous studies found that a communicative gaze before the gaze cue (i.e., mutual or avoiding gaze with the participants) influenced the subsequent joint attention by eliciting the gaze-cueing effect only in the mutual gaze condition. In the present work, we first manipulated the attribution of the intentional stance toward the robot by letting participants share a familiar context. Subsequent to this shared experience, we integrated the gaze-cueing paradigm with the iCub robot, such that the robot cued participants’ attention after establishing either mutual or avoiding gaze with them. In contrast to previous studies where the adoption of the intentional stance was not manipulated, our current results show that when the robot was perceived as an intentional agent, a gaze-cueing effect was present for both mutual and avoiding gaze, thereby suggesting that participants might have interpreted both gaze conditions as intentional (and, thus as communicative signals).",

Eye contact and repeated averted gaze shifts are key cues for gaze-based communication and joint attention, but it remains unclear how the temporal and perceptual dynamics of these gaze cues combine to signal an interlocutor's intention to communicate. This study examines three key perceptual properties of dynamic eye gaze displays, and the extent to which they influence the perception of communicative intent. Both autistic (n = 126) and non-autistic (n = 118) participants completed a semi-interactive task with an on-screen agent that displayed dynamic eye movements on each trial searching for a target among three objects. Participants had to decide whether the agent was privately inspecting the objects or requesting the participant to ‘give’ them one of the blocks (i.e., attempting to communicate). Across trials, we manipulated whether the agent displayed eye contact and made repeated averted gaze shifts at the same object and the duration of gaze displays. We measured the frequency of ‘give’ responses (indexing perceived communicative intent) and reaction times (indexing response certainty). Participants were most likely to perceive communicative intent when the agent displayed eye contact and repeated averted gaze shifts. Gaze duration was a less potent signal of communicative intent. However, longer gaze durations increased perceptions of communicative intent in the absence of eye contact and repeated averted gaze displays. Autistic and non-autistic participants exhibited similar overall patterns, challenging the traditional view of autism as a condition in which people have a reduced tendency to understand the social meaning of gaze cues.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the semantic depth of grammatical number in Ukrainian through a distributional semantic approach. In Ukrainian, the number category is considered a morphological category with a semantic dominance (Vykhovanecj, 2004). This view suggests that some forms are semantically motivated, while others express number only formally. By utilizing the semantically annotated General Regionally Annotated Corpus of Ukrainian (GRAC) and word embeddings from the TenTen Corpus for Ukrainian, this research analyzes the distributional representations of grammatical number to uncover its semantic nuances. The observed patterns in the usage of singular and plural forms in Ukrainian nouns align with the heterogenity of the number category. As such, the distribution of singular and plural forms does not strictly follow grammatical patterns. Instead, semantic factors play a significant role in determining the choice between singular and plural forms in Ukrainian nouns. In Ukrainian, a language with a rich morphological system, the semantics of grammatical number extends beyond simple quantification, touching on nuances of meaning, cultural usage, and syntactic dependencies.",

We also examined music-training effects on musical abilities, motor skills (fine and gross), broader socioemotional functioning, and cognitive abilities including nonverbal reasoning, executive functions, and auditory memory (short-term and working memory). Study 1 (N = 110) was a 2-year longitudinal intervention conducted in a naturalistic school setting, comparing music training to basketball training (active control) and no training (passive control). Music training improved fine-motor skills and auditory memory relative to controls, but it had no effect on emotion recognition or other cognitive and socioemotional abilities. Both music and basketball training improved gross-motor skills. Study 2 (N = 192) compared children without music training to peers attending a music school. Although music training correlated with better emotion recognition in speech prosody (tone of voice), this association disappeared after controlling for socioeconomic status, musical abilities, or short-term memory. In contrast, musical abilities correlated with emotion recognition in both prosody and faces, independently of training or other confounding variables. These findings suggest that music training enhances fine-motor skills and auditory memory, but it does not causally improve emotion recognition, cognitive abilities, or socioemotional functioning. Observed advantages in emotion recognition likely stem from preexisting musical abilities and other confounding factors such as socioeconomic status.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual content is integrated as it unfolds in real-time within temporal windows. Understanding the dynamics of temporal integration requires understanding influences by an ongoing temporal context. Towards this goal, we developed a novel paradigm of temporal integration where two halves of a Kanizsa square are integrated together (seen as a full square) or segregated (not seen as a full square) as a function of temporal gap between them. The two halves are embedded within a preceding and succeeding context of rotating Kanizsa discs leading up to and trailing away from them. We wanted to investigate whether integration is subject to frames of interest or whether the dynamics of the context influence form-part integration. Through three experiments, we manipulated the nature of the rotation: (1) the context being temporally correlated or random in Experiment 1, (2) variance of the temporally correlated context in Experiment 2, and (3) mean of the temporally correlated context in Experiment 3. Our results showed that the sensitivity of seeing an integrated square was better when the context aided anticipation of the target frames, the effect being selective at different ISIs depending on the properties of the context. We interpret these results in the light of a probabilistic view of temporal windows of integration. Our results provide evidence for an inherent adaptiveness in the extent or window of temporal integration. The results also reinforce the general account of extended temporal processing and iterative updating and inform rough timescales of context effects on this process.",

The social bonding hypothesis proposes that these phenomena may be interlinked: musicality may have facilitated the evolution of social bonding beyond the possibilities of spoken language. Although dozens of experimental studies have argued that synchronised rhythms can promote bonding, methodological issues including publication bias, sample bias, experimenter effects, and appropriateness of experimental controls make it unclear whether synchronous singing reliably and generally enhances bonding relative to speaking. Here, we propose a Registered Report to overcome these issues through a global experiment in diverse languages aiming to collect data from 1800 participants across 60 sites. The social bonding hypothesis predicts that bonding will increase more after synchronous singing than after spoken (sequential) conversation or (simultaneous) recitation, while alternative hypotheses predict that song will not increase bonding relative to speech. Regardless of outcome, these results will provide an unprecedented understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music, speech, and sociality.",

          "authors": "Berthine Ommensen; Kate Sofronoff; Tony Attwood; Nancy A. Pachana",
          "abstract": "Background\nMuch of the research on autistic ageing is framed by what is known about the developmental trajectory of autism throughout childhood and into middle age. There is also the risk that common negative stereotypes about ageing distract from exploring the potential for developmental gains in later life such as those seen in the non-autistic population and some other conditions. The research presented here is part of a broader body of work aimed at addressing these gaps. To do this we explored older autistic adults’ experiences of social and emotional changes over the lifespan and their concerns for the future.\nMethods\nIn semi-structured one-on-one interviews we explored changes in social and emotional functioning over the lifespan and into later life and concerns for the future from the perspectives of six male and four female older autistic adults (Mage = 63.30 years; age range 53-74 years). Using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted an iterative process of analysis and interpretation to identify and organise patterns and connections in the data into representative themes. \nResults\nParticipant interviews revealed a bittersweet but nonetheless positive outlook on life. Sub-themes of independence and autonomy, awareness and acceptance, positive reframing, family focus and humour supported an overarching theme of poignancy and positivity.\nConclusions\nParticipants’ positive outlook on life suggests the potential for developmental gains in autistic later life that parallel similar patterns in the general population. In the context of evidence from gerontological studies of social and emotional ageing, this work challenges existing negative expectations and stereotypes about old age and suggests opportunities to reframe future autism research and clinical practice to promote successful and healthy autistic ageing.",

          "authors": "LITING SONG",
          "abstract": "Background: Hue, saturation, and brightness are critical dimensions of color perception, and art students may experience color-related emotions differently from non-art students due to either their specialized training or innate artistic sensitivity. Despite this intriguing possibility, limited research has systematically examined these differences. This study aims to investigate how art and non-art students perceive and emotionally evaluate different colors.\nMethods: Using a questionnaire-based approach, participants rated the emotional valence of colors on a 7-point semantic differential scale, ranging from very negative to very positive. The colors were carefully selected from Munsell's color system, which enabled precise manipulation of hue, brightness, and saturation levels. The study included 36 art students and 36 non-art students, who evaluated colors under controlled experimental conditions.\nResults: The findings indicate that brightness and saturation significantly influence emotional responses to colors. Warmer colors, such as orange, elicited more positive emotional evaluations, whereas cooler colors, such as blue, received less positive ratings. Notably, art students differed from non-art students in their emotional responses, with the former group showing distinct sensitivity to variations in color dimensions.\nConclusion: This study highlights that art training shapes emotional color perception, as evidenced by the differing evaluations of art and non-art students. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how artistic training influences the emotional experience of color and underscore the role of education in enhancing perceptual and emotional sensitivity to visual stimuli.",

          "authors": "Thomas DW Wilcockson; Melody Pattison; Ahmet Begde",
          "abstract": "Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary size, lexical diversity, word class distribution) before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total word count increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett's formal diagnosis. These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.",

          "abstract": "Often the only source of information for learning a new word is its surrounding language context. For example, even if one has never seen a rambutan, it is possible to learn that “rambutan” is a kind of fruit just from hearing “I like sweet, juicy rambutans”. What processes unfold in the moment upon encountering a new word in context that lead to successful word learning? We conducted three experiments to evaluate the role of working memory, which may be critical for linking a new word to the meaning implied by its surrounding language context. In each experiment, we assessed word learning from sentences in which new words occurred either before or after an informative context. In Experiment 1, we tracked gaze during reading to gain insight into the real-time processing of the surrounding language context and the new word. Results highlighted the importance of working memory resources for holding the language context in mind while processing the new word, regardless of which was encountered first. Experiment 2 replicated the importance of working memory resources for learning new words heard in fluent speech, and Experiment 3 replicated this finding while controlling for overall engagement measured from performance on an unrelated task. Together, these findings support the conclusion that successful word learning from context depends on maintaining the context in working memory while linking it to a new word.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the psychosocial and community risk factors associated with financial exploitation is essential in developing prevention strategies. Although previous work has identified factors related to increased risk such as poor financial literacy, cognitive decline, and worse mental health, less is known about social factors, particularly those tied to our community and how they interact with our ability to form meaningful relationships. To investigate this issue, we used a previously published national sample of U.S. adults aged 20 to 94 (N = 886). We used self-reported zip code data coupled with the US Census data to reconstruct community-level indicators of social cohesion (i.e., neighborhood disorder, neighborhood disadvantage, residential instability). We found that reduced community-level social cohesion was associated with increased risk for financial exploitation. In addition, our exploratory analyses indicated that community-level indicators of social cohesion also moderated the association between subjective cognitive decline and risk of financial exploitation. Specifically, individuals with higher levels of subjective cognitive decline residing in areas with low residential instability appeared to have lower risk of financial exploitation. These results highlight how community-level factors contribute to risk for financial exploitation, which may provide a foundation for future work aimed at improving prevention strategies and public policy.",

          "abstract": "In the last decade trust in news sources has fallen globally, reflecting increasing public concern about misinformation. Inoculation theory is a pre-emptive cognitive approach to fighting misinformation, which in recent years has been a foundational theory for several serious games. While many game-based interventions have been found to be efficacious, there is a lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms which make them work. This review critically engages with the current state of gamified interventions for misinformation, identifies gaps in game design and research, and investigates the relationship between inoculation theory and game design. We find that homogeneity in design has left some areas of game design underexplored, and discussion surrounding game design decisions – particularly the integration of inoculation theory components – is often superficial. We call for deeper exploration of game design and the integration of inoculation theory components, proposing a hypothetical model of inoculation theory in gamified contexts.",

          "authors": "Connor Spiech; Mario Gómez Martínez; Giorgio Lazzari; Virginia Penhune",
          "abstract": "The pleasurable urge to move to music (“groove”) has been shown to be greatest for moderately complex musical rhythms. This is thought to occur because temporal predictions from the motor system reinforce our perception of the beat when there is a balance between expectation and surprise. The supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the potential origin of these temporal predictions. Thus, to causally test the role of the SMA in the experience of groove, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt activity in this region or an active control site (V1) before and after non-musicians listened to and rated musical clips that varied in rhythmic complexity and perceived groove. Following stimulation over left SMA, participants preferred moving to music with higher rhythmic complexity while after V1 stimulation, they preferred moving to music with lower rhythmic complexity. Pleasure ratings, however, were unaffected. These results suggest that the SMA weighs the precision of beat-based predictions generated by the dorsal auditory stream. Therefore, stimulating the left SMA may have disinhibited either the dorsal striatum or other nodes generating the beat-based predictions themselves. In summary, these findings provide causal evidence that the SMA plays a critical role in embodied rhythm processing.",

Using multilevel response surface analysis and ecological momentary assessment, we investigated relations between congruence of perceived affect and self-reported empathy during social interactions in a large sample of adults (N=526; total interactions=21,521; median=38 interactions per person). Data were collected in spring 2023. We found that while self-reported empathy is generally higher when there is congruence of perceived affect, empathy is highest when there is congruence in high positive affect.

          "authors": "Vladimir Chituc",
          "abstract": "A recent article by Zheng and Meister [Neuron, 113(2), 192–204. (2025)] reveals what seems to be a surprising constraint on the capacity for the human mind to process information: a limit of 10 bits/s. In this short response, I aim to reconcile the compelling evidence presented by Zheng and Meister, with the no-less compelling demands of common sense: how could our minds possibly be that slow? My answer is twofold. First, this regularity is only counterintuitive insofar as we understand this throughput (as quantified by Shannon’s entropy, a theoretical construct describing un- certainty reduction in terms of the minimum amount of information required to encode some message) in comparison to everyday data transmission (as quantified by the literal number of bits being sent over some information channel). This claim becomes immediately more plausible when explicitly framed in the context of information theory. Second, this regularity is in fact more general than Zheng and Meister contend, since I demonstrate qualitatively similar (if not identical) throughputs in even the most advanced AI models (which I calculated using the same procedure Zheng and Meister applied to the throughput of human behavior). Even more, I report a striking convergence: the performance of machine intelligence (either in terms of success in competitive games or benchmark performance in Large Language Models) reliably improves as it approaches 10 bits/s, whether that means speeding up or slowing down. Though speculative, I believe this unexpected convergence raises an exciting theoretical possibility: the apparent constraint of 10 bits/s is not as much a speed limit as it is a solution to an optimization problem, involving e.g. the inherent tension between seeking new information (exploring) and pursuing a known reward (exploiting). I finally contextualize this finding in relation to one of the most widely known (but least well-understood) papers in the history of psychological science.",

However, its comparability to traditional computerized methods remains unclear. This study investigates the convergent validity, user experience, and usability of VR-based versus PC-based assessments of short-term and working memory, and psychomotor skills, while also examining how demographic and IT-related skills influence performance in both modalities.\nMethods: Sixty-six participants performed the Digit Span Task (DST), Corsi Block Task (CBT), and Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Task (DLRTT) in both VR- and PC-based formats. Participants’ experience in using computers and smartphones, and playing videogames, was considered. User experience and system usability of the formats were also evaluated.\nResults: While performance on DST was similar across modalities, PC assessments enabled better performance on CBT and faster reaction times in DLRTT. Moderate-to-strong correlations between VR and PC versions supported convergent validity. Regression analyses revealed that performance on PC versions was influenced by age, computing, and gaming experience, whereas performance on VR versions was largely independent of these factors, except for gaming experience predicting performance on CBT backward recall. Moreover, VR assessments received higher ratings for user experience and usability than PC-based assessments.\nConclusion: Immersive VR assessments provide an engaging alternative to traditional computerized methods, with minimal reliance on prior IT experience and demographic factors. This resilience to individual differences suggests that VR may offer a more equitable and accessible platform for cognitive assessment. Future research should explore the long-term reliability of VR-based assessments.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis:\nLanguage impairments are core symptoms of both schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders and have been linked to deficits in predictive language processing. While altered use of semantic predictions have been reported in both disorders, little is known whether semantic predictions are stable over time. We therefore investigated the temporal stability of semantic predictions in individuals with schizotypal and autistic traits.\n\nStudy Design:\n115 participants, assessed for schizotypal and autistic traits, completed an auditory stability paradigm across two time points. In the first session, participants listened to 240 sentence beginnings varying in predictability (e.g., low: “The swimmer jumped into the…”; high: “The child hid the toy under the…”) and provided a prediction for each sentence final word. In the follow-up sessions, 240 new sentences were intermixed. In addition to final-word predictions, sentence and prediction recall were assessed to examine the influence of memory on prediction stability.\n\nStudy Results:\nGeneralized linear mixed models revealed that higher predictability led to greater temporal stability of semantic predictions. Importantly, increasing schizotypal and autistic traits were associated with reduced stability, particularly in highly predictable contexts where stable predictions typically facilitate efficient language processing. While poorer sentence recall was linked to greater instability, especially in medium- and low-predictability contexts, it did not account for the reduced stability observed in relation to schizotypal and autistic traits. \n\nConclusions:\nThese findings suggest that individuals with higher schizotypal and autistic traits struggle to form stable, lasting semantic predictions, which may contribute to difficulties in efficient language processing.\n\nKey words: Language Processing, Predictive Processing, SSD, ASD",

Both Crisis and Action framing (and negative and positive emotions, respectively) motivated reading and sharing, relative to the unaltered headlines.

What are the psycho-social implications of this? Do people value human contact, and do they value it more when perceived as scarce, effectively turning it into a luxury good? We tested these questions in four pre-registered online studies (N=3521), using hypothetical scenarios encompassing four different domains (education, finance, mental health, and fitness) and a willingness to pay task, where we asked participants how much they were willing to pay for a service, offered either with human contact (e.g., a financial advisor), or fully digital (e.g., an app for financial advice). We found that services offering human contact are valued more than their digital equivalent, and people on higher income are willing to pay more for them, but not for digital; crucially, nudging people to perceive human contact as scarce increased its value, in that people were willing to pay more for it and considered it more important in most of the domains. The results were replicated within a UK and Italian sample, and could not be explained by differences in digital skills and accessibility.

          "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs are widely considered resistant to factual correction, yet recent research shows that relatively brief, personalized “debunking” dialogues with a generative AI model can substantially reduce such beliefs. To identify the mechanisms driving this effect, we conducted an experiment spanning eight treatment arms that varied key features of participants’ interactions with GPT-4 during such debunking dialogues (N = 1,297). The debunking effect proved robust across most manipulations—including whether participants were explicitly told the AI aimed to change their minds, were asked to debate the AI, or whether the AI offered them factual information without otherwise seeking to persuade or was concise in its exposition. The only condition that undermined the debunking effect was prompting the AI to persuade participants without presenting any counterevidence, which yielded a null effect. Furthermore, analyses of the AI’s persuasive strategies identified reasoning-based tactics as the sole significant mediator of belief change. Participants who reported feeling persuaded overwhelmingly cited the AI’s rational, evidence-focused approach. Finally, participants higher in actively open-minded thinking showed larger treatment effects. These findings suggest that AI-driven interventions reduce conspiracy beliefs principally by providing factual, targeted counterarguments that address the specific reasons people hold these beliefs.",

          "authors": "Niclas Kaiser; Lovisa Blomdahl; My Lögdahl",
          "abstract": "Understanding meaningful interpersonal moments in therapy and daily life remains a challenge for neuroscience. Various overlapping concepts—such as moments of meeting, mutuality, social closeness, intersubjectivity, and social connectedness—seek to capture the unique experience of interpresence, a shared psychological here and now. While these concepts are well-recognized, they have been difficult to study scientifically. Recent methodological advancements, including the 4E/MoBI framework and the ConNECT approach, provide new avenues for empirical investigation. A key question is how therapeutically informed practices can be applied in cross-disciplinary studies to explore experientially enhanced relational processes. This study examines the feasibility of studying therapeutic interventions in a laboratory setting by investigating experiences in therapist-therapist dyads engaging in Moment-to-Moment Tracking, a method designed to foster psychological closeness. Thematic analysis of participant experiences revealed that authenticity was largely preserved despite laboratory constraints. While factors such as the presence of fNIRS equipment and observational pressures influenced engagement, participants reported experiencing genuine moments of connection. These findings suggest that therapeutic interventions can be effectively studied in laboratory environments, opening new possibilities for neuroscientific research on interpersonal processes.",

          "abstract": "Implicit biases are stereotypes and attitudes that influence decisions and actions, contributing to discrimination and societal inequities. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the most widely used tool for measuring implicit bias, assessing response time in sorting stimuli into labeled categories. Most interpretations assume that IAT performance (D-scores) reflects conflicting associative memories or decision ease. We challenged this assumption by decomposing D-scores into additional cognitive processes that may influence results, particularly response caution—the tendency to trade speed for accuracy. Using Racing Diffusion Models across 39 topics (N = 115,601), we found that response caution explained significantly more variance in D-scores beyond decision ease. Response caution also best predicted explicitly reported biases. These findings challenge the traditional interpretation of D-scores as primarily reflecting associative memory activation and highlight the need to consider multiple cognitive processes when assessing implicit biases.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Immersive virtual reality (VR) enhances ecologically validity and facilitates intuitive and ergonomic hand interactions for performing neuropsychological assessments. However, its comparability to traditional computerized methods remains unclear. This study investigates the convergent validity, user experience, and usability of VR-based versus PC-based assessments of short-term and working memory, and psychomotor skills, while also examining how demographic and IT-related skills influence performance in both modalities.\nMethods: Sixty-six participants performed the Digit Span Task (DST), Corsi Block Task (CBT), and Deary-Liewald Reaction Time Task (DLRTT) in both VR- and PC-based formats. Participants’ experience in using computers and smartphones, and playing videogames, was considered. User experience and system usability of the formats were also evaluated.\nResults: While performance on DST was similar across modalities, PC assessments enabled better performance on CBT and faster reaction times in DLRTT. Moderate-to-strong correlations between VR and PC versions supported convergent validity. Regression analyses revealed that performance on PC versions was influenced by age, computing, and gaming experience, whereas performance on VR versions was largely independent of these factors, except for gaming experience predicting performance on CBT backward recall. Moreover, VR assessments received higher ratings for user experience and usability than PC-based assessments.\nConclusion: Immersive VR assessments provide an engaging alternative to traditional computerized methods, with minimal reliance on prior IT experience and demographic factors. This resilience to individual differences suggests that VR may offer a more equitable and accessible platform for cognitive assessment. Future research should explore the long-term reliability of VR-based assessments.",

          "authors": "Angelia Caparco; Genaro Lopez-Martin; Alejandro Galvez-Pol",
          "abstract": "Research on the interaction between interoception and external sensory processing has expanded rapidly, particularly in how stimulus processing is influenced by concurrent cardiac phases (systole and diastole). However, definitions of these phases vary widely. Some studies follow biomedical conventions, defining systole as the period from the R-peak to the end of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG), with diastole encompassing the remainder of the cycle. Others adopt a time-based heuristic approach, defining systole based on the estimated arrival of afferent cardiac signals in the brain. This approach assumes that baroreceptor activity plays a key role in cognition, though conclusive evidence for this is lacking. This variability leads to inconsistencies, where systole in one study may correspond partly or entirely to diastole in another. To address this, we first review studies examining how cardiac phases modulate stimulus perception. Second, we highlight methodological inconsistencies in defining cardiac phases, particularly in time-based heuristic approaches. Third, we discuss additional sources of variability, such as differences in recording equipment and measures of interoceptive ability. Rather than focusing on specific findings, we highlight broader challenges in replicability and interpretation. Additionally, we introduce the HEARTS framework, a set of guidelines for standardising methodologies in interoception research. This consists of six recommendations: Harmonizing physiological terms across fields, Establishing clear nomenclature, Avoiding selective reporting, Refining mechanistic understanding, Tailoring methods for precision, and Standardizing study comparability. Implementing these recommendations can improve methodological consistency, cross-study reliability, and interdisciplinary collaboration, ensuring a more accurate understanding of how interoceptive signals shape perception and cognition.",

          "abstract": "The ability to gauge the average of a number stream is a fundamental aspect of numeric cognition, information processing, and value-based decisions. Research on this ability has primarily focused on the integration of numerical information from a single source. Here, we examined the estimation of averages when competing sources of information are presented. We tested two theories of numeric value integration: the Compressed Mental Number Line (CMNL) predicts underestimation of averages independent of competing information; Selective Integration (SI) predicts that competing information interferes with the target information. Across three experiments, we found a significant underestimation of the averages, and a limited impact of competing information on estimation. Computational modeling shows that the CMNL (together with an explicit noise theory) provides the overall better account than SI to describe estimation behavior in our data. However, about one third of our participants were best described by SI. Among these participants, the computational mechanism of SI consisted of an underweighting of lower numbers in local sample comparisons. Overall, our findings clarify the role of competing information in average estimations, and shed light on the exact cognitive process and limitations of SI as a general theory of sequential information integration.",

We then identify previously unreported examples of lexical elaboration, and analyze how lexical elaboration is influenced by ecological and cultural variables.

We find that each socio-demographic characteristic considered (i.e., sex, age, marital status, migration background, income, highest completed education, and region of residence) as well as five of the six HEXACO personality dimensions (Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience; but not Agreeableness vs. Anger) were associated with self-selection, selective dropout, and/or selective attrition.

By drawing comparisons between species richness and abundance, we applied Shannon entropy and beta diversity measures to assess the diversity and distribution of a verbal repertoire over time. This analysis utilized the outcomes of three verbal operant experimental analyses that use a multi-element design to test for the occurrence of four elementary verbal operants. Using archival data, diversity measures were then used to conduct a detailed analysis of the richness and evenness of verbal responses. The results demonstrate that beta diversity and Shannon entropy effectively capture the richness and distribution of the verbal repertoire over time. These findings suggest that diversity indices can provide a robust framework for assessing language development and the effectiveness of interventions. This research underscores the importance of integrating ecological diversity models into behavioral science to better understand complex human behaviors like language. Future applications of this method may allow for more complex analysis of verbal behavior within and across individuals and interventions.",

Due to their associations with potentially harmful nonnormative behaviours at both the individual and collective levels, researchers have expressed particular concern over conspiracy theories that malign science. To better understand such beliefs, we conducted a national U.S. survey to gauge respondents’ agreement with 11 science-related conspiracy theories and their political, psychological, and social characteristics. We find that beliefs in specific science-related conspiracy theories represent two unique factors that are (i) related to nonnormative behaviours including political violence, vaccine refusal, and sharing false information online, and (ii) undergirded by a range of nonnormative personality traits and attitudes. We conclude by discussing the potential role of political leaders in propagating science-related conspiracy theories and the implications for preventing or reversing science-related conspiracy theory beliefs.",

          "abstract": "Functional connectomics is a popular approach to investigate the neural underpinnings of developmental disorders of which attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent. Nonetheless, neuronal mechanisms driving the aberrant functional connectivity resulting in ADHD symptoms remain largely unclear. Whereas resting state activity reflecting intrinsic tonic background activity is only vaguely connected to behavioral effects, naturalistic neuroscience has provided means to measure phasic brain dynamics associated with overt manifestation of the symptoms. Here we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in three experimental conditions, an active virtual reality (VR) task where the participants execute goal-directed behaviors, a passive naturalistic Video Viewing task, and a standard Resting State condition. Thirty-nine children with ADHD and thirty-seven typically developing (TD) children participated in this preregistered study. Functional connectivity was examined with network-based statistics (NBS) and graph theoretical metrics. During the naturalistic VR task, the ADHD group showed weaker task performance and stronger functional connectivity than the TD group. Group differences in functional connectivity were observed in widespread brain networks: particularly subcortical areas showed hyperconnectivity in ADHD. More restricted group differences in functional connectivity were observed during the Video Viewing, and there were no group differences in functional connectivity in the Resting State condition. These observations were consistent across NBS and graph theoretical analyses, although NBS revealed more pronounced group differences. Furthermore, during the VR task and Video Viewing, functional connectivity in TD controls was associated with task performance during the measurement, while Resting State activity in TD controls was correlated with ADHD symptoms rated over six months. We conclude that overt expression of the symptoms is correlated with aberrant brain connectivity in ADHD. Furthermore, naturalistic paradigms where clinical markers can be coupled with simultaneously occurring brain activity may further increase the interpretability of psychiatric neuroimaging findings.",

          "abstract": "One important distinction in the syntax literature is between agreement that is external to the nominal phrase and agreement that is internal to it (sometimes called concord). How this type of agreement impacts sentence processing, however, is not well understood. In this paper, we ask whether agreement errors are processed differently based on their internal vs external status. We investigate this question in Russian, a Slavic language that has a rich morphological agreement system and flexible word order, allowing us to control for several confounds. Our results are not fully conclusive but do provide moderate evidence that processing of agreement is modulated by internal vs. external status. As a second, methodological contribution, we measure real-time language processing using Mouse Tracking for Reading (MoTR), a new web-deployable measurement tool that has been argued to improve over previous methods (e.g., self-paced reading) but has so far been tested only in English, and never for agreement processing phenomena. We find that MoTR can successfully pick up differences in our factorized psycholinguistic experiment in Russian. A directed comparison with existing data collected using in-lab eye-tracking-while-reading and similar experimental materials (Fuchs et al., 2025) suggests MoTR data yields larger effect sizes than does eye-tracking data.",

          "abstract": "Goal-directed actions are defined by their sensitivity to the causal association between actions and outcomes, as well as the subjective value ascribed to those outcomes. When this sensitivity diminishes, actions may transition into habitual behavior. Based on recent findings from animal studies, we hypothesized that delaying outcomes relative to actions would weaken sensitivity to outcome revaluation and reduce action rates. In three experiments ( N = 290 ), participants made fictitious investments in companies within different contexts providing immediate or delayed feedback. After training, participants were informed of a market crash that affected the performance of both companies, favoring one over the other. Across all experiments, action rates were lower in the delayed-feedback condition, and outcome revaluation had a more pronounced effect in the immediate-feedback condition. Self-reported action-outcome knowledge revealed that participants were less aware of the contingencies in the delayed condition. These findings suggest that delays in reinforcement weaken the action-outcome association critical for goal-directed control.

          "abstract": "What determines who becomes and stays friends? Many factors are linked to friendship,\nincluding physical proximity and interpersonal similarities1,2. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends3,4 by capturing how people process the world around them5,6. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here, we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips–acquired before participants met one another–predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (i.e., they were more likely to be friends rather than several “degrees of separation” apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence, and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after meeting each other. Compared to people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this 6-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in “deeper” interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to, and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.",

This study interviewed 8 pre-retirees and 15 retirees (N = 23) using semi-structured individual and focus group interviews. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework, we asked participants to reflect on their retirement transition, attitudes toward solitude, social influences on their alone time, and their perceived control over managing solitude during retirement. Thematic analysis revealed key themes, including shifts in identity, balancing social connection and alone time, and the role of autonomy and financial stability in shaping solitude experiences. While some participants embraced solitude as an opportunity for personal growth and well-being, others faced challenges such as boredom and social isolation. Findings suggest that achieving a balance between alone time and social engagement is critical to fostering positive experiences of solitude in retirement.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: The stereotype content model posits that Asian Americans are viewed by outgroups as competent but lacking warmth. Little research has examined how Asian Americans perceive their ingroup (self-perception) and perceive society’s views of their ingroup (metaperception). This study examined whether incongruence between self- and metaperception in terms of warmth and competence has mental health implications. We hypothesized that perception incongruence would predict poorer mental health.\n \nMethods: Asian American participants (N = 249, 78.7% women, 44.6% East Asian, 73.1% second or later generation) completed an online survey assessing self- and metaperceptions of warmth and competence dimensions as well as depression, social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and affect.\n \nResults: Participants reported perceiving that society views Asian Americans as more competent and less warm than they perceived their own ingroup. Self- and metaperception of high competence and self-perception of low warmth predicted worse mental health and affect. Perception incongruence was unrelated to mental health symptoms and affect.\n \nConclusions: Asian Americans are aware that their own group is perceived as high competence and low warmth, but they view their own group differently. While self- and metaperception consistent with racial stereotypes were related to mental health outcomes, perception incongruence was not. Future research should examine why incongruence may not influence mental health and identify protective factors against stereotype-related harm for Asian Americans.\n\n\nKeywords: Stereotype content model; self-perception; metaperception; perception incongruence; mental health\nPublic significance statement: Asian Americans are cognizant of societal stereotypes but perceive their ingroup differently.

However, progress in identifying unique behavioral markers of psychopathology from smartphone sensors has been stalled by research on diagnostic categories that are heterogenous and have many non-specific symptoms.\nObjective Determine which domains of psychopathology are detectable with smartphone sensors and identify passively sensed markers for (1) general impairment (the p-factor) and (2) specific transdiagnostic domains.\nDesign Observational study including a baseline assessment and 14 days of smartphone monitoring.\nSetting Selected community sample.\nParticipants Participants included 557 adults selected for mental health treatment status (51% currently in outpatient treatment, 29% with treatment history).\nMain outcomes and measures Transdiagnostic psychopathology dimensions of internalizing, detachment, disinhibition, antagonism, thought disorder, somatoform, and the p-factor; 27 behavior markers derived from GPS, accelerometer, motion, call logs, screen on/off, and battery status.\nResults Among the 557 participants included in the study, 82% were female and the mean age was 30.7 (SD = 8.8).  Multiple correlation (R) showed the domain most strongly related to sensed behavior was detachment (R = .42) followed by somatoform (R = .41), internalizing (R = .37), disinhibition (R = .35), antagonism (R = .33), and thought disorder (R = .28).  Each psychopathology domain had significant, bivariate associations with 4-10 smartphone sensor variables. After adjusting for shared variance between psychopathology dimensions, all domains except thought disorder retained significant, incremental associations with sensor variables, reflecting unique behavioral signatures (standardized s = |.15|–|.25|). The p-factor was associated with lower mobility, more time at home, later bedtime, and less phone charge (s = |.12|–|.24|).\nConclusions and relevance This study identified behavioral markers for domains encompassing most major forms of psychopathology using smartphone sensor data. In addition to establishing the breadth of psychopathology that is detectable, findings show smartphone sensors assess markers that distinguish domains of dysfunction. Results showing many behavioral markers reflect non-specific psychopathology reinforces the need for dimensional, transdiagnostic models to maximize the potential of mobile sensing technology. Findings from this study can advance research on day-to-day maintenance mechanisms of psychopathology and inform development of symptom monitoring tools.",

          "abstract": "People connect with others who share their likes, interests, and mental states, a phenomenon known as homophily. Here, we examine human-AI homophily by testing how individuals' psychological traits are related to their affiliation with large language models (LLM) that mimic these traits. In Experiment 1, the LLM GPT-4 was prompted to produce language aligned with either an anxious or non-anxious state. Participants (n=100) engaged with both versions of the LLM and then completed a questionnaire to assess how relatable they found the AI. Participants with high anxiety felt more similar to and understood by the LLM instructed to mimic an anxious state, while participants with lower anxiety reported a perceived difference between themselves and the LLM. In addition, the sentiment of the messages exchanged with each LLM persona mirrored the sentiment of the messages the LLM produced. This apparent display of empathy towards the AI was predicted by participants’ own anxiety in the case of messages with a negative sentiment. In Experiment 2, participants (n=100) engaged with two LLMs prompted to align with either an extroverted or introverted personality. Extroverted participants felt similar to the AI when it mimicked extroversion. Taken together, the findings support the idea that humans affiliate more with LLMs when they are instructed to mirror aspects of their psychology.",

          "abstract": "Students with poor quality relationships (e.g., those lacking parent/carer support, peer support, and/or who are bullied by their peers) typically report lower wellbeing than their peers. Support from school staff may play a compensatory role for these vulnerable learners, but current evidence is meagre. Using data from N=25,977 adolescents (aged 12-15; 50.1% girls) from the #BeeWell study in Greater Manchester, England, we fitted a series of linear regression models to estimate the association between school staff support and psychological wellbeing; optimism; self-esteem; and, life satisfaction. These models were subsequently extended to explore potential moderation effects (i.e., whether the association between school staff support and wellbeing varies based on students’ level of parent/carer support, peer support, and/or exposure to bullying). Analyses revealed that higher levels of school staff support are significantly associated with higher levels of all four student wellbeing outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed a complex picture, with the nature and magnitude of effects varying by relationship and wellbeing outcome.  For example, for self-esteem and life satisfaction, the association with school staff support is stronger for students reporting low (vs high) parent/carer support or who are exposed (vs unexposed) to bullying. In contrast, for psychological wellbeing and optimism, it is smaller for students reporting low (vs high) social support from peers. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of having supportive school staff for promoting student wellbeing. They also suggest that increasing school staff support is a potentially useful mechanism for bolstering the wellbeing of vulnerable students (e.g., those who are bullied).",

          "abstract": "Theories of personality development emphasize the continuity between who we are as a child and who we are as an adult.  However, there are major unanswered questions about this (dis)continuity because research on traits has long been divided into studies of temperament in childhood and studies of personality in adolescence/adulthood. To bridge this divide, the present study used longitudinal data from a sample of 674 Mexican-origin youth who completed assessments of temperament traits (i.e., Negative Emotionality, Surgency, Affiliation, Effortful Control) from ages 10-16 and assessments of Big Five personality traits from ages 14-26. Leveraging two waves of overlapping temperament/personality trait assessments at ages 14 and 16, we found: (1) continuity between childhood/adolescent temperament and age 26 personality, with the strongest associations between conceptually similar traits, and Effortful Control predicting all Big Five traits (except Extraversion), suggesting self-regulation broadly promotes maturation; (2) temperament starts predicting adult personality traits by age 12-14, indicating that temperamental foundations of adult personality development crystallize in adolescence; (3) conceptually similar temperament/personality traits reflect different expressions of the same underlying trait from age 10-26, established using latent growth models of joint temperament/personality factors; (4) mean-level personality development across late childhood to adulthood showing that all joint traits maintain consistent rank-order stability and youth increase in Effortful Control/Conscientiousness, decrease in Negative Emotionality/Neuroticism and Surgency/Extraversion, and do not change in Affiliation/Agreeableness. Findings add novel support for widely accepted–yet largely untested–theories, although some unexpected results undermine prevailing assumptions about personality development.",

Using a method described by Mõttus and colleagues (2023) we obtained noise- and bias-free ‘true’ correlations (rtrues), which were used to produce regression model estimates of the true independent associations (βtrues) of age, sex and Big Five personality domains with loneliness across three multicultural samples (Estonian-speaking, n = 20,893; Russian-speaking, n = 762; English-speaking, n = 600). Using this method, personality traits predicted 54–62% of variance in loneliness, compared to 26–33% when using methods limited to just self-report or informant-report data. Across samples, we found strong independent relationships between loneliness and Neuroticism (βtrues around 0.7) when controlling for other personality traits. Loneliness had robust, though comparatively weaker, associations with Extraversion (βtrues around 0.25) and Agreeableness (βtrues from 0.1 to 0.3). Women and older people tended to be lonelier, but these associations were entirely attributable to personality trait differences: once these were controlled for, the associations either reversed or became non-significant. Overall, we find that loneliness is far more closely related to Neuroticism than previously understood, and distinct from both social isolation and social disconnection.",

          "abstract": "When breaking bad news (BBN) in pediatric oncology, effective triadic communication among healthcare professionals (HCPs), pediatric patients, and their families is essential. The quality of BBN influences the entire cancer care trajectory, impacting BBN receivers’ (patients and their families) shared decision-making abilities, treatment adherence, distress reduction, and coping skills. BBN is considered challenging for both transmitters and receivers. Unlike for adult oncology, there is no specific support for pediatric oncology in Germany, such as guidelines, protocols, or comprehensive BBN skill training.\nIn order to provide practice-based evidence guidance for HCPs in pediatric oncology, the research project OKRA (Orientation Compass for Breaking Bad News in Pediatric Oncology) created a comprehensive BBN-support instrument: the OKRA Compass. This Compass aims to facilitate the navigation of BBN transmitters during the preparatory, transmission, and subsequent follow-up phases of BBN. The initial phase of this study involved formulating high-quality BBN theses (recommendations) through a participatory group Delphi, focusing on multiperspective, practice-based knowledge. Representatives from four groups were constantly engaged: BBN transmitters and receivers, family support organizations, and researchers. Then, based on the theses, a pilot Compass was refined through practical application in five pediatric oncology clinics in Germany.\nThis paper aims to elucidate how the OKRA Compass has engendered novel developments or alterations in the daily BBN routine. Applying the OKRA Compass in daily routines has yielded significant insights across four domains: (1) Considering BBN as a complex process, (2) addressing the multi-layered needs of BBN receivers, (3) encouraging new paths for shared decision-making, and (4) cultivating awareness of the needs of BBN transmitters.\nProviding a BBN support instrument at no cost is imperative to foster high-quality BBN processes. The OKRA Compass underscores the significance of effective communication by offering a structured, comprehensive, and context-tailored orientation to novice BBN transmitters and serving as a catalyst for experienced BBN transmitters. The OKRA Compass is expected to be widely accepted as it not only fills a gap. Incorporating diverse experts during its development was crucial for ensuring its comprehensive utility across all HCPs in pediatric oncology.\nIncorporating the OKRA Compass’s theses into daily routines requires organizational openness to change, which must be enforced at the individual, team, and organizational levels. This process demands a readiness to adapt, allocate resources, and invest in enhancing team communication skills.",

          "abstract": "To accelerate climate change mitigation, lifestyle changes and more ambitious climate\npolicies are urgently needed. However, realizing lifestyle changes is challenged by\nwidespread misperceptions about the climate impact of different mitigation behaviors, making\nit difficult even for motivated individuals to identify which actions to prioritize and which\npolicies to support. Little is known about the cross-national variability of such climate impact\nperceptions and their association with climate-relevant outcomes. We aim to address this gap\nwith a pre-registered cross-country study (N = 2,742) in China, Germany, and the United\nStates. Using a novel experimental paradigm, we investigate the extent to which participants’\nperceptions of the climate impact of behaviors and their accuracy in estimating carbon\nfootprints is associated with their own climate-related behavior and their support for behavior-\ntargeted climate policies. Across the three countries, participants largely misperceived overall\ncarbon footprints, and underestimated the climate impact of highly carbon-intensive actions.\nDespite these behavior-specific misperceptions, impact perceptions of different actions were\nindependent of each other, showing no evidence for compensatory judgments. Participants’\nimpact perceptions and carbon footprint accuracy were associated with their own\ncorresponding behavior across all countries. However, the association between impact\nperceptions and climate policy support varied by national context with impact perceptions\nhaving a direct effect in Germany, no effect in China, and a moderated effect by political\norientation in the United States.

          "abstract": "Digital health data or ambulatory assessment (AA) data collected using digital devices (e.g., smartphones, active watches, or other health-trackers) provides unparalleled opportunities for clinicians to assess symptoms, experiences, and therapy processes outside of session, ultimately strengthening the precision of clinical assessment and increasing engagement in the psychotherapy process. However, much of the guidance on collecting and interpreting AA data is written for researchers and there are few guides written for clinical practitioners who may be interested in using AA data to inform their clinical practice. As clinical researchers and practitioners ourselves, we aim to increase interdisciplinary crosstalk by illustrating the benefits of integrating AA data into clinical practice using case examples. We offer practical recommendations for how clinicians might effectively use digital data. Specifically, we encourage clinicians to (1) co-create digital assessments that align with their client’s goals, (2) consider which digital device (or assessment modality) may be best suited to measure their client’s symptoms, experiences, or goals, and to (3) co-determine what constitutes ‘meaningful change’ for your client and their goals. We hope to inspire clinicians and to strengthen research-practice partnerships to advance the use of AA data as a tool for strengthening clinical practice, beyond the traditional boundaries of the therapy room.",

Using experience sampling, we tracked the emotion states of Danish mothers and fathers six times daily for a week across maternity (N = 100) and paternity leave (N = 68). Bayesian multilevel coupled-oscillator models revealed distinct patterns of emotion regulation that varied systematically with leave arrangements. Both parents exhibited stronger self-regulation during their partner’s leave period, with arousal amplifying regulatory strength. Emotional synchrony in valence and arousal emerged between co-located partners, suggesting\nthat parents jointly navigated a shared emotional space. During maternity leave but not paternity leave, mothers followed fathers’ emotional lead, especially for high-arousal emotions, whereas fathers displayed arousal-modulated co-regulation, providing emotional counterbalance particularly during mothers’ low-arousal states. These asymmetric patterns demonstrate how couples’ coordinated emotion strategies adapt to changing circumstances and highlight the role of interpersonal processes in shaping emotional experiences.",

          "abstract": "Deontological arguments are those that refer to properties of actions other than their consequences, e.g., vaccination, act vs.\\ omission. These arguments are often used to justify public policies. In principle, they could make outcomes worse than the outcomes of utilitarian choices, i.e., those designed to yield the best expected consequences. Deontological arguments ought to explain why it is better to make things worse. We suggest that arguments attempting to do this are usually fallacious. We list several categories of fallacies. We report two demonstrations in which we ask whether people without special training can classify fallacies correctly. People vary in their classification ability, and that ability is correlated with acceptance of the standards of actively open-minded thinking, possibly because both traits require meta-cognitive competence.",

          "abstract": "Retirement marks a significant life transition, often accompanied by the loss of structured work routines and an increase in alone time. How this solitude is experienced—positively or negatively—varies depending on individual and environmental factors. This study interviewed 8 pre-retirees and 15 retirees (N = 23) using semi-structured individual and focus group interviews. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework, we asked participants to reflect on their retirement transition, attitudes toward solitude, social influences on their alone time, and their perceived control over managing solitude during retirement. Thematic analysis revealed key themes, including shifts in identity, balancing social connection and alone time, and the role of autonomy and financial stability in shaping solitude experiences. While some participants embraced solitude as an opportunity for personal growth and well-being, others faced challenges such as boredom and social isolation. Findings suggest that achieving a balance between alone time and social engagement is critical to fostering positive experiences of solitude in retirement.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Psychedelic research has expanded globally, but studies in Japan remain limited due to strict drug policies and social stigma. This study investigates the demographic characteristics and mental health effects of psychedelic use among Japanese users, providing insights for future drug policy and mental healthcare.\n\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Japanese psychedelic users recruited via social media (X, formerly Twitter) from May 1 to June 1, 2024. Eligible participants (aged 18+, Japanese nationals) completed an online questionnaire, reporting demographic data, psychedelic use history, and mental health assessments. Depression and anxiety were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scales before and after psychedelic use.\n\nResults: Among 615 participants, the average age was 33.8 years. LSD was the most used psychedelic. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests showed significant reductions in depression and anxiety scores after psychedelic use (PHQ-9: Z = –14.87, p &lt; .001, r = 0.59; GAD-7: Z = –14.59, p &lt; .001, r = 0.58), suggesting potential mental health benefits.\n\nDiscussion: The findings support the self-medication hypothesis, indicating that individuals may turn to psychedelics for relief from mental distress, resulting in improved symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the study’s reliance on self-reported data and lack of clinical control limits the ability to establish causal relationships. Further research should investigate the therapeutic potential and risks of psychedelic use in Japan’s cultural context. These findings highlight the need for culturally sensitive drug policies and continued exploration of psychedelic use outside clinical settings.",

          "authors": "ru song",
          "abstract": "In moral scenarios, individuals often exhibit divergent interpretations and judgments of the same moral event due to varying prior experiences, making true \"bystander objectivity\" challenging. This study investigates how prior experiences influence perspective selection and subsequently moderate moral judgment and its neural underpinnings by activating different moral role perspectives (decision-maker vs. receiver) using Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). Results reveal that activating the receiver's perspective leads to stricter moral judgments, whereas activating the decision-maker's perspective results in more lenient judgments. Furthermore, the moderating effect of perspective on moral judgment weakens as the decision-maker's gains from immoral choices decrease. At the neural level, activating different moral role perspectives affects early processing and emotional arousal during moral judgment, manifesting as larger N1 and P2 components for the decision-maker perspective, and larger FRN components related to expectation violation for the receiver perspective. These findings indicate that prior moral experiences significantly shape an individual's moral judgment preferences as a bystander, primarily by modulating early processing of others' moral decisions.",

This model suggests that individuals’ behaviors are influenced by motivational factors, with online disinhibition moderating this process.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nWe observed how individuals expressed their attitudes by clicking “Like” when reading a fictional thread with multiple replies. In Study 1a, participants were shown two types of replies in a thread: inflammatory and normal posts. In Study 1b, we followed up with the participants from Study 1a by asking them how sensational and annoying they perceived each post. In Study 2, we examined whether participants clicked “Like” on a post that contained extreme language.\nFindings\nIn Study 1a, the influence of online disinhibition on Like-clicking did not significantly differ across post types. In Study 1b, when participants perceived posts as sensational or annoying, they were more likely to click “Like” if they experienced high levels of online disinhibition. For posts that were neither sensational nor annoying, online disinhibition did not affect the likelihood of clicking “Like.” In Study 2, although online disinhibition was significantly correlated with Like-clicking on the extreme post, this effect was not observed among participants who held a negative attitude toward the extreme post.\nOriginality\nThis study rigorously examined the causal relationships among motivational factors, online disinhibition, and behaviors, challenging previously overgeneralized explanations of online disinhibition theory regarding online behaviors.",

In this paper, we introduce Drawing of THINGS (DoT), a novel dataset of 28,627 human drawings of 1,854 diverse object concepts, sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language, mirroring the structure of the THINGS image database. In addition to data on drawings’ stroke history, we further collected fine-grained recognition data for each drawing, along with metadata on participant demographics, drawing ability, and mental imagery. We characterize people’s ability to communicate and recognize semantic information encoded in drawings and compare this ability to their ability to recognize real-world images of the same visual objects. We also explore the relationship between drawing understanding and the memorability and typicality of the objects contained in THINGS. In sum, we envision DoT as a powerful tool that builds on the THINGS database to advance understanding of how humans express knowledge about visual concepts.",

The safety message on the center console was manipulated at two levels:  a default legal message (common in contemporary vehicles upon console start-up) or a QBE safety message (i.e., “Will you drive safely today?”).  The QBE message was hypothesized to reduce preferred speeds in a video speed test.  Contrary to the hypothesis, we found no evidence to support that the QBE message resulted in different speed preferences as compared to the default message.

          "authors": "Briana Louise Kunstman",
          "abstract": "Due to the DSM diagnosis category including mental paraphilia, there has been a question of whether or not BDSM/kink is linked to pathology (Moser et al. 2005). Kink refers to unconventional sexual practices or desires. BDSM is an overarching term that refers to a spectrum of sexual behaviors and preferences that incorporate (B)ondage, (D)iscipline (or Domination), (S)adism (or submission), and (M)asochism. The biases and stigma towards BDSM and kink have shown to be detrimental, as research has found that many BDSM and kink identified individuals are not out due to the fear of stigma and concerns regarding clinician beliefs. This is the case regardless of having specific needs relating to their kink behaviors and preferring to be out to their providers (Waldura et. al 2016). Therefore, the current aim of this project is to broadly explore therapists’ understanding and attitudes towards BDSM and kink through semi-structured interviews. IRB approval was obtained and we recruited 10 practicing clinicians using Psychology Today. Consistent with the qualitative research tradition of eliciting diverse responses, we identified individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, we selected participants who listed sex therapy or kink-allied work in their bios as well as those who have no link to these key terms. Participants were asked to provide informed consent and participate in a 30-45 minute interview via Google Meets. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis procedures outlined by Braun and Clarke (2022). Thematic analysis has been used to identify, analyze, and report patterns in the data. We identified several themes that give us a better understanding of how therapists’ react to specific dynamics, and what would make them more comfortable in working with BDSM-and-kink identifying individuals. This exploratory research allows us to better assess future steps needed to work towards BDSM and kink normalization to enhance treatment effectiveness and allow therapists to provide more individualized care for their clients. Additional implications will be discussed.",

          "abstract": "How do we tailor learning experiences to promote formation and generalization of conceptual knowledge? Exposing learners to a highly variable set of examples has been postulated to benefit generalization, but evidence is conflicting. In the present study, we manipulated training set variability in terms of both the typicality of training examples (high vs. low coherence) and the number of unique examples (small vs. large set size) while controlling the total number of training trials. The face family category structure was designed to allow participants to learn by picking up on shared features across category members and/or by attending to unique features of individual category members. We found relatively little effect of set size but a clear benefit of high coherence (lower variability) training both in terms of category learning and generalization. Moreover, high coherence training biased participants to make judgments based on shared features in both categorization and recognition. Using an exploratory model fitting procedure, we tested the hypothesis that high coherence training facilitates prototype abstraction. Instead, we found an exemplar model advantage across training conditions. Yet, there was also systematic misfit for all models for some trial types, including underestimating the influence of shared features in categorization responses. Overall, we show that high-variability training is not necessarily beneficial for concept learning when the total length of training is controlled. Instead, training on typical examples promotes fast learning and broad category knowledge by helping learners extract shared category features.",

          "abstract": "Songs intimately combine two defining human capacities: music and language. As a song unfolds, interconnected musical and linguistic elements such as dissonant chords and evocative words combine to generate fluctuating patterns of tension and relaxation, with associated predictive expectations that shape aesthetic and emotional experiences. However, how these patterns integrate across both domains to produce a holistic sense of tension remains unexplored. We investigated this integration in a tension-rich subset of Western vocal music, late-Romantic art songs, hypothesising that tonal and semantic tension combine superadditively. Using a naturalistic listening paradigm, online participants rated tonal, semantic, and holistic tension in three selected songs. Results suggest that the musical dimension (tonal tension) plays a more prominent role than the linguistic one (semantic tension) in shaping overall affect. Music alone explained a greater proportion of variance in the holistic condition than did lyrics alone. A significant redundant-information component suggested an integration of music and lyrics under genre-specific rules, while a synergistic-information component indicated their combined effect exceeds the sum of their individual contributions. Though based on a specific tonal-poetic idiom, our findings illuminate how music and language might integrate during real-time listening, from the experiential perspective of tension. We discuss how both culture-specific and culture-invariant (universal) mechanisms may contribute to this process, offering insights into cross-domain aesthetic integration.",

We selected 206 emotional expressions from models of Black African descent from the Racially Diverse Affective Expression (RADIATE) dataset (Conley et al., 2018). Fifty-four students from the University of Limpopo, South Africa, rated these stimuli. Using a 75% rater agreement threshold, we refined the set to 131 validated images, termed the Limpopo facial emotion stimulus set. This subset demonstrated high recognition of the intended facial expressions and strong consistency between raters. We present psychometric results describing these open-access stimuli, which we hope will be informative for other researchers. Our validation process underscores the importance of adapting materials to match the cultural and social context of the target population. The Limpopo facial emotion stimulus set enhances the ecological validity of emotion research in Sub-Saharan Africa, filling a gap in the availability of culturally appropriate cognitive and emotional assessment tools.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric assessment is the foundation of psychological research, where the accuracy of outcomes and their interpretations depend on measurement. Due to the widespread application of factor models, factor loadings are fundamental to modern psychometric assessment. Recent advances in network psychometrics introduced network loadings which aim to provide network models with a metric similar to factor loadings to assess measurement quality when the data are generated from a factor model. Our study revisits and refines the original network loadings to account for properties of (regularized) partial correlation networks, such as the reduction of partial correlation size as the number of variables increase, that were not considered previously. Using a simulation study, the revised network loadings demonstrated greater congruence with the simulated factor loadings across conditions relative to the original formulation. The simulation also evaluated how well correlations between factors can be captured by scores estimated with network loadings. The results show that not only can these network scores adequately estimate the simulated correlations between factors, they can do so without the need for rotation, a standard requirement for factor loadings. The consequence is that researchers do not need to choose a rotation with the revised network loadings, reducing the analytic degrees of freedom and eliminating this common source of variability in factor analysis. We discuss the interpretation of network loadings when data are believed to be generated from a network model and how they may fit into a network theory of measurement.",

In line with a \"bright-future hypothesis\", people predicted higher levels of happiness and meaning in the future than in their historical baseline. We observed the same optimistic pattern for a 1-year as a 5-year time horizon. Rather than reflecting a past-neglecting cognitive mechanism, the evidence mostly favored a motivational explanation. First, the effect emerged both between-subjects and within-subjects: Even when people had just reported their past well-being, they still predicted future improvement. Second, predicted well-being improvement generalized to social judgments of a friend but not to an enemy, mediated by judgments of deservingness. In conclusion, people predict a bright future when they want to see one.",

In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then compare the relative evidence for these two competing hypotheses and find that for political topics, it is 20 times more likely that cognitive reflection is associated with less motivated reasoning – in contrast to the prediction from the influential “motivated reflection” hypothesis. Our results highlight the need for more nuanced theories of how different cognitive control processes interact with motivated reasoning.",

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we examined the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying empathy in these contexts.

Behavioral results showed observing grasping movements performed by the hemiplegic hand elicited stronger negative empathic feelings than those performed by the non-hemiplegic hand, regardless of the grasping targets. Positive empathic feelings were more pronounced while observing the hemiplegic hand grasping the human hand than the object. Furthermore, classification approaches in MVPA revealed that parts of the mirror neuron system and mentalizing networks distinguished empathic responses to grasping the human hand and the object commonly across the hemiplegic and the non-hemiplegic hands conditions. Additionally, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) more accurately classified empathic responses to hemiplegic than non-hemiplegic grasping movements. Representational similarity analysis revealed that brain regions associated with affective empathy were specifically attuned to feelings of relief involved in the grasping movements across conditions. These findings suggest that both affective and cognitive empathic brain systems are mutually engaged when empathizing with individuals with hemiplegia who face complex challenges. The dorsal MPFC likely plays a key role in facilitating precise empathic responses to the challenges of hemiplegic movements. Moreover, the affective system is particularly fine-tuned to positive feelings, such as relief. Our findings advance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying empathy toward individuals with different characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Parental involvement plays an important role in children’s learning within everyday social contexts. This study investigated whether and how a brief instructional intervention affected parent-child interactions during play, and how parents’ and children’s behaviors impacted children’s learning during the play and subsequent independent exploration. Parents and their 3- to 6-year-old children (N = 72) engaged with causal toys, with parents assigned to one of three conditions: Teaching (teach the child), Helping (help the child), or No-involvement (watch the child). During the Interactive Phase, parent-child dyads had four minutes to explore the toys and figure out the causal rule together. This was followed by the Independent Phase, in which children explored a different set of toys with a new causal rule on their own for three minutes. Children's learning outcomes were assessed after each phase. Results indicated that parents in the No-involvement condition asked fewer questions and provided less feedback and encouragement compared to those in the Teaching and Helping conditions. However, there were no significant differences in parental behaviors between the Helping and Teaching groups. Across all conditions, parents’ use of questioning (particularly pedagogical questions) and guidance in helping children generate evidence during the interaction predicted better learning outcomes for children. These improved learning outcomes were even observed following children’s independent exploration, suggesting that guidance (in particular in the form of pedagogical questions) supports “learning to learn”.",

          "abstract": "A familect is the type of inward-oriented language variety used by families. It exhibits some distinctive features compared to other more outward-oriented vernacular varieties, which result from its function in bonding and marking identity. Familects also share some characteristics with child language and child-oriented speech, as well as with forms of language play. Additionally, most of the familectal features can be found in the languages spoken by small, isolated, close-knit human groups. This commentary reviews both the idiosyncratic features of familects and their overlap with other vernacular varieties, as well as the functional explanations for them. It also argues for promoting research on this understudied variety found in all human languages, which should contribute to a better understanding of language diversity, language change, and language evolution.",

          "abstract": "People often favour information aligned with their ideological motives. Can our tendency for directional motivated reasoning be overcome with cognitive control? It remains contested whether cognitive control processes, such as cognitive reflection and inhibitory control, are linked to a greater tendency to engage in politically motivated reasoning, as proposed by the “motivated reflection” hypothesis, or can help people overcome it, as suggested by cognitive science research. In this pre-registered study (N = 504 UK participants rating n = 4963 news messages), we first provide evidence for motivated reasoning on multiple political and non-political topics. We then compare the relative evidence for these two competing hypotheses and find that for political topics, it is 20 times more likely that cognitive reflection is associated with less motivated reasoning – in contrast to the prediction from the influential “motivated reflection” hypothesis. Our results highlight the need for more nuanced theories of how different cognitive control processes interact with motivated reasoning.",

          "abstract": "Background \n\nAlcohol and tobacco use as well as increases in psychological distress continue to be public health concerns among youth in the United States (U.S.), including Hispanic youth who represent 25% of all American youth. The social determinants of health (SDOH) in relation to alcohol and tobacco use (ATU) among Hispanic youth have been investigated for decades. Evaluation of the multi-level influence of SDOH on ATU and the intersection with mental health among youth is needed to inform early interventions that promote positive health outcomes among American Hispanic adults. \n\nMethods \n\nWe conducted a systematic, reproducible search on PubMed for empirical research articles published that examined the SDOH of ATU among Hispanic/Latino/a/x adolescents in the U.S. We retrieved and screened 1464 titles and abstracts that yielded 256 articles for full review, of which 63 articles met final criteria for inclusion in the final synthesis. We categorized the SDOH by domains of behavioral, physical/built environment, socio-cultural, health care, and by levels for individual, interpersonal, school, community, and societal factors. \n\nResults \n\nMost studies focused on socio-cultural domains within individual and interpersonal levels. Less studies examined societal and healthcare domains. Along with the influence of individual and interpersonal determinants (e.g., generational status, Hispanic values, acculturation stress, family and peers), community level factors (e.g., neighborhood level factors such as neighborhood exposure to ATU and neighborhood ethnic concentration) emerged as key structural predictors of ATU. Ethnic discrimination was also identified as a societal level predictor that influenced ATU, with potential association of mental health as mediators, moderators, or co-occurring outcomes. About one-third of the studies investigated the influence of SDOH on ATU along with mental health related variables like depression, anxiety, and stress.  \n\nConclusion \n\nSDOH at the societal level and in the healthcare domain were identified as understudied among Hispanic adolescents. Future research is needed on these broader societal and structural determinants, including access to healthcare services and the integration of substance use prevention within these services, to intervene early in adolescence and reduce ATU related health consequences among Hispanic adults in the U.S.",

          "authors": "Philip Gerrans; Hugh MGovern; Jakob Hohwy; Lena K L Oestreich",
          "abstract": "Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is a newly recognized diagnosis that is distinguished from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through additional symptom clusters beyond re-experiencing, avoidance, and a persistent sense of threat. In addition to these core PTSD symptoms, C-PTSD is characterized by disturbances in self-organization, including affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal difficulties. These disruptions often result in persistent emotional instability, deep-seated feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and challenges in forming and maintaining relationships. While PTSD often arises from discrete traumatic events, C-PTSD is more commonly associated with prolonged or repeated interpersonal trauma, such as childhood maltreatment, domestic violence, or prolonged captivity. Here, we propose a novel model that explains these differences, identifies their neural substrates, and outlines the potential role of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in C-PTSD treatment. Drawing on active inference theories of cognition, we apply the concept of self-modelling to elucidate the insula’s role in affective regulation and adaptation to adversity. This framework clarifies the insula’s involvement not only in C-PTSD but also in other conditions affecting self-awareness and emotional processing. By integrating insights from neuroscience and psychopharmacology, we discuss how MDMA-assisted therapy may recalibrate affective regulation and reinforce a more stable self-model, offering a promising avenue for treatment. Theoretical and clinical implications are explored, emphasizing the need for further empirical research into MDMA’s therapeutic potential for C-PTSD.",

          "authors": "Saanvi Kumar",
          "abstract": "Background\n\nThere is an increasing rate of comorbidity with alcoholism and mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, especially among young adults, the demographic with the largest proportion of heavy drinkers. This study compares semaglutide, a GLP-1 drug, and naltrexone, which is FDA-approved for treating alcoholism, in treating comorbid alcoholism and anxiety using self-reported data from Reddit posts.\n\nMethods\n\nReddit API was used to extract Reddit posts relating either of the drugs (naltrexone and semaglutide) to either of the disorders (alcoholism and anxiety) as well as posts discussing the side effects of each drug. A script was created in Python to use Reddit API and automatically label the posts using a list of keywords, which was developed by running the script and manually checking portions of the data. For each drug, the effectiveness in treating a disorder was compared to ineffectiveness, and low/moderate side effects were compared to high side effects. The Chi-square test was applied to check for significance.\n\nResults\n\nAn analysis of 1,214 posts showed that Semaglutide was more effective than naltrexone at treating alcoholism as 100% of posts reported semaglutide to be effective compared to 75.67% of posts for naltrexone. Although the percentage of posts reporting the effectiveness of naltrexone for anxiety was greater at 68.97% compared to 63.83% for semaglutide, a chi-square test found that these differences were not statistically significant. Semaglutide had less intense side effects than naltrexone as 63.76% of the posts discussing semaglutide side effects found them to have a high intensity compared to 73.14% of posts discussing naltrexone side effects.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the rising comorbid condition of anxiety with alcoholism, semaglutide is a promising alternative to naltrexone for treating patients with alcoholism. It also appears to be a safer alternative, which could encourage more people to seek out treatment. Future studies can conduct clinical trials with treatment-seeking patients to affirm it, especially for comparing the two drugs for alcohol effectiveness. Other GLP-1 drugs and other mental health disorders in alcoholism comorbidities should also be explored.",

          "abstract": "Despite increased public interest and research on intensive high-dose mental health interventions, much remains unknown about the mental health effects and safety of multi-day intensive high-dose mindfulness meditation training. Accordingly, we aimed to study its salutary and adverse effects on mental health. We conducted a preregistered prospective intervention study among 89 adults who registered for 6-day insight mindfulness meditation retreats and 46 matched controls (Mage(SDage) = 33.75(9.50), 56.3% female). Controls were selected from a pool of 543 people recruited from the same community of meditators as retreat participants and matched to retreat participants on age and lifetime meditation experience. Retreat participants demonstrated significant improvements in well-being, negative affect, perseverative thinking, brooding rumination, and depression symptoms at 2-week follow-up compared to matched controls (η² range = .04–.08, ps &lt; .05). Importantly, the % of participants exhibiting statistically reliable deterioration in mental health outcomes at 2-week follow-up were equal or lower among retreat participants than among matched controls in the entire sample, as well as in a sub-sample with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety (ORs &lt; 1). These findings suggest that a 6-day mindfulness meditation retreat can produce rapid improvements in mental health, comparable to effect sizes of much longer 8-week mindfulness-based programs. These findings also challenge concerns about adverse effects of intensive high-dose meditation training and suggest that it may be a safe and effective intervention modality, even for clinically vulnerable adults struggling with depression or anxiety.",

In contrast, for addition they are taught to decompose the smaller digit to make 10 (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4). We hypothesized that these learning experiences would be reflected in the preferred order of operands, that is, min-first for multiplication and max-first for addition.

To address this issue, we developed a novel experimental paradigm that distorts participants' prior beliefs about memory tasks. This approach allows for manipulating JOLs without affecting the materials' perceptual fluency or lower-level properties. Our validation of this paradigm demonstrates that it effectively influences how participants allocate their study time across different conditions, reflecting varying levels of trial-by-trial JOLs.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the clinical utility of rhythmic digital markers (RDMs) in schizophrenia. RDMs are digital markers capturing behavioral rhythms over different timescales - within 24 hours span (ultradian), at a span of 24 hours (circadian), or over cycles of more than 24 hours (infradian). While previous research has explored digital markers for schizophrenia, the focus has primarily been on sensor data variability rather than rhythmic patterns. This study introduces two RDMs: an entropy RDM, which quantifies uncertainty in activity distribution over the infradian cycles, and a dynamic RDM, which is derived from models of transitions in entropy and psychotic symptom intensity using Markov chain analysis. Data were ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of 39 activities collected from 390 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and controls. We assessed associations between RDMs and symptom severity and whether participants could be differentiated based on these RDMs. We found that participants with schizophrenia significantly differed on dynamic RDMs, suggesting a potential diagnostic utility. However, dynamic RDMs were not associated with symptom severity, and entropy RDM had no significant clinical correlate. Our findings contribute to the growing evidence on digital markers in psychiatry and highlight the potential of rhythmic digital markers (RDMs) in characterizing digital phenotypes for schizophrenia.",

The Urnings algorithm is a computationally inexpensive method, which provides unbiased estimates and known standard errors and, can track the change without formulating an explicit growth model. However, it is not straightforward how to set up a system to match the characteristics of the learning context and provide optimal tracking and parameter estimation. \nFirst, we studied the convergence properties of Urnings when the ability of the students is constant. Second, we tested how well the algorithm can track different types and amounts of change in the ability. \nUrnings algorithm proved to be successful at adapting to the various simulated learning contexts and capabilities to track changing abilities.

In particular, they suggest that time intervals are perceived or reproduced differently for stimuli at different distances from our body, and that this interaction of space and time is altered when we interact with spatial distances using tools. To corroborate these findings, we performed a series of experiments in physical and virtual setups, testing 218 participants on a time reproduction task for stimuli presented at three distances from the body (60, 120 &amp; 240 cm). In between testing sessions participants performed tool-use training, whereby they either used physical or virtual tools to manipulate objects at distances between 120 and 200 cm from their body. Prior to training, the reproduced intervals were overall longer for stimuli at an intermediate distance (120cm) compared to near the body (60cm). Tool-use training significantly shortened the reproduced intervals for stimuli at 120 cm, hence the distance at which tool-use training was operated. Participants' sensitivity to the presented intervals did not differ between distances prior to training, but was significantly reduced by tool-use training systematically at all distances. We observed qualitatively similar results for experiments in physical and virtual setups. Yet, the effect sizes for individual experiments were small, pointing to systematic but weak effects.

          "abstract": "Petitionary prayers—requests made to a deity for specific outcomes—are widely practiced across religious traditions. While their efficacy remains a subject of theological debate, they exhibit remarkable resilience to disconfirmation. In three pre-registered studies—a field study in China and two global surveys via Prolific (total n=1800)—we examined how religious believers (Christians, Muslims, local deity worshippers, and Hindus) update beliefs and behaviors in response to prayer successes or failures for both hypothetical co-religionists and themselves. Results indicate that belief updates generally follow a Bayesian pattern, with increases after prayer successes and decreases after failures, though with an asymmetry favoring belief reinforcement. Notably, participants from the Prolific sample exhibit sensitivity to the prior probability of prayed-for events, attributing greater belief increases to improbable outcomes. Muslims predict belief increases even after failed prayers, consistent with doctrines framing hardships as divine tests. Across traditions, believers estimate continued prayer regardless of past outcomes, with monotheists displaying stronger resilience. These findings illuminate the cognitive and cultural mechanisms that buffer religious beliefs against counter-evidence, contributing to debates on the evidential vulnerability of religious credence and its parallels with epistemically self-sealing belief systems.",

          "abstract": "Psychological researchers are interested in how things change over time and routinely make claims about age effects (e.g., personality maturation), cohort effects (e.g., generational differences in narcissism), and sometimes period effects (e.g., secular trends in mental health). The age-period-cohort identification problem means that these claims are not possible based on the data alone: Any possible temporal pattern can be explained by an infinite number of combinations of age, period, and cohort effects. This concern holds regardless of the study design (it also applies to longitudinal designs covering multiple cohorts) and the number of observations available (it also applies if we observe the whole population). Researchers usually rely on statistical models that impose constraints to pick one specific decomposition of effects. Unfortunately, these constraints often remain opaque, resulting in a lack of scrutiny of the underlying assumptions. How can we reason more transparently and systematically about age, period, and cohort? Here, I summarize advances in our understanding of the precise nature of the identification problem, provide an overview of ways to move forward, and highlight one approach that is particularly transparent about assumptions: bounding analysis, a framework developed by sociologists Ethan Fosse and Christopher Winship. To illustrate this approach, I analyze how age, period, and cohort affect attitudes toward working mothers in the German General Social Survey.",

A volume of evidence encompassing social, cognitive, and applied psychology has established Implementation Intentions as an effective strategy for goal pursuit over simply intending to pursue a goal (Goal Intentions). In this Perspective, we propose a computational framework for intention formation (Implementation vs. Goal vs. No Intention) and how it impacts goal pursuit. Our framework explains a broad range of findings within the intention formation literature including seemingly contradictory ones, while making novel empirically testable predictions. Importantly, it establishes normative conditions under which forming Implementation (vs. Goal) Intentions is an optimal strategy considering its benefits and costs. Finally, current formal models of value-based decision-making rarely consider ecological timescales of human intentions. Interfacing with this work, we lay the groundwork for a neurocognitive understanding of intention formation and its impact on goal pursuit.",

          "abstract": "Human brain, as the carrier of memory and consciousness, has become a hot topic in neuroscience research recently, the study of memory may be the hottest one. However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory. This model is the foundation of brain-inspired AI.",

          "abstract": "Can active inference model consciousness? We offer three conditions implying that it can. The first condition is the simulation of a reality or generative world model, which determines what can be known or acted upon; namely an epistemic field. The second is inferential competition to enter the world model. Only the inferences that coherently reduce long-term uncertainty win, evincing a selection for consciousness that we call Bayesian binding. The third is epistemic depth, which is the recurrent sharing of the Bayesian beliefs throughout the system. Due to this recursive loop — in a hierarchical system (such as a brain) — the world model contains the knowledge that it exists. This is distinct from self-consciousness, because the world model knows itself non-locally and continuously evidences this knowing (i.e., field-evidencing). Formally, we propose a hyper-model for precision-control across the entire hierarchy, whose latent states (or parameters) encode and control the overall structure and weighting rules for all layers of inference. This Beautiful Loop Theory is deeply revealing about meditation, psychedelic, and altered states, minimal phenomenal experience, and provides a new vision for conscious artificial intelligence.",

There are nine 40-day-long cycles each year ending at the winter solstice.

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI. Here we present Focus on Visual Features (FoVF), a cognitive mode that demonstrates both activation and deactivation depending on the task context. The BOLD signal configurations associated with FoVF are modulated by a range of tasks, and here, we present six. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing FoVF from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with FoVF over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we playfully nicknamed the anatomical patterns specific to the FoVF cognitive mode as follows: (1) Stay Puff and (2) Old Blue Eyes. Evidence for the FoVF cognitive mode was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes elicited by the following types of tasks: working memory (verbal and spatial), thought generation, evidence integration, task switching, and handedness. This evidence consistently supported the FoVF cognitive mode as involving activation when there is focus on the features of the visual display to enhance task performance, and deactivation when features of the visual display are irrelevant to the task, or when attending to the features may detract from task performance.",

The current study investigates the temporal course of joy, as reported on daily diary cards, in adults with BPD receiving a 6-month course of comprehensive DBT (N=95). BPD severity was measured every four weeks. Results showed that joy increased significantly during treatment, whereas negative affect decreased. Semi-parametric time-varying effect models showed that increases in joy were steeper earlier in treatment and plateaued around month four of treatment. Additionally, within-person increases in joy during a given month predicted decreases in BPD severity at the end of that month. Our results suggest that PA may be an important treatment target deserving of further clinical attention in in DBT, given that it prospectively predicts reductions in BPD symptom severity. Our finding that joy increases during DBT, particularly in early stages of treatment, may be an important incentive to bolster treatment uptake and commitment.",

Then, they implicitly and even explicitly expect that if sample A is higher on variable X than sample B, sample A's value on variable Y is also higher than that of sample B. But this inference is not always correct unless the correlation coefficient is one. The present study analyzed the triad relationship between the probability of such inferences' accuracy, the strength of the correlation, and the standardized distance between two X values of samples A and B. The conclusion is that such practice has very limited usefulness in realistic situations. The article proposes using a 95% range of variability of Y when one needs to expect the Y value based on the paired X value, or reporting the probability of dominance when comparing two samples is necessary.",

Multilevel analyses including participants with and without cLBP showed that greater momentary fear of movement, lower momentary pain self-efficacy, and higher momentary levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with higher pain intensity (β=.05, p=.042, β=–.15, p&lt;.001, and β=.04, p=.001). Greater momentary fear of movement and lower momentary pain self-efficacy were associated with poorer back health (β=–.07, p=.004 and β=.16, p&lt;.001). The observed within-person associations highlight the potential for ecological momentary interventions targeting modifiable psychological factors related to cLBP in daily life, particularly pain self-efficacy.",

          "abstract": "The case against Professor Ute Hülsheger from Maastricht University  involves multiple allegations of academic misconduct, including misrepresentation of research results, methodological flaws leading to biased findings, unethical authorship practices, and undisclosed conflicts of interest. Her research, particularly on mindfulness interventions, contains misleading conclusions, inflated effect sizes, and methodological inconsistencies that compromise the credibility of her work. She has repeatedly removed co-authors from papers without justification, taken credit for others' intellectual contributions, and engaged in unethical authorship practices to advance her career. Additionally, she failed to disclose her affiliation with Headspace Inc., a mindfulness app company, despite using its products in her studies and benefiting from free access to their services. Her omission of this conflict of interest raises concerns about potential bias in her findings and industry influence over academic research. Given the severity of these issues, immediate retractions and  corrections are warranted to uphold scientific integrity.",

          "authors": "Poppy Watson; Katrina Prior; Nicole Ridley; Lauren Ann Monds; Victoria Manning; Reinout Wiers; Mike Le Pelley",
          "abstract": "Background\nOne of the most prominent theories of drug addiction is the incentive sensitization model. Individual differences in the tendency to ascribe motivational salience to cues that predict reward, and their ability to promote reward-seeking behaviour have been identified as potentially important in understanding vulnerability to addiction and relapse. However, to date this behaviour has not been assessed in a treatment-seeking clinical population, highlighting a significant gap in the literature pertaining to incentive sensitization and drug addiction.\n\nMethods\nIndividuals accessing drug and alcohol services with alcohol as primary drug of concern were recruited to participate in an intervention study. At the baseline session, participants completed various self-report measures (including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; AUDIT) in addition to a visual search task measuring sign-tracking to cues predicting monetary reward. Self-reported abstinence at 3-month follow up was primary outcome measure. All analyses and hypotheses were pre-registered.\n\nResults\nAt baseline (49 participants), AUDIT scores correlated with sign-tracking to signals of monetary reward, a relationship that cannot be explained by overall response time in the task or demographic variables. Sign-tracking, gender and craving during the sessions predicted return to use at 3-month follow up (41 participants). \n\nConclusions\nOur work demonstrates that involuntary sign-tracking to cues signalling non-drug reward is associated with problematic alcohol use and return to use at 3-month FU, in a treatment-seeking sample. Whether this automatic prioritisation of cues signalling reward is a consequence or vulnerability for problematic drug use remains to be seen.",

          "abstract": "Current theoretical accounts of perception and high-level cognition suggest that awareness plays an active role in disambiguating incoming sensory information. However, the relationship between ambiguity resolution and conscious access remains unclear, partially due to a lack of quantifiable measures of ambiguity. Here, we designed novel stimuli with quantifiable semantic ambiguity levels and tested whether more ambiguous stimuli enjoy preferential access to awareness, as indexed by the time it takes them to break interocular suppression in the breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm. In a series of three experiments, we found that stimuli’s visual symmetry levels, rather than semantic ambiguity, facilitated their access to awareness. We therefore propose that symmetrical patterns enjoy preferential access to awareness, and we speculate that this effect might be implemented by a process of evidence accumulation across multiple symmetry axes in parallel.",

          "authors": "Dominik R Bach; Juliana Katharina Sporrer; Filip Melinscak",
          "abstract": "Background: Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), a laboratory representation of risky foraging, serves as mainstay of pre-clinical anxiety disorder research, motivated by an impact of anxiolytic drugs on cautious behaviour. While behavioural cautiousness appears to be a stable trait, growing evidence suggests that it is insufficiently explained by self-reported trait anxiety. \nMethods: Here, we ask which psychiatric symptom dimensions explain AAC behaviour, using an exploration-confirmation approach across two large online samples (N1 = 315; N2 = 690). In a previously validated task, participants chose whether, and when, to approach rewards under varying threat probability and magnitude. They then completed a comprehensive psychiatric questionnaire battery with a known three-factor structure. \nResults: A broad psychopathology factor, with little contribution from anxiety scales, was the best predictor of all behavioural readouts. Higher symptom scores predicted decreased passive avoidance, increased behavioural inhibition, and reduced sensitivity to threat features. It was also associated with an altered subjective model of threat and reward relations in the environment. Broad and unspecific associations with same directional patterns were found between individual questionnaire scores and behaviour, underscoring the status of transdiagnostic dimensions. Crucially, no associations were found between behaviour and transdiagnostic anxiety-depression or gender. \nConclusions: This study highlights that cautiousness in AAC tasks is comprised of two components, which are linked to transdiagnostic psychopathology but not specifically or particularly strongly to self-reported trait anxiety. This finding challenges a traditional understanding of AAC as anxiety test, and provides a new view on cautious behaviour in every-day situations.",

This study examined the individual temporal response to this ‘critical session’ to predict overall treatment outcome. Based on Dynamic Systems Theory, it was expected that patients who retained an improvement in negative beliefs after the critical session, benefitted more from the overall treatment. Method: Treatment-resistant patients with comorbid anxiety disorders who followed Metacognitive Therapy and showed a drop in negative beliefs about worry after the critical session were selected (N = 45, 73.3% women, M age = 44.5). Negative beliefs about worry up to two weeks after the critical session, measured with the Metacognitions Questionnaire-30, were used to determine response patterns. Anxiety symptoms were measured at start, end, and one year after treatment using the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Analyses were pre-registered. Results: Most patients (65.1%) were classified as persistent responder (retaining improvement after critical session), as opposed to reversed responders, but this dichotomous predictor did not predict treatment outcomes. In contrast, individual slopes of negative beliefs about worry after the critical session positively predicted anxiety symptoms and clinically relevant improvement posttreatment but not one year follow-up. Conclusions: Holding on longer to an improvement in negative beliefs about worry predicted better treatment outcomes. This predictor could provide insight into whether patients have mastered a theorized, critical element for symptom improvement in MCT, which could be used to implement adjustments to the treatment plan to improve individual treatment effectiveness.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making behavior in economic tasks is increasingly widely adopted as a psychological individual difference variable of interest. However, such measures are known to be sensitive to many seemingly incidental factors, such as presentation format, framing, and various kinds of context. The field as yet does not have a consistent theoretical explanation of this construct-irrelevant variability. We examine the prevalence and extent of variability across laboratory psychology measurements of supposedly stable behavioral economic traits. We begin by reviewing how these traits are conceptualized in behavioral economics, and how different instruments for eliciting them lead to variability in their measurements. We then consider factors such as experiment structure, affect, and context, known to influence or correlate in some way with the inferred values of these constructs: from domain or “subject-level” influences to local influences. We further consider the idea that an important – and cognitively meaningful – source of potential variation in experimentally-inferred measures may come from temporal sequence or the influence of trial order. Finally, we discuss how some of these sources of variation may not ultimately all be brought under experimental or analytical control. Rather than discard these widely-used measures, we instead provide strong reason for  researchers to explicitly think about how endemic variability should instead be exposed and considered for its predictive value in different settings.",

          "abstract": "In some contexts, abstract stimulus representations can effectively promote the pursuit of reward, whereas in others, more detailed representations are needed to guide choice. Here, using a novel reinforcement-learning task, we asked how children, adolescents, and adults flexibly adjust the specificity of the representations used for learning based on experienced reward statistics, as well as how the specificity of these learning representations influences subsequent memory. Across two experiments (total N = 224), we found that children, adolescents, and adults flexibly up- and down-weighted more detailed versus broader stimulus representations, depending on the reward structure of the environment. The representations used for learning shaped mnemonic specificity; when participants placed greater weight on granular representations during value-guided learning, they demonstrated enhanced subsequent memory for stimulus details, whereas when they placed greater weight on broader, categorical representations, they showed enhanced memory only for categorical information. Moreover, the relation between learning and memory strengthened with age; relative to adults, children exhibited reduced coupling between the specificity of the representations used for value-based choice and the specificity of their subsequent memories. Our work demonstrates that from early in life, reward shapes the granularity with which the world is partitioned, which, increasingly with age, influences how experiences are remembered.",

          "abstract": "El presente trabajo surge a raíz de la participación como observador de una serie de ateneos que se dieron en una institución educativa inicial para niños sordos. Durante los mismos, un equipo interdisciplinario compuesto por docentes, directivos, audiologas, fonoaudiólogas y psicólogos, evaluaban la trayectoria de algunos alumnos para definir la promoción o permanencia en el nivel, es decir si pasaban del nivel inicial a primer grado, o si debieran permanecer un año más en el mismo nivel. Llamó particularmente mi atención el debate que se originó en torno a una niña de 5 años, a la cual se evaluaba; docentes y psicólogos no llegaban a un acuerdo acerca de qué le pasaba a esa niña. Mientras que las dos docentes de su sala proponían que no era una sorda pura (término utilizado habitualmente para referir que no hay otra patología agregada a la discapacidad de base), los psicólogos sostenían que ciertas conductas disruptivas de la niña tenían que ver con el entorno, por aburrimiento o falta de estímulos de refuerzo. Queda claro que ambos psicólogos seguían un marco referencial cognitivo conductual. Las conductas que describían eran que deambulaba permanentemente por la sala, todo el tiempo de acá para allá, que sólo lograba concentrarse cuando las intervenciones de la docente eran dirigidas exclusivamente a ella, que no lograba seguir consignas grupales, que no prestaba atención y que estaba como en su mundo la mayoría del tiempo. La sospecha de las docentes es que la niña padecía de Trastorno por déficit\nde atención con hiperactividad (TDAH) y que este no estaba debidamente diagnosticado. Los psicólogos rechazaban fervientemente tal hipótesis aludiendo que si bien algunos criterios podrían coincidir con tal diagnóstico, los mismos no eran concluyentes o suficientes.\nEsta breve presentación me hizo reflexionar por un lado que la cuestión diagnóstica (sea pertinente para esta niña o no), giraba exclusivamente en la categoría TDAH. Yo me preguntaba, siendo consciente de no tener mucha más información del caso, y sabiendo que no era mi rol el de intervenir clínicamente, si el caso de la niña no podría pensarse dentro de los trastornos narcisistas no psicóticos (Rodulfo, 1987).\nMe propongo entonces, en este ensayo breve, contextuar el marco teórico de donde surgen ambas categorías diagnósticas, para luego sistematizar las características principales de cada una: la del TDAH y la del trastorno narcisista no psicótico, para finalmente poder cruzarlas y determinar puntos de contacto y diferencias a la hora de pensar un posible diagnóstico.\nLa hipótesis que se toma como punto de partida es que más allá de que ambos diagnósticos se rigen por marcos teóricos referenciales distintos, no hay una coincidencia entre ambas situaciones clínicas por lo que debería hacerse un diagnóstico diferencial entre ambas categorías.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia is a lack or loss of pleasure in daily life and is common across many mental health conditions. This is the first systematic review to investigate the following research questions: 1) How is anhedonia conceptualized and explicitly measured using experience sampling methodology (ESM) in mental health research?; 2) What is the experience of anhedonia in daily life at the between-person level and at the within-person level?; and 3) What is the quality of reporting in ESM studies assessing anhedonia in daily life? We searched PsychARTICLES, MEDLINE, Psychology Databases, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and Europe PMC (last search 6th January 2025). We identified 113 unique articles that satisfied inclusion criteria. Anhedonia was typically conceptualized in terms of diminished pleasure, enjoyment, or liking, with emphasis on consummatory rather than anticipatory experiences. Anticipatory and consummatory anhedonia were present in samples that experienced different mental health conditions or symptoms (between-person) and varied across different daily contexts and across time (within-person). Most studies explored anhedonia in depression or psychotic disorders, although measurement was heterogeneous, and approaches differed across mental health conditions. Compliance with a composite reporting quality assessment tool for ESM studies was generally low. Exploring anhedonia in daily life from a transdiagnostic perspective is a critical gap in the literature, which will help to identify whether different components of anhedonia relate to one another in a similar way across disorders. Future research would benefit from standardized and validated ESM items of anhedonia, exploration of moment-to-moment changes over shorter time-scales, and increased transparency in methodological reporting.",

However, limited longitudinal work has examined the role of both household and neighborhood SES in shaping mental health trajectories over time using large population-based data. The goal of the present study was to characterize associations between SES and changes in mental health problems during early adolescence.\nMethods. We investigated independent and joint associations of household income-to-needs ratio, parent educational attainment, material hardship, and neighborhood disadvantage with internalizing, externalizing, and attention symptom trajectories using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Youth-reported mental health was assessed across six time-points from age 10 to 13 years (M=10.4, SD=0.63 years at T1, N=9,488) and SES was assessed six months prior to T1.\nResults. Main effects indicated that high SES was associated with lower mental health symptoms. However, longitudinally, higher SES was associated with greater increases in mental health problems over time. A higher income-to-needs ratio predicted greater increases in internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems. Two-way interactions between SES indicators predicting changes in symptoms were non-significant.\nConclusion. Our finding that youth from higher-SES backgrounds exhibited greater increases in mental health problems during early adolescence contrasts with findings from prior cross-sectional studies. However, mental health problems are on the rise and the landscape of risk for psychopathology is changing. More research is needed to understand how childhood SES contributes to risk and resilience for psychopathology during the transition to adolescence.",

          "abstract": "The concept of affordance, proposed by James J. Gibson as an opportunity for action offered by the environment to the organism, has been adopted in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and robotics. However, different interpretations exist as to whether it is a feature of a relation between the environment and the organism and therefore cannot exist independently of the organism, or a “resource\" that exists in the environment independent of the organism's presence and is waiting to be used, or both, or neither. In this paper, we defend the position that affordances are both relational and resources using a category-theoretic approach. This idea is formalized by the concept of “natural transformations\" in category theory, which are structure-preserving transformations between “functors\" – mathematical expressions representing “seeing from a particular perspective.\" We propose that formalizing the realism of affordance in terms of natural transformations offers a more rigorous and lucid understanding of this concept. Furthermore, our formalization enables us to relate the reality of affordances to a broader context, especially the shift in the meaning of “reality\" in modern physics. Our category-theoretic approach offers a potential solution to the problems and limitations associated with existing set theory-based frameworks for affordances, paving the way for a future theory that better accounts for the open-ended interplay between organisms and their environments.",

We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training. A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained with eastern instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained with western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. A groupwise Principle Component Analysis allowed us to investigate these effects of duration and nature of training highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

One is that all object features are integrated into an object file. The other is that locations are critical for maintaining the bindings of visual features of an object. We developed an experimental paradigm that bridges the vWM and object-file literatures. Several multi-featured objects were presented simultaneously, followed by a retention interval in which placeholders either moved or not. Participants were then given one feature of a randomly chosen object as a cue and prompted to report the other two features of the same object. Applying multinomial process tree (MPT) models to evaluate the competing accounts of how multi-featured objects are represented in memory, we found evidence supporting the object-file theory and challenging the location-binding hypothesis. We conclude that bindings of features within the object can be maintained after motion. Furthermore, pairwise bindings between color and shape are robust against motion, implying that location is not essential for visual feature bindings.",

          "abstract": "This is a personal reflection on why I believe the science of consciousness may be taking a pernicious turn. The primary issue lies in the continued conflation of our supposed target phenomenon—subjective experience—with general cognitive and perceptual processes. As a result, much of the current research is conceptually off-target and insufficiently constrained by the relevant empirical evidence. This confusion, about the supposed subject matter itself, allows for the overinterpretation of findings and promotion of one’s personal worldviews as being supported by science. Unlike in other disciplines, where hyperbolic media activity can be dismissed as mere ‘noise,’ in this field it significantly influences funding and editorial decisions—and, by extension, jobs, and also the peer review process. This has made meaningful research increasingly difficult, and the clarification of the said conceptual confusion increasingly unlikely. I am not optimistic that we can ever resolve these systemic issues. However, by laying out the situation in some detail, we might better navigate how to move the science of subjective experience forward.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this study was to abbreviate the Disgust Scale Revised in a Peruvian sample. To do this, a previously collected sample of 339 participants was used. The data was analyzed using the Item Response Theory to explore the discrimination, difficulty, and information curve of the items. After selecting the items, the structural validity, reliability, and external validity of the short scales were evaluated and compared with the original scales. The results gave three items for core disgust, three for animal reminder and three for contamination. These dimensions had adequate structural validity, reliability and correlation with external variables. It is concluded that the short 9 item DS-R made in this study has good psychometric properties and is suitable for use in research when it is difficult to use the 25-item version.",

          "abstract": "Prior research has highlighted that brain oscillations, particularly in the theta, alpha and beta frequency bands, are closely linked to the sense of ownership and agency in both physical and virtual environments. Building on this foundation, the present study aimed to investigate whether participants develop a sense of ownership and agency over a physical tool or a computer mouse (termed virtual tools) during a reaching and grasping task, utilizing a well-established tool-use paradigm employed in our prior research. Additionally, we explored whether higher ratings of ownership and agency could be predicted by resting-state brain oscillations at baseline and during the tool-use training task. Twenty young adult participants took part in both physical and virtual tool-use training, completed across two blocks of active training. After each training session, participants completed a questionnaire to subjectively assess their sense of ownership and agency over both, the physical tool and the computer mouse. EEG recordings were conducted before, during, and after each tool-use training block, allowing us to assess the neural correlates of these experiences. The results showed that patterns of resting-state and task-related brain activity were linked to participants' sense of ownership and agency during tool-use training. Specifically, higher resting-state beta power in the right temporal region and alpha power in frontal areas predicted stronger feelings of ownership, while higher agency ratings were associated with alpha and beta power in the occipital region. During the task, ownership was linked to theta, alpha, and beta power across multiple brain areas, whereas agency during physical tool-use training correlated with increased frontal alpha, central and occipital beta, and theta in frontotemporal, central, and parieto-occipital regions. In virtual tool-use training, agency was associated with frontal alpha, frontal theta, and beta power in the left temporal and occipital areas. These findings suggest that both ownership and agency rely on distinct but overlapping neural mechanisms, highlighting the role of widespread oscillatory activity in integrating tools into the sensorimotor system’s adaptation to tool use. \nKeywords: Resting-state EEG, task-related EEG, sense of ownership, agency, tool-use",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study aimed to account for heterotypic continuity of multiple dimensions of psychopathology by using developmental scaling to place ratings by multiple informants of children’s externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\n\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N = 231) development of three dimensions of psychopathology—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered psychopathology—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from different measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\n\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task. Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach.\n\nConclusion: Using (a) changing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link the scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying the development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "In the context of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive modes can be defined as task-general cognitive/sensory/motor processes which reliably elicit specific blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal pattern configurations. A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Default Mode A (DMA), a task-negative cognitive mode. The BOLD signal configurations associated with DMA are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present four. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing DMA from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with DMA over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to DMA as follows: (1) Snowman Mouth, (2) Muted Medial Temporal Dots, (3) Penguin, (4) Kitten, and (5) You’re in Trouble. Evidence for DMA was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by phonological and semantic judgement tasks, lexical decision, and task switching. The DMA cognitive mode was inversely correlated with the language mode, and therefore showed greater deactivation when linguistic processing was required, but less deactivation when suppression of linguistic processes enhanced performance. We also provide an anatomical and functional comparison to Default Mode B (DMB).",

Mental disorders are diverse, complex and multifaceted, and co-morbidity is common. However, fragmentation across multiple services and sectors (health, mental health and human services) results in gaps in service provision. In the context of ongoing mental health service reform in Australia. Comprehensive evaluation of the whole care system is critical for shaping policy and ensuring efficient allocation of resources. In this paper we describe the protocol for a population-based data linkage study that involves evaluating patterns of health, mental health, and human service use among young people in Victoria, Australia with the goal of identifying subgroups experiencing unmet mental health needs.\nMethods and analysis: Our primary cohort is youth aged 12-25 years during the time period January 2018 to November 2023. Data for individuals aged 5-11 and 26-53 during this period will also be included, to allow for examination of early years factors and an older adult comparison group. The data sources and data linkage methodology are described. Traditional statistical methods coupled with contemporary machine learning and natural language processing techniques will be used.\nStudy outcomes: Ongoing consultation and engagement with young people and key stakeholders will inform interpretation, dissemination and translation of findings. We will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical characteristics of young people, their broader health and human service use behaviour and typical pathways through care, that could not be gleaned from examining datasets in isolation. Findings will inform ongoing mental health service reform that will lead to improvements in healthcare delivery and outcomes for Victorian youth.",

EMC2 implements recent developments in Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, including powerful and efficient sampling and marginal likelihood estimation algorithms, making it computationally feasible to estimate many different cognitive models and perform inference among them.

Comprehensive phenotyping and genotyping will be performed for participants in US, MX, AU, NZ, and SE using the EDGI2 questionnaire battery and participant saliva samples. In DK, case identification and genotyping will be through the National Patient Register and bloodspots archived near birth. Case-control and case-case genome-wide association studies will be conducted within EDGI2 and enhanced via meta-analysis with external data from the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED). Additional analyses will explore genetic correlations between eating disorders (EDs) and other psychiatric and metabolic traits, calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS), and leverage functional biology to evaluate clinical outcomes. Moreover, analyzing PRS for patient stratification and linking identified risk loci to clinically relevant phenotypes highlight the potential of EDGI2 for clinical translation. \nDiscussion: EDGI2 is a global expansion of the EDGI study to increase sample size, expand the numbers of participants from non-European ancestry, and to include ARFID. Inclusion of MX will be the first large-scale ED genetics study from Latin America. ED genetics research has historically lagged behind other psychiatric disorders, and EDGI2 is designed to rapidly advance the study of the genetics of the major EDs. Exploring EDs at both the diagnostic level and the symptom level will provide an unprecedented look at the genetic architecture underlying EDs.",

          "abstract": "Attempting to suppress unwanted thoughts is generally characterized by the opposite outcomes of what is desired in motor task performance, resulting in a counterintentional error. This study examined the impact of priming negative cues on elite athletes' performance and reaction time (RT) in Stroop rifle shooting task, guided by ironic processes of mental control theory. Ten elite biathletes completed the task under two conditions: no-frequency negative cue (NFN) and high-frequency negative cue (HFN). Using a quasi-experimental within-subject design and multiple psychophysiological measures, the study assessed target hit rates and RTs at the incongruent stimuli. Bayesian analysis revealed moderate and anecdotal evidence in support of the null model (BF01) for hit rates and RTs towards target hits, indicating no ironic shooting errors and delay to the intended targets. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) also showed no significant variations across conditions. Findings suggest that negative instructions, regardless of frequency, do not disrupt elite biathletes' shooting performance. Thus, directives like \"do not shoot blue\" fail to induce ironic errors, highlighting elite biathletes' resilience to such cues in maintaining consistent shooting performance.",

However, recent meta-analyses in cognitive psychology suggest that behavioral and computational measures are less stable than self-reported surveys as assessed by test-retest correlations. If extended to mental health measures, this poses a serious challenge to the computational psychiatry agenda. To start addressing this question, we leveraged a well-validated reinforcement learning framework based on a neuro-computational model. We collected data from participants who performed a multi-context reinforcement-learning (RL) task twice (~5 months apart), so as to compare the reliability of behavioral measures, computational parameters, and psychological and mental health questionnaires. Despite the remarkable replicability of population-averaged measures, the test-retest reliability of individual metrics was low-to-very-low for behavioral and computational measures, while moderate-to-strong for questionnaires. Behavioral measures were essentially correlated only among themselves, while measures from questionnaires were also correlated with mental health symptoms. Overall, these findings challenge the translational potential of computational approaches for precision psychiatry.",

          "authors": "Tanja Müller; Joseph Milton; Masud Husain; Matthew A J Apps",
          "abstract": "Everyday we perform tasks that make us feel fatigued. Theoretical accounts predict that fatigue not only develops due to exertion of effort but also increases how effortful the same action will feel subsequently. However, to date there has been no formalised computational account of subjective perceptions of fatigue and effort, with few studies measuring these sensations directly or quantifying their moment-to-moment changes. Here, across three experiments, participants were required to exert different levels of physical effort (grip force below maximum capacity) to obtain rewards, rating on each trial how effortful they found exerting force (Experiment 1) or how fatigued they felt (Experiments 2 and 3). Across studies, ratings of fatigue and perception of effort increased over time, but also fluctuated on a trial-by-trial basis as a function of both effort exerted and rest. A computational model of fatigue, comprising a recoverable component (with fatigue reducing during rest) and an unrecoverable one (in which it only increases through effort exerted) successfully accounted for subjective responses. It was best able to explain momentary changes in both fatigue and effort perception. This computational model provides insights into the brain mechanisms underpinning the close, dynamic relationship between sensations of fatigue and effort.",

          "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of analyzing intensive longitudinal data (ILD) with zero-inflated autoregressive processes. ILD, characterized by intensive longitudinal measurements, often exhibit excessive zeros and temporal dependencies. Neglecting zero-inflation or mishandling it can lead to biased parameter estimates and inaccurate conclusions. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Zero-Inflated Process Change multilevel AutoRegressive model (ZIP-CAR) model that incorporates zero-inflation using a Bayesian framework. We compare the performance of the proposed method with existing methods through a simulation study and demonstrate its advantages in accurately estimating parameters and improving statistical power. Additionally, we apply the ZIP-CAR model to a real intensive longitudinal dataset on problematic drinking behaviors, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing autoregressive and cross-lag effects while accounting for zero-inflation. The results underscore the importance of addressing zero-inflation in ILD analysis and provide practical recommendations for researchers. Our proposed model offers a valuable tool for analyzing ILD with zero-inflated autoregressive processes, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of dynamic behavioral changes over time.",

          "abstract": "Children are adept statistical learners, capable of parsing streams of structured input into meaningful units, but the explicit knowledge of environmental structure that they acquire through experience often differs from that of adults. To date, however, it is unclear how developmental changes in learning mechanisms influence structured knowledge acquisition. To address this question, we tested 110 children, adolescents, and adults, ages 8 - 22 years, on a predictive learning task, in which they experienced sequences of stimuli with a higher-order temporal structure. After an initial learning phase, participants’ explicit knowledge of the relations between stimuli was probed via two additional task measures. We used a recently introduced computational model to characterize participants’ response times during learning, and found that all participants relied on simple, recency-based prediction, anticipating that they would encounter stimuli they recently encountered in the past. With increasing age, however, participants demonstrated greater evidence of additionally relying on a more sophisticated learning mechanism, which captured a predictive representation of the contingent  relations between stimuli. The extent to which participants demonstrated evidence of this more complex form of predictive learning related to — and accounted for age-related improvements in — their explicit knowledge of the task’s underlying structure. Our results suggest that age-related changes in the use of different predictive learning mechanisms influences the structured knowledge that people derive from experience, providing an account for why children, adolescents, and adults form different representations of their environments from identical streams of experiences.",

          "abstract": "The cognitive control system continuously monitors actions and adapts to enhance task performance and prevent errors. More pronounced amplitudes of early neurophysiological response monitoring signals, such as error-related negativity (ERN) and correct-related negativity (CRN), have been linked to increased response caution and heightened attention to task-relevant features in subsequent trials. However, it remains unclear whether these population-level effects accurately capture adaptive processes at the individual level. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of findings, as effects significant at the population level may be driven by only a small subset of participants. Using Bayesian hierarchical drift diffusion modeling on behavioral and EEG data from four datasets, we found robust population-level associations between ERN amplitude and adaptive behaviors but also identified substantial individual variability. The relationship between ERN amplitude and response caution was highly context-dependent, varying across individuals, datasets, and conditions. In contrast, the association between ERN amplitude and attentional focus was more consistent, though influenced by traits related to negative affect. Our results emphasize the importance of considering individual differences to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior.",

The former were to become woodland-dwellers in multifemale-multimale troops with social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, which is limited mostly to mothers or female alloparents. \n \tContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (consisting of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had three consequences that would impinge on homininan evolution and differentiate it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans, namely: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any time of the year, which meant that voracious social units were necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness which, in turn, demanded ingenuity and the transmissibiity of existential information in the form of active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, by virtue of the broadening of homininan \"zones of bounded surprisal\" with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan social unit and between adjoining homininan units in the landscape, which spread geographically over time as budding small-world information networks (and eventually reached Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Late (Upper) Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sometimes collaboration between social units (maybe ~4 Ma in Australopithecus anamensis), which, together with the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and together with mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners with establishment of mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby (mixed-sex philopatry), which maintained not only heterozygosity but also, most important, kinship links that favoured cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units: all of that marked a major behavioural shift away from paninan social arrangements.",

We distinguish between two propositions: (1) identical similarity relationships necessarily implying identical qualia (which we do not claim), and (2) identical qualia necessarily yielding identical similarity relationships (which we do assume). Our study introduces a novel unsupervised alignment method to compare similarity structures and quantify structural correspondence between individuals' color experiences. We have revised our manuscript to address all reviewers' concerns, clarified terminology, and emphasized the limitations of our approach in making claims about subjective experience.

A number of cognitive modes are detectable with task-based fMRI, and here we focus on Default Mode A (DMA), a task-negative cognitive mode. The BOLD signal configurations associated with DMA are modulated by a range of tasks, and here we present four. For each task, we report: (1) specific pattern-based (as opposed to coordinate-based) anatomical details essential for distinguishing DMA from other BOLD-based cognitive modes, and (2) task-induced BOLD signal changes associated with DMA over a range of task conditions. In order to facilitate recognition, we nick-named the anatomical patterns specific to DMA as follows: (1) Snowman Mouth, (2) Muted Medial Temporal Dots, (3) Penguin, (4) Kitten, and (5) You’re in Trouble. Evidence for DMA was derived from the timing and magnitude of task-induced BOLD signal changes induced by phonological and semantic judgement tasks, lexical decision, and task switching. The DMA cognitive mode was inversely correlated with the language mode, and therefore showed greater deactivation when linguistic processing was required, but less deactivation when suppression of linguistic processes enhanced performance. We also provide an anatomical and functional comparison to Default Mode B (DMB).",

Computational cognitive process models are often fit to repeated cognitive assessments to quantify individual differences in terms of substantively meaningful cognitive markers and link them to other person-level variables. Most studies stop at this point, and do not test whether these cognitive markers have utility for predicting some meaningful outcomes. Here, we demonstrate a partially observable predictor modeling framework that can fill this gap. In this framework, we can simultaneously extract cognitive markers from repeated assessment data and use these together with demographic covariates for predictive modeling of a clinically interesting outcome, implemented in a Bayesian multilevel modeling framework. We describe this approach by constructing a predictive process model in which features of learning are combined with demographic variables to predict mild cognitive impairment, and demonstrate it using data from the Einstein Aging Study.",

Sixty participants were randomly assigned to anodal, cathodal, or sham HD-tDCS groups and completed a 30-minute flanker task during stimulation. Using a comprehensive methodological approach, including Drift-Diffusion Modeling (DDM), EEG analysis, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), we assessed the cognitive, neural, and phenomenological effects of stimulation. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in reaction times or accuracy across the stimulation groups. Similarly, DDM parameters showed no effect of HD-tDCS on cognitive processes. However, EEG data revealed a significant reduction in neural complexity, in the anodal group during resting-state, suggesting neural reorganization. Subjective experience analysis identified two distinct clusters of task-related feelings, though time spent in these experiential states did not differ between groups. Interestingly, sensation of stimulation was significantly higher for anodal stimulation than sham when analyzed as a single dimension. Despite null behavioral effects, this study provides important insights into the neural and subjective responses to HD-tDCS and emphasizes the value of advanced analytic techniques in examining brain stimulation effects. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate about the efficacy of tDCS in cognitive enhancement.",

Most research on this topic has focused on the first three to four years of life because this is a critical period for developing gut-brain connections. Prior studies have identified associations between the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in infancy and markers of temperament, including negative affect. However, the specific microbes affected, and the directionality of these associations have differed between studies, likely due to differences in the developmental period of focus and assessment approaches. In the current preregistered study, we examined connections between the gut microbiome, assessed at two time points in infancy (2 weeks and 18 months), and negative affect measured at 30 months of age in a longitudinal study of infants and their caregivers. We found that infants with higher gut microbiome diversity at 2 weeks showed more observed negative affect during a study visit at 30 months. We also found evidence for associations between specific genera of bacteria in infancy and negative affect. These results suggest associations between specific features of the gut microbiome and child behavior may differ based on timing of gut microbiome measurement.",

Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, reflection test order did not impact philosophical decisions. Instead, a philosophical reflection effect emerged: making philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved reflection test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

In the contemporaneous network, momentary core cognitive vulnerability was associated with various momentary symptoms. In the temporal network, increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the severity of three specific symptoms – anxious mood, fear, and feeling like a failure. Interestingly, momentary core cognitive vulnerability predicted subsequent increases in the perceived event negativity, but perceived event negativity did not predict subsequent increases in momentary core cognitive vulnerability.\nConclusions: Our findings show that the core cognitive vulnerability is differentially associated with symptoms at the between-person and within-person levels of analysis. On a moment-to-moment basis, core cognitive vulnerability temporally precedes and influences the severity of emotional symptoms and perceived event negativity. We discuss study implications and outline directions for future research to clarify the etiology of internalizing psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "In noisy perceptual environments, people frequently make decisions based on non-perceptual information to maximize rewards. Therefore, a central problem in psychophysics, metacognition and consciousness research is to distinguish between decisions resulting from changes in subjective experience and those arising from non-perceptual information. It has recently been proposed that confidence reports can be used to discriminate between changes in subjective experience and those arising from non-perceptual information. Here we use a Bayesian ordinal modeling framework combined with an explicit measure of subjective experience to show across two experiments and three bias manipulations that confidence during perceptual decision-making does not uniquely reflect subjective experience. Instead, non-perceptual manipulations affecting response bias ‘leak’ into perceptual confidence reports. This occurs not only for biases resulting from changes in the base-rate of stimuli (‘cognitive’ priors), but also when biasing information does not inform decision correctness (asymmetric payoff matrix).",

          "abstract": "Stress generation describes processes by which individuals actively contribute to the occurrence of stressful events in their lives. Personal characteristics like neuroticism or psychopathology have been found predict the occurrence of major life stressors over several months or years. However, a profound understanding of stress generation over shorter time periods in people’s daily lives is still missing. Here, we integrated recent research on person-environment transactions with the clinical stress generation literature to develop a process model of stress generation. This process model posits that short-term dynamics between momentary personal characteristics and daily hassles are the building blocks for established long-term stress generation effects. To evaluate this model, we conducted a systematic literature search on stress generation in daily life (43 studies, Ntotal = 9’579). Results show that both dispositional traits and dynamic states predict the occurrence of daily hassles, supporting core aspects of the process model. However, future research on stress generation in daily life using measurement burst design, multi-method assessments of momentary state variables, and comprehensive assessments of daily hassles is needed.",

Much of what people invest time, energy, and money in revolves around connecting with others. However, identifying the factors that make people feel connected or disconnected can be challenging due to individual differences in how loneliness is experienced. Studying the neural mechanisms that reflect how satisfied or lonely people feel offers a new window into this critical problem and allows us to test whether there exists a robust brain signature of loneliness. Loneliness may be associated with widespread changes in brain connectivity across multiple neural regions and systems. Here, we aim to capture this complexity by deriving a neural signature of loneliness from distributed brain patterns in resting-state functional connectivity data in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. We then demonstrated the generalizability of this neural signature in predicting individual differences in loneliness in an independent sample of young adult students",

          "abstract": "The use of advanced analytics in public health policy remains hindered by a disconnect between researchers, policymakers, and technical experts. Bridging this gap requires intentional knowledge translation strategies that facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and real-world application of research findings. Hackathons, which bring together diverse stakeholders in a time-bound, solution-oriented format, offer an approach to addressing this challenge. In January 2025, the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC-GIDA) and the Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) at the University of Nairobi organized the Bridging the Gap Hackathon (BTGH), designed to strengthen collaboration between academia, policy, and public health practitioners in Kenya. The hackathon convened researchers, software engineers, and policymakers to co-develop data-driven tools tackling public health challenges identified by Kenya's Ministry of Health and the Directorate of Veterinary Services. Over five days and using a structured multi-stage process, six interdisciplinary teams developed prototype solutions to improve outbreak surveillance, vaccine deployment, data quality monitoring, and health workforce estimation. This paper reflects on the hackathon’s structure, participant experiences, and project outcomes, highlighting key lessons for future knowledge translation initiatives. Our findings suggest that hackathons can serve as effective platforms for accelerating interdisciplinary research impact, fostering engagement between policymakers and researchers, and promoting the development of public health solutions.",

          "abstract": "In January 2023, Louisiana enacted Act 440, requiring websites containing substantial adult content to verify users’ ages through government-issued identification or commercial verification services. Since the passing of this legislation, 17 additional states have adopted similar laws. Using Google Trends data and a preregistered synthetic control design, this paper examines the impact of these age verification requirements on digital behavior across four key dimensions: searches for the largest compliant website, the largest non-compliant website, VPN services, and adult content generally. Our analysis reveals a 46.6% reduction in searches for the dominant compliant platform, accompanied by significant increases in searches for both the dominant non-compliant platform (48.1%) and VPN services (34.2%). Through multiverse analyses that incorporate multiple specifications and control group constructions, we demonstrate the robustness of these behavioral changes. Our point estimates remain\nconsistent with our pre-registered hypotheses across 3,200 point estimates. Our findings highlight that while these regulation efforts reduce traffic to compliant firms and likely a net reduction overall to this type of content, individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification. Our methodological approach offers a framework for real-time policy evaluation in contexts with staggered treatment adoption.

Drawing on sonic workshops and research-creation experiments conducted in Montréal in collaboration with the PULSE Lab at Concordia University, we are particularly interested in exploring and speculating with non-human sonorous materialities, including hidden algorithms and shaping forces operating beyond the human sensorium. This is especially relevant within the context of the sentient city, where data flows and algorithmic tracking of human activities and behaviours are increasingly central to contemporary urban economies. We conclude by advocating for posthuman modes of listening, embedding speculative and experimental approaches to revealing and following the city’s unseen disruptions and materialities.",

          "abstract": "Graphic narratives, with their interplay of visual and textual elements, offer a powerful\nmedium for storytelling, engaging readers on both cognitive and emotional levels. Amruta\nPatil’s Kari exemplifies this through its intricate use of visual intelligence, where metaphors,\nsymbols, and artistic choices shape the reader’s perception of the protagonist’s identity\nstruggle and survival in a heteronormative society. However, despite the increasing scholarly\ninterest in graphic narratives, there remains a gap in understanding how visual storytelling\ninfluences reader reception, particularly in terms of emotional and cognitive engagement.\nThis study seeks to address this gap by analyzing Kari through the lens of Graphic Narrative\nTheory and Neil Cohn’s Visual Language Theory (VLT), investigating how readers interpret\nand respond to its visual and textual elements.\nThis research employs sentiment analysis as a methodological tool to assess emotional\npolarity and subjectivity in reader responses, providing a computational approach to under-\nstanding the novel’s reception. The findings reveal that while Kari elicits predominantly\npositive sentiments, there exists a duality in interpretation—some readers deeply connect\nwith its artistic and metaphorical depth, while others find its abstract narrative challenging\nto decipher. This highlights the crucial role of visual literacy in decoding graphic narratives,\ndemonstrating that comprehension of visual storytelling significantly impacts the perception\nof the protagonist’s journey.\nUltimately, this study contributes to the broader discourse on graphic novels as a complex and evolving literary form, emphasizing their potential to serve as cognitive-emotional\nlandscapes that challenge traditional storytelling structures. By examining how visual intelligence in Kari shapes reader engagement, this research underscores the necessity of fostering\nvisual literacy to enhance the reception and appreciation of graphic novels, further advocating for their recognition in contemporary literary and academic discourse.",

Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and challenges of maintaining scientific rigour that were uncovered in these responses. While the prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews, it also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in selecting and presenting articles and responses. Future developments will prioritize refining the selection and ordering criteria while encouraging greater engagement from the scientific community and informed public with the goal to enhance the reliability of published research.",

          "abstract": "This research identifies the causality between entrepreneurial behaviour and informal institutions of social trust within the context of China’s development. Revisiting the Polanyi-Schumpeter theoretical framework, entrepreneurship embedded in social relations interlinked by trust is a dynamo of sustainable socioeconomic progress. The institutionalised trust, however, was not clarified. With micro-individual data from the Chinese General Social Survey 2011–2021, our research employs the instrumental variable approach rooted in historical rice farming to tackle endogeneity. The results demonstrate that social trust elevates entrepreneurial engagement by 32.65 and 10.37 percentage points in self-employment and business incorporation, respectively. Increased trust paradoxically hampers self-employment in the central due to insular networks and structural disparities. The findings uncover the nuanced role of social trust in facilitating and constraining entrepreneurship with contextually regional determinants. The research contributes to knowledge and evidence of institutional endowments that mediate entrepreneurial agency and argues for synchronising formal and informal institutions in development.",

A mixed-methods approach combining rule-based VADER sentiment analysis and thematic evaluation was used to analyze user feedback to elucidate platform-specific advantages and systemic challenges. Results indicate DeepSeek was perceived as highly positive overall by users (+0.80 aggregate sentiment) as well as high scores for Accessibility (+0.93) and Intelligence &amp; Reasoning (+0.88). Nevertheless, emerging criticism revolved around its Censorship and Content policies (-0.20). The users applauded analytical accuracy through free access but criticized the interface navigation issues. Thematic analysis pinpoints DeepSeek as affluent with analytically driven users while emphasizing its highly tenacious capacity towards domain-specific problems. However, Cross-cutting challenges include latency, stability, and the inherent tension between content moderation and user autonomy. The AI evaluation frameworks are methodologically advanced by adding computational sentiment tools and qualitative perceptions. The intuitions from these findings allow for a better understanding of the user experience and have profound implications for the current development and practical usability of DeepSeek. The relationship between functional specialty and user expectations equates the competitiveness of AI platforms with DeepSeek, seen as a robust, free analytical tool while signaling possible areas for strategic enhancements.",

          "abstract": "Normative fertility reflects broader societal trends but curiously changed little despite shifts in families. Changes in general ideal fertility, however, may be hidden by omitting nonnumeric ideals. Using GSS data, I analyze trends in and predictors of nonnumeric fertility ideals between 1975-2022. I further examine ideals for a subset nudged for numeric responses. Findings underscore a spike in nonnumeric ideals (9% in 1975 to 23% in 2022) paralleled by a waning two-child ideal. Shifts to web-surveys account for some of the growth, but nonnumeric ideals increased even when only examining interviewer-surveys (9% to 15%). Notably, when nudged, nonnumeric respondents offer nonnormatively high or low numeric ideals. Nonnumeric predictors also point towards two groups likely to give opposed extreme ideals (e.g., high and low gender role and sexuality attitudes, frequent religious attenders and non-attenders). Over time, those with large-family ideals may have initially drove nonnumeric responses, with a bifurcated pattern emerging later. The high and increasing proportion of nonnumeric ideals may suggest a shift from broadly held two-child norms toward bespoke smaller families that facilitate self-actualization emerging alongside a continuing counterweight favoring large families. Like work on nonnumeric personal fertility preferences, attention to nonnumeric normative ideals offers insights into fertility decision-making.",

          "authors": "Amy Nivette; Isabelle W. J. van der Vegt",
          "abstract": "Increasingly researchers are assessing the causal effects of procedurally just treatment by police on public attitudes using experimental vignettes across the world. However, there are two key limitations to this body of research, particularly when drawing causal conclusions about theoretical mechanisms. The first is that most research on procedural justice, and particularly using experimental vignettes, has been conducted in countries with similar roots in policing (i.e., Anglo-Saxon, English-speaking countries). The second limitation is that research on procedural justice theory using vignettes often fails to closely assess the mechanisms and potential confounds linking experiences of treatment and subsequent attitudes. The current study aims to address both of these gaps by replicating US experimental vignettes among a representative sample of Dutch residents. Specifically, we field a 3x2x2 between-subjects vignette to assess different components of procedurally just treatment by police on individual attitudes during a traffic stop. We assess causal assumptions using a series of follow-up questions about placebo characteristics, and investigate underlying mechanisms by analysing open-text responses following each police legitimacy item. The results from the current study show that, while procedurally just treatment by police was statistically related to perceptions of encounter-specific police legitimacy, the strength of the causal effect and underlying mechanisms were not so clear. Not only was a key causal assumption violated, indicating that the effect does not run only through the treatment, but respondents suggested that they would comply and trust police in the situation based on broader societal norms and expectations, not necessarily because of police behavior. Methodologically, our study suggests that researchers using experimental vignettes need to pay more attention to causal assumptions. Theoretically, our study shows that those interested in testing procedural justice theory (and criminological theories more broadly) must think critically about identifying and evaluating competing mechanisms in different societal and institutional contexts.",

          "abstract": "Despite strong evidence supporting sexual education, the Dutch national week of primary school-based sexual education sparked online controversy in 2023. This study examines the discourse surrounding this debate by analyzing social media posts (2022–2023) and newspaper articles (2005–2024) using topic modeling. Topic modeling is a machine-learning method that identifies patterns and themes in large text corpora. Among 2,095 newspaper articles, we identified five topics, revealing that while sexual education in Dutch primary schools has consistently been portrayed as beneficial, it has become increasingly contested over time. Newspaper coverage grew rapidly in 2023, with opposing viewpoints receiving more attention since 2018. The 10 topics identified in the analysis of 3,091 social media posts reflected this trend, highlighting polarization between conservative and progressive groups. Debates centered on age-appropriateness, the inclusion of controversial topics such as pleasure and LGBTQ+ issues, and the role of schools in sex education. We conclude that to increase public support for primary school-based sexual education, schools should prioritize transparent communication and direct engagement with parents to address concerns and counter misinformation circulating on social media.",

          "authors": "Richard Wainwright",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper explores the musical dimensions of early infant vocal expressions—crying, cooing, and babbling—and their role in shaping secure attachment through the lens of Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of the ritornello. Building on Bowlby’s attachment theory, which emphasizes the infant’s innate signaling behaviors and the caregiver’s responsive attunement, the discussion foregrounds how repeated vocal exchanges create a sonic “territory” that fosters a sense of emotional safety. Drawing on studies of mother–infant interactions, the paper examines how rhythmic and melodic qualities of cries and babbles elicit complementary parental responses, forming protoconversations integral to a child’s emerging self-regulation. The theory of communicative musicality is invoked to illustrate how these interactive “songs” precede formal language yet convey complex affective states. Deleuze and Guattari’s refrains framework highlights the creative, organizing power of repeated sound patterns in stabilizing early relational life. Incorporating insights from Kristeva, Trevarthen, and Stern, the paper argues that the preverbal “song before speech” establishes a foundation for later linguistic and psychosocial development. Finally, clinical perspectives show how voicework and expressive therapies can re-access and re-configure these preverbal sonic territories in adulthood, offering corrective emotional experiences for individuals with disrupted attachments. Through this approach, the paper reaffirms the important  impact of musicality in infancy, underscoring how repeated vocal refrains not only forge secure bonds but also endure as vital resources for therapeutic healing.",

          "authors": "Danyelle; Emil Juvan; Bettina Grün; Marius Portmann; Sara Dolnicar",
          "abstract": "Food waste generates a substantial amount of carbon emissions. One type of food waste – uneaten food left behind on plates at the end of a meal – is unnecessary because it does not improve the dining experience. This study explores two enjoyment-based interventions aimed at reducing plate waste at hotel buffets. The first intervention (“sweet delight”) offers guests a chance to win a luxury dessert for finishing all the food on their plate. The second intervention (“flipper”) involves giving away to hotel guests who leave no plate waste a token for a game of flipper (pinball). In a manipulation check survey experiment, we test whether the two interventions increase positive emotional engagement (i.e., enjoyment, enthusiasm, excitement) and compare stated behavioural intentions to a control condition (no intervention). The “sweet delight” condition passes the manipulation check but does not increase intentions to leave no plate waste. The “flipper” intervention did not pass the manipulation check. A field study at a Slovenian hotel showed that “sweet delight” significantly reduced plate waste generated per hotel guest at dinner. The “flipper” intervention failed to change plate waste behaviour significantly. Findings point to enjoyment-based incentives as a promising avenue for behaviour change interventions aiming to trigger pro-environmental consumer behaviour. The “sweet delight” intervention tested in this study is available for immediate deployment by hotels that wish to reduce plate waste.",

          "authors": "Christof Brandtner; Patricia Bromley",
          "abstract": "Cities worldwide have turned to publishing strategies that articulate their plans for the future to their peers and stakeholders. How do a city’s interlinkages influence whether and when cities publish such a plan? Informed by political economy and institutional perspectives on organizations, we posit that a combination of competitive and cultural pressures influences a city’s adoption of strategic planning. Institutional theory suggests that strategic planning is adopted as a signal of legitimacy, particularly by entities enmeshed in global culture. Conversely, political economy perspectives hold that strategic planning is vital for competing for international capital and maintaining one’s economic status. Although both a city’s cultural embeddedness and economic status may increase its propensity to strategize, these influences arguably operate through and are shaped by its administration’s centrality in an emerging network of intercity associations. To show this, we tracked the adoption of strategic plans across the 360 largest cities worldwide from 2000 to 2019, uncovering the influence of cities’ network affiliations on the spread and nature of strategic planning. The event history analysis reveals that institutional factors outweigh the influence of economic status in predicting strategic planning. However, the effect of a city’s administrative centrality in inter-city networks diminishes with its economic status. This indicates that network dynamics propagated by higher-status cities more directly influence lower-status cities. The study sheds light on the impact of inter-city networks on cities’ strategic approaches to challenges like climate change, providing a macro-level foundation for understanding city strategy. It also shows how institutions and the political economy jointly influence cities, integrating two literatures that have long existed concurrently but without much interaction.",

          "authors": "Daniel Martinez-Felip; Steven G.M. Schilizzi; Chi Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Social norms, understood as shared expectations of appropriate behavior, can help resolve collective action problems by making salient collectively beneficial equilibria. However, achieving long-lasting behavior of this type has so far challenged policymakers. To make progress, we need a deeper understanding of the dynamics of people’s normative expectations regarding collectively beneficial behaviors. This study employs a controlled laboratory experiment to collect panel data on individuals’ normative expectations regarding contributions in a public goods (PG) game. Using the Krupka &amp; Weber’s 2013 method, we elicit participants’ normative expectations at three stages: before playing a repeated standard PG game, after completing the repeated PG game, and after playing a repeated PG game with social incentives activated through the threat of exclusion from non-financial group activities. By comparing these stages, we examine whether and how experienced group behavior in PG games within two distinct structured social contexts—one without and one with social incentives—shapes individuals’ normative expectations. Our findings indicate heterogeneity in how social norms are perceived and how normative expectations change in response to experienced group behaviors in the PG games. Normative expectations for socially beneficial actions tend to emerge when such group behavior conveys a normative signal (i.e., when non-financial social incentives lead to increased and sustained contributions), particularly when the social norm is initially perceived as being loose. This work contributes to the growing body of research on social norms by offering experimental evidence that advances our understanding of the factors that determine beneficial normative change.",

Both help map circulation spaces and understand their operational logic, aiming to visualize the proximities and/or distances between different places/actors in the production of these symbolic goods. *Accordingly, based on several datasets collected to analyze the dynamics that structure contemporary French-speaking Swiss theater production circulation, this article aims to constitute a practical case on the combined use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Geometric Data Analysis (GDA) in mapping cultural spaces in a cross-fertilization perspective. The implementation of a mixed SNA and GDA analytical approach reveals distinct clusters of venues based on linguistic boundaries, size, cultural legitimacy, and audience reach. It identifies an “intermediate” subspace, between avant-garde and commercial productions. The study highlights methodological advantages in integrating SNA and GDA for developing a nuanced view on cultural dynamics, especially in understanding the career landscape of Swiss “ordinary” artists who navigate between artistic autonomy and market demands.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the movement against “progressive” prosecutors in the United States. Prosecutors have significant discretion at the front-end of the criminal legal system, including over charges, bail recommendations, and plea deals. Although prosecutors have traditionally wielded their power in a way that contributes to mass incarceration, “progressive” prosecutors have been elected in growing numbers since 2016 on pledges to mitigate the racialized harms of the criminal legal system. While scholars tie the rise of progressive prosecutors to the Movement for Black Lives (BLM), less is known about the countermovement efforts – such as recalls, impeachments, and suspensions – challenging these prosecutors’ discretion and tenures. To address this gap, I constructed an original database of all local prosecutors in 2012 and/or 2022 in the country's 300 most-populous jurisdictions. Through archival research, I documented prosecutor demographics, state politics, and extra-electoral challenges, which I define as organized efforts to remove prosecutors from office or constrain their power outside of regularly-scheduled elections. Findings reveal that extra-electoral challenges disproportionately target women of color prosecutors, disproportionately occur in Republican-controlled states, and have nearly tripled over the last decade. I argue that extra-electoral challenges constitute a novel movement repertoire used by the political right to legally mobilize against racial justice efforts following BLM.",

Through systematic document analysis of policy frameworks across eight major global actors—the United Kingdom, Russia, India, the European Union, China, the United States, BigTech, and UNESCO (n=1,836)—we identify distinct governance typologies that determine higher education's role in AI ecosystems. Our findings quantify significant variations in how universities are instrumentalized across governance contexts—from talent pipelines in market-led systems to state-directed innovation hubs in centralized approaches. We document the emergence of value-aligned \"strategic education blocs\" replacing universal academic networks, with India demonstrating unexpected leadership in education-specific policy provisions. This research advances theoretical understanding of \"technological statecraft\" in higher education, demonstrating how the interplay between sovereignty concerns, regulatory philosophies, value systems, and public-private dynamics creates systematically different operating environments for universities across geopolitical contexts. These findings provide critical benchmarks for understanding institutional positioning in the global AI landscape and challenge conventional internationalization frameworks in an era of technological nationalism.",

          "authors": "REGROUP project; Michalis Moutselos",
          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic put public health, economic activity, and constitutionally guaranteed freedoms under severe strain. Existing research has studied the ensuing protests, predominately individuals’ likelihood to have participated and the determinants of such participation. The present paper analyzes COVID-19-related protest events across the EU-27 space and examines the observed grievances, actors, mobilization patterns, and protest frames, with protest events as the unit of analysis. Relying on an analytical distinction between economic and cultural grievances, I find that left-wing protesters contested the economic effects of the crisis, while right-wing protests mobilized around cultural concerns about freedom and the importance of science. Non-partisan actors were behind much of the observed protesting and that a “rallying” effect was small and limited to cultural protests. On the Green-Alternative-Libertarian/Traditional-Authoritarian-Nationalist (GAL-TAN) dimension, GAL actors remained relatively inactive, while TAN actors mobilized around cultural grievances. I also observe regional effects, such as the preponderance of cultural protests in Germany and the Netherlands and of economic protests in Southern Europe, and a positive association between protest incidence and centrist/technocratic governments. The paper further discusses the activation of other pre-pandemic cleavages (for instance, ethnoreligious ones) and the most pertinent repertoires of contention observed across the EU-27; a noteworthy finding concerns the diversity and, quite often, the country-specific characteristics of COVID protests. Lastly, a critical discourse and qualitative-interpretive frame analyses of press releases by protest actors in France, Cyprus, and Greece demonstrates the limits of a simultaneous activation of economic and cultural dimensions during the pandemic.",

Using “A history of socialist thought from the precursors to the present” by Mukherjee and Ramaswamy (2000) as data, this paper utilizes qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) method to find the combination of characteristics that make up socialist thoughts, and political compass to visualize the positions of socialist thoughts. These common characteristics are categorized into groups of Goal and implementation, International view, Politics, Economy, Society, Democratic institution, Revolutionary action, and Revolutionary forces. Among them, Politics, Society, and Revolutionary action groups can be considered to have causal relationship with socialist thoughts. Most socialist thoughts are on the Libertarian left quadrant of the political compass. The methods in this paper have the potential to combine the strengths and limit the weakness of both qualitative and quantitative methods in more comprehensive research of socialist thoughts, for better application of socialism in practice in the future.",

It is found that the first democracy was born in China more than 4,000 years ago. As a result of the discovery, a practical framework called Yao-Shunism is formulated and presented. Yao-Shunism offers non-partisan politics and participatory governance. It is backed by major Chinese philosophies and provides a viable alternative to existing political practice. It is shown that the entire world can benefit from Yao-Shunism if implemented. We demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of Yao-Shunism through George Washington.",

In it, I will consider the development of the rule of law as a phase of state building, paying particular attention to representative institutions. I will compare the constitutional histories of England, France, Russia, Germany and the United States from their origins to the point in each nation’s history which I consider the end of that country’s revolution. It is my thesis that all revolutions are about law and constitutional arrangement and that continuity is a characteristic of the political and constitutional arrangements which exist before and after revolutions.  Revolutions answer the question: Who makes law? Where in the state does the legislative authority reside? I hope to show that the outcome of a revolution, the constitutional arrangements that result from it, is largely determined by the system of government that existed before the revolution. That is, however much revolutionaries might want to make a clean break with the past and create a totally new political system, the ultimate revolutionary outcome will have some continuity with the prerevolutionary system.",

          "abstract": "This article considers how \"self-imposed term limits,\" voluntary pledges by candidates for elected office to step down at the end of their term if elected or reelected, can arise endogenously within a formal model of electoral accountability. To this end, I extend a standard two-period political agency model with adverse selection by appending an election campaign during which two candidates compete with the option to commit not to seek reelection. I show that term limit pledges can emerge in equilibrium without commitment power, revealing their relationship with informative cheap talk. The subsequent analysis considers scenarios where commitment power is necessary for upholding term limit pledges. In these cases, self-imposed term limits allow strong candidates to signal their private type to voters, giving them an electoral advantage over those seeking reelection. However, these candidates' appeal comes not from the informational content of their pledges but from their ability to make policy decisions free from career considerations. I characterize the equilibria of a model specification in which politicians have differing policy preferences, identifying conditions under which term limit pledges are simultaneously informative and improve voter welfare.",

          "authors": "Emily H Emmott; Masahito Morita",
          "abstract": "Understanding human behaviour requires simultaneous consideration of “nature and nurture”, yet biocultural enquiry within anthropology remains uncommon. In part, this may stem from historical divisions the between sub-disciplines of anthropology where biological anthropology has specialised in quantitative methods and socio-cultural anthropology in qualitative ones, often leading to siloed approaches and hindering biocultural collaborations. The study of human behaviour within evolutionary anthropology has emerged from a robust methodological tradition of naturalistic observations, mirroring participant observations commonly deployed in socio-cultural research. This offers opportunities for evolutionary anthropologist to go “beyond the quantitative” to facilitate biocultural investigations. However, perhaps due to increasing challenges and impracticalities with observing participants across private spaces, this method has declined in popularity over the last 50 years. Following recent emerging interest in biocultural mechanisms and methodological diversification within evolutionary anthropology, we explore and reflect on autophotography (a visual qualitative method where participants showcase their lives through photographs) as a quasi-naturalistic method. In doing so, we demonstrate how integrating creative methods into evolutionary anthropology may help bridge methodological divides and enhance biocultural enquiry.",

          "abstract": "Environmental stressors, and their downstream social and economic impacts, can affect a broad set of social processes and outcomes. One growing line of research examines how climatic and environmental exposures in early life affect later-life outcomes, which can occur through biological, developmental, and socioeconomic mechanisms. We contribute a historical perspective to this literature by leveraging unique, linked census data from early twentieth-century America (1900-1940). We match these data to historical temperature and precipitation estimates from the PRISM project at the county level. We then fit a series of regression models to measure the effects of exposures to temperature and precipitation anomalies in utero and during early childhood (i.e., the year before birth through age 5) on migration, marriage, labor force participation, and occupational prestige for men in early adulthood (i.e., ages 20 to 24). Our results show that temperature is positively associated with labor force participation and occupational prestige but negatively associated with the likelihood of marriage. Precipitation is positively associated with occupational prestige and negatively associated with marriage. Temperature and precipitation exposures are not significant predictors of migration prior to stratification. Additional models test for effect heterogeneity, revealing differences by region, farming status, and race. These findings underscore the complex and varied ways in which early-life climate exposures shaped socioeconomic trajectories in early twentieth-century America.",
