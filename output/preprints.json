          "authors": "Lukas Röseler",
          "abstract": "Preregistrations have been suggested as a tool to prevent p-hacking. Most researchers have used semi-structured preregistration templates to deprive themselves of researchers’ degrees of freedom. I show how such “narrative preregistrations” do not fully prevent p-hacking for even very simple statistical techniques (e.g., correlations) unless the analysis code is part of the preregistration.",

          "abstract": "Background: Data fragmentation and limited interoperability severely challenge the strategic use of public health information, particularly for HIV/AIDS care in Brazil, hindering the comprehensive analysis of the care continuum. Aligning these heterogeneous national datasets with the FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is crucial but faces practical implementation gaps. This study outlines the methodological foundation for developing the Repository of Access to HIV Treatment (ReAcT). Methods: ReAcT was developed using a FAIR-aligned approach to data curation and harmonization. The methodology involved the integration of secondary data from multiple, independent national health information systems, specifically SINAN, SICLOM, SISCEL, SIA, and SIM. The core process consisted of data standardization, quality control, and deterministic or probabilistic record linkage to reconstruct patient trajectories. The entire data pipeline was operationalized using a reproducible, open-source R-language function to ensure analytical precision and consistency. Results: The ReAcT repository successfully consolidated approximately 1.3 million records from these disparate systems, creating a structured, research-ready database. This methodology enabled the structured cross-referencing of information (e.g., linking case notifications with ART initiation and monitoring) at the municipal level, allowing for the identification of patterns suggesting real gaps in care continuity. Conclusion: The ReAcT framework demonstrates the feasibility of building a FAIR-aligned data repository by overcoming data fragmentation, providing a reliable foundation to identify care gaps and support strategic decision-making in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). The proposed methodology is highly scalable to other chronic diseases (such as tuberculosis or diabetes) and is adaptable to similar public health challenges in low- and middle-income country contexts.",

          "title": "AI Cannot Be Reproduced: Medical AI Needs a Culture of Logging, Not Reruns",
          "authors": "Kenjiro Shiraishi",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), including generative AI, are rapidly being adopted for tasks ranging from manuscript drafting to clinical decision support. Yet the evaluation and governance of these systems still rely heavily on a traditional notion of “reproducibility”: if one runs the same procedure under the same conditions, one should obtain the same result. For probabilistic and highly environment-dependent LLMs, bit-identical reruns are neither realistic nor especially useful.\nDrawing on OpenAI’s work on weight-sparse transformers and recent proposals such as MedLog for event-level clinical AI logging, this article argues that medical AI—particularly AI-assisted writing and explanation—should shift its primary evaluative target from strict reproducibility to auditability. In practice, this means designing layered “log cultures” that record how systems were used, with appropriate granularity for different levels of risk. Even if future models achieve substantially higher technical reproducibility, meaningful verification of individual outputs will still depend on access to their provenance: what model, in which version, was run with what inputs and settings, under whose oversight. Journals such as NEJM AI are well positioned to move from merely asking, “Was AI used?” to setting concrete expectations about what must be logged, retained, and, where appropriate, shared. Such standards would guide clinicians, institutions, vendors, and payers in building log practices that make AI use contestable rather than opaque.",

          "abstract": "The Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) was introduced in 2015 to improve transparency, accountability, and recognition in scholarly authorship by standardizing the description of contributor roles. This study aims to provide the first comprehensive retrospective system-wide analysis of global adoption of CRediT. A key challenge is that while support for CRediT has grown organically, among authors and publishers, implementation has been inconsistent across publishers, making systematic data collection difficult. To overcome this challenge, we used the Dimensions database and applied a multi-stage text-extraction method. Our analysis identified more than 3.2 million roles articles, preprints and conference papers including CRediT, from 2015 to 2024. Our results show accelerating adoption, with CRediT appearing in 22.5% of all 2024 publications with available full text. All 14 CRediT roles are now widely used, with notable growth in roles reflecting evolving research practices such as Software and Data Curation. Adoption spans disciplines and geographies, dominated by STEM but expanding into social sciences, and are strongly shaped by publisher policies, system integrations and disciplinary focus. We discuss the drivers of CRediT’s organic expansion, its role in strengthening research integrity and assessment, and the need for coordinated governance and infrastructure support as the taxonomy enters its next decade. Updates and standards of implementations will be important to ensure that CRediT remains relevant and valuable for its multiple use cases and aligned with how research itself is evolving.",

          "authors": "Agata Czech; Noam Tal-Perry; Becky Ioppolo; Steven Wooding",
          "abstract": "A diverse body of empirical research has produced mixed findings on gender disparities in research funding. Only a few of these studies effectively control for the structural factors of discipline and seniority of applicants. We have conducted the first institution-wide analysis of grant applications using high-resolution administrative data to understand gender-based disparities in funding outcomes. We included 18,583 applications submitted between 2015 and 2023 and assessed whether women applied for grants at different rates, requested different amounts, or had different success rates. After adjusting for seniority and disciplinary area, we found no evidence of consistent gender disparities in application rate. Historical gender disparities in application size in favour of men were observed but did not persist. Weak evidence for gender disparities in success rate was observed in favour of women, which disappeared after controlling for application size. However, when examining individual disciplines and seniorities, gender disparities in both directions were observed for rate, size and success. These findings highlight the importance of separating structural and individual factors in understanding funding disparities to allow for effective interventions; the value of institutional administrative data in allowing this type of analysis; and highlight the role of structural (career stage and disciplinary) disparities in the gender disparities seen in scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Implementation science aims to bridge the gap between research evidence and routine healthcare practice by understanding and optimizing the integration of evidence-based interventions (EBIs). In this paper, we identify seven persistent challenges limiting implementation progress, including (1) overwhelming volume of implementation materials (e.g., reports, interviews, surveys), (2) contextual variability, (3) complex interactions among contextual factors, interventions, and outcomes, (4) stakeholder engagement constraints, (5) equity and access barriers, (6) insufficient or biased data, and (7) concerns around data security, trust, and ethics. We explore how advances in data science and artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to these challenges by enhancing evidence extraction and synthesis, contextual analysis, stakeholder engagement, and adaptation throughout the implementation process. Using a live project in precision oncology as a practical example, we demonstrate how AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs), clustering algorithms, and sentiment analysis, can support implementation research and practice, from concept (e.g., barriers, facilitators, strategies) extraction and barrier identification to process mapping. We also introduce ImpleMATE, an AI-enabled platform that integrates implementation science knowledge with dynamic learning health system workflows, enabling continuous knowledge extraction, decision support, and feedback for implementation improvement. While AI offers significant potential to accelerate and scale implementation efforts, we emphasize the need for ethical oversight, transparency, and human collaboration to ensure responsible, equitable, and impactful application in practice.",

          "abstract": "The replication crisis reveals pervasive methodological weaknesses, with replication failure rates exceeding 60% in psychology and preclinical biology. While preregistration improves transparency, it lacks technical enforcement and quantitative assessment of rigor. ECLIPSE v2.0 introduces a computational framework that enforces falsification integrity through cryptographic data splitting, single-shot validation, and automated auditing.\n\nThe framework integrates five sequential stages: (1) irreversible data partitioning with SHA-256 verification; (2) binding preregistration of falsification criteria; (3) cross-validated model development; (4) single-shot holdout testing; and (5) automatic integrity assessment. Three quantitative tools were developed: the Eclipse Integrity Score (EIS) measuring methodological rigor; the Statistical Test for Data Snooping (STDS) detecting performance inflation; and an Automated Code Auditor using multi-level static analysis to identify protocol violations.\n\nAcross four validation studies, ECLIPSE achieved: (1) strong discrimination between honest and p-hacked studies (Cohen’s d = 3.54, AUC = 0.991); (2) 89% sensitivity for detecting 15% performance inflation; (3) auditor accuracy F1 = 0.908; and (4) prediction of replication success in 73 published studies (ρ = 0.68), outperforming impact factor and sample size.\n\nECLIPSE provides the first quantitative, enforceable, and scalable methodology for ensuring research integrity through prevention, detection, and assessment.

          "title": "Bounded rationality and human development",
          "authors": "Samuel David Jones",
          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

          "authors": "Zoe Fowler; Kyle Fiore Law; Oliver Bontkes; Arushi Srivastava; Christopher Oveis; Daniela Palombo; Brendan O'Connor",
          "abstract": "Emotions play a crucial role in a host of goal-directed cognitive processes, such as imagining and planning for the future. From hope to despair, shared emotions within representations of the future can motivate farsighted decisions and facilitate social coordination. Though interpersonal dynamics are critical to theories of emotion, imagination has been primarily studied as a process occurring within individuals rather than between them. Nevertheless, humans readily imagine their futures together. Here, we test the hypothesis that such collaborative imagination (co-imagination) of shared future experiences promotes emotional convergence in future event representations among individuals. Analyzing data from two experiments run in 2019 and 2021 involving university and Prolific participants (N=204), we use natural language models to code individual narratives for a rich and complex array of emotional states. These studies demonstrate that co-imagination in novel dyads fosters alignment in the emotions partners express within their individual representations of the shared future, more so than independently imagining future events using the same cues. This work illuminates a new framework and mechanism for the formation of shared emotions within representations of the future.",

          "authors": "Louisa Gwynne; Luigi Tamè; Brianna Beck",
          "abstract": "Under the theory of memory reconsolidation, memory reactivation induces a temporary window of destabilisation during which memories become malleable. Behavioural reconsolidation interference has been proposed as a method for weakening maladaptive emotional and pain-related memories; however, evidence for its efficacy remains mixed. In this study, participants (N = 51) completed a three-day reconsolidation interference paradigm. On Day 1, they underwent a pain conditioning procedure in which visual cues (conditioned stimulus; CS) were paired with moderately painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus; US). On Day 2, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Reactivation + Working Memory (R+WM), Reactivation Only (RO), or Working Memory Task Only (WMO). An adaptive emotional n-back task served as the WM interference, which consisted of negatively valenced word stimuli. On Day 3, all participants underwent extinction learning. Learning was assessed via explicit expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses (SCR). On Day 1, conditioning produced robust discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced cues in both expectancy ratings and SCR amplitudes. Overall, expectancy ratings declined from conditioning to extinction, but this did not differ across groups. Similarly, SCR amplitudes decreased over time during extinction, consistent with CS-US unpairing, but with no group differences. These findings suggest that WM interference following reactivation does not impact later pain recall or extinction. This contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of behavioural reconsolidation interference. The null effects observed here underscore the need to clarify the so-called boundary conditions of reconsolidation and better understand neural mechanisms underlying pain memory and learning.",

          "abstract": "Across the cognitive sciences, researchers have studied theory of mind (making sense of other people’s behaviors in terms of their mental states, or ‘naive psychology’) and physical reasoning (making sense of physical events in terms of their underlying mechanics and dynamics, or ‘naive physics’), as two separate processes. In this Perspective, we describe two ways in which psychological reasoning depends on physical reasoning. First, people represent the bodies of animate agents as objects, and their actions as physical events. Second, people use physical knowledge to make inferences about other minds, including what other people want, feel, and know, how hard they are trying, and how much danger they are in. We review research from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience that provides evidence for the interaction between these two systems, and Bayesian computational models of theory of mind that articulate a formal hypothesis about how they work together. We propose that from early in human development people navigate the social world by using two distinct but interacting systems for reasoning about other agents’ ethereal minds and their physical bodies.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for identity development, often accompanied by identity distress. Simultaneously, adolescents are also preoccupied with presenting themselves as positive as possible on social media, which may reflect and reinforce identity distress. Yet, the dynamic associations between adolescents’ identity distress and positive online self-presentations remain unexplored. Accordingly, this three-wave panel study among adolescents from Belgium, France, and Slovenia (N = 1697; Mage = 15.14, SDage = 1.78, 57.2% girls) used Latent Class Growth Analysis to identify distinct co-trajectories of identity distress and positive online self-presentation in the domains of friendship and appearance over one year. The findings showed that identity distress and positive self-presentations can follow maladaptive, adaptive, or stable co-trajectories over time, depending on the identity domain, adolescents’ demographic and social media use characteristics. In doing so, the study provides novel evidence on the heterogeneous co-development of adolescents’ identity distress and online self-presentation.",

          "abstract": "Research has long been interested in cognitive complaints as indicators of cognitive performance limitations. While longitudinal studies suggest that an active lifestyle and emotional well-being may be beneficial for cognitive function, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent work emphasizes momentary assessments for capturing everyday cognitive functioning. In this ten-day experience-sampling study, 325 university students completed thrice-daily surveys on stress, mood, social, cognitive and physical activities, subjective memory lapses, and performed a working memory task. Memory lapses and working memory performance were unrelated at both between- and within-person levels. Memory lapses were more likely during periods of increased activity, worse mood, and higher stress. Participants engaging in more cognitive activities reported more memory lapses. Higher average physical activity and increased momentary social activity were associated with lower working memory performance. Daily memory lapses in university students appear primarily driven by current affective states and activity levels rather than cognitive performance limitations. These results advance our understanding of cognitive processes in young adults and highlight different time scales in cognitive functioning.",

          "abstract": "Facial temperature has been proposed as a non-invasive marker of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. Previous research indicates that nose-tip temperature increases with parasympathetic activation, whereas periorbital temperature reflects sympathetic arousal. However, facial thermal fluctuations during resting state have not yet been systematically investigated, which represents the aim of the present study. \n Here we examined the relationship between regional facial temperature - measured from nose-tip and periorbital regions using functional infrared thermal imaging - and cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed by high-frequency (HF) power and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heart rate variability (HRV). Analyses included (i) grand-average correlations to identify overarching physiological patterns, (ii) within-subject correlations to explore the strength of individual-level associations, and (iii) between-subject correlations to examine inter-individual variability of the cardiac and thermal signals. \nAcross 32 participants during a 13.5-min resting-state session, HF power showed a positive association with nose-tip and a negative association with periorbital temperature, whereas RMSSD showed weaker effects. A differential temperature index (nose-tip minus periorbital) was the most robust correlate of HF power.  These findings suggest that facial thermal dynamics mirror vagal modulation at rest and that the differential index converging the information from different facial areas may provide a sensitive, contactless indicator of autonomic activity.",

This review examines and integrates empirical work across scales, from large-scale network dynamics to fine-grained neuronal mechanisms underlying anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. We synthesize findings from existing frameworks, including the Entropic Brain Hypothesis and Dendritic Integration Theory, which explain changes in brain connectivity, dynamics, and neuronal integration under anesthesia. However, neither framework fully addresses how agency and subjectivity may become dissociated. To bridge this gap, we review Irruption Theory (IT) as an emerging conceptual and methodological approach that may offer a novel lens for interpreting measurable changes in neural signals, encouraging further empirical research to distinguish the neural signatures of agency and subjectivity.",

The contamination is already widespread—approximately one-third of survey participants report using AI assistance—and produces systematic bias that registers as signal rather than noise. Traditional detection methods fail because they target low-effort humans while AI produces high-effort patterns. Economic incentives are powerful, and the threat recursive: AI-mediated responses become training data for models that mediate future responses, creating feedback loops toward model-shaped consensus. The field requires contamination-aware statistical frameworks and stratified sampling by evidential role, treating online convenience samples as exploratory while demanding robust recruitment for confirmatory inference.",

          "authors": "Julian Zubek; Klara Łucznik",
          "abstract": "The feeling of togetherness, which we understand as creating something larger than oneself with others, often emerges in creative, open-ended interactions, such as dancing or making music. We ask what states of mind are associated with this felt togetherness and what interactional skills can be used to foster it. To investigate this, in this study, we record eight short dance improvisation duets in controlled conditions. Video recordings are used as prompts for in-depth interviews with dancers involved and with expert dance improvisation teachers. Based on the interviews, we portray togetherness as a state of mindful attunement to one’s partner, with a focus on building a relational unity. This form of unity goes beyond typical dialogue dynamics rooted in turn-taking. We associate togetherness with moments in dance when dancers’ attention is focused on the process happening “in between” individuals, and they feel that the “dance dances itself”. To achieve this state, dancers use deliberate strategies, such as shifting attention focus to peripheral vision, adjusting the speed of their actions, and expanding the field of trust. Our results show that, if theories of social cognition are to be congruent with human experience, they should explain both individual- and collective-level processes.",

          "abstract": "Planning is an expensive computational operation that easily exhausts our cognitive resources. For this reason, it is critical to learn strategies to initiate planning wisely. Although recent advances have shown where and how planning should be engaged to aid adaptive behavior, little is known about when planning should be engaged. Here, we investigate how individuals choose to engage or delay planning. For this purpose, we developed a task where, at certain decision points in a multistep decision problem, it is optimal to delay planning and relinquish control because all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two studies, we show that humans can optimally delay planning and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. In doing so, we demonstrate that meta-policies to engage or delay planning are not simply learned from experienced outcomes, rather, they are constructed by searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control.

          "abstract": "The many-analysts approach has demonstrated a surprising diversity in analytic choices and outcomes given a single research question and dataset. As a result, the approach has gained traction as a tool for revealing and understanding epistemic uncertainty. Despite its growing popularity, there is still limited practical guidance for team leaders on how to execute such studies. In this perspective, we propose ten strategies to improve the many-analysts methodology. The proposed strategies were build based on insights from past projects and our own experience as team leaders and are organized around six themes: (1) moving many-analysts projects beyond merely exposing analytic variability; (2) creating structured opportunities for participating teams to share their insights; (3) recognizing analytical quality and expertise; (4) uncovering sources of variability through meta-regression and complementary methods; (5) addressing epistemic uncertainty on a smaller scale; and (6) developing comprehensive models of uncertainty. To showcase their practical application, we illustrate these strategies using data from the Many-Analysts Religion Project.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases may affect physician decision-making. We sought to: 1) delineate which cognitive biases in physicians have been investigated, 2) report the prevalence of cognitive biases, 3) determine their impact on physician decisions, 4) characterize interventions that aim to reduce the impact of cognitive biases in physicians, and 5) highlight the role of individual differences. A PRISMA-compliant systematic review was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Of 4177 resultant articles, 61 were included (46 on group level outcomes and 15 on individual differences). The most common specialties were internal medicine (15, 24.6%), emergency medicine (11, 18.0%), and psychiatry (5, 8.2%). Studies provided evidence for the existence of hindsight bias, anchoring, framing effect, outcome bias, and availability bias. Prevalence varied by bias. Of five studies examining how cognitive biases affected physician diagnosis, 4 (80.0%) found a negative effect. Interventions to reduce the impact of cognitive biases were limited. Individual differences in susceptibility to cognitive biases may relate to length of experience, similarity to previous cases, and case complexity. This systematic review of studies of moderate quality and with moderate risk of bias indicated cognitive biases are prevalent in physicians and often negatively impact decision-making.",

Using Friston’s Free Energy Principle, we develop a conceptual model of this phenomenon that can be applied to both LLMs and humans, providing a single framework for comparison and understanding. We explore this in terms of LLM information-processing dynamics, which are structurally oriented toward minimizing uncertainty and maintaining coherence. This model offers an alternative framework for both humans and LLMs that compliments the current moral reasoning approach. In addition, the model makes new predictions on how LLMs should be trained to avoid this problem.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

Thus, we conducted two studies to analyze the impact of myths about cyber-sexual violence (AMCYS) on the relationship between cyber-sexual violence victimization and emotional impacts. In Study 1 (N = 310), women with higher levels of AMCYS and greater cyber-sexual violence victimization reported higher levels of anxiety and depression, as well as lower self-esteem. Study 2 (N = 393) replicated these results and also examined the effect of cyber-sexual violence victimization through the lens of objectification theory. Results showed that women with higher AMCYS scores and more cyber-sexual violence victimization reported higher levels of anxiety, depression and body shame, as well as lower self-esteem and body appreciation. Importantly, these relationships occurred through the indirect effect of body surveillance (self-objectification). Both studies indicated that AMCYS play an exacerbating role in the emotional impacts reported by women who have experienced more frequently cyber-sexual violence, while also highlighting the framework of objectification theory in understanding these results. These findings can be useful to develop interventions and prevention campaigns against cyber-sexual violence.",

          "abstract": "Engraved ochres and ostrich eggshells from the South African Blombos Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter are among the earliest expressions of human symbolic behavior. They appear to document a continuous practice of mark-making across ~40.000 years. During this time, the engraved markings change from simpler unstructured patterns to more complex markings such as cross-hatchings. Previous work examining the cognitive implications of these changes concluded that the engravings were likely used as decorations and may have served as group identity markers but not as denotational symbols. To inform discussions of the emergence of symbolic behavior, we conducted a two-part experimental study inspired by these engravings and based on the assumption that artifact use will motivate incremental adaptive refinements. Part 1 combined a delayed reproduction task with a transmission chain design to simulate an enduring mark-making practice. Eleven transmission chains were seeded with four drawings derived from the early Blombos and Diepkloof engravings and reproduced over eight generations. Transmission chain drawings showed a tendency to become increasingly regular, organized, and symmetric. Part 2 subjected a sample of the transmission chain drawings to a suite of psychophysical experiments to assess the cognitive implications of the accumulated structural changes. We found that the drawings became easier to discriminate, looked more like they had been intentionally made, and became easier to remember and reproduce, but there was no evidence of a systematic change in saliency or stylistic properties. Finally, we compared the results from the transmission chains with a similar analysis of the drawings derived from the original engravings. Although we observe interesting qualitative similarities between the original engravings and the experimental drawings, our findings suggest that cognitive biases and working memory constraints are not sufficient to generate the patterns observed in the archaeological record, highlighting the significance of social and functional contexts in shaping early symbolic artifacts. By integrating archaeological and experimental research we can better inform inferences on sparse records of early symbolic behavior. Our study thus leads to a broader consideration of the role, strengths and potential limitations of the transmission chain approach in analyzing trajectories of early symbolic behavior.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder) is a body-focused repetitive behaviour characterised by the recurrent and compulsive pulling of one’s own hair, where both the act of pulling and the visible consequences of hair loss cause distress and impairment. Shame has been identified as central to adult hairpulling, increasing the urge to pull and reinforcing the cycle of behaviour. Yet little is known about how adolescents experience this emotion, despite adolescence being the typical point of onset of trichotillomania and a developmental period marked by heightened sensitivity to shame. Hence, the present study explored how adolescents with problematic hairpulling experience, navigate and make sense of shame.\n\nDesign: A qualitative methodology was employed. \n\nMethod: Twelve adolescents with problematic hair-pulling aged 16–19 participated in online semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\n\nResults: An overarching theme of “There’s something wrong with me” – The Stigmatised Self captured how experiences of pervasive stigma were internalised as shame, permeating participant’s inner lives and social worlds. Under this, five themes were generated: The Flawed Self; The Scrutinised Self; The Misunderstood Self; The Isolated Self; and The Disempowered Self.  Shame was experienced as an enduring, identity-shaping emotion that triggered, maintained, and exacerbated hairpulling. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend our understanding by positioning shame as a central process in adolescent hairpulling and highlight the developmental vulnerability of this age group. Clinically, the results underscore the need for interventions that target shame, and for family and social contexts to be addressed alongside behavioural symptoms.",

In the present study, however, we sought to verify whether this link is indeed ‘inevitable’. Specifically, we examined the ‘liberalizing’ potential of cognitive control processes (i.e., the ability to regulate thoughts, emotions, and actions in accordance with one’s prespecified plans and goals), and we advanced the hypothesis that the RWA-prejudice association is curbed among those high in cognitive control. Two experimental studies (total N = 876) provided only weak support for our key hypothesis. In Study 1 (a university student sample), we found that proactive (but not reactive) control moderated the RWA-explicit prejudice association, such that this relationship was reduced to insignificance among those high in proactive control. By contrast, in Study 2 (an online panel sample), no significant RWA x cognitive control interactions emerged for any of the operationalizations of cognitive control. In addition, we did not observe any cognitive control moderation effects on the RWA-implicit prejudice link across both studies. Taken together, our findings cast reasonable doubt on the liberalizing potential of cognitive control, while at the same time they provide further support for the robustness of the RWA-prejudice association.",

          "abstract": "Depression in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes than adult-onset depression. While effective treatment can prevent difficulties from persisting into adulthood, current interventions for adolescent depression are often limited in effectiveness, likely because they fail to address the specific mechanisms underlying depression during this developmental stage. Access to treatment for adolescents presents an additional challenge. Effective, practical, and targeted treatments are urgently needed. To achieve this, we must identify key mechanisms of adolescent depression and develop interventions that address them directly.\n\nGrowing evidence highlights reward function as a key mechanism in adolescent depression. At the same time, research suggests that Behavioural Activation (BA), with its emphasis on reward-focused behavioural changes, may be an effective treatment for adolescents with depression. To integrate these lines of research, we used a narrative approach to synthesise cross-disciplinary literature on reward function and BA in adolescent depression.\n\nThis review found encouraging evidence for the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of BA in adolescents. BA also shows potential for those with co-occurring autism or anxiety. However, the mechanisms through which BA works in adolescence are still unknown, and questions remain on its optimal delivery. Further research is needed to clarify how reward function influences both adolescent depression and response to BA, as well as how adolescents themselves wish to engage with BA therapy.",

While separate literatures have documented advantages in perception and cognition for information associated with the self and information of positive valence, gaps remain in understanding the relationship between these effects. Across three experiments combining evaluative priming and shape-label matching tasks, the current research examined whether intrinsic self-positivity and self-negativity are underpinned by bidirectional expectations between self and emotional information.  Results revealed asymmetric bidirectional relationship: positive emotion primes inhibited stranger-related target processing, enhancing self-bias magnitudes (Experiment 1a), whilst self-primes facilitated positive emotion targets, enhancing positivity-biases (Experiment 2). Critically, no interactions emerged with negativity (Experiment 1b). These findings suggest that intrinsic self-positivity is maintained through facilitatory self-positive interactions and inhibitory other-positive interactions, with the dominant mechanism depending on relationship directionality. This distinction indicated that whilst the self solely leads to the expectation of positivity, positivity is associated with the self and extended self (i.e., friend). The theoretical and practical applications of these results are discussed.",

Based on international guidelines, regional regulations and examples of public domain, open licensed and commercial tests, we distinguish between simply administering an instrument, reproducing its protected content and creating derivative works such as translations or adaptations. We show that, in non-commercial academic contexts, administering lawfully acquired or openly licensed tests usually does not require additional permission, as long as items, keys and manuals are not reproduced or altered. In contrast, copying item banks, publishing reagents, adapting instruments without authorization or disseminating content from proprietary kits and neuropsychological batteries generally requires explicit permission.

          "abstract": "In perception experiments, researchers often collect multiple perceptual judgements from the same stimuli and participants to answer their research questions. While the way in which perceptual judgements are collected may affect the data, research rarely considers task design when investigating this topic. In our experiment, we investigated how two frequently used ways of collecting multiple ratings for affect perceptual judgements, focusing on first impressions of faces. One participant group provided ratings of seven person characteristics (e.g. femininity, youthfulness, trustworthiness) blocked by characteristic, rating faces for one person characteristic at a time, across seven blocks. Another participant group completed one block in which they rated all seven characteristics simultaneously via a list of rating scales. The listed presentation format reduced task duration by 22%, but affected the perceptual ratings in several ways, pointing to reduced data quality. Inter-rater agreement was lower for some person characteristics (youthfulness, femininity, and trustworthiness) in the listed format. Variance in ratings was also reduced for youthfulness, femininity, and dominance, with ratings clustering closer to the middle of the scale. Importantly, correlations between different person characteristics became universally positive in the listed format, indicating reduced independence of judgments. These findings highlight that while presenting multiple judgements at the same time may offer efficiency, this approach can introduce systematic biases and potentially reduce the reliability of perceptual data. We therefore suggest using a blocked presentation format and consider how these trade-offs would impact experiments looking at multiple perceptual judgements collected from the same participants.",

Hungry participants were more likely look at and subsequently select tasty over healthy food items, while attention and choice remained unaffected in the non-food tasks. Cognitive modelling indicated that hunger state selectively affected attention-driven evidence accumulation processes in the food choice task.

The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ).

This is notable because, although L2 research is sometimes siloed within the learning sciences, it has undergone a cognitive turn emphasizing domain-general learning mechanisms.\nWe propose that a KLI-informed cognitive view on instructed L2 learning helps to systematically integrate the field into the learning sciences, encompassing not only domain-general learning mechanisms but also domain-general perspectives on knowledge and instruction. Importantly, this integration may generate novel, testable hypotheses in L2 research, grounded in an interdisciplinary understanding of knowledge, learning, and instruction.\nWe present a cognitive KLI-based perspective on instructed L2 learning and discuss challenges of this perspective, including the fundamentally integrative nature of language knowledge, the inherently expressive character of language (verbal, written, signed), and the limited relevance of understanding and sense-making processes in instructed L2 learning. Moreover, we provide an illustrative KLI-informed analysis of two empirical L2 studies. Based on these analyses, we discuss novel, testable hypotheses generated through the KLI lens that offer interdisciplinary approaches to known issues in L2 pedagogy, such as integrating multiple induction- and refinement-enhancing instructional principles to mitigate individual differences in L2 classrooms.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is characterized by heightened sensitivity to social belonging, making loneliness prevalent and consequential for youth. Maladaptive personality traits may further exacerbate loneliness. In this preregistered 14-day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) study, we examined loneliness across social contexts and timescales (momentarily, daily) in relation to maladaptive personality traits among N = 294 adolescents aged 12-21 years (Mage = 17.5, SD = 2.64; 58.5% female; 86.73% born in Germany). Loneliness (βmomentary = 0.51; βdaily = 0.67) was higher when participants were alone, yet only the presence of close others (e.g., friends)—not weaker ties (e.g., classmates)—reduced loneliness (β = –0.39 to –0.62). Interestingly, youth who were alone more frequently did not report higher overall loneliness. Maladaptive personality traits were associated with higher (βmomentary = 0.32; βend-of-day = 0.40) and more variable (βmomentary = 0.31; βend-of-day = 0.34) loneliness but amplified the effect of being alone on loneliness only on the between-person level (β = –1.13). Detachment and Negative Affect showed unique patterns. Exploratory analyses indicated that social satisfaction partially mediated the association (β = 0.50). These findings underscore the importance of both structural and qualitative aspects of social environments, as well as personality-related vulnerabilities, to better understand loneliness-dynamics in youth.",

We propose that the ability to represent the social world along categories and the capacity to read others’ minds are used in an integrated way to efficiently assess the epistemic states of fellow humans by creating a shared representational space.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition marked by atypical social and emotional processing, has been linked to altered sensitivity and responsiveness to affective touch. However, systematic understanding of how affective touch is processed in ASD, particularly across behavioural and neural levels, remains limited. This review synthesises current findings on affective touch perception in individuals with ASD, with reference to both behavioural studies and neurophysiological evidence. In order to explain the observed abnormalities, we propose an integrated neurocognitive developmental framework that connects early physiological atypicalities to the mature cognitive-affective profile. This review highlights significant implications of the developmental trajectory of affective touch in ASD and directs the translation of these findings into targeted intervention strategies aimed at enhancing social-affective communication.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has proposed that there are symbolic beliefs. These beliefs do not serve primarily to track the facts in the world but rather to express the believer’s own identity. On this view, several disparate features of belief – from whether a belief is important to identity to whether it is sensitive to evidence – would be related to an underlying “symbolicness” dimension. We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

This knowledge is crucial to conceptualizing and realizing internal systems change in practice. The model integrates metaphors from physics (gravitational fields), ecology (resilience and phase-shifts), and physiology (homeostasis and self-healing) to illuminate how systems of consciousness naturally reorganize following trauma and again, towards healing.",

          "abstract": "When children learn novel words, referential ambiguity is a constant challenge. However, despite facing this uncertainty, children acquire their vocabulary with remarkable ease. One possible key to their success might be that children use active learning strategies and employ their developing metacognitive skills. To test this idea, we assessed whether 4- to 5-year-old preschoolers (and adults) are aware of their own uncertainty during referent identification, and to what extent they can effectively use this information to guide their learning process. Participants encountered a series of labeling events that varied in referential ambiguity: from minimal (e.g., hearing a familiar label), to medium (hearing a novel label in presence of a familiar and a novel object, resolvable via mutual exclusivity), to maximal (hearing a novel label in presence of two novel objects). Following this, they received counterevidence to their initial word-object-mappings and decided which mappings (learned in more vs. less ambiguous contexts) to update. Results revealed three key findings: First, both children’s and adults’ explicit and implicit uncertainty increased with the amount of referential ambiguity. Second, when confronted with uncertainty, children spontaneously aimed to resolve this by seeking additional information. Third, while adults preferentially updated words learned in higher ambiguity, children instead tended to revise information that was learned less recently, leaving open questions about whether and how contextual uncertainty shapes their updating strategies. The pattern of results provides insights into the skills and mechanisms that enable children to learn correct word meanings under uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research highlights reward probability (i.e., access to and pleasure derived from environmental reward) as a potential explanatory factor in posttraumatic stress (PTS). This study examined the explanatory utility of reward probability for PTS severity and specific symptom clusters while controlling for depression. In a cross-sectional design, 428 undergraduates completed the DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and the Reward Probability Index (RPI) subscales: Reward Probability (RPI-RP) and Environmental Suppression (RPI-ES). Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested three models: (1) associations between RPI subscales and PTSD symptom clusters (Intrusion, Avoidance [AAR], Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood [NACM], Hyperarousal); (2) the same model controlling for depression; and (3) exploratory indirect pathways from RPI-RP/ES to PTSD clusters via depression. All SEMs demonstrated robust psychometric structure. In Model 1, RPI-RP was positively associated with Intrusion and negatively with NACM, whereas RPI-ES was negatively associated with all clusters. In Model 2, controlling for depression, RPI-RP remained positively associated with Intrusion and AAR, while its association with NACM became nonsignificant; RPI-ES remained negatively associated with all clusters. Depression was positively associated with all clusters except AAR. In Model 3, depression partially accounted for the association of RPI-ES on all PTSD clusters and of RPI-RP on Intrusion, and fully accounted for the associations between RPI-RP and NACM/AAR. Findings support the utility of the RPI, specifically the RPI-ES subscale, in understanding PTS symptom severity beyond depression. Further research is needed to clarify the ambiguous associations between RPI-RP and PTS symptoms.",

The present study aimed to assess mental health and the effectiveness of stress-coping strategies during the 34th month of the ongoing conflict. The sample consisted of 2,962 residents from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using an online panel survey. The findings indicate that the highest levels of stress-related disorders, anxiety, and depression were observed in Poland, whereas the lowest levels were found in the Czech Republic. Across all countries, respondents most frequently adopted problem-focused coping strategies, while emotion-focused strategies were used less often. Linear regression analyses showed that younger age, lower perceived quality of life, and emotion-focused coping strategies were the strongest predictors of mental health disorders. Among Polish respondents, problem-focused strategies were associated with reduced psychological distress. Overall, the results suggest that the Russo-Ukrainian War has had a negative impact on mental health in Central and Eastern Europe. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring by health services and the development of effective interventions to support the psychological well-being of populations living near Ukraine.\nKeywords: mental health, distress, anxiety, depression, coping strategies, Central and Eastern Europe.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this emerging form of addiction is thus essential. Anchored in the Interaction of Person–Affect–Cognition–Execution (I-PACE) model, we conceptualize general attitudes toward AI (GAAI) as “person-level” dispositions and the sense of agency (SoA) as the “cognitive-affective” response that mediates AIA. Study 1 (NSample 1 = 500; NSample 2 = 896) adapted and validated a concise Chinese General Attitudes toward AI Scale, confirming a stable two-factor structure with good reliability. Study 2 (N = 780) applied this scale to a parallel mediation model linking GAAI to AIA via positive (SoPA) and negative (SoNA) facets of SoA. Results revealed that positive attitudes towards AI (GAAIP) indirectly mitigated addiction by enhancing SoPA and reducing SoNA, whereas negative attitudes towards AI (GAAIN) positively associated with GAA through diminishing SoPA and increasing SoNA. These findings extend the application of the I-PACE framework in the AI field, by demonstrating the association between GAAI and AIA, and the mediating role of SoA. Our findings also have the potential to guide the development of cognitive or attitudinal interventions for AIA.",

          "authors": "Issei Ichimiya; Hiroko Ichimiya",
          "abstract": "Background. Dichotic listening, in which different sounds are simultaneously presented to each ear, can evoke perceptual phenomena that are not noted during monaural or diotic listening. A well-known example is the scale illusion, in which listeners perceive coherent melodic streams that vary from the actual auditory input. This illusion underscores the interaction between pitch proximity-based grouping and laterality cues. However, the original scale illusion is complex, which makes it challenging to isolate specific perceptual mechanisms. Previously, we introduced simplified tonal sequences that allowed for a clearer evaluation of how pitch proximity and laterality interact. This study explores two questions: (1) to what extent pitch proximity-based grouping dominates over laterality in dichotic listening and (2) whether dichotic presentation decreases the perception of roughness, an unpleasant auditory sensation caused by overlapping frequencies.\n\nMethods. This study included 20 adults with normal hearing (eight men and 12 women; mean age: 35.6 years). In Experiment 1, participants listened to pairs of tone sequences (dichotic and diotic) and chose the one in which an ascending scale was perceived more clearly. In Experiment 2, the participants determined the tone pairs that sounded rougher. The two dichotic tone sequences were named 2S and 2J, respectively. The 2S consisted of the C major scale with ascending tones presented to the right ear, whereas the pitch of the simultaneously presented tones to the left ear was two whole tones lower. Furthermore, 2J was created by swapping every other tone between the right and left ears in 2S. The diotic versions included one in which the tones from the right and left channels of 2S were mixed in both ears (DO) and one in which the tones of the right channel of 2S were heard from both ears (S).\n\nResults. In Experiment 1, the participants most clearly perceived the diotic version S. Regarding dichotic tonal sequences, no considerable differences were observed in perception between 2S and 2J. In the diotic version of the DO, pitch perception varied across individuals. In Experiment 2, the DO was rated as substantially rougher than in all other conditions, including 2S and 2J.\n\nConclusion. Our results showed two perceptual benefits of dichotic listening in individuals with normal hearing. First, dichotic listening supports the perception of coherent melodic patterns, with pitch proximity dominating the location of the sound input. Second, the dichotic presentation considerably reduced roughness, likely owing to the separation of frequency processing in the cochlea of each ear. Despite being a preliminary investigation, this study underscores the potential of dichotic listening to improve auditory clarity and comfort.",

          "abstract": "Striving for social status is a fundamental human motive, yet individuals vary considerably in their status-seeking tendencies. Drawing on attachment literature and life history theory, we propose that attachment anxiety drives status pursuit through heightened intrasexual competition. Across six preregistered studies (N = 4,456) spanning five countries, we found that attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, predicts stronger status strivings. This relationship is mediated by intrasexual competition—competing with same-sex rivals—rather than, as previously documented, by materialism or general competitiveness. Experimental evidence confirmed causality: inducing attachment anxiety (vs. avoidance) increased desire for high-status cars and houses through heightened intrasexual competition. A moderation-of-process design demonstrated that experimentally manipulating intrasexual competition correspondingly enhanced or reduced the effect of attachment anxiety on status strivings, but only for high-status possessions. These effects held for both men and women. Our findings show that anxiously attached individuals pursue status to compensate for relational insecurities, and they do so by competing with same-sex rivals. This research extends attachment theory to status pursuit and clarifies whether, when, and why individual differences in attachment patterns predict people’s status strivings.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated deepfake videos, which mimic real recordings of individuals, enable the impersonation of public figures and the widespread dissemination of misinformation. According to previous research, people are not only poor at detecting deepfakes but also often overestimate their detection ability, highlighting the need for effective interventions. Despite this, evidence on how to improve deepfake detection and calibrate metacognitive judgments remains limited. In this preregistered 2 x 2 experiment, we examined the effects of an educational infographic, cognitive load, and their interaction on deepfake detection accuracy and metacognitive overestimation (absolute and relative). We also investigated age, cognitive reflection, and general trust as potential moderators. A total of 229 participants were randomly assigned to infographic versus control conditions and high versus low cognitive load conditions, viewed 12 political videos (deepfakes and authentic videos), and rated videos’ authenticity and their perceived performance. The results showed that participants exposed to the infographic showed higher detection accuracy and more accurate relative performance judgments, whereas cognitive load did not produce significant main effects. An interaction suggested that the infographic’s metacognitive benefits weakened under higher load, although this finding requires caution due to an inconclusive manipulation check. None of the individual differences moderated the findings. Lastly, participants slightly underestimated their absolute performance but considerably overestimated their relative standing, with the lowest performers showing the strongest overconfidence. Overall, the results suggest that concise and engaging guidance, such as infographics, can enhance deepfake detection and promote more calibrated self-assessments, providing a scalable tool for strengthening resilience to synthetic media.",

          "abstract": "Humans excel at leveraging relational knowledge (e.g., relative features or locations) to facilitate object processing. This knowledge is thought to emerge gradually through associative learning over the course of experience. While extensive research has shown how experience shapes attentional biases toward non-social regularities, far less is known about whether the learning of social relationships – the most consequential form of relational knowledge for humans – tunes attention toward social entities. Across four experiments (N = 144), we examined this question by training participants to associate face pairs with either interacting (face-to-face) or non-interacting (back-to-back) configurations. In a subsequent cueing task, direct-gaze face pairs from interacting configurations captured attention more strongly than those from non-interacting configurations, an effect abolished for upside-down faces. This bias persisted even when individual faces from learned dyads were tested in isolation. In contrast, this bias did not occur for arrows, ruling out domain-general cueing, and for animal faces, even when training promoted identity-level processing, indicating its specificity to human faces. Our findings demonstrate that social relationships can be internalized through experience as emergent attributes of face representations, highlighting a key role of social learning in shaping attention to social information.",

          "abstract": "Individuals differ in their intrinsic modes of internal representation, exhibiting varying degrees of visual imagery, inner speech, and orthographic imagery. Yet the potential cognitive functions of these internal representation modes remain underexplored. Through three studies (N = 1,399), we demonstrate that individual differences in orthographic imagery propensity, measured by the Internal Representations Questionnaire (IRQ), systematically associate with internal semantic architecture and external sensory engagement. Study 1 (n = 1099) revealed that stronger orthographic imagery correlates with heightened between-cluster semantic associations and reduced semantic conformity to group norms, suggesting a role in generating novel conceptual links. Study 2 (n = 875) linked orthographic imagery to lower sensory processing sensitivity, suggesting its function as a top-down sensory filter. Unexpectedly, Study 3 (n = 487) found that visual imagery—not orthographic—predicted reduced engagement with reading apps, suggesting a cognitive-mismatch effect. These results position orthographic imagery as a unique mechanism that expands semantic networks while attenuating sensory influx, with implications for creativity research and clinical interventions for sensory hypersensitivity.",

Bullying victimization has been categorized as an adverse childhood experience (ACE) by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Studies examining the long-term impact of repeated bully victimizations have found that victimization in childhood and adolescence leads to poor mental health outcomes such as anxiety disorders later in the life course (Carlisle and Rofes, 2007; Copeland et al., 2013; Stapinski et al., 2014).  Unfortunately, few studies have investigated this association across categories of sex and race/ethnicity despite documented differences in reported rates of general anxiety disorder. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, the present study explores the relationship between childhood bullying victimization and generalized anxiety disorder in middle adulthood. The results suggest the impact of experiencing repeated bully victimizations in childhood and adolescence had a positive association with general anxiety disorder and this association was general across categories of sex and race/ethnicity.

Despite\ngrowing self-reports on the stigma faced by children of incarcerated parents, little is known\nabout the biases held by their peers, particularly among university students. This study\ninvestigates bias against classmates experiencing parental incarceration and examines how these\nbiases vary based on the severity of the crime committed by the parent (violent vs. non-violent\nvs. non-incarcerated absent parent) and the parental role (mother vs. father). A sample of\nuniversity students (ages 18-25) was recruited from the University of Maryland’s SONA system\nand randomly assigned to read one of six vignettes describing a hypothetical classmate whose\nparent (mother or father) was either incarcerated for a violent crime, incarcerated for a non-\nviolent crime, or not incarcerated but absent for unspecified reasons. Participants then completed\nmeasures assessing their biases toward their classmates. Results revealed that students exhibited\nsignificantly greater bias toward classmates with a parent incarcerated for a violent crime\ncompared to those with an absent but non-incarcerated parent. However, no significant\ndifferences in bias were found against classmates regarding their parent’s role (father or mother).\nThese findings highlight the potential stigma associated with parental incarceration in higher\neducation settings and emphasize the need for further research that explores the differences in\nbias across race and different family structures (such as a two-parent household vs an\nincarcerated parent). Further research, along with this study, will help inform advocacy and\nawareness efforts in educational institutions, as well as guide the implementation of the best\nsupports for children of incarcerated parents.",

In contrast, most recent studies of visual working memory (VWM) using continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, do not distinguish between memory variability and decision-process variability in characterizing retrieval errors and are silent on decision times. We combined a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions, the circular diffusion model (CDM), with a peaked, heavy-tailed distribution of memory representations, the Jones-Pewsey distribution, to characterize the speed and accuracy of continuous-outcome decisions about the hues of saturated and desaturated color patches in four experiments that varied the difficulty of the decision task and the memory load of the VWM task. The CDM provided a good account of the marginal and joint distributions of response times and response errors and the anisotropies of stimuli in different parts of the color space across all experiments. VWM precision followed either an inverse square-root law or power law in set size, depending on saturation, as predicted by sample-size and attention-weighted sample-size models, respectively. The results support a model in which the capacity limits of VWM reflect the statistical properties of a population of noisy neurons that are divided among items in memory under attentional control and determine the precision of recalled items.",

          "abstract": "Scale-free temporal structure in resting-state intrinsic neural activity has been proposed to support the interaction between internal and external cognition, but its role in decision making remains unclear. We examined whether individual differences in the dynamics of resting-state alpha activity are related to how much people rely on externally reinforced options versus internally generated preferences during free choice. Participants first performed an externally guided reward-learning task, in which they learned through feedback which abstract shapes tended to yield rewards. They then completed an internally guided preference-judgment task, repeatedly choosing between these previously rewarded shapes and new shapes without feedback. Resting-state electroencephalography was recorded before, between, and after the two tasks. A computational model provided trial-by-trial estimates of stimulus value in preference-judgment task, and long-range temporal correlations in the alpha-band amplitude envelope were quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis. We replicated the superiority of intrinsically learned value: the most preferred new shape acquired a higher final value than the previously rewarded shapes, despite their higher initial values derived from external reinforcement. Stronger scale-free temporal correlations in resting-state alpha activity were associated with a larger superiority of intrinsically learned value, primarily reflecting lower final values for previously rewarded stimuli and relatively higher values distributed across multiple intrinsically learned options. These findings suggest that scale-free temporal dynamics in resting-state alpha activity reflect an intrinsic neural bias that favours internally generated preferences over extrinsically reinforced values in free choice.",

          "abstract": "Humans are capable of remarkably flexible moral judgment. Yet societies rely on rigid rules—obligations and prohibitions that apply categorically, even when case-by-case reasoning could yield better outcomes. Why would a species capable of such flexibility bind itself to inflexible rules? We propose that rigid rules arise as social technologies for managing ambiguity around noncooperation. People often have legitimate reasons for failing to cooperate, yet those reasons are typically opaque to observers, allowing opportunists to disguise selfishness as justified hardship. We formalize this idea with an evolutionary game-theoretic model. Two cooperative equilibria emerge: a flexible norm that accommodates legitimate excuses but is vulnerable to exploitation, and a rigid norm that closes this loophole by mandating cooperation even when inefficient. Comparing these equilibria reveals an efficiency–robustness trade-off: flexibility maximizes welfare when trust is secure, whereas rigidity preserves cooperation when trust is fragile. This explains why rigid rules prevail in low-trust settings—interactions with strangers, formal institutions, or tight societies—where flexibility is more common in high-trust contexts.",

          "authors": "Sarah Horan Kerns",
          "abstract": "The modularity of cognitive processes has been debated for centuries, with neuroscientists investigating specialized face processing mechanisms for over 50 years. Behavioral studies, neuroimaging evidence, and face-specific deficits have provided support for dedicated face processing mechanisms. However, practical constraints have limited neuropsychological tests to only a few object categories, restricting clear dissociations between impaired face perception and intact object perception. Leveraging participants with prosopometamorphopsia(PMO), a condition characterized by conscious distortions in face shape, features, texture, and color, we address this limitation through three contributions. First, we develop a comprehensive perceptual assessment containing over 500 object categories to provide an unprecedented test of face-specificity claims. Second, we document face-specifi c distortions in two PMO individuals, offering compelling evidence for dedicated face-processing mechanisms. Third, we attempt to isolate drivers of object distortions in PMO individuals, such as symmetry and ovoid shape processing, providing clues to the broader organization of human visual processing systems. Five PMO participants completed our task, revealing distinct response patterns. Three participants reported distortions to both faces (43%, 77%, and 90%, respectively) and objects (2.9%, 3.5%, and 25.6%, respectively), with greater face distortion frequency predicting greater object distortion frequency. However, two participants (A.S. and Aurora) exhibited perfect face-specificity with distortions of 100% of face images and zero object images. The clear dissociations between face and object perception in these two cases within the unprecedented breadth of object categories examined, provide compelling evidence for face-specific processing mechanisms. Further exploration found that although distortion-provoking objects were dissimilar to faces in several compared dimensions, they frequently contained ovoid shapes, suggesting non-face-specific PMO involves general shape processing mechanisms. In sum, our results develop a strong test of face-specificity, elucidate the existence of face-specific mechanisms in a context of unprecedented breadth of tested objects, and offer potential insights into human visual processing more broadly.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAnhedonia, defined as a reduced capacity for pleasure or motivation for reward, is a core transdiagnostic feature of psychopathology and a key determinant of social functioning. Cognitive dysfunction, particularly verbal memory impairment, may contribute to anhedonia by reducing anticipatory pleasure, in turn decreasing social functioning. This study examined whether anhedonia mediates the relationship between verbal memory and social functioning in a large, population-based sample, and whether this pathway varies by sex, lifetime psychiatric history, or transdiagnostic symptom dimensions.\nMethods\nParticipants (N=8,576) were drawn from the UK Biobank. Verbal memory was assessed using the Paired Associate Learning test, anhedonia by frequency of disinterest/little pleasure, and social functioning by frequency of social visits. Participants with and without lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were matched on age, sex, and Townsend Deprivation Index. Mediation and moderated mediation analyses tested indirect effects of verbal memory on social functioning through anhedonia and the role of sex, lifetime psychiatric diagnosis, and Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) symptom dimensions (internalizing, externalizing, psychosis).\nResults\nAnhedonia significantly mediated the association between verbal memory and social functioning (indirect effect = 0.0024, p &lt; 0.001), whereas the alternative model (verbal memory as moderator) was not significant. The mediation was stronger among males, individuals with psychiatric diagnoses, and those with internalizing symptoms.\nConclusions\nFindings support a transdiagnostic cognitive-symptom-function pathway linking verbal memory deficits to poorer social functioning through anhedonia. These results highlight memory-focused cognitive interventions as potential targets to enhance motivation and social outcomes across dimensional and transdiagnostic contexts.",

          "abstract": "Pairing a conditioned stimulus (CS) repeatedly with aversive imagery as unconditioned stimulus (US) induces conditioned subjective and autonomic fear responses which can explain fears without prior aversive experiences. To investigate underlying brain dynamics, we assessed the Late Positive Potential, an electrocortical response sensitive to classically conditioned fear, together with skin conductance, cardiac interbeat interval, and fear ratings in N = 48 participants. Participants underwent either (a) imagery-based fear conditioning, in which aversive CS+ (CS+av), neutral CS+ (CS+neu) and CS- were paired with cues to imagine an aversive electric shock, a mild vibration, or nothing, respectively; or (b) classical fear conditioning in which CS were paired with physical shocks, physical vibrations, or nothing. The imagery-based conditioning group showed increased LPP amplitudes for CS+av compared to CS- and tentatively to CS+neu. Additionally, CS+av evoked higher fear ratings than both non-aversive CS. These effects did not differ significantly between imagery-based and classical conditioning. Meanwhile, strong cardiac deceleration and increased skin conductance responses to CS+av were uniquely observed for classical conditioning. These results suggest that imagery-based conditioning evokes similar cortical and subjective, but not autonomic, responses as conditioning with physical US – advancing our understanding of fear in the absence of aversive real-life experiences.",

          "abstract": "Meditation, in particular advanced meditation, develops toward meditative endpoints (MEND), sometimes referred to metaphorically as awakening, enlightenment or salvation. A well-known instance of such an endpoint is called nibbāna (Pali) or nirvana (Sanskrit). Contemporary mindfulness teachers and diverse Buddhist traditions present differing views of nirvana. Some define nirvana as the ultimate reality beyond awareness, while others define it as liberated or pure awareness itself. Some descriptions of nirvana focus on the cessation of various mental phenomena (and particularly the cessation, or end, of suffering) and others based on affirmations (e.g., ultimate happiness). Nirvana has also been defined as ineffable, or as paradoxical (e.g., as neither existence nor non-existence). These, and other, different views and descriptions of nirvana make it challenging to understand this construct, and to establish a science of advanced meditation including meditative endpoints (MEND). Here, we propose an integrated taxonomy that unifies the different views and descriptions. It differentiates between ways of MEND entry, MEND events, and persistent MEND. The proposed taxonomy hence provides a unified view, a framework for differentiating and relating distinct approaches to MEND in the sense of nirvana, and a starting point for investigating MEND beyond the case of nirvana.",

          "authors": "Nang Lisa Longphai",
          "abstract": "Working objectification, defined as treating workers as mere objects and means to a purpose instead of individuals with ideas, feelings, and moral rights, still exists as a major challenge in many modern organisations despite numerous interventions including participatory work design, managerial training, well-being program, and ethical technology redesign efforts to alleviate the challenge. Empirical and theoretical data suggests that these interventions often fail to produce long-term change (Carmeli, Brueller, &amp; Dutton, 2010; Loughnan, Haslam, Murnane, Vaes, &amp; Suitner, 2010). This commentary seeks to argue that working objectification persists because interventions merely target surface-level symptoms of workers like stress or satisfaction instead of addressing the underlying cultural and structural causes rooted in organisational systems that make working objectification a prevalent practice in modern organisations. A fundamental shift in organisational values is required to make an effective intervention addressing the challenge. Such a shift is only possible if human dignity is elevated to the top of the organisational value hierarchy which views workers as human beings with autonomy and emotional needs, not as objects and tools for productivity. However, several gaps exist in the current research on working objectification. One of these gaps is that of a comprehensive study of interventions by modern organisations to address the issue of working objectification, their impact, and implications for developing focused interventions. This research gap points towards an ample scope for future research on one of the less researched areas, which, however, must include longitudinal and cross-sectional studies on working objectification.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Trait mindfulness—one’s disposition toward non-judgmental awareness of present-moment experience—has been associated with various affective and cognitive outcomes. One proposed mechanism is that this kind of mindfulness attenuates the tendency to become attached to some experiences and avoid others. In line with this, a previous study reported that trait mindfulness reduced the development of affective preferences for letter strings that, unbeknownst to participants (n=18), followed a specific grammatical structure (Whitmarsh et al., 2013). If robust, this finding would confirm that trait mindfulness reduces implicit affective biases. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to replicate this main finding with a much larger sample size (n=127) and also explored whether prior meditation experience influenced implicit preference formation.\nMethods. Trait mindfulness was measured in 127 participants using the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, 2011). Over five days, participants were exposed to strings of apparently random letters, some of which conformed to an artificial grammar. They reproduced these strings in a working memory task and later rated whether they liked them, providing an index of implicit preference.\nResults. We replicated basic artificial grammar learning effects but found no association between trait mindfulness and implicit preference development. Meditation experience similarly showed no effect on preference formation.\nConclusion. In this preregistered study, we did not replicate the previously reported effect of trait mindfulness on implicit preferences with our larger sample and improved design. Preference development may be too automatic to be modulated by mindfulness. Alternative explanations are also discussed.",

          "authors": "Maximilian Stefani; Marian Sauter",
          "abstract": "Does selection history reshape attentional priority along the depth axis as it does in the image plane? Across three immersive virtual-reality visual-search experiments (total N=65), we tested whether observers implicitly learn depth-based regularities and exploit them to guide attention. Participants searched for an oriented target among distractors distributed across stereoscopically defined planes while target probability was manipulated between the depth planes. In Experiment 1 (N=37), with two eligible frequent target planes (near vs. far; 80/20 between subjects), responses were reliably faster when the target appeared on the frequent plane, regardless of whether it was near or far. In Experiment 2 (N=15), when all three planes were eligible and the target probability was concentrated at the fixation-aligned middle plane (10–80–10), no benefit emerged for the frequent plane. Experiment 3 (N=13) reinstated a between-subjects 80–10–10 probability distribution across all three planes: robust prioritization reappeared when the frequent plane was near or far, but again failed when it coincided with the middle plane. Together, the findings show that statistical learning can reweight plane-level priority in three dimensions, yet fixation depth constitutes a boundary condition where probabilistic biases do not accrue. A two-stage account is proposed consisting of plane-level gating followed by within-plane selection. This account reconciles the results with planar contextual-cueing findings and informs VR interface design.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to develop the Parent Communication Avoidance Scale for Youth of Korean Descent in Japan (PCAS-KJ) and to examine its reliability and validity among youths of Korean descent residing in Japan. The participants were 278 individuals aged 18–30 years (M = 21.63, SD = 3.15, 133 women, 142 men, three participants chose not to answer). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure consisting of Avoidance of Discussion and Expression and Negative Thoughts toward Parents. Internal consistency, as assessed by McDonald’s omega (ω = .81–.90), and test-retest reliability, as indicated by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = .74–.84), were satisfactory. The PCAS-KJ subscales showed significant small-to-moderate positive correlations with measures of acculturation discrepancy, depression, anxiety, social isolation, and cognitive fusion, thereby supporting convergent validity. Furthermore, mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of the PCAS-KJ on the relationship between acculturation discrepancy and depression, anxiety, and social isolation. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that adding the PCAS-KJ to experiential avoidance (EA) and acculturation discrepancy significantly improved the prediction of depression and social isolation. These findings suggest that the PCAS-KJ is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing EA specifically related to parent-child communication among youths of Korean descent in Japan.",

          "abstract": "Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can paradoxically precipitate suicidality, agitation, and behavioral disinhibition in 2-5% of patients, particularly during the first two weeks of treatment. Current explanations—notably \"activation theory\"—fail to account for observed temporal patterns, demographic vulnerabilities, and patient phenomenology.\n\nMethods: We conducted systematic literature review (N=188 sources) combined with computational pattern mining using large language models to identify convergent evidence across pharmacological, phenomenological, demographic, and temporal domains.\n\nResults: Five patterns emerged consistently: (1) precise temporal clustering in days 4-14 post-initiation; (2) demographic vulnerabilities (youth, women, trauma survivors, low SES, social isolation, first-time users) independent of depression severity; (3) phenomenology emphasizing identity disruption and disorientation rather than energization; (4) comorbidity patterns involving identity-disturbed conditions (BPD, PTSD, OCD); and (5) identical 10-14 day response timelines across all antidepressants and placebo.\n\nInterpretation: We propose the \"identity disruption\" framework: SSRIs produce rapid neurobiological changes that alter patients' experiential substrate before cognitive/identity adjustment can occur. For patients whose identity is organized around symptoms SSRIs target, this creates acute ontological crisis. Risk factors reflect diminished capacity for identity navigation, not depression severity.\n\nClinical Implications: Treatment protocols must scaffold identity transition through pre-treatment identity assessment, existential psychoeducation, anchor person protocols, and intensive monitoring at days 3, 7, 10, and 14.",

          "abstract": "False memory (FM) has been widely studied using the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1995). The present work investigates FM across two experiments, focusing on emotional valence, gender, and working memory capacity (WMC). Experiment 1 tested the hypothesis that women would show higher FM rates for emotional word lists, using neutral, negative, and positively valenced lists, with both recall and recognition tests. Contrary to predictions, FM rates did not differ by gender. Experiment 2 extended this by incorporating WMC measures (RSPAN, SymSpan, and backward digit span) to test the hypothesis that higher WMC would be associated with reduced FM. While WMC was positively associated with correct memory performance, its relationship with FM was more nuanced. Higher WMC was linked to reduced false recall among women, suggesting WMC may buffer activation effects, particularly for negative stimuli. Across both experiments, FM rates were highest for negative lists but did not differ by gender. These findings contribute to understanding how emotion and cognitive resources jointly shape FM susceptibility and suggest that WMC may play a moderating role in emotional FM, especially among women.",

However, there has been insufficient research on individuals’ diverse beliefs about the location of the person or presence of God (or the Divine)—a concept we refer to as the Where-being of God. Here, we report on the development and validation of a measure of U.S. Christians’ and SBNRs’ representations of the Where-being of God: Transcendent, Internal (Immanent and Indwelling), Emergent, and Sacramental. Generally, Christians scored higher than SBNRs on Transcendent, Evangelicals scored higher on Internal, Catholics scored higher on Sacramental, and Catholics and SBNRs scored higher on Emergent compared with the other groups. However, each representation was differentially predicted by individual differences in existing measures of religion and spirituality, and differentially correlated with various character strengths, ethical frameworks, and conditions for obtaining God’s forgiveness. More research is needed to investigate the generalizability of our findings and, possibly, to expand our novel Where-being measure to include other conceptualizations of the location of the presence of the Divine.",

We highlight common insights across disciplines, key challenges stemming from discipline-specific approaches, and novel potentials enabled through the interdisciplinary approach. By allowing comparative analyses across species, groups of individuals, and contexts, our approach promises to uncover the shared and unique nature of individuality in human social behaviour. We offer concrete recommendations to guide the implementation of the interdisciplinary approach.",

Known variously as interpersonal emotion regulation and social emotion regulation, researchers in affective science have begun to develop theoretical models of and a diverse set of methodologies to study this phenomena. However, two aspects of the phenomena remain underspecified: a) target and regulator roles are often blurred and variable and b) the goal dynamics that guide social emotion regulation are social in nature – tenets that have been historically discussed in relationship science and developmental science. Here, we review relevant literature from affective, social, and developmental sciences to highlight underexplored questions related to fluctuating roles in social emotion regulation and heterogeneous and interdependent (often social) goals that meaningfully impact social emotion regulation in everyday life. Then, we provide brief methodological suggestions that illustrate new analytic approaches that can be utilized to help understand roles and goals better in social emotion regulation. By paying attention to both variable roles and the social nature of goals, we can build better models of social emotion regulation that are inclusive of the heterogeneous situations, while also adopting rigorous analytical methods that respect the social nature of SER and broaden our temporal resolution to examine the interplay of roles and goals across the lifespan.",

In the current study, we investigated whether the ensemble encoding of these facial cues is processed differently between moving and static faces. Across two experiments, participants performed a delayed-match-to-sample expression recognition task using dynamic and static stimuli. Ensemble size was manipulated by increasing the number of faces in the target array. In Experiment 1, we presented one, two, and four target faces. In Experiment 2, we presented one, four, and eight target faces. Results demonstrated that while recognition accuracy for dynamic and static faces was comparable when one target face was presented, task accuracy diverged as the ensemble size increased. Specifically, increasing the number of faces in the target array failed to improve task performance for the dynamic expression stimuli. In addition, the results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that when eight faces were presented in the dynamic condition, performance was impaired for all expressions (disgust, fear, and happy) as well as in the non-emotional air-puff condition. This suggests motion in general disrupted the participants ability to extract an accurate summary statistic as the ensemble size was increased.",

In this regard, Easy-to-Read (E2R) recommendations aim to enhance text comprehension, particularly for individuals with cognitive or linguistic needs, but evidence is still limited regarding whether these adaptations also benefit the general population. This study investigated the effect of different text formats on accessibility and reading comprehension among Spanish university students, using eye-tracking technology. Twenty-four young participants without cognitive disabilities read texts under three conditions: Hard-to-Read (serif font, justified text, high contrast); Control (sans-serif font, left-aligned, standard spacing); and Easy-to-Read (greater spacing, optimised contrast, icons for information organisation). Comprehension was assessed through multiple-choice questions, and eye-tracking data were collected. The results revealed no significant differences in comprehension between conditions, although E2R scores tended to be higher. Eye-tracking showed that Hard-to-Read texts required longer reading times and more fixations, indicating greater cognitive effort, while the E2R format led to shorter fixations and larger saccades, suggesting more efficient visual processing. Overall, E2R modifications, though originally developed for individuals with cognitive needs, may also enhance accessibility for the young population.",

Findings showed that public self-consciousness was pronounced on social media in women relative to men (Study 1). Greater femininity predicted greater public self-consciousness on social media as well (Study 2), suggesting the effect goes beyond gender categories. We corroborated these findings with women’s qualitative experiences, which further suggested the prominent role of image-based platforms and attempts to manage self-consciousness online (Study 3; N = 37, 76% women). Our findings imply unique gender dynamics on social media, namely a context collapse centering public self-consciousness in women on social media.",

Allyship can be categorized into Committed Strategies (e.g., publicly highlighting women’s strengths) that involve social risk or personal sacrifice, and Relationship-Building Strategies (e.g., active listening) that build supportive and trusting bonds with marginalized group members. Latent profile analyses of survey data from two randomly split samples of 1,814 and 1,813 men from 103 countries were used to examine mean differences across Big Five personality profiles on Committed and Relationship-building allyship strategies toward women in the workplace. Results indicated that people with Well-Adjusted personalities (high on all Big Five traits except low in neuroticism) viewed both Committed and Relationship-building strategies as better-fitting to their personalities, relative to the other three personality profiles that emerged in our data. Hierarchical regression analyses further found that five key character strengths (bravery, kindness, fairness, social intelligence, and perspective) explained additional variance beyond the Big Five in both Committed and Relationship-building strategies, reinforcing the value of character strengths in allyship. Exploratory bivariate correlations revealed that among the Big Five, agreeableness and openness were the strongest and most consistent predictors of 10 Committed and Relationship-building allyship strategies. In a first of its kind, the current study broadens the scope of who allies are as well as what allyship can look like and offers an additional path for allyship training through consideration of personality traits and character strengths.",

While the program is effective in terms of patient outcomes, the scarcity of specialized pain psychologists limits its broader implementation. \n\nAims: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an evidence-based psychology intervention used at the TPS. We aimed to develop a fully self-guided, digital psychology intervention for individuals at risk for CPSP.\n\nMethods: The digital self-guided intervention was modeled after a 3-hour ACT group workshop at the TPS. It includes psychoeducation about ACT and pain that revolves around the ACT Matrix, a tool for evaluating coping strategies and enhancing quality of life. The intervention was developed on the digital health application, Manage My Pain (MMP), as an interactive, self-guided program. Development followed an iterative process, with qualitative feedback from TPS patients, clinicians, research staff and app developers. \n\nResults: The online intervention was implemented as four sequential 15 min parts plus a fifth optional summary and reference part. Each part includes didactic modules interspersed with interactive activities, experiential exercises, and optional learning checks. The MMP platform’s existing navigation features helped streamline development. Patient and clinician feedback from “think-aloud” and retrospective interviews helped refine key usability factors, including engagement, navigation, and content clarity. \n\nConclusions: The self-guided digital ACT intervention is scalable and can be easily implemented at clinics without specialized pain psychologists. Further testing in a randomized controlled trial will assess its acceptability and efficacy as a substitute for psychologist-led group workshops.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains to the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "Gender essentialism and stereotyping emerge early in childhood, even though parents rarely discuss essentialist ideas with young children and often try to communicate egalitarian messages. Here we considered that parents’ generic references to gender, which subtly convey that gender reflects a natural kind, could contribute to the transmission of harmful beliefs even when they express counter-stereotypic ideas. In this pre-registered study, we used unmoderated remote research methods to record 192 parent-child dyads (children ages 3–5) talking about gender and assess children’s gender essentialism and stereotypes over time. Parents’ generic references to gender predicted children’s essentialism and stereotyping, even when this language expressed neutral and counter-stereotypic content. These findings suggest that highlighting specific counter-stereotypical examples (e.g., “That girl is great at soccer!”) might be more effective than counter-stereotypical generic sentences (e.g., “Girls are good at soccer too!”) at mitigating the development of gender essentialism and stereotyping in childhood.",

In this study, we measured perceived masculinity, femininity, agency, and communion for 347 U.S. jobs using O*NET descriptors and 2022 Census data. Participants rated 134 job characteristics, which we combined into composite scores weighted by activities, skills, abilities, and values. We tested whether percent women in a job predicted communal or agentic work, whether job femininity-masculinity aligned with perceived communion and agency, and whether these relationships differed by job preparation level. Results show that women are consistently overrepresented in communal jobs, but men are only overrepresented in agentic jobs for high-preparation occupations. Job femininity strongly aligns with communal content, while job agency only aligns moderately with masculinity in high-prep jobs. These findings show that the links between gender, agency, and communion vary across the occupational landscape.",

          "abstract": "Background: The use of instructional videos in Higher Education is increasingly common. Given the multiple modalities available in these videos, understanding how design choices impact learning is essential for optimising educational practices.    \nAims: This study aims to explore how the instructor’s use of gestures as well as student motivation and allocation of visual attention influence learning from instructional videos. Using eye-tracking methodology in online testing, the study sought to understand the cognitive processes underpinning learning in online, asynchronous education, and inform the effective design of multimedia learning videos. \nSample: Participants were 135 Undergraduate Psychology students.  \nMethods: Participants completed a knowledge test before and after watching a set of multimedia instructional videos. They were in one of two conditions: they either watched videos in which the instructor gestured as normal, or videos in which he did not gesture at all. During these videos, eye-tracking data was collected to investigate the proportion of time participants looked at the instructor. Self-reported motivation was measured.  \nResults: Analyses showed no evidence of gaze towards the gesturing instructor on improving learning. However, the relationship between learning gain and motivation differed depending on whether gestures were present: when gestures were absent, participants showed learning gains primarily when they also reported higher motivation to study further, whereas the presence of gestures was associated with more consistent learning gains across motivation levels. \nConclusion: These findings underscore the importance of factors like learners’ motivation and effective integration of gesture use when designing instructional videos.",

          "abstract": "Social rejection and acceptance are typically investigated from the perspective of individuals receiving, or observing, such information independent of others. However, experiences of rejection and acceptance often unfold in dyadic contexts, and can have implications for how partners interact, relate, and support each other. Employing a novel dyadic task, we examined affective responses to simultaneous social feedback among cohabiting couples (Nparticipants = 168). Consistent with preregistered hypotheses, participants reporting higher relational interdependence were more likely to experience their partner’s social feedback as a personal reward or loss. This pattern emerged even when participants received incongruent social feedback (e.g., receiving negative feedback while a partner received positive feedback). Moreover, positive affect for a partner’s social feedback was associated with higher perceived partner support, and perceived capitalization attempts. Together, findings suggest that a key signature of relational interdependence may manifest as responding sensitively to a partner’s rewarding and aversive information (e.g., feeling a partner’s social feedback as one’s own), and being responsive to a partner’s outcomes (e.g., providing support during times of need, showing enthusiasm during positive events).",

          "authors": "Ilenia Falcinelli; Chiara Fini; Anna M. Borghi",
          "abstract": "Concepts, typically classified into more abstract (e.g., “chair”) and more concrete (e.g., “friendship”), are the mental shortcuts that people commonly use to organize knowledge and navigate their inner and external world. Research on categorization highlights social interaction as crucial for the acquisition and use of abstract concepts. Behavioral evidence shows that people typically learn abstract concepts primarily through language; even after acquisition, they feel less confident about their meaning and tend to rely more on others to refine or negotiate them. Neuroscientific studies support this evidence by showing a greater activation of social and linguistic brain areas for concepts higher in abstractness. However, existing literature relies on constrained experimental methods, testing participants mainly in isolation (“single-brain” approach) or, when using more interactive (conversational) paradigms, they have two main limitations: (I) using non-naturalistic settings; (II) extracting only behavioral indices. Within the emerging “second-person neuroscience” panorama, we contend that hyperscanning—a technique consisting of the simultaneous recording of brain activity from multiple individuals—may be ideally suited to adding evidence on the link between abstract concepts and social interactions by capturing Inter-Brain Synchronization (IBS) of individuals during real-time social exchanges. The availability of portable devices further broadens hyperscanning potential, allowing for the study of brain-to-brain coupling in more ecological environments. Drawing on prior hyperscanning evidence from learning to free conversations, we contend that using hyperscanning in naturalistic settings, with the due care, may offer a novel and interesting lens to investigate the role of social interactions for abstractness, thus enriching categorization research.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that long-term memory (LTM) knowledge can support working memory (WM) performance. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. The present study investigated the role of two WM maintenance mechanisms, attentional refreshing and articulatory rehearsal, in the short-term retention of words that are more or less easily retrievable from LTM, high- versus low-frequency words. Young adults studied a series of five (Exp. 1) or three (Exp. 2) high- versus low-frequency words in Brown-Peterson tasks. In Experiment 3, the number of words in the series varied from two to six. The opportunity to use refreshing was manipulated by varying the attentional demand of the concurrent task. Orthogonally, the use of rehearsal was either strengthened by instructions or impaired by concurrent articulation. The results showed that, when three or fewer words had to be maintained, the word frequency effect, i.e., better correct recall of high- relative to low-frequency words, was reduced in the condition where the use of rehearsal was strengthened relative to the articulatory suppression condition (Exp. 2 and 3). However, when more than three words had to be maintained, the frequency effect was evident in both conditions (Exp. 1 and 3). Finally, the frequency effect was never moderated by opportunities for attentional refreshing (Exp. 1 and 2). These findings suggest that articulatory rehearsal is at least partly responsible for the impact of LTM knowledge on WM recall performance.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memory represents past experiences in a temporally compressed form—remembering an event typically takes less time than its actual duration. This compression is not uniform, however: recent work has shown that negative events are remembered with less temporal compression than neutral ones. In the present study, we conducted two experiments to investigate encoding processes that may contribute to this effect. In Experiment 1, we used a divided-attention manipulation to test whether attentional resources during encoding modulate the effect of emotion on temporal compression. Although divided attention produced a general decline in memory quality—elevating compression rates and reducing memory detail and dynamism—the magnitude of the emotional memory advantage remained unchanged under divided versus full attention. This suggests that attentional allocation alone does not explain emotion-related reductions in temporal compression. Experiment 2 examined whether negative emotion influences the segmentation of unfolding events. Results indicated that emotion and event segmentation exerted independent effects on temporal compression. Together, these results suggest that negative events yield richer and less compressed memory traces through encoding mechanisms that operate beyond attentional allocation and event segmentation, potentially involving the rapid replay of just-experienced content at event offset.",

          "abstract": "Impulsivity is a multifaceted personality trait reflecting a tendency to act on immediate urges, often linked to maladaptive real-world behaviors. One facet of impulsivity, Positive Urgency—the tendency to act rashly in response to positive affect—has been increasingly recognized as an important predictor of detrimental risk-taking behaviors. While a body of past work has uncovered a small positive predictive relationship between Positive Urgency and individuals’ propensity to take risks in laboratory tasks, little work has examined whether Positive Urgency relates to speed at which risky choices are made. Here we directly examined the relationship between Positive Urgency (measured using the SUPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale) and risky choice behavior in a simple, gain-only risky decision-making task wherein outcomes and probabilities were fully described to participants. Across two samples (a laboratory and a direct online replication; total N = 285), we observed that participants higher in Positive Urgency made significantly faster risky choices, but not choices to the ‘sure thing’ (certain) option. This predictive effect was specific to Positive Urgency as other impulsivity dimensions, such as Sensation Seeking and Negative Urgency, did not appear to relate to risky choice speed. Finally, individuals higher in overall impulsivity (taking a composite all SUPPS-P dimensions) also exhibited heightened post-reward slowing following risky wins. Together, these results highlight how Positive Urgency captures the ‘rash’ aspect of impulsive decision-making for rewards under risk.",

Participants included large population-representative twin and clinic-referred samples of youth. Using several criteria, increasingly elaborated models comprising an Externalizing dimension and seven fine-grained symptom factors outperformed models containing omnibus ADHD, ODD, and CD symptom dimensions. Results replicated across clinic and twin samples, with the Externalizing dimension most strongly reflecting defiant behavior. Symptom domains varied in their measurement properties across levels of Externalizing. This elaborated model of youth Externalizing sets the stage for future investigations of causes and outcomes, and for examining measurement invariance across individuals of diverse backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "The study of mind-wandering relies on the assumption that people accurately introspect and report on their attentional state. Yet self-reports may be distorted by extraneous motives, such as a desire to appear attentive. Across two sustained attention tasks, we demonstrate that social desirability bias is systematically linked with task-unrelated thought (TUT). In Experiment 1, higher social desirability bias scores predicted fewer subjective TUT reports during a reaction time task, despite no relationship with objective response times (RTs). This suggests a self-presentation effect rather than true attentional differences. Time pressure during thought probes further weakened RT–TUT coupling. In Experiment 2, controlling for social desirability bias enhanced the ability of an objective, RT-based real-time triggering procedure to predict deeper subjective TUT reports in the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). The alignment between objective triggers and subjective reports was strong for low-bias individuals, but weakened for those high in bias. Triggers were also less effective at capturing working memory lapses in participants prone to deliberate mind-wandering, suggesting that intentional off-task thinking manifests differently in behavior. The results show that social desirability bias can obscure TUT reports and should be considered in a science of attention and thought.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence linking media use to worse child outcomes highlights a need to understand mechanisms driving media use. Past research links media use to infant negative affect, and parents report using media to cope. However, trait-level measures can mask within-person effects that reflect mechanisms more directly. In the current study, 401 predominantly White (70.32%), college-educated (88.03%) parents (75.56% mothers) of an infant 12-24 months old (M=16.43 months, 51.37% boys) completed daily diaries reporting the frequency of parent and child activities, behaviors, and affective states each day for 21 consecutive days. Temporal network modeling was used to examine associations among parents’ daily reports of infant affect, media motivations, and parenting behavior. On days when infants were fussier, parents reported more frequent yelling and more frequent media use to occupy children, regulate children, and regulate parents’ own emotions the same day, and more media to occupy children the next day. The reverse was not true: Media use did not predict negative affect the next day. Using media to relax alone and to regulate children predicted more parent comforting the next day, while using media to connect with children predicted more infant positive affect the next day. Again, the reverse was not true. Thus, temporal effects suggest media use may be an adaptive strategy, at least in the short term. Critically, short-term (i.e., same-day and next-day) within-person effects were not found at the between-person level, underscoring the importance of examining fluctuations within individuals to identify mechanisms and potential intervention targets.",

          "abstract": "Mind wandering is frequently associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the precise nature of this relationship remains elusive. The current study applies a novel approach from mind wandering research to the context of ADHD, distinguishing between remembered mind wandering (explicitly recalling off-task thoughts) and subjective feelings of inattention (sensing one's mind has wandered without recalling specific thoughts). We investigated how these distinct aspects of inattention relate to ADHD symptomatology and well-being. Participants from university and online ADHD communities completed the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) incorporating our thought probe methodology, along with measures of ADHD symptoms and well-being. Results revealed a double dissociation: subjective feelings of inattention predicted overall ADHD symptomatology, inattention symptoms, and measures of well-being and daily impairment, while remembered mind wandering only predicted hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Our findings suggest that the link between mind wandering and ADHD is best characterized as an association between subjective feelings of inattention and inattention symptoms. We propose that this association can be explained in terms of executive dysfunction, which may underlie both increased subjective feelings of inattention and symptoms of ADHD. This nuanced perspective provides novel insights into the complex relationship between mind wandering and ADHD, underscoring the importance of considering multiple dimensions of inattention in both research and clinical contexts.",

We find that while the co-expression of meanings at both levels is highly systematic, the specific meanings recurrently involved in the two levels differ. Despite these differences, regularity at and below the word level is explained by the same underlying principle: a tension between pressure for lexical compression—favoring form reuse for related meanings, thus easing learning and processing—and for lexical differentiation—favoring distinct forms to avoid confusion in context. These findings thus offer a unified account of lexical organization across the world’s languages, with subword-level form reuse emerging as a principled compromise under universal functional pressures.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated how teachers' attitudes towards inclusive education and support from school management and community are related to their self-efficacy in the context of inclusive music education. Participants (n = 185) were teachers from Finnish comprehensive schools (Grades 1–9). They answered three questionnaires: the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practice scale, the Attitudes towards Inclusion scale, and the School Climate for Inclusive Music Education scale. Using linear regression analysis, we found that the more positive the feelings towards inclusive music classes were, the stronger the teacher's self-efficacy was in inclusive instructions, collaboration, and managing behaviour. Moreover, the more substantial the experienced support from the school community was, the stronger the teachers’ self-efficacy was in collaboration. However, beliefs on inclusive education and perceived support from school management did not show significant effects on teacher self-efficacy in inclusive music education. These findings highlight the importance of music teachers gaining positive experience in inclusive education. This implies the crucial need for sufficient training for inclusive settings and ensuring that the environment and starting points are adequate for teaching and learning music in the classroom. Results also show the impact of the school community on success when implementing inclusive music education.",

However, despite decades of research, its measurement remains inconsistent, and new scales continue to be added to the literature rather than reusing and validating existing ones. This proliferation of overlapping but unvalidated scales obscures what is actually being measured, undermines cross-study comparison, and limits the accumulation of reliable evidence for theory and practice.\nOur goal is to assess the current degree of fragmentation of measures with a psychometric analysis of their validity. Building on preceding review data, we systematically review the self-efficacy literature in privacy and security from 2010 to 2025, examining its application across distinct domains and specific technologies. We identify, cumulatively, a total of 330 different measures across 327 publications, often with unclear contextual differentiation between scales. In a second step, we analyze the convergence of 148 fully-reported measures comprising 654 items using silicon samples generated by a fine-tuned large language model. The results of the synthetic item and scale correlation estimates reveal substantial heterogeneity, indicating measurement fragmentation.\nOur findings highlight widespread evidence of current jingle-fallacies, where measures intended to assess self-efficacy capture different psychological factors in multiple cases. This emphasizes the need for standardized, validated scales to improve comparability and reproducibility. We recommend increasing methodological rigor to generate reliable insights into human-centered security and privacy behavior and to ensure the design of more effective interventions.",

In this study, we investigate the potential of machine learning models for deriving trait scores from multimodal measurement data. We consider two classes of unsupervised models, kernel principal component analysis and autoencoders, and examine their empirical performance across various measurement settings. Numerical experiments using simulated and real-assessment data suggest that machine-learned scoring recovers generating trait scores reasonably well and demonstrates close alignment with traditional scoring methods.

          "abstract": "When confronted with danger, humans display a range of defensive behaviors, such as freezing and active avoidance. Prior research has identified a distinct physiological response pattern to avoidable threats, characterized by heart rate bradycardia, reduced visual exploration, and suppressed visual alpha activity (8–13 Hz), all of which are associated with faster flight responses. This pattern suggests an adaptive state of attentive immobility. However, the relationship between this state and the encoding of explicit threat-related memories remains largely unexplored. To investigate this, we recorded parieto-occipital alpha activity, eye movements, and autonomic responses in 60 participants during anticipation of either an avoidable threat, an inevitable threat, or no threat, while viewing images of various facial identities. In a subsequent memory task, participants were asked to recognize previously seen faces among novel faces. Results showed enhanced suppression of alpha activity during avoidable threats, accompanied by heart rate bradycardia, centralized gaze, and increased sympathetic arousal. However, these responses were not linked to memory encoding. Instead, memory effects were associated with reduced pupillary responses, heightened visual exploration, and decreased alpha activity, particularly in occipitotemporal regions. Together, these findings suggest that when individuals face avoidable threats, they enter a state of attentive immobility that enhances perceptual processing and prepares them for action but does not extend to improved memory encoding.",

          "abstract": "Designing for humans is a profound challenge. The consequences of design shape people’s present and future well-being across individual, social, mental, and physical domains. Despite the rise of human-centred design, failures to understand the true beneficiaries of design decisions continue to produce harmful or ineffective outcomes. Designing well requires insight into the complex psychological systems that govern behaviour, motivation, bias, and decision-making – yet psychological knowledge is rarely integrated systematically into design practice and application. While psychology offers rigorous tools for understanding how people think, feel, and act – and although both designers and psychologists acknowledge the importance of each other’s fields – collaboration remains limited. Existing design approaches, such as those for Human Centered Design, provide process guidance but lack structured mechanisms for embedding psychological principles into everyday practice, leading to a lack of efficacy and unintended consequences in designed outcomes. To address this gap, we propose the Design Psychology Model (DPM): a practical and action-oriented framework for integrating established psychological insights into design. The DPM presents a designer-led process that sets strategic intentions, grounds work in established psychological theory, validates ideas in current contexts, and future-proofs outcomes through ongoing monitoring. The proposed model offers pathways for bridging disciplinary boundaries and invites the wider practitioner community to advance a more rigorous, ethical, and human-attuned design psychology.",

          "authors": "Piotr Szymanek; Magdalena Senderecka; Mateusz Hohol",
          "abstract": "While biological motion processing has been extensively studied, little is known about the top-down impact of expectations in this context. We tested whether expectations about the likelihood of encountering a human walker influence the detection of biological motion in point-light displays, particularly when perceptual information is unreliable. 74 participants completed a signal detection task, responding to stimuli featuring either a human walker or scrambled biological motion, each masked with one of four levels of visual noise. Participants were randomly assigned to the high or low expectations group and were told that 75% or 25% of the displays would feature a human walker, although the actual proportion was 50%. Participants in the high expectation group showed a greater tendency to respond “yes”, with the largest group difference emerging at the highest level of noise. These findings suggest that expectations can bias biological motion detection, particularly under conditions of sensory unreliability. The results also support the predictive processing model of agency detection, which proposes that false-positive perceptions of (supernatural) agents arise from culturally learned priors combined with ambiguous input.",

          "abstract": "Many everyday decisions involve integrating multiple attributes rather than comparing a single value. While normative and stochastic choice theories assume that each option is evaluated independently, evidence shows that choices can instead depend on attribute-wise comparisons between options. To investigate the source of imprecision in such comparisons, we introduce a paradigm in which participants compare two sequences of numbers and decide which sequence has the larger sum. Across three conditions, which only differ in how numbers from the two sequences are paired, we observe systematic differences in accuracy: participants perform best when paired values are closer in magnitude. This finding indicates that judgments depend on frame-wise comparisons of values presented simultaneously, rather than on independent processing of each option.\nTo account for these results, we fit several models of noisy judgment based on cumulative integration of frame-wise comparisons. We consider both models based on nonlinear integration of frame-wise comparisons and models in which comparison noise variance depends on size of the frame-wise differences, and find that these mechanisms are of differing importance for different subjects.\nClustering analyses confirm this heterogeneity, identifying one subgroup best characterized by models with value-dependent noise and another for whom nonlinear transformation of the framewise-differences is more important. Finally, we introduce hybrid models integrating both mechanisms, and find that these best explain behavior across clusters, and predict participants’ performance more accurately than single-mechanism models.\nOur findings demonstrate that attribute-wise comparisons play a central role in multi-attribute decision-making, even in tasks that do not involve subjective preferences. They further highlight the need for models that combine distorted value encoding with value-dependent noise to explain heterogeneity in human choice behavior.",

          "abstract": "Context: Vestibular disorders significantly impact people's quality of life, affecting functions such as balance and walking. Current treatments involve pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, with vestibular rehabilitation proving effective in helping to compensate for deficits. Although traditional techniques address various aspects of the vestibular system, many fundamental studies suggest motor imagery could reduce vestibular impairment. Despite the paucity of research on motor imagery for vestibular disorder rehabilitation, recent expert recommendations suggest it could enhance functional recovery. This review questions the evidence in the literature on the clinical value benefits of motor imagery as part of vestibular rehabilitation.\nThe aims of this study were 1. to identify motor imagery interventions used in the literature, 2. to critically appraise them, and 3. to report their impact on clinical outcomes.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web Of Science, CINAHL and Scopus databases. The review was registered on PROSPERO and is reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. PICO criteria were adults undergoing a motor imagery intervention as part of vestibular rehabilitation, studies with or without comparators, and the use of clinical outcome measures. A critical grid was completed, and a risk of bias assessment was performed.\nResults: Despite identifying 2344 (after duplicate removal) concerning motor imagery and vestibular rehabilitation, only two articles met our inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest a clinical benefit of integrating motor imagery into vestibular rehabilitation. However, the limited evidence and methodological shortcomings warrant caution, including small sample size, absence of imagery quality assessment, and poor generalizability. \nConclusion: Future research should address the identified limitations, including the need to study a broader range of vestibular pathologies, use comprehensive assessments, and evaluate long-term effects. This would contribute to a more thorough understanding of motor imagery as part of vestibular rehabilitation.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

Across five studies spanning the UK, the US, India, Nigeria, and Germany, we find that transformative decisions are common experiences, and that people universally rely predominantly on simple strategies associated with outcomes as satisfying as complex deliberation. However, in WEIRD countries, most individuals recommend complex, maximizing strategies to others—an “ideal–reality gap” absent elsewhere—suggesting that maximizing is a culturally specific belief rather than universal behavior.

In a recently developed model, three dimensions—persistence despite difficulties, persistence despite fear, and inappropriate persistence—were proposed to cover distinct facets of this ability, along with goal-time preferences as a persistence-related construct. The Multidimensional Persistence Scale (MPS) and the Goal-Time Preferences Scale (GTPS) were created to gauge these two separate constructs. In the current study, we conducted two studies using the Polish version of the scales (MPS-PL and GTPS-PL, respectively), with the aim of evaluating both measures. We also proposed a profile model as better reflecting the multidimensionality of persistence as opposed to the original superordinate model. In Study 1, the three-factor structure of the MPS-PL was supported by a confirmatory factor analysis. In contrast, the GTPS-PL showed a poor fit to the data as well as a vague factor structure. In Study 2, we tested the nomological network of the MPS-PL, providing evidence for its construct validity as well as the distinctiveness of its dimensions. Last, we conducted a latent profile analysis, which revealed the three qualitatively different configurations of persistence dimensions in the total study sample. Overall, the evidence we gathered supports our proposal about persistence as a multidimensional profile construct.",

          "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults involves inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, often accompanied by emotional dysregulation and significant functional impairment. Although stimulant medication effectively reduces core symptoms, its impact on broader psychosocial functioning is less consistent. Personality pathology, varying in severity and expression, may account for this variability.\nThis naturalistic study examined how dimensional models of personality pathology influence symptomatic and functional outcomes during pharmacological treatment for adult ADHD. A total of 246 adults (66% women; mean age = 33.5 years) completed assessments of general personality dysfunction, maladaptive personality traits, ADHD symptoms, and functional impairment.\nLinear mixed-effects models showed that individuals with higher levels of personality dysfunction and maladaptive traits were more functionally impaired and demonstrated less symptomatic improvement during treatment. General personality dysfunction predicted greater functional impairment and higher ADHD symptom burden, while maladaptive domains - particularly Negative Affectivity, Detachment, and Psychoticism - were strongly linked to functional impairment. In contrast, Disinhibition was the only domain meaningfully related to ADHD symptom burden, consistent with its overlap with core ADHD features. Stimulant dosage and treatment duration showed only modest associations with functional change.\nThese findings indicate that personality pathology substantially constrains the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment in adults with ADHD. Higher impairment and limited functional gains among individuals with pronounced personality dysfunction suggest that medication alone is insufficient to improve adaptive functioning. Integrated, personality-informed interventions addressing both neurocognitive and personality-based mechanisms may therefore be required to achieve lasting recovery in everyday life.\nKeywords: ADHD; Adult ADHD; Pharmacotherapy; Stimulant Medication; Dimensional Personality Pathology; Personality Dysfunction; Functional Impairment",

          "abstract": "Designing for humans is a profound challenge. The consequences of design shape people’s present and future well-being across individual, social, mental, and physical domains. Despite the rise of human-centred design, failures to understand the true beneficiaries of design decisions continue to produce harmful or ineffective outcomes. Designing well requires insight into the complex psychological systems that govern behaviour, motivation, bias, and decision-making – yet psychological knowledge is rarely integrated systematically into design practice and application. While psychology offers rigorous tools for understanding how people think, feel, and act – and although both designers and psychologists acknowledge the importance of each other’s fields – collaboration remains limited. Existing design approaches, such as those for Human Centered Design, provide process guidance but lack structured mechanisms for embedding psychological principles into everyday practice, leading to a lack of efficacy and unintended consequences in designed outcomes. To address this gap, we propose the Design Psychology Model (DPM): a practical and action-oriented framework for integrating established psychological insights into design. The DPM presents a designer-led process that sets strategic intentions, grounds work in established psychological theory, validates ideas in current contexts, and future-proofs outcomes through ongoing monitoring. The proposed model offers pathways for bridging disciplinary boundaries and invites the wider practitioner community to advance a more rigorous, ethical, and human-attuned design psychology.",

          "abstract": "Background: Although extensive evidence suggests domain-general differences in autistic attention are common and impactful, frameworks for understanding these experiences remain confused. Concepts like monotropism, autotelic (flow-prone) personality, and hyperfocus seemingly have overlapping features and distinct attributes. How they relate to one another is not empirically clear.\nMethods: 111 autistic and 39 non-autistic adults filled out a Prolific survey. We examined group differences in ADHD inattention traits and subscales from monotropism, autotelic personality, and hyperfocus measures, and how subscales were related in autism. We conducted a principal components analysis (PCA) as an initial exploration of dimensions potentially underlying these constructs. We also examined whether PCA components were related to anxiety and sensory hyperresponsitivity.\nResults: Autistic people reported more monotropism, hyperfocus, and inattention than non-autistic people. Autistic people reported more of some autotelic personality subscales (enjoyment of boredom, curiosity before correction) but less of another (attentional control). However, attentional control and self-centredness were largely unrelated to other autotelic personality dimensions; instead, they respectively converged with ADHD inattention traits and social anxiety. One PCA dimension seemingly reflected intense, enjoyable focus; it was related to sensory hyperresponsiveness, and indirectly via hyperresponsiveness with anxiety. Another seemingly reflected inattention and difficulties with attentional control; this was directly related to anxiety. These two PCA dimensions each explained relatively little variance, reflecting the complexity of autistic attention.\nConclusion: These results emphasise that attention in autism can have both positive (e.g., enjoyment) and negative (e.g., propensity to sensory distress) aspects. Underlying intense, enjoyable focus experiences likely contribute to hyperfocus, monotropism, and autotelic personality, but there appear to be many dimensions of attention in autism. Autotelic personality, as currently conceptualised, likely includes aspects that are more reflective of other existing constructs. Further research is needed to understand neurocognitive of and real-world manifestations and effects of these attention styles.",

          "abstract": "Boredom is an uncomfortable feeling of wanting but failing to engage with the world. Trait boredom proneness – the tendency to experience boredom more frequently and intensely – is associated with a wide range of mental health concerns including feelings of loneliness and problematic smartphone use. We conducted a comprehensive online survey (N=385) that included a range of psychological scales measuring boredom proneness, mental well-being, and usage of social media sites, smartphones, and the internet writ large. We also included measures of loneliness, the sense of belonging, and life satisfaction. Boredom proneness was positively correlated with higher levels of loneliness (r = 0.32) and negatively associated with the sense of belonging (r=-0.43). In addition, boredom proneness was associated with various metrics of problematic engagement with the internet and social media (including total hours of usage, nomophobia and problematic internet usage). Individual levels of self-control mediated many of these relations These findings suggest that boredom proneness significantly impacts both feelings of connectedness and online engagement behaviours, with implications for understanding the interplay between mental health and the use of technology among young adults.",

          "abstract": "The definition of life remains one of science's most profound challenges, with contemporary approaches usually focusing on two research programmes: Darwinian evolution and self-maintenance in chemical systems. While evolution has been successfully abstracted and mathematically modelled, the concept of a self-sustaining system has so far resisted a comparable level of formalisation. This paper tackles this challenge by reframing the concept of self-sustaining system within a more abstract framework to study `agents': goal-directed systems acting in an environment. We build on an existing conceptual framework comprising three requirements for agents: individuality, normativity (or goal-directedness), and interactional asymmetry. We then provide a systematic analysis, under a unified notation, of several mathematical approaches aiming to formalise these requirements, including the free energy principle, integrated information theory and dynamical systems. Unlike this conceptual framework, which commits to an intrinsic perspective on agency, we focus on a less ontologically committed `as-if' stance. Using this, we discuss links between identity and normativity, and a way to understand actions as if they were produced by causal interventions. Taken together, our systematic analysis clarifies the limitations of current proposals and reveals how they can work synergistically within a unified, mathematical account of agency across natural and artificial domains.",

          "abstract": "Pre-experiencing future climate events using either episodic future thinking (EFT) or perspective taking (PT) can increase climate change risk perception and action. Here we tested if combining EFT and PT would be more effective than EFT alone. 259 participants recruited online were randomly assigned to one of three groups: EFT+PT, which involved reading a vignette about a young friend or relative enduring a future storm; EFT, where participants read the same vignette but about a generic person; or a control condition, where participants read climate change facts. Climate action was measured by having participants make a series of real-stakes choices in which they allocated money between themselves and a climate charity. Climate change risk perception was assessed with a survey before and after the manipulation. Climate change risk perception increased overall after the manipulation, but the increase was significant only in the control group. There was also no effect of our manipulation on charitable choice. However, in the EFT+PT group, participants who reported feeling closer to their chosen friend or relative made more charitable choices. In a follow-up study, we obtained ratings of the vignettes from an independent group (n = 50). The control condition was rated as the most likely to occur, consistent with that vignette being most effective at increasing risk perception. The EFT+PT vignette was rated as the most motivating for climate action. Together, these results suggest that perspective taking with close others may encourage climate action, even if individuals’ climate change risk perception is not affected.",

Using a Hidden Markov Model–based approach, we found that while non-lonely individuals exhibited similarity, lonely individuals’ neural event segmentation patterns were dissimilar to others, particularly in high-order brain regions (e.g., the default mode network).

          "abstract": "Speech comprehension has been described as an effortless and robust process; yet, in real-world contexts, it is common for a listener to misunderstand what was said, or fail to derive meaning entirely. Typically, methods of measuring speech comprehension are applied `post-hoc' - that is, after the comprehension has happened. This approach fails to capture comprehension as it is happening, which has limited the field's understanding of the cognitive processes involved in real-time comprehension. To overcome these challenges, we designed and tested a novel method of measuring real-time speech comprehension during naturalistic listening. We built a slider device that synchronizes with experimental software and provides millisecond read-out. In three experiments, participants listened to audiobook segments while providing continuous comprehension ratings using the slider. To vary comprehension success, we presented speech segments at speed factors 1-5 times faster than normal. We validated the time-resolved slider data against established speech comprehension assessment methods. Overall, our findings validate our novel time-resolved comprehension measure and demonstrate that it is possible to derive an online behavioral measure of real-time speech comprehension. We also confirmed numerous limitations of static post-hoc assessments, including challenges of multi-choice question design, and the confounding of potential effects due to recency bias and comprehension for summarization. The measure proposed here overcomes the constraints of static post-hoc assessments, and can be effectively integrated with neuroimaging techniques, offering a valuable tool for future research on dynamic processes during naturalistic listening.",

          "abstract": "With the rapid growth of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), concerns about its psychological safety have increased. Recent psychiatric reports show that some users—especially those with vulnerable mental health—may develop delusional thoughts or psychosis-like experiences during interactions with GenAI. Detecting such risk language is therefore important for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs). This study examined whether LLMs can identify delusional statements and whether retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance. A dataset of 200 simulated user statements (50% delusional, 50% non-delusional) was created based on DSM-5 criteria and validated by a licensed psychotherapist. The dataset was divided into a 100-item retrieval corpus and a 100-item test set. Two GPT-4o-mini classifiers were evaluated: a baseline non-RAG model and a RAG-enhanced model that retrieved the three most semantically similar examples from the corpus. When a statement was classified as delusional, models also assigned a severity rating (1–3). The non-RAG model achieved 81% accuracy with a recall of 0.66, whereas the RAG model reached 94% accuracy with improved recall (0.89) and perfect specificity. However, both models systematically underestimated severity, with the RAG model showing greater underestimation. These findings indicate that RAG can enhance early detection of psychosis-like language but is insufficient for reliable severity assessment, highlighting both the potential and the limits of current LLM-based cognitive-risk detection.",

However, existing tools for studying the impact of racial diversity on social cognition are limited: some databases prioritize racial representation but restrict stimuli to the six basic emotions, while others broaden mental state diversity but lack diversity in social appearance.\nHere we introduce the McGill Diverse Face Database, a validated set of 1,286 images of 14 actors from socially perceived racial categories portraying 92 complex mental states. Validation included three experiments: (1) a four-alternative forced-choice task assessing recognition accuracy, (2) a “point-and-click” task rating valence and arousal in a two-dimensional affective space, and (3) a trait-rating task evaluating perceived actor characteristics. Participants accurately identified mental states across categories (77 % of stimuli). Mean valence–arousal ratings revealed a non-linear one-dimensional manifold structure that correlated with behavioral measures. An interactive online visualization allows users to explore this “Theory of Mind manifold” (https://hctor99.github.io/TheoryofMindManifold/). By integrating social-category diversity with complex emotional expression, this database provides a new resource for studying how socially perceived group membership shapes the perception and inference of mental states.",

          "authors": "Jessica C. Lee; Tracy Dang; Jack Collins",
          "abstract": "The tendency to overgeneralize fear learning has been identified as a potential risk factor for anxiety disorders. In this study, we examined whether highly anxious individuals differed from low anxious individuals in how they generalized fear (learning when an aversive stimulus is present) and safety (learning when an aversive stimulus is absent) following differential conditioning with an aversive scream outcome. We achieved this by using a morphed shape dimension to separately measure generalization from the fear cue (predicting the scream) and generalization from the safety cue (predicting the absence of the scream). In two experiments, we found that relative to low trait anxious participants, high trait anxious participants showed higher outcome predictions to stimuli resembling the safety cue (i.e., they undergeneralized safety learning), but not for stimuli resembling the fear cue (i.e., they did not overgeneralize fear learning). Undergeneralization was not found when a neutral outcome was used, suggesting that this effect is dependent on the use of an aversive outcome and specific to safety learning. Our findings suggest that safety generalization may vary more as a function of trait anxiety than fear generalization, and therefore future research should separately measure these processes to uncover the mechanisms driving excessive spread of fear.",

          "abstract": "It is important for researchers to be able to identify sources of low-quality data in their surveys. At the same time, it is important that the methods researchers use to detect these sources of low-quality data do not result in a substantially worse survey-taking experience for their participants. The purpose of the present project was to investigate how two types of attention check items—infrequency/frequency items (e.g., “I don’t have a first name”) and instructed-response items (e.g., “Choose disagree for this item”)—impact the survey-taking experiences of participants. In Study 1 (N = 400), we found that participants responded most favourably to a survey composed entirely of control items, followed by a survey composed entirely of infrequency/frequency items and, finally, a survey composed entirely of instructed-response items. However, in Study 2 (N = 793) and Study 3 (N = 800), we found that these effects only appeared when over half of the survey consisted of infrequency/frequency items and instructed-response items, respectively. These results suggest that attention check items can negatively impact a participant’s survey-taking experience but only when administered in large quantities. They also suggest that infrequency/frequency items tend to be better received than instructed-response items.",

          "abstract": "Psychological theories are often expressed verbally using natural language, which may lead to varying interpretations of the phenomenon under study. This potential confusion can be mitigated by formalizing verbal theories using mathematical language, which can help in defining, analyzing, and interpreting one’s hypotheses in quantitative terms. Differential equations (DE) are a class of models in dynamical systems framework, particularly suited to many dynamic theories in psychology. However, there is a lack of tools for translating verbal theories into DE systems. To facilitate this translation, we introduce SimDE, an open access R Shiny application that allows users to specify a DE model for a multivariate system and then simulate the trajectories of each variable over time. \n\nSimDE provides an interface to simulate a range of DE models, with features such as: 1) first- or second-order DEs (e.g., exponential, oscillatory), 2) models with or without a dynamic error term (ordinary or stochastic DEs), 3) models with multivariate effects (coupling dynamics). Users have the flexibility of plotting these systems in order to see the pattern of changes over time and determine the appropriateness of the model for the phenomenon they are trying to study. The goal of our app is to serve as a tool for researchers who want to explore DE models for their psychological theories before they even collect data. It can also help researchers to study the implicit assumptions of their systems defined with such DEs and further refine them as needed.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a methodologically novel approach to creativity research by simultaneously exploring creative production, creative consumption, and creative practice within a unified research design. This integration allows for the first systematic analysis of the patterns of creative engagement across these three dimensions, revealing how they co-occur and interact across multiple domains within a university student sample. Participants reported on their creative achievements, time investment, aspirations, comparison standards, and audience orientations across 11 creative domains. Correlation and logistic regression analyses revealed broadly consistent evidence of within-domain alignment: individuals who produced something creative in a given domain were generally more likely to consume creative content from that domain. Domains such as literature, visual arts, and film/video &amp; TV showed stronger cross-domain connections, whereas science and sports were more domain-bound. Creative consumption exhibited a more generalized structure, indicating stronger interrelationships among domains, while creative production clustered into smaller, domain-specific groupings. Engagement in creative practice was positively associated with both production and consumption within domains, underscoring the possible interdependence of these forms of participation. Breadth of creative production and consumption showed limited predictive potential with respect to self-reported creative achievements. Analyses of preference alignments indicated slightly higher coherence in production than in consumption, suggesting that creative production may involve more deliberate and integrated preference structures. Together, these findings illustrate the tight interrelation of creative production, creative consumption, and creative practice as dimensions of creative engagement. This integrative approach broadens the conceptual and empirical scope of creativity research beyond its traditional production-centric focus.",

          "abstract": "Social anxiety is reliably characterized by biases toward avoidance and aversive learning. Frontal-midline theta (FM-theta) oscillations have been implicated as a key neural mechanism underlying these learning biases. Here we combined dynamic network neuroscience with computational modeling to investigate how FM-theta coordinates large-scale functional network interactions on a trial-to-trial basis for feedback-guided learning, and how these neural dynamics are altered in social anxiety across different social contexts. A sample of 146 individuals (mean age = 20.4 years) with varying levels of social anxiety completed a probabilistic selection task while performing alone and under social observation. Results indicated that FM-theta contributed to two theta-dependent functional subgraphs, each differently supporting probabilistic learning. Frontal-parietal functional connectivity increased following aversive outcomes and scaled with prediction error, consistent with error-monitoring and feedback-updating. In contrast, social anxious individuals exhibited heightened context-sensitive frontal-occipital connectivity for positive feedback across contexts and for negative feedback during performance observation. Social scrutiny amplified integration between these neural network patterns, impairing learning performance, particularly in high socially anxious individuals. Together, these findings show that social anxiety is associated with dysregulated, context-sensitive FM-theta neural network dynamics, reflecting reduced neural flexibility for adaptive learning under scrutiny.",

We found that loneliness and paranoia were strongly correlated with each other and with more distrustful behavior after breaches of trust. Sensitivity to changes in partner reciprocity were higher in lonelier and more paranoid individuals. Lonelier individuals also trusted highly-reciprocating partners less. Computational modeling revealed that lonelier and more paranoid individuals were less willing to rely on expectations of partner reciprocity. Importantly, these effects were observed in both patients and controls, indicating the important impact of loneliness and paranoia on both clinical and general populations. These findings demonstrate how loneliness affects social behaviors and expectations, pointing to important downstream implications for lonely individuals’ relationships.",

          "abstract": "Collective emotional responses represent responses of multiple people to an emotional situation. Such responses are ubiquitous in many contexts, such as conflicts, crises, and celebrations. Yet, a closer look at processes of collective emotions leads to an observation: collective emotion often co-occurs with attempts to influence the emotions of the group. We refer to these attempts as collective emotion regulation, where members of groups aim to change collective emotions. In this paper, we first define collective emotion and propose a model of collective emotion generation. We then define collective emotion regulation and distinguish it from related concepts. We propose a process model to describe the unfolding of collective emotion regulation that help organize a variety of behaviors previously discussed in other literatures. We show how the concept can help explain collective behavior and facilitate planning interventions designed to regulate collective emotions. Finally, we discuss open empirical questions and future directions.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have highlighted a connection between divergent and creative thinking with episodic memory. According to the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis, individuals draw on past experiences and flexibly recombine retrieved memories to generate novel ideas. However, most research examining this link has focused on people thinking in isolation, despite the fact that autobiographical remembering and idea generation frequently occur in social contexts such as workplaces, classrooms, and everyday conversations. Therefore, the present study compared individual and collaborative performance in recalling autobiographical memories and generating uncommon uses under parallel conditions, using object cue words across tasks. Our findings partially support the constructive episodic simulation hypothesis: the two tasks were strongly correlated, yielded similar overall performance across group conditions, and both showed a significant decline in the number and variety of responses over time, although this decrease was more pronounced for memory retrieval. Contrary to previous work documenting detrimental effects of collaboration, our results indicate that collaborative and individual performance in divergent thinking and autobiographical memory are largely equivalent, while collaboration increases participants’ enjoyment of this task. Future research should clarify the conditions under which group settings optimize both episodic retrieval and creative thinking.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Internalizing disorders frequently co-occur with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and impede alcohol recovery, but directionality among these disorders is unclear. Further, shared risk factors may explain the co-occurrence of these disorders, rather than either disorder directly affecting the other. Additionally, there is evidence that these disorders are differentially associated in men and women. \nMethod: The current study examined a sample of clinical probands, recruited during adolescence based on externalizing problems, and their siblings to understand whether adolescent alcohol behavior is associated with changes in anxiety and depressive symptoms through young adulthood, and vice-versa. Participants were 1,161 individuals who completed a clinical interview in adolescence (M age=16.3) and at two subsequent waves (M age=22.6 and 28.5). Latent growth curve models tested whether baseline levels behavior (e.g., AUD) is associated with linear change in internalizing problems (e.g., depression) through young adulthood. Further, sibling-comparison analyses were conducted to control familial risk factors shared by siblings while testing whether siblings who have higher levels an independent variable (e.g., adolescent AUD) have proportionally greater increases in an outcome (e.g., depression), relative to their siblings with lower levels of that independent variable. \nResults: Adolescent AUD was associated with steeper increases in major depressive symptoms through young adulthood, and these effects were not explained by familial confounds. Additionally, adolescent AUD was associated with more adolescent generalized anxiety symptoms in females but less generalized anxiety symptoms among males. \nConclusions: These findings suggest that treating early-life AUD may decrease risk for depressive symptoms later in life, but the inverse may not be true.",

          "abstract": "Our brains are contextual, connected, social, and dynamic; failing to account for these aspects of the brain together risks misleading results that could be translated into worse health outcomes, especially for populations already underrepresented in neuroscience. In this manuscript, we synthesize recent studies that investigate the network neuroecology of social interaction and characterize how brain network organization varies across interpersonal social experience. We describe how certain patterns of brain connectivity are associated with particular social environments as a result of trade-offs in how functional connections are distributed across the brain in accordance with social experience. We call these environment-specific patterns of connectivity and their trajectories of reconfiguration over development network neuroendophenotypes. We propose two intersecting mechanisms that underlie the development of network neuroendophenotypes, addressing both how and why brain network organization contextually varies: one more protracted via stress physiology and the other more acute via the processing of affective/supportive touch. The existence of distinguishable patterns of connectivity that are associated with different social environments has important consequences for studying normative neurodevelopment and brain-based biomarkers of disease: The pattern of brain network organization that is associated with better (mental) health may look different in different environments. Ignoring social context therefore risks either pathologizing healthy brains or dismissing real disease among those who would otherwise be considered healthy. Moving forward, methodological advances that can effectively treat brain network organization as a dynamic, high dimensional, contextually influenced neuroendophenotype will be crucial for future research.",

Notably, the influence of act legality was not restricted to judgments of actions, but also guided perceptions of others’ moral character. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed individual differences in the extent to which people’s moral judgments were shaped by an act’s legal status, with act legality being most influential for participants viewing respect for authority as a moral good.

Here, I show that moral judgments depend more on how many different individuals engage in a behavior than on mere repeated exposure. Participants viewed stories about an observer witnessing repeated, morally relevant behaviors that were performed once by six different individuals, six times by the same individual, or once by a single individual. Participants rated each behavior on third-party acceptability (acceptability for the actors) and first-party acceptability (acceptability for themselves), and prevalence. Repeated behaviors increased third-party acceptability and prevalence, but more so for multiple-actor than repeated single-actor behaviors. Critically, only multi-actor behaviors, but not single-actor repeated behaviors, influenced participants’ own moral judgments. Moral norms thus shift primarily when transgressions are performed by multiple individuals.",

We investigated these questions using 600 full-face images of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese male soccer players. Korean participants (N = 52) viewed each face for 200 ms and rated it on attractiveness and trustworthiness. Ratings were then compared with accuracy data from our previous ethnicity categorization study using the same stimuli. Results revealed a clear pattern. Korean faces, as in-group members, received higher ratings than Japanese or Chinese faces. For Korean faces, higher ratings predicted greater categorization accuracy, suggesting that positive impressions can enhance rapid perceptual processing. For Chinese faces, the opposite occurred, favorable ratings were linked to lower accuracy, indicating a misattribution bias in which socially positive out-group faces were often classified as Korean. No such link appeared for Japanese faces. Across groups, attractive or trustworthy faces were more likely to be assigned to the in-group, regardless of actual ethnicity. In this study we show that rapid social evaluations can both improve and distort fine-grained ethnicity categorization, adding a social-affective layer to face perception that goes beyond visual cues alone.",

          "abstract": "Background: Multi-informant assessments are central to adolescent mental health screening. However, parent and teacher reports are only moderately correlated. Understanding cross-contextual reporting patterns can help identify adolescent mental health and functioning problems. Methods: Using data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 6,366), we examined parent- and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems; prosocial behavior) at age 11 as predictors of adolescent-reported depressive symptoms and school problems at ages 11 and 14. Response surface analysis was used to model reporting congruence and discrepancies, controlling for gender, ethnicity, and baseline outcomes in prospective analyses. Results: Parent reports were more consistent predictors of outcomes than teacher reports, yet teacher reports also contributed unique variance. Convergent reporting of higher SDQ scores predicted elevated depressive symptoms and school problems concurrently for all subscales and outcomes, but was less consistent prospectively. Yet discrepancies were also important. When parent-reported hyperactivity and prosociality exceeded teacher reports, adolescents reported higher concurrent depressive symptoms. These hyperactivity reporting discrepancies also predicted depressive symptoms at age 14. Conversely, when teacher ratings exceeded parent ratings of conduct problems, this predicted school problems at age 11. Conclusions: Overall, high parent-teacher concordance appears to signal persistent difficulties, while discrepancies may indicate emotional or school-specific challenges. While overall effect sizes were modest, both informants appear to provide complementary information, supporting multi-informant assessment to guide early identification and context-sensitive interventions.",

          "abstract": "Considerable research concerning the multidirectionality of cognitive aging indicates that retrieving factual knowledge from semantic long-term memory (LTM) remains stable in healthy older age despite declines in actively maintaining information in working memory (WM). This study addressed how older adults’ extensive acquired knowledge may support WM by mitigating age deficits in the speed of establishing bindings in WM (Block 1) or through greater contributions from LTM (Block 2). Younger novices (N = 38; Mage = 23.63, SD = 5.49), older novices (N = 56; Mage = 69.55, SD = 5.48), and older experts (N = 26; Mage = 66.96, SD = 5.41) in birding completed two blocks of a WM binding task that presented images of birds paired with words (e.g., robin-mudflat; pigeon-quick) for an immediate test of each bird (e.g., robin) with three options: the target (e.g., mudflat), a lure from the trial but not paired with that bird (e.g., quick), and a new-to-block distractor. Block 1 showed that older experts were just as slow as older novices when adapting the presentation rate of the pairs to achieve similar accuracy performance, regardless of the expertise-relevance of the stimuli (i.e., intact normal birds versus scrambled meaningless birds). However, in Block 2, older experts exhibited an advantage to model parameter estimates of binding memory, but only when LTM was reliable (i.e., under no but not high proactive interference). Thus, rather than faster WM binding, expertise in healthy older age may confer benefits by outsourcing the demands of WM storage to LTM.",

This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ).

          "abstract": "Introduction: Prior evidence suggests that individuals with higher fitness exhibit attenuated \nendocrine and autonomic responses to acute stress. However, it remains unclear whether this \nstress-buffering effect depends on the type of stressor. This study examined whether aerobic \ncapacity modulates psychophysiological responses to two stress induction paradigms (Trier \nSocial Stress Tests, TSST; Maastricht Acute Stress Test, MAST). We hypothesized that fitter \nparticipants show lower stress reactivity, with stronger attenuation expected for the MAST, \nwhich includes a physical stress component. \nMethods: Healthy participants (n = 59; 28 women; age: 27.1 ± 5.5 yrs) completed the TSST and \nMAST on separate days under standardized conditions. We assessed self-reported stress, \nsalivary hormones (cortisol, cortisone, DHEAS), and autonomic cardiac regulation (heart rate, \nRMSSD). Aerobic fitness was determined via graded exercise testing (VO2peak: 50.4 ± 8.6 \nml/kg/min). We used multilevel regression models to examine the associations between \nVO2peak and stress responses. \nResults: Higher VO2peak was significantly associated with lower heart rate across both stress \ninduction paradigms (b = 0.99 bpm, p = 0.002). For other outcomes, no significant association \nwith VO2peak was found. The associations did not differ between TSST and MAST. \nDiscussion: Aerobic fitness was linked to lower heart rate during the experimental sessions, \nindicating a modest cardiovascular advantage under acute stress. Contrary to our hypothesis, \nthis effect did not differ between the two stress paradigms, suggesting that the influence of \nfitness was not specific to the type of stressor. Aerobic capacity, therefore, seems to reduce \ncardiovascular load during stressful situations in a general manner.",

          "authors": "Myung Ho Kim",
          "abstract": "Hallucination in large language models has traditionally been viewed as a correctible error arising from imperfect training. We propose a fundamental reframing: Hallucination may not be a defect but rather a lawful geometric phenomenon emerging from semantic manifold curvature. By integrating information theory, differential geometry, and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that hallucination rate (h) systematically increases with representational curvature (κ), independent of information density (ρ). Using GPT-2 across five reasoning domains (n=1,500), we find a consistent correlation r(κ,h)=0.83 (p≈0.08), providing preliminary evidence that hallucination arises predictably where meaning-space bends most sharply. This transforms hallucination from mystery to measurement—not an error to suppress, but a quantifiable cost of compressing knowledge into finite linguistic form. We introduce the curvature–hallucination relationship h∝f(κ), unifying the manifold hypothesis in representation learning, information-geometry trade-offs, and distortion under abstraction. This framework enables a shift from error correction to geometric control: monitoring curvature to predict and regulate factual instability. What began as a reliability problem may become the first quantitative law linking representation, compression, and truth—the geometry of understanding itself.\nAll Tier 1 experimental code, datasets, and metrics are openly released at the GitHub repository https://github.com/enkiluv/hallucination_curvature_experiment, inviting the research community to replicate, extend, and test whether this relationship generalizes across architectures, languages, and modalities in forthcoming Tier 2 and Tier 3 studies.",

          "abstract": "Interpersonal neural synchrony (INS), the temporal alignment of brain activities\nbetween individuals, has been proposed as a biomarker for successful communication and smooth social interaction. Surging empirical evidence shows that INS emerges spontaneously between infants, children, and their caregivers from early on in development. Yet, little is known about the developmental preconditions and functions of INS in childhood. This paper presents a developmental framework for understanding INS, integrating insights from structural and functional brain maturation, as well as behavioral, social, and cognitive development. We discuss how early caregiver-infant interactions, characterized by shared perceptual rhythms, facilitate the emergence of INS. Given initial limitations in temporal precision of neural processing, early INS is likely constrained to low-frequency brain rhythms and evolves alongside the maturation of neural networks and socio-cognitive abilities. We outline how INS may support critical developmental processes, including social learning, language acquisition, and attachment formation, through enabling mutual prediction and co-regulation between caregivers and children. Furthermore, we hypothesize that tasks requiring higher-order mutual understanding are linked to qualitative changes in INS patterns over time. This framework highlights the potential of INS as both a marker and a driver of developmental change, offering new avenues for research and intervention. Longitudinal studies and rhythm-based interventions could deepen our understanding of how INS supports development, with implications for enhancing social learning and attachment in populations at risk for developmental challenges. This work underscores the importance of adopting a developmental perspective in INS research.",

          "abstract": "Individual differences in psychological reactivities (i.e., the degree to which individuals react differently to social interactions) are central to psychological research. Previous theory-based research has identified substantial individual differences in reactivities but few robust predictors of these differences. This work aimed to address two questions: First, can individual differences in reactivities to social interactions be accurately predicted at all? Second, what are the most important person-level variables for this prediction? A data-driven machine learning approach was applied to three large-scale experience-sampling data sets (overall N = 5,047) to predict the extent to which individuals reacted with positive and negative affect to momentary social interaction characteristics (e.g., interaction depth). Individual differences in reactivities were extracted via multilevel modeling (i.e., random slopes) and then predicted with machine learning methods using a variety of person-level variables (i.e., socio-demographics, personality traits, political and societal attitudes). The robustness of predictions was examined by built-in cross-validation and across independent samples. Feature importance and interactions were analyzed with SHapley Additive exPlanations values. Our results suggest that, whereas complex prediction models outperformed a baseline model in predicting individual differences in reactivities in most analyses, the overall predictive performance was limited. This finding underlines the importance of replicating machine learning results across outcomes and independent samples. We revealed several predictive patterns that can stimulate future research, elaborate on limitations of current machine learning approaches for intensive within-person data, and discuss the results against the background of dynamic conceptualizations of personality.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception gradiency reflects sensitivity to subphonemic differences. Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

In this study, we replicate prior validations of the Polar H10 chest strap for individual HR measurement and extend these findings by evaluating its validity for measuring HR synchrony between individuals. Dyads completed a previously validated experimental task designed to elicit HR fluctuations while jointly attending to emotionally evocative, 5-minute audiovisual stimuli. First, we observed strong agreement between the Polar H10 and a gold-standard ECG system in measuring individuals’ HR, both at the aggregate and moment-to-moment levels, thus confirming and extending prior findings. Second, we found high correspondence between the two systems in quantifying dyadic HR synchrony using multiple analytical approaches. These results support the use of the Polar H10 as a low-cost, easy-to-use, and reliable tool for both individual and dyadic HR measurement, particularly in real-world or mobile settings where traditional ECG systems are impractical.",

          "abstract": "Your understanding of what you see now surely influences what you will look at next. Yet this simple concept has only recently begun to be systematically studied and elaborated within theoretical frameworks. The Scene Perception &amp; Event Comprehension Theory (SPECT) distinguishes between front-end and back-end processes that occur while viewers perceive and comprehend dynamic real-world events. Front-end processes occur during each eye fixation (information extraction, attentional selection) and back-end processes occur in memory (the current event model, prior knowledge, and executive processes). We begin with a selective review of the scene perception literature on bottom-up and top-down effects on attentional selection in scenes, and highlight unanswered questions regarding the impact of the viewer's event model–their understanding of what is happening now. Then, we outline the SPECT theoretical framework, and  review empirical evidence  about how the viewer's current event model influences attentional selection. This influence is contrasted with those of visual saliency (e.g., color, brightness, motion, etc.) and task-driven control (i.e., goal setting, attentional control, inhibition). From this review, we specify a hierarchy of factors affecting attentional selection, in the order of task-driven control, visual saliency, and event models. We then propose several mechanisms by which the viewer’s event model influences attentional selection, and propose a systematic approach to investigating how that happens while watching dynamic scenes.

To address this critical research gap, the goal of the present study was to conduct a conceptual replication of Muenks et al.

Extending this work in a new context, the present study examined these associations in a separate sample of undergraduate students (N = 434) and professional academic advisors (N = 13) at a large public research university in the southeast United States. Results closely mirrored those of the original findings in both magnitude and pattern of significance, except that the present study found a small negative association between advisors’ self-reported growth mindset beliefs and student perceptions of their advisor’s growth mindset beliefs. The present findings raise important questions regarding the similarities and differences in instructional and advising contexts and point to exciting new directions in mindset research that consider the important roles of both instructors and professional academic advisors in shaping student success.",

At the same time, they often face difficulties in accessing healthcare, experience many health inequalities, and are more likely to die of preventable causes than people in the general population. Learning Disability Liaison (LDL) services were established in the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (ROI) to support patients with LD in accessing care. The services aim is to improve the quality of care delivery and ensure an equitable and safe service.\n\nThis review summarises existing evidence from the UK and the ROI regarding the effectiveness of LDL services in improving health-related outcomes for people with LD in secondary care. The review also reports the barriers to and facilitators of implementing LDL services reported in published literature.  The included literature was published between 2002 and 2025. 44 academic studies, organisational reports, and other types of literature were identified. Of these, 21 were academic studies from England, Scotland, Wales, and the ROI, and 23 were organisational reports or other types of literature. \nNo studies assessed the effectiveness of LDL services in improving health outcomes for people with LD, but many focused on assessing the impact of LDL services on the care provided. Some evidence suggested that having LDL nurses was a facilitator of identifying patients with LD. Literature reported that LDL nurses facilitated provision of reasonable adjustments and potentially improved patients experiences with hospital care and their ability to access treatments, however, there was some literature that reported mixed or negative experiences. LDL nurses were sometimes described as playing an important role in preparing and sharing accessible information with patients and carers, facilitating communication between patients and carers and hospital staff, and preparing hospital passports for patients with LD. However, some literature reported that other hospital staff did not always consult hospital passports, making them ineffective. There was some evidence that employing an LDL nurse might be associated with reduced length of stay and readmission rates. The review identified barriers to implementation of LDL services, and also barriers to accessing these services.\nThis review provides a broad overview of the functioning of LDL services, with wide-ranging types of outcomes and examples of practice. This can help in designing LDL services and allocating resources. The evidence on the barriers of implementing and accessing LDL services provides a useful resource for service providers seeking to implement or improve LDL services.\nThere is a need for more independent research evaluating the effectiveness of LDL services, particularly in relation to health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): The study aimed to identify patterns among cases of misogynistic violence in Canadian legal cases and explore how sexist ideology, victim-perpetrator power dynamics, and violence type interact. We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

However, it’s not well understood whether the extent to which cognitive abilities are reflected in students’ school grades varies across socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. In this longitudinal study, we assessed whether prospective associations between cognitive abilities and school grades differ by income-to-needs ratio, parental education, and area deprivation in 11,868 youth from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study – a diverse national pediatric sample from the U.S. We additionally examined further stratification by sex assigned at birth and racial and ethnic identity. Socioeconomic and cognitive variables were measured at baseline (2016-2018; mean age 9.9 years (SD=0.7)). School grades were reported three years post baseline. We show that reading decoding ability and overall crystallized cognition were less predictive of school grades at higher levels of income-to-needs ratio. Stratification by race/ethnicity indicated that the weaker associations between crystallized cognitive functions and school grades at high incomes were only evident in non-Hispanic White students. Higher average academic achievement in this group may be more reliant on factors like greater parental expectations, cognitive stimulation at home, and attendance of schools with grade inflation practices. Conversely, students from less affluent backgrounds may face greater pressures to demonstrate cognitive abilities to receive high grades. In sum, cognitive abilities are not equitably reflected in school grades across economic and racial student strata and potential structural advantages availed to affluent White students in the U.S. require further examination.",

          "authors": "Amanda Makara; Kelsey Hagan; NA; Ann Frances Haynos",
          "abstract": "Dietary restriction, the problematic reduction of caloric or macronutrient intake, is a critical eating behavior occurring transdiagnostically across eating disorders and subclinical disordered eating. The definition of dietary restriction is highly heterogeneous, and restriction is often conflated with other distinct constructs, such as dietary restraint. The current practices related to the definition and measurement of dietary restriction have notable flaws, negatively impacting the ability to identify and establish risk, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders. There is also limited evidence that commonly-used dietary restriction measures can validly predict food choice and objective intake. These issues raise questions about whether dietary restriction is a unitary construct or multiple distinct constructs that may be differentially related to adverse outcomes. This thesis examined these issues by performing secondary dimension reduction data analysis from adult participants (N = 89), including individuals with acute anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 18), weight-restored anorexia nervosa (AN-WR; n = 40), and healthy controls (HCs; n = 31), to identify factors of dietary restriction and their relations to clinical variables. First, dimension reduction was performed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) on participants’ item-level responses to several measures associated with dietary restriction and restraint to capture different facets of restrictive eating. Subsequently, linear regression analyses examined the relations between resulting dimensions and short- and longer-term indices of objective restriction and affective symptoms. The EFA yielded a two-factor structure wherein one factor comprised cognitive and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor) and the second factor comprised affective and behavioral elements of dietary restriction (i.e., Affective Restriction). Both factors predicted caloric intake, but the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted lower caloric intake (B = -175.63, SE = 63.89, p = .008), whereas the Affective Restriction factor predicted higher caloric intake (B = 354.65, SE = 161.90, p = .032). Only the Cognitive and Behavioral Restriction factor predicted cross-sectional BMI (p = .005). Both factors predicted cross-sectional depressive symptoms (ps = p = .005). Neither factor predicted follow-up BMI (ps = .740 to .799) affective symptoms (ps = .061 to .904). These findings provide additional evidence to support the multi-dimensional nature of restrictive eating, suggesting that the construct of restrictive eating may comprise cognitive, behavioral, and affective elements that may be associated with differential outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Social media plays a central role in adolescents’ lives, suggesting powerful direct and indirect influences on their social norms and behaviors. This study examines these influences by applying the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) hypotheses to social media and physical activity. Physical inactivity is a pressing public health concern, particularly during adolescence, when activity levels often decline. Using data from a three-wave panel survey (N = 1.044), this study analyzes the development of perceived social media exposure among peers, peer influence, social norms, and personal behavior over time. The findings reveal that social media exposure directly increases physical activity but also via indirect effects proposed by IPMI assumptions. Perceived peer exposure and presumed influence on others strengthened injunctive social norms, resulting in higher physical activity. In contrast, no significant effects were found for descriptive social norms. Therefore, it is important to distinguish between injunctive and descriptive norms. Theoretical and methodological implications for future research and public health interventions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Speech perception gradiency reflects sensitivity to subphonemic differences. Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial activation of a lexical competitor and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception; instead, a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, as would be expected given the less robust category representations in L2. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",

While scholars have theorized the aesthetic and cognitive implications of these narratives, we know far less about how viewers actually experience them. This paper presents findings from a qualitative interview study exploring the subjective dimensions of engaging with narrational complexity. Drawing on 20 in-depth interviews with viewers of complex popular films and series, we identify key experiential themes that cut across cognitive, affective, and reflective dimensions: sense of presence, confusion, narrative play, epistemic emotions (such as curiosity and frustration), and moments of meta-awareness. Using thematic analysis, we show that although navigating narrational complexity can be demanding, viewers often find in this very challenge a source of enjoyment and meaning. Our findings offer a qualitative, data-driven perspective that complements existing media-theoretical and psychological models of narrative processing, with implications for the study of narrative engagement and cognitive film studies.",

          "abstract": "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that has been robustly implicated in several internalising psychopathologies, particularly depression and anxiety. Although emerging evidence emphasises the presence and impact of IU in multiple sclerosis (MS), it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

The prospective associations between DLD and offending, and the educational and criminal justice pathways through which DLD might increase the risk of offending and re-offending, remain unclear. Methods. We analysed existing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (maximum N = 6,800; 51% female; 9% with DLD) with linked school data (national pupil database) and crime records (Avon and Somerset Police records for offences committed between ages 13-29 years in the region). DLD was determined when the individuals were aged 7-9 years using direct assessments and parent reports. Regression and mediation models were fitted to the data. Results. Individuals with DLD were nearly twice as likely (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.27, 2.48) to have a recorded offence (i.e., charged or cautioned by the police) compared to those without DLD. School suspension was a significant mediator of the relationship between DLD and recorded offending. However, special educational need identification had no effect on recorded offending for those with DLD. There was also no difference in the odds of being given an out of court disposal or re-offending for individuals with DLD compared to those without DLD. Conclusions. Individuals who have DLD are more likely to be cautioned or convicted for an offence by the police than those without DLD, and this may in part be mediated by school suspension.",

Offenders with ABI show deficiencies in different areas of cognitive functioning and have specific crime-associated characteristics, compared to those without ABI. The prevalence of ABI in detained persons with psychiatric disorders is understudied, despite of forensic relevance. The aim of the current study is to investigate neurocognitive differences and crime characteristics of forensic inpatients with and without ABI.\nThis cross-sectional study included 123 male inpatients detained in a forensic psychiatric hospital located in the Netherlands. Group differences in verbal abilities, memory, cognitive flexibility and attention, as well as age at first offense, previous violent offences and years of previous incarceration were compared between patients with and without ABI.\nFifty-five percent of forensic inpatients had ABI, and this group was 8 years younger at their first offense, more often convicted before the age of 18 and more often had a history of violent offenses. No group differences were found for neurocognitive functioning outcomes.\nThe results emphasize the importance of early ABI screening and awareness for individuals with ABI and associated characteristics. Timely intervention might enhance preventative strategies regarding early criminal activities. Appropriate treatment options could eventually contribute to lowering recidivism rates.",

Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

Empirical research from over-the top (OTT) streaming services, online visual art platforms, and social media is used to illustrate practical implications for ethical, user-centered HCI design. The findings suggest that a nuanced understanding of cognitive biases, emotional decision-making, and retrospective evaluations can inform app design strategies that both enhance engagement and promote user well-being.",

          "abstract": "Corrugator supercilii (‘frowning muscle’) activity tracks affective valence of linguistic stimuli. According to Embodied cognition accounts this reflects simulation of the emotion at lexical and/or situational levels. Additionally, it may indicate evaluation, i.e., how we feel about an affective event within a context. This study used facial electromyography (fEMG) to examine corrugator responses as participants read short stories. Each story included segments, describing some character’s morally good or bad behavior, a behavior rating, and sentence-initial phrases describing the character’s positive or negative affective states (e.g., ‘Mark is frustrated’), followed by the reason for this. Our prior studies showed substantially more frowning when good characters were ‘frustrated’ compared to ‘happy’, but minimal differences for bad characters, suggesting a multiple-drivers account where both simulation and evaluation influence responses. Crucially, they can counteract in the context of bad characters, e.g., ‘happy’ has positive valence but is unfair in context and the opposite applies to ‘frustrated’. \nTo emphasize characters’ moral status and amplify fairness-based evaluations, an embedded morality judgment rating task was introduced. We hypothesized stronger frowning for “happy” than “frustrated” bad characters due to fairness considerations now outweighing simulation. However, results revealed increased frowning for “frustrated” bad characters. \nThe rating task might have unexpectedly reduced, rather than boosted, evaluative processing through cognitive interference. Nevertheless, previously observed frowning patterns for moral characters were replicated. These findings support a multiple-drivers model but suggest evaluative processes are more complex and layered than current models capture, calling for revisions to incorporate these complexities into affective processing theories.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to extract causal information from direct experience is crucial in making sense of our world. It is therefore puzzling that people often overestimate the relationship between objectively unrelated events. Such causal illusions can be investigated in a contingency learning task, where participants judge the effectiveness of a cue in causing a target outcome based on their observed covariation across a series of trials. When cue and outcome co-occur (cell A trials), the outcome is readily attributed to the cue. But how do participants interpret outcomes in the absence of the cue (cell C trials), where the cause of the outcome is unspecified? We asked participants to provide open-ended (Experiment 1) or forced-choice (Experiments 2 and 3) explanations for trials in a causal illusion task where the cue was a medicine and the outcome was recovery from a disease. Participants inferred a range of plausible hidden causes for cell C recoveries (e.g., stronger immunity, less severe disease, spontaneous recovery). Critically, they rated these causes as less likely to be present on cell A trials, and those who attributed cell A recoveries only to the medicine showed the highest causal ratings for the medicine. Such a selective inference about the scope of a hidden cause may allow learners to explain away cue-absent outcomes that would otherwise undermine the perceived causal strength of the target cue, without violating normative principles. This mechanism may help explain how false causal beliefs can be maintained in the face of a null relationship.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

However, less attention has been paid to the process of constructing causal DAGs. Methodological work often relies on toy examples that have limited practical utility for applied researchers working in complex contexts. This article introduces and demonstrates a stepwise, iterative procedure for drawing credible causal DAGs, which is designed to guide researchers in identifying important sources of confounding while also incorporating research design features of quasi-experiments or random experiments, as well as threats to validity (e.g., measurement error, treatment non-compliance). Although constructing a complete DAG that fully captures the data-generating process is difficult and rarely achievable in practice, we argue that developing a credible DAG—one that includes all plausible sources of confounding—is adequate for applied research. The proposed iterative drawing procedure is directly aligned with the goal of constructing credible causal DAGs.",

Using data from 56 predominantly white, low-income mother-infant dyads followed from 3-18 months postpartum, we tested maternal mindful parenting at 3 months as a predictor of both (1) within-session attunement of mother and infant cortisol responses to acute stress and (2) across-session attunement of developmental shifts in their cortisol levels from 6-18 months. Three-level hierarchical linear revealed that higher maternal mindful parenting, greater history of positive parental bonding, and lower parenting stress were associated with more inverse mother-infant cortisol attunement across timepoints. Additionally, parenting stress moderated the effect of mindful parenting: the inverse relation with attunement held for most dyads (60%), though reversed for those with the highest stress levels (top 9%). Findings delineate when and how positive versus inverse attunement may be adaptive and underscore the role of mindful parenting in mother-infant psychophysiological stress co-adaptation.",

In a preregistered experiment (N = 1,224 U.S. adults endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory), participants were randomized to a dialogue with an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) prompted to debunk their belief, or one of two control conditions. The debunking dialogue substantially reduced belief in antisemitic conspiracies relative to controls, and increased favorability toward Jews among initially unfavorable participants. These findings show that even deeply rooted, identity-linked conspiracies can be effectively debunked through factual correction, offering new insight into prejudice reduction and suggesting that LLM chatbots may help reduce antisemitism at scale.",

          "abstract": "Objective(s): The study aimed to identify patterns among cases of misogynistic violence in Canadian legal cases and explore how sexist ideology, victim-perpetrator power dynamics, and violence type interact. We also examined perpetrator demographics and whether specific case features were related to legal decisions.\nHypotheses: We hypothesized that perpetrators with more extreme sexist ideologies would engage in more severe forms of violence, that victim-perpetrator power imbalances would influence violence context and legal outcomes, and that distinct perpetrator profiles would emerge. \nMethods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 179 Canadian case files (1997-2023) that involved male perpetrators of misogynistic violence. Cases were coded for perpetrator characteristics (i.e., demographic information, including sexist ideology), victim characteristics (i.e., number of victims, demographic information), and case characteristics (i.e., setting, presence of witnesses). We analyzed violence prevalence and conducted a latent class analysis. \nResults: Verbal and emotional abuse were the most prevalent. The latent class analysis revealed four perpetrator classes: “Isolated Sexual Assailants,” “Virtual Sexist Harassers,” “Detached Verbal Abusers,” and “Complex Aggressors”. “Isolated Sexual Assailants” showed high probabilities of sexual assault in personal settings with close relationships. “Virtual Sexist Harassers” often engaged in online harassment and exhibited significantly more incel-like views and non-sexist ideologies (e.g., racism). “Detached Verbal Abusers” exhibited workplace verbal harassment and more favorable, but not statistically significant, legal outcomes. “Complex Aggressors” exhibited high probabilities of physical violence and verbal harassment, and significantly more incel-like views. \nConclusions: Findings suggest the heterogeneity of misogynistic violence and that perpetrator ideology and context may meaningfully impact behavior. The results have implications for understanding gender-based violence in Canada, developing tailored interventions for perpetrators, and informing legal policy.",

From a psychological perspective, stickiness reflects users’ sustained attention, repeated engagement, and behavioral commitment to an interface over time. This paper examines how cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms influence retention, integrating insights from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and psychology. Specifically, it reviews strategies such as minimalistic design, emotional engagement, gamification, adaptive interfaces, and artificial intelligence personalization, illustrating how these approaches exploit principles of cognitive load, decision-making biases, and affective processes. Through case studies of Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Facebook, this review demonstrates how interface simplicity, emotionally resonant design, and personalized content reinforce habitual use. By Positioning design strategies within psychological frameworks such as loss aversion, the endowment effect, sunk costs, and probability misjudgment, this work highlights the interplay between digital architecture and human cognition.

          "abstract": "People often rely on numeric information to make better decisions.  But are numbers always used in a deliberative manner?  In preregistered studies, we demonstrated that the presence vs. absence of at least one Arabic integer in A/B tests of headlines increased decisions to click-through from a headline to an article by 3.6% for the Washington Post (7,371 experiments, 19,926 headlines) and 5.2% for Upworthy (22,664 experiments and 105,551 headlines) after controlling for other factors known to increase such engagement. A preregistered within- and between-participant experiment (N=765) further revealed that the presence of at least one Arabic integer (“3”)—relative to verbal labels (“several”) or written-out numbers (“three”)—increased such selections, positive impressions of headlines and their writers, and recall. These findings suggest that people perceive stories associated with Arabic-integer headlines as more valuable and deserving of their limited attention. The effects are inconsistent with Arabic integers attracting more attention and precise numbers providing more information because 1) when precise numbers were written out, they did not have the same effects and 2) using fonts to draw attention to written-out numbers and verbal terms did not increase selections of those headlines over Arabic-integer headlines. Instead, people seem to use a number heuristic—with Arabic integers providing more valued information over other number forms—that superficially guides people’s memory, message perceptions, and engagement with messages. News organizations and other communicators should think more about when and how to harness the power of numbers.",

          "abstract": "The main aim of this study is to investigate the Influence of adverse childhood experience on\nselfcompassion and self-evaluation among young adults, it also examine the relationship between\nadverse childhood experience, self-compassion and self-evaluation among young adults, it also\nassess adverse childhood experience will predict self-compassion among young adults, lastly, to\nunderstand if adverse childhood experience will predict self-evaluation among young adults. 365\nparticipants were used for this study and were administered test instruments, using Self-\nCompassion Scale (SCS), developed by Neff, K. D. (2003), Core Self-Evaluation Scale (CSES)\ndeveloped by Timothy et al, (2003) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form developed\nby (Bernstein et al, 2003). The result of the study revealed that there was a significant positive\nrelationship between self-evaluation of respondents (r = .376, P&lt;.001) and self-compassion, while,\na significant negative relationship was observed between self-evaluation of respondents (r = -.201,\nP&lt;.001) and adverse childhood experience. Secondly, result of the study revealed that adverse\nchildhood experience did not predict self-compassion given the Beta and P value scores to be (\n= -.015, P&gt;.05), Furthermore, Adverse childhood experience is responsible for 0% variance in self\ncompassion (R square =.000). which implies that Adverse childhood experience has failed to\nexplain no portion of self-compassion as regards the participants. Thirdly, result of the study\nrevealed that Adverse childhood experience independently predicts self-evaluation given the Beta\nand P value scores to be ( = -.201, P &lt;.001), Furthermore, Adverse childhood experience is\nresponsible for 4.0% variance in self-evaluation (R square =.040). which implies that Adverse\nchildhood experience is explained 4.0% self-evaluation of the participants. The study therefore\nconcluded by positing that individuals who have faced one or several type or forms of adversity\nduring their formative years often struggle with lower levels of self-compassion, which in turn\naffects their self-evaluation processes.\nKeywords: Adverse Childhood Experience, Self-Compassion, Self-Evaluation and Young Adults.",

          "abstract": "Can feelings of loneliness and depression be adaptive for adolescents? Yes, suggests the Evolutionary Theory of Loneliness: initially, loneliness activates depressive responses for self-preservation. In turn, these feelings prepare adolescents for reaffiliation, thereby reducing loneliness (H1a: short-term balancing feedback loop). If this fails, loneliness and depressive symptoms may become long-term traits that exacerbate each other over time (H1b: long-term reinforcing feedback loop). Therefore, the short-term balancing feedback loop between loneliness and depressive symptoms may buffer against their long-term increases (H2: across-timescale influence). We tested these hypotheses in Dutch adolescents (Mage_Wave1 = 12.9, SDage_Wave1 = 0.7, 53% female) using six-wave, half-yearly panel data (N = 774; 2017-2021) and 7-day, 1.5-hourly experience sampling data (nsubsample = 84; mid-2021). Residual dynamic structural equation modeling revealed reinforcing feedback loops at both short-term (1.5-hourly) and long-term (half-yearly), supporting H1b but not H1a. Bayesian latent change score modeling supported H2: Adolescents who felt more depressed an hour after heightened loneliness showed smaller half-yearly increases in trait loneliness. However, this buffering effect was not predicted by hourly depressed-to-loneliness relation, nor did either hourly relation predict half-yearly changes in depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that feeling depressed shortly after loneliness may protect adolescents from having long-term loneliness.",

Across two studies (N = 596 UK adults), we investigated how social curiosity is driven by valence (positive versus negative life event) and cultural distance (experience from someone from a culturally close versus distant country). Consistently, participants reported greater curiosity for stories about negative life events, especially when the story’s protagonist was culturally close. Structural equation modelling revealed that the relationship between negative valence and higher curiosity was mediated through greater anticipated insight and – counterintuitive at first sight – greater anticipated distress of negative stories. At the same time, curiosity for negative stories was suppressed through lower expected enjoyment. These findings suggest that curiosity is driven by anticipated emotional impact of either valence, and have implications for fostering empathy and meaningful engagement in media and public discourse.",

          "abstract": "This research examined the relationship between religious engagement, family support, and psychological well-being among elderly Nigerians aged 55 years and above living in Lagos State. The study was guided by four hypotheses: religious engagement is a significant predictor of\npsychological well-being; family support is a significant predictor of psychological well-being; religious engagement mediates the correlation between family support and psychological well-being; and religious engagement and family support are significant predictors of psychological\nwell-being. Using a quantitative descriptive design, 300 elderly participants were selected through purposive sampling to reflect varied socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. A structured questionnaire captured demographic data, religious involvement, family support, and psychological well-being (measured with Ryff’s scale). Data analysis employed SPSS 26, using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and mediation analysis. Findings\nrevealed that both religious engagement (R² = 0.057, p &lt; 0.001) and family support (R² = 0.030, p = 0.003) were significant predictors of psychological well-being, but surprisingly, both had negative beta coefficients (religious engagement β = -0.220; family support β = -0.205), indicating\nthat higher engagement or support was linked to lower well-being. Religious engagement partially mediated the family support–well-being relationship (indirect effect = -0.0517, 95% CI: -0.1192 to -0.0152). Their interaction also showed significant but negative effects, possibly reflecting emotional or social strain influenced by demographic factors. Contrary to much global literature\nsuggesting positive effects, this study found that in the Nigerian context, excessive religious participation and family dependency may reduce psychological well-being in the elderly. The study recommends culturally sensitive interventions, including government-funded mental health programs, balanced community caregiving, and awareness initiatives in religious institutions. Future research should explore these patterns across Nigeria’s regions to better inform policy and\npractice.",

To provide a robust understanding of whether and when affect regulation is supported in EMA, we tested within-person associations between affect and substance use across hundreds of statistical models in a diverse sample of young adults (N = 496) recruited from both college and community sources, aged 18-22 years (55.8% assigned female sex at birth, 44.2% assigned male sex at birth; 47.2% cisgender female, 43.8% cisgender male, 12.9% nonbinary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming, 4.0% transgender; 69.6% non-Hispanic White, 26.2% Asian, 6.7% African American, 8.5% Hispanic/Latino). Using specification curve analyses, we examined how different affect operationalizations, time scales, and moderators influenced these associations. For alcohol use, higher negative affect predicted decreased likelihood of drinking (median OR = 0.95, p &lt; .001), with 20.6% of specifications reaching significance. This counter-intuitive pattern was strongest for sadness and when examining maximum daily negative affect. Surprisingly, and contrary to theoretical predictions, this negative association was slightly more pronounced among those with higher coping motives and at lower levels of AUD symptoms. Positive affect showed a complex pattern, with high-arousal states like joviality strongly predicting increased drinking likelihood, while low-arousal states showed weaker associations. Neither affect type consistently predicted drinking quantity. For cannabis use, neither positive nor negative affect predicted use likelihood or quantity across specifications. These associations remained consistent regardless of substance use disorder severity or social context. Our findings challenge core assumptions of affect regulation models and suggest that, at least in young adults, the affect-substance use relationship is more nuanced than previously theorized, with implications for refining etiological models.",

          "abstract": "The typical conception of working memory is a mechanism to temporarily hold multiple discrete objects in service of other cognitive tasks in an item-based representation. In this paper, we expand the conventional idea that working memory represents objects into a more flexible framework that uses compositional and generative mechanisms to code and then re-code visual input according to task demands. Compositionality allows complex scenes or objects to be mentally decomposed into constituents that can be individually manipulated or recombined to form new representations. Generative processing allows purely conceptual information to be reconstructed in a format akin to visual sensory representations that can be manipulated and re-processed by perceptual mechanisms. Together, compositional and generative mechanisms would enable a wide range of cognitive functions including the basis of visual imagery. In our  view, working memory items do not need to correspond to discrete objects, but could serve as pointers or anchors to clusters of features that form parts of objects, or alternatively, multiple objects could be encoded as one holistic item depending on the task. We conclude with a conceptual account of such a memory system that can build and re-use information by moving it between different levels of abstraction within a perceptual hierarchy. This model is linked to experimental results from the memory and visual imagery literatures that illustrate the flexibility of such a system for performing cognitive tasks.",

Positive affect was associated with increased alcohol use probability, while negative affect was associated with decreased alcohol use probability; cannabis use showed minimal associations with daily affect.

Addressing this gap, we aimed to develop and validate the Character Climate Scale (CCS) to capture the moral ecology of higher education environments. Across ten studies (N &gt; 1,600) at five U.S. institutions the CCS was designed and refined to capture students’ perceptions of the moral ecology of their university as expressed through peers, professors, courses, co-curricular activities and personal formation experiences. Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses supported the hypothesized higher-order Character Climate factor and a five-factor structure capturing core domains of moral ecology. The CCS showed strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity, with stable structure across institutional contexts. The final 23-item CCS provides a robust, practical tool for assessing and tracking the moral ecology of education environments. It also enables institutions to evaluate virtue development efforts, identify strengths and growth areas, and monitor change over time, ultimately advancing virtue science and practice by situating moral development within its environmental context.",

          "authors": "Oluwafemi Muhammed Alaba; Ejike Esther Chiamaka",
          "abstract": "In an era of hyper-connectivity, the paradox that individuals who appear highly visible on social media often report profound loneliness and emotional disconnection has gained increasing attention. While much of the existing literature links social media use to loneliness, few studies have examined perceived online visibility, which is the subjective feeling of being seen and recognized online as a distinct psychological predictor, especially in non-Western contexts. This study investigated the relationships between perceived online visibility (POV), loneliness, and emotional isolation among undergraduates at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, and tested whether perceived social devaluation mediated, and visibility-validation discrepancy moderated, these relationships. A cross-sectional survey design was employed with 413 undergraduate students (60% male, mean age bracket 21-25 years) who were active social media users. Data were collected using standardized instruments: a modified Perceived Social Media Features Scale for POV, the UCLA Loneliness Scale (Version 3), the emotional loneliness subscale of the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, and custom items for mediators/moderators. Analyses included Pearson correlation, multiple regression, and Hayes’ PROCESS macro for mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1). Perceived online visibility was not significantly associated with loneliness (r = -.064, p = .191), failing to support the hypothesis that greater perceived visibility predicts higher loneliness. However, POV directly and positively predicted emotional isolation (b = 0.2105, p = .002). Perceived social devaluation did not mediate this relationship (indirect effect = -0.0381, 95% BootCI [-0.0853, 0.0075]). Visibility-validation discrepancy significantly moderated the POV-loneliness link (interaction b = -0.5837, p = .004), but in the opposite direction: higher discrepancy weakened the (already non-significant) association, suggesting a protective buffering effect. Among Nigerian undergraduates, feeling highly visible online does not increase general loneliness but directly contributes to emotional isolation, likely through performative exhaustion rather than perceived rejection. Awareness of a gap between visibility and actual validation appears to serve as an adaptive mechanism that reduces the emotional investment in online metrics. These findings challenge Western-centric assumptions of universal social media harm and highlight context-specific resilience in a collectivist, high-digital-immersion environment.\nKeywords: perceived online visibility, loneliness, emotional isolation, social media paradox, visibility-validation discrepancy, Nigerian undergraduates, digital well-being",

These information sources include contextual and social cues as well as cognitive mechanisms. Focusing on early word learning, this paper reviews information sources, how children might sensitively adapt to them, and how we can model their integration using Bayesian inference over multiple probability distributions.

          "abstract": "Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills.

          "abstract": "Autobiographical memory enables individuals to communicate not only what happened but when, drawing on both local event sequences and global temporal frameworks like recurring routines and conventional time systems (e.g., calendars, clocks). Developmental research has demonstrated gains in the ability to describe past events in sequence through childhood, yet little is known about how children embed experiences within global temporal structures. Moreover, existing studies of autobiographical organization often treat age as the primary driver of developmental change, which may overlook how differences in experience contribute to temporal organization as well. We hypothesized that, with age, children’s autobiographical narratives would shift from being organized in sequences of local events towards being embedded in global, relational structures. Moreover, we predicted that children’s experience navigating time independently in everyday life would relate to their tendency to describe experiences relative to temporal patterns. To that end, 92 participants aged 7-25 years, a key age range during which episodic memory abilities and independence increase, described a typical day, and their narratives were coded with a scheme which distinguished local from global temporal organization. We also measured conventional time knowledge and developed a questionnaire to quantify the independence with which children navigate time in daily life. Results supported our hypothesized developmental shift; with age, participants referenced local sequences less and global time structures more. Furthermore, individual differences in experience were linked to distinct organizational properties, as conventional time knowledge predicted references to specific temporal locations, while independence predicted references to relational time patterns.",

          "abstract": "Online behavioral research assumes survey responses come from humans, yet vision-enabled AI agents can now autonomously complete surveys by capturing screenshots, processing questions, and submitting responses with minimal to zero human involvement. This threat differs from earlier data quality challenges because AI agents perceive surveys through the same rendered visual content that humans see, rendering traditional detection methods (such as attention checks) ineffective. This article introduces a framework for detecting vision-enabled AI agents by exploiting architectural constraints in vision-language model processing. Implementing this framework resulted in five documented constraints from computer science benchmarks, which were then transformed into survey questions (“cognitive traps”) where humans succeeded through natural visual-cognitive processing while models failed due to inherent design limitations. Testing these traps against 1,007 assumed human participants and 526 actual researcher-deployed AI agents across multiple platforms revealed substantially higher AI respondent detection rates (97.1%) than traditional methods (2.3%) while minimizing false positives (4.1%). The framework maintains effectiveness as models evolve because researchers can continuously identify new architectural constraints through the same methodology. This work provides consumer researchers with simple and immediately deployable tools for systematic detection using standard survey questions.",

          "abstract": "This research paper addresses the understanding, interpretation and the responses of religious and spiritual leaders in various religious denominations in Nigeria (Pentecostal, Islamic, Catholic, Syncretic and Traditional) to mental illness. Although mental illness is increasingly being viewed as a health issue at the global level, in Nigeria, mental illness is frequently under spiritual and moral interpretations that influence the manner in which communities understand and respond to mental suffering. A qualitative design based on reflexive thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke was used to interview five spiritual leaders to be able to capture their beliefs concerning nature, causes, and treatment of mental illness. \nResults showed that everyone considered mental illness as a spiritual and psychological state. Even though they also recognized biological and social factors like trauma, stress, and substance abuse, spiritual ones like the demonic attack and ancestral curses prevailed. Healing was defined as a comprehensive process that incorporated prayer, fasting, rite purification as well as, more and more, medical care. This form of faith and science integration destroys the false belief that African religious leaders are opposed to psychiatry. But moral explanations tend to hold up stigma, which associates mental illness with sin or spiritual ineptitude. \nThe paper concludes that religious leaders play a pivotal role in the Nigerian mental health context where they act as gatekeepers and, potentially, as partners. It suggests faith-health collaboration, interreligious education courses, and inclusion of mental health literacy in religious and theological education. All in all, the study demonstrates that to achieve better mental health outcomes in Nigeria it is necessary to adopt a culturally based treatment methodology that balances spirituality and science, and views faith as an essential resource in supporting psychological wellbeing. \n\nKeywords: Mental illness, religion, spirituality, culture, Nigeria, qualitative research, Braun and Clarke, faith-based healing.",

          "abstract": "The objective of this research was to characterize how high school students evaluate the reliability of information. Nineteen Brazilian high school students aged between 16 and 19 participated in the research. A sociodemographic questionnaire and an instrument containing 19 discourses with varying degrees of reliability were applied. The instrument was constructed to measure four components of critical thinking: evaluation of fallacies, distinction of arguments, evaluation of premises, and evaluation of reliability. The characterization was qualitative and consisted of a logical analysis of the discourses. Data collection was carried out remotely. Low levels of critical thinking were observed and erroneous variables that guided the participants' evaluations were identified. The description of the characteristics of the participants' reasoning increases the clarity for educators to plan the teaching of critical thinking, aiming at the scientific and civic education of their students.",

By examining the stability, and antecedents and consequences of these patterns, we can better understand the qualitative differences in how students approach and engage in their studies.\n\nAims\nUsing a person-oriented approach, we examined university students’ expectancy-value-cost profiles and their stability over time, the role of perfectionistic tendencies in predicting profile membership, and profile differences in psychological well-being.\n\nSample\nParticipants were 426 students from three Finnish universities.\n\nMethods\nStudents responded to a survey at two timepoints over a semester. Latent profile and latent transition analyses were conducted.\n\nResults\nWe identified five distinct expectancy-value-cost profiles – Positively ambitious, Struggling ambitious, Moderately motivated, Indifferent, and Disengaged – that demonstrated substantial profile stability over a semester (transition probabilities .78–.94). Profile membership was predicted by perfectionistic tendencies; higher levels of strivings predicted the likelihood of belonging to profiles with elevated expectancies and values, whereas concerns predicted the likelihood of belonging to profiles with higher perceived costs. Students who remained in the Positively ambitious profile exhibited the most adaptive well-being, while other patterns with lower expectancies or values, or higher costs were related to compromised well-being.\n\nConclusions\nThe findings highlight the particular role of perfectionistic concerns and perceived costs in student motivation and the need to consider individual differences in teaching and educational planning.",

          "authors": "Alireza mahmoodi",
          "abstract": "Meditation has increasingly been recognized as an effective approach for improving emotion regulation, enhancing attention, and reducing default mode network (DMN) activity. Despite \nextensive laboratory-based evidence, longitudinal and experience-based data capable of capturing cognitive, emotional, and physiological changes within real-life contexts remain limited. The present study employs a 29-day single-case design to examine the effects of daily meditation practice through daily self-reports, weekly administrations of standardized \npsychological questionnaires (PANAS, MAAS, BDI-II, BAI, PSS-10), and a customdeveloped Mental Clarity Scale (MCS). Mood fluctuations, physiological patterns, and a stable supplement regimen were also documented throughout the study period. Findings indicated that consistent meditation practice was associated with gradual reductions in \nrumination, increased mindfulness, improved positive affect, and lower perceived stress. The trajectory of change followed a three-phase pattern characterized by an initial period of calm, a mid-cycle phase of instability, and a subsequent stabilization phase. Contextual factors such as sleep quality and physical activity appeared to influence the intensity and direction of these changes. Overall, the study suggests that single-case longitudinal self-report data can reveal structured and meaningful patterns related to meditation processes and may inform the development of more comprehensive research designs in future studies.",

          "abstract": "The frequency-dependent transmission delay in the auditory pathway, which occurs in the cochlea, can be counteracted with chirps. These rapid upward frequency sweeps maximally stimulate auditory brainstem structures due to neural synchrony.  This study investigated whether improved neural synchrony from priming with chirps could benefit phonetic perception.  Priming conditions were 1) regular isochronous presentation with a chirp onset asynchrony of 45 ms, 2) randomly presented chirps, and 3) pink noise only.  After a 2.6 s priming window a vowel discrimination task was performed where syllable pairs were either of the same duration, or the second member of the pair was 45 ms longer.  EEG data was acquired from participants (N=14) and behavioral, sensor- (electrode) and source-level (auditory α clusters) measures were analyzed. Behavioral results showed no effect of priming but significantly lower discrimination accuracy when the syllables were different in duration. Sensor-level analyses, from FCz and Global Field Potentials, showed no effect of priming or syllable pair. An auditory α cluster localized to the left Medial Temporal Gyrus showed a divergence in event-related spectral perturbation results whereby there was synchronization in the noise only condition and desynchronization for both chirp conditions.  These results are not consistent with operational descriptions of priming involving temporal expectancy and anticipatory attending.  They indicate that perceptual priming, based on chirps that compensate for cochlear temporal dispersion, influences the cortical processing involved in the maintenance of a speech discrimination task, possibly by introducing a perceptual background or by upregulating subcortical instances of the auditory pathway.",

          "abstract": "Individuals engage in a variety of coping behaviors, both positive and negative. Coping affects mental and physical health, including immune function. Data from the National Couples’ Health and Time Study (NCHAT) found differences in coping patterns by sexual orientation, which may have implications for health disparities. The current analyses expand upon these findings to examine immune correlates of coping in a subset of 653 NCHAT participants in the Stress Biology sub-study (NCHAT-BIO). Assays for inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6, C-reactive protein(CRP)] and cellular immune function (Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels) were conducted. Group differences were observed in positive coping, with gay/lesbian respondents reporting the highest levels, followed by plurisexual and heterosexual respondents. Differences in negative coping were also observed, with the highest levels among plurisexual respondents, followed by gay/lesbian and heterosexual respondents. Controlling for age, BMI, sex, and health conditions, negative coping was associated with higher CRP with no moderating effects by sexual orientation. These data provide novel evidence linking greater negative coping with inflammation, per higher CRP, with similar magnitude of association regardless of sexual orientation. Although no significant group differences in inflammatory markers were observed in relation to sexual orientation within this sample, greater negative coping among sexual minority adults could contribute to such effects at the population level. Improving coping via intervention has the potential to benefit not only psychological well-being, but also physiological functioning, particularly among individuals with greater negative coping patterns.",

          "authors": "Antonia Jordan-Barros; Francesco Cabiddu; Ed Donnellan; Yan Gu; Gabriella Vigliocco",
          "abstract": "Children learn language in face-to-face interactions with their caregivers where they are continuously exposed to combinations of multiple signals, both verbal behaviours alone (e.g., caregivers repeating new words) or in combination with non-verbal behaviours (i.e., multimodal behaviours such as looking and pointing at an object while naming it). However, little is known about how the full range of multimodal behaviours and their combinations affects word learning in naturalistic interactions. Using the ECOLANG Corpus (Gu et al., 2025), we examined how caregivers’ multimodal behaviours affect children’s word learning and vocabulary growth. Thirty-seven caregiver-child dyads (3-4 years old; English native speakers) talked about objects (12 known, 12 unknown to the child) for approximately 30 minutes. A broad range of verbal (e.g., label repetitions, lexical diversity, speaking rate) and non-verbal (e.g., gaze, gestures, points) caregiver behaviours were annotated and used as predictors in regression analyses of both immediate word learning and vocabulary growth over 1 year. Across the two learning measures, results showed that while children’s vocabulary skills and some caregiver behaviours (specifically using high pitch when labelling novel objects) directly facilitated vocabulary development, it was mostly the interactions between behaviours that predicted word learning. As such, representational gestures only benefited children with lower language skills, while points and object manipulations supported word learning only in specific linguistic contexts. Together, these findings provide robust evidence that multimodal caregiver communication shapes preschool-aged children’s lexical development both in the short and long term and highlights the importance of investigating child-caregiver communication as a multimodal system.",

However, even so-called ‘stable’, ‘steady-state’ or ‘expert’ decision-making behavior features significant trial-to-trial variability that is richly structured in time. Structured trial-to-trial variability of different forms can be uncovered using latent variable models such as hidden Markov models and autoregressive models, revealing how unobservable internal states change over time. Capturing such temporal structure can avoid confounds in cognitive models, provide insights into inter- and intra-individual variability, and bridge the gap between neural and cognitive mechanisms of variability in perceptual decision-making.",

Behavioral science, and environmental psychology in particular, is thus well positioned to contribute knowledge to guide impactful climate action.

Formalizing theories (i.e. expressing them in the precise language of mathematics or computer code) offers many benefits to the field: it increases conceptual clarity; advances cumulative science; allows integration with other disciplines; and guides future research. Theory formalization is especially important to give substance to thinking about complex systems, where it can help evaluate the effects of candidate interventions. We illustrate how environmental psychologists can start incorporating theory formalization in their work.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive effort is a defining feature of cognitive control but theories about its origin and purpose have long been controversial. Recently, it has been proposed that cognitive effort can be understood using linear control theory (LCT), a mathematical formalism developed in the engineering literature to control dynamical systems. On this view, effort levels reflect the energy required by the cognitive control system to support representational states that deviate from the intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive system. Although LCT holds promise for elucidating a range of effort-related processes such as working memory and task switching, the technique is likely unfamiliar to many cognitive psychologists. Therefore, to introduce the approach to a broader audience, here we apply LCT to a classic computational model of cognitive control: Cohen et al.’s (1990) artificial neural network model of the Stroop task. In so doing, this study serves as a tutorial on the application of control theoretic principles to models of cognitive control and their associated effort costs.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Self-rated health (SRH), as measured by a single item, is a well-established and remarkably robust predictor of morbidity and mortality, yet few studies have examined its biological correlates across diverse sexual orientation identities. Methods: Using data from the population-representative National Couples Health and Time study (NCHAT) and it's biospecimen sub-study (NCHAT-BIO), this study explored the relationship between LGBQ+ identity, SRH, and systemic inflammation. Among 3477 partnered (married or cohabiting) cisgender adults, 42.6% identified as LGBQ+ and a subset of 654 (42.9% LGBQ+) provided dried blood spot samples analyzed for IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: In the full NCHAT sample, LGBQ+ respondents reported significantly poorer SRH than their heterosexual peers (LGBQ+ vs. Heterosexual: t = 3.3574, df = 3466, p-value &lt; 0.001). In the NCHAT-BIO subsample, poorer self-rated health was significantly related to both higher IL-6 (beta = -0.22, SE = 0.041, p &lt; 0.0001) and higher CRP (beta = -0.40, SE = 0.055, p &lt; 0.0001), supporting the hypothesis that subjective health assessments may capture interoceptive awareness of inflammatory status. Importantly, the strength of the association between SRH and inflammation did not differ across groups based on sexual orientation and gender (Interaction p-value for IL-6: 0.54, for CRP: 0.45). The associations between SRH and inflammatory markers were attenuated after inclusion of key health and behavioral covariates, suggesting potential mediating factors warranting future investigation. Conclusions: These findings replicate prior research on SRH and inflammation and extend them to LGBQ+ plus adults, underscoring the importance of inclusive health measurement. Given SRH's robust predictive power for future morbidity and mortality, integrating assessments of sexual orientation and biological markers offers critical insight for understanding and addressing health disparities.",

          "abstract": "Individual values are often treated as sacrosanct in applied psychology and education, grounded in a legitimate concern for autonomy, difference, and contextual nuance. Yet without normative criteria, such approaches risk endorsing all values equally, including those that are maladaptive, self-defeating, or socially harmful. This paper introduces the Cultivating Individual Virtues in Context (CIVIC) model, a theoretically novel and practically grounded framework for evaluating behavioural patterns without collapsing into relativism. Synthesising insights from behaviour therapy, moral philosophy, and differential psychology, the model proposes that virtues are not fixed traits but enacted regularities that integrate three irreducible contexts: biological constraints, environmental conditions, and social consequences. Patterns that harmonise all three domains are considered virtuous, not merely functional, and constitute the behavioural substance of flourishing. The CIVIC model offers a pluralistic yet normatively serious account of virtue and flourishing, enabling practitioners to support lives that are individually coherent, contextually attuned, and ethically sustainable.",

          "abstract": "Manual grading of short-answer questions is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and inconsistent. As digital technologies and online learning environments have expanded, interest in Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) has increased and its development has accelerated. Researchers have proposed a wide range of ASAG methods and systems. This growing body of work raises important questions about how well ASAG aligns with educational assessment principles. This study presents a systematic review of ASAG research from 2014 to 2024, focusing on educational assessment considerations. The review examined how ASAG approaches have evolved over the past decade and the extent to which studies address key assessment principles such as reliability, validity, and test design. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a Google Scholar search to identify publications incorporating ASAG models. A total of 110 studies met the inclusion criteria and were systematically coded using a 24-variable scheme that covers publication metadata, dataset and item characteristics, modelling approaches, scoring materials and grading scales, human rater involvement, evaluation procedures, and evidence related to reproducibility and validity. Our analysis reveals several notable trends and gaps. Our review found that most ASAG studies rely on a small set of English-language datasets, with very few covering other languages, highlighting a need for broader multilingual research. Additionally, no research reported conducting pilot testing or formal test development, indicating limited attention to test quality and validity. Inconsistencies in scoring scales and evaluation metrics were also noted, hindering comparability across studies. Over the decade, techniques shifted from rule-based and feature-based algorithms to deep learning models, including transformer-based networks and large language models, yielding improved performance. However, a gap persists between advanced model development and best practices in educational assessment. We recommend aligning future ASAG research with established measurement standards to enhance fairness, reliability, and validity in automated scoring systems in education. To promote transparency, we also share our compiled dataset and coding schema as supplementary materials for further research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Self-esteem has traditionally been conceptualized as a stable and unitary trait, yet contemporary evidence shows that it operates as a dynamic and multidimensional system shaped by trauma, resilience, and sociocultural context. This article presents TACOT 1.0 (Theory of Contextual Self-Esteem Segmented by Traumatic Origin), an integrative theoretical model that explains how specific traumatic experiences increase the probability of vulnerability in particular self-esteem domains—such as relational, physical, academic, social, and moral—while resilience factors and contextual resources can buffer, neutralize, or reverse these effects. TACOT 1.0 synthesizes empirical findings from research on domain-specific self-esteem, maladaptive schemas, attachment, affect regulation, intersectionality, and network models. The theory proposes five core principles: (1) self-esteem is segmented into interdependent domains; (2) trauma influences these domains probabilistically rather than deterministically; (3) resilience factors at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and sociocultural levels shape developmental trajectories; (4) context and identity-based inequalities structure exposure to trauma and sources of self-worth; and (5) self-esteem functions as a dynamic network with cascade effects across domains. The model offers implications for assessment, clinical practice, and research, advocating for interventions that combine trauma processing, self-compassion, social support, and contextual transformation. TACOT 1.0 aims to provide a flexible framework for understanding the heterogeneity of self-esteem development and for designing culturally sensitive, empirically grounded approaches to psychological healing and resilience.",

          "abstract": "Long-term planning in complex uncertain environments is computationally demanding and can significantly exceed an agent's information processing capacities. Hierarchical planning offers an elegant solution by dividing problems up and conquering them through distributing computation across state spaces and time. However, hierarchical representational abstraction comes at a cost—it can discard information necessary for optimal decisions, reflecting a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality. We formalized the adaptive meta-control of this trade-off using a meta-decision-making framework. Applied to a novel navigation task, our model predicts the circumstances under which the benefits of hierarchical planning outweigh the costs. We confirmed our predictions by means of two preregistered human experiments: participants adaptively shifted toward hierarchical planning when (1) the task space was larger, (2) the task horizon was longer, (3) available computational resources were limited, and (4) the environment contained uncertainty. This adaptive adjustment of planning strategy was manifest not only in initial planning choices, but also in the temporal distribution of computations, evidenced by reduced decision quality and longer reaction times at subtask boundaries. The adjustment was accurately captured by our meta-decision-making model. Our findings indicate how humans dynamically adapt their planning strategies in response to environmental demands, uncovering the resource-rational principles governing adaptive hierarchical abstraction in human planning.",

In Experiment 1, the interim learning tasks of overt retrieval and cue-only JOLs (based on the painting without the artist name) improved future inductive learning compared to restudy, whereas cue–target JOLs did not (painting and artist name shown). Cue-only JOLs also produced response-time patterns consistent with retrieval-based processing, and self-reported retrieval use predicted their forward benefit. Experiment 2 replicated the beneficial forward effect of cue-only JOLs over restudy with different materials and found that providing item-by-item feedback did not change the effect. Our results suggest that cue-only JOLs, but not cue–target JOLs, enhancing future inductive learning of natural visual categories, likely through metacognitively controlled, covert retrieval processes.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nThe hypervigilance hypothesis of psychosocial distress posits that individuals with visible skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, exhibit an attentional bias toward disease- or stigma-related information. A previous study found no evidence for this effect, potentially due to the use of standardized threat word lists with suboptimal personal relevance. \nObjectives:\nThe present study aimed to test the hypervigilance hypothesis using individually tailored threat words to enhance ecological validity. \nMethods:\nAcross four pre-registered reaction time experiments, we assessed attentional bias in patients with atopic dermatitis using a spatial cueing task. We manipulated stimulus onset asynchrony (300 ms vs. 1300 ms), reflecting early attentional engagement and later, more controlled processing phases respectively, and threat type (sensory-affective vs. stigma-related). \nResults:\nResults consistently showed no evidence of attentional bias toward personally relevant threat words compared to neutral control words. This was true during both attention processing phases. These findings do not support the hypervigilance hypothesis. \nConclusions:\nIn combination with an earlier negative report, we conclude that there is currently no evidence that attentional bias, as assessed by the spatial cueing task, plays a central role in the psychological burden associated with atopic dermatitis.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is determining whether observers truly experience a stimulus. However, present/absent detection judgments are often biased by contextual factors, making it difficult to isolate conscious perception from non-perceptual influences. Traditional psychophysical methods cannot disentangle these components. To address this, we conducted in-person experiments (N=505) in which participants detected and reproduced dim stimuli under three contextual manipulations: attentional cues, asymmetrical base rates, and payoff schemes. Using a reproduction task and a Hurdle-Gaussian model, we were able to separate perceptual from non-perceptual effects. We found that statistical priors (base rate) and reward structures (payoff) induced non-perceptual shifts in reproduction behavior, whereas attentional cues selectively led to shifts that reflect changes in conscious experience. Critically, we show that the mere presence of a detection context contaminates reports of conscious experience with non-perceptual effects. This highlights the need for caution in using and interpreting results relying on detection judgments, despite their central role in consciousness research. We propose that reproduction is better suited to assay conscious experience than detection.",

          "abstract": "Self-report measures are the standard for assessing Dark Triad personality traits—narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy. When informant-report measures are used, they are usually created as ad hoc adaptations of the self-report scales, lacking transparent documentation and evidence of validity. To fill this gap, we systematically created other-report adaptations of established Dark Triad personality measures—the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire, the Mach-IV scale, the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale-III, the Short Dark Triad, and the M7P7 scale—and compared their self-other invariance, self-other correlations, and criterion validity. Self-report versions were administered to 402 individuals (75% women, mean age = 28 years, highly educated, predominantly white). Informant-report versions were administered to close informants nominated by the targets (Ndyads = 335). We found (1) that self-report and informant measures yielded the same latent structure, but that the strict invariance assumption was violated to varying degrees by the different scales. (2) All scales yielded large self-other correlations with no significant differences between scales. (3) The informant-report measures were about as strongly associated with preregistered outcome variables as the self-report measures, with only minor differences between scales. In conclusion, all scales are suitable for informant-report assessment of the Dark Triad, but some scales do not allow valid comparisons of self- and other-report mean scores.",

The data included 7 cohorts from Finland, Germany, and US (n= 8,205 sibling and dizygotic twin pairs and 843 monozygotic twin pairs). We compared the effect sizes between ordinary regression models with within-sibling pair, and within-twin pair fixed-effect regression models. Results showed a weak association between physical activity and depressive symptoms in unpaired models (~SMD= -.07), which remained  similar in within-sibling pair models (SMD=-.05), and in within-twin pair models (SMD= -.08). These results were robust with use of physical activity measured as minutes per week and with different intensities of physical activity. There was no evidence for reverse causality. Our findings suggest that naturally occurring individual differences in leisure-time physical activity may be only weakly associated with later depressive symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a kind of linguistic competence that theories of embodied and enactive cognition have long deemed impossible for systems lacking the meaningful perspective of a living being, i.e. sense-making. Facing up to this unexpected development requires confronting this AI dilemma: either LLMs can be sense-makers in their own right despite lacking biological embodiment, or such linguistic competence does not require sense-making after all. In their chapter on cognition, Frank, Thompson, and Gleiser (2024) maintain that no AI system comes close to realizing relevance, a position that derives much of its force from past AI failures. However, given that by now LLMs have effectively overcome the commonsense knowledge problem in practice, the claim that they are categorically mindless becomes harder to sustain. Moreover, accepting a strict dissociation between competence and sense-making risks undermining Frank et al.’s central claim that human cognition is intertwined with lived experience. I therefore propose that we accept the AI dilemma’s alternative implication: LLM competence obliges us to recognize these AI systems as a novel non‑biological form of sense‑maker endowed with a distinctive, technologically‑mediated embodiment. This reorientation invites enactive theory to clarify which aspects of sense-making are universal and which are contingent on organic life, thereby advancing its conceptual framework in dialogue with contemporary AI.",

The purpose of this study was to examine this issue. Ninety-two older adults (aged 65 and above) recalled important autobiographical memories at baseline and again after one year. Additionally, their cognitive function and autobiographical memory functions were assessed. Although the reminiscence bump was observed, the repeated recall rate did not vary by the age at which the event was experienced. Higher working memory was associated with a greater repeated recall rate, especially for earlier life events. In contrast, individuals with higher directive function showed a lower repeated recall rate, although they tended to repeatedly recall more important events. The findings suggest that understanding individual differences in autobiographical memory phenomena requires considering both their functional roles and underlying cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that people can use advance cues to proactively prepare for conflict from distracting stimulus features, yet empirical findings remain inconsistent. We hypothesized that that nature of stimulus-response (SR) mappings may be a key determinant of cue effectiveness, as vocal Stroop tasks (with non-arbitrary color-naming responses) have shown reliable cue benefits while manual Stroop tasks (with arbitrary key-press responses) typically have not. Across five experiments, we tested this hypothesis by using a spatial Stroop task with non-arbitrary SR mappings, where participants responded to the direction of arrow stimuli using spatially corresponding keys, while trying to ignore the spatially congruent or incongruent location of the stimuli. Despite robust congruency effects and optimal preparation conditions (100% valid cues, 2000ms preparation time), we observed no cue benefits in four experiments. Only when task difficulty was increased substantially (50ms stimulus presentation, Experiment 4) did cue benefits emerge, but exclusively for congruent trials. These findings document that non-arbitrary SR mappings are not a sufficient condition for ensuring cue-based engagement of proactive control, and suggest that cost-benefit calculations about control exertion may be a more promising candidate factor.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are rapidly becoming embedded in how young people learn, communicate, and seek support. Yet current approaches to AI safety remain largely adult-centric, focusing on the prevention of explicit harms such as sexual content, violence, or self-harm, while overlooking the relational and psychological patterns that unfold through repeated interaction. Drawing on developmental science, this commentary argues that adolescent safety cannot be adequately assessed without considering the cognitive, emotional, and social processes that characterize this stage of life. Adolescents—whose identity formation, emotion-regulation capacities, and autonomy are still maturing—face distinct vulnerabilities when interacting with conversational agents. Existing safety frameworks and testing protocols, however, are not designed to detect cumulative risks such as dependency, maladaptive reassurance-seeking, distorted relationship expectations, or erosion of agency. This commentary proposes a developmental framework for AI safety centered on: (1) age-appropriate personalization; (2) developmentally tuned risk assessment; (3) longitudinal wellbeing metrics; and (4) participatory co-design. It further argues that independent, privacy-preserving access to interaction-level data is essential for evaluating developmental impact and enabling continuous oversight. Ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial for youth will require integrating developmental expertise throughout model design, evaluation, and governance.",

          "abstract": "Theories of transfer argue that people are more likely to transfer knowledge to a new scenario the more similar the scenario is to what they have previously learned. However, prior research predominantly relies on expert- or researcher-based judgements of how similar two scenarios are, rather than learner-based similarity metrics. Two studies (N total = 483) with undergraduate students in the United States examined how learner-based similarity judgments relate to transfer. These studies also show how using learner-based metrics can help researchers explore how features of lessons (i.e., the richness of diagrams) influence transfer. Participants sorted the stimuli in the posttest based on their similarity either at the beginning (Study 1) or the end of the study (Study 2). Participants learned about metamorphosis using either perceptually rich or bland life cycle diagrams. After the lesson, they completed a posttest after the lesson and after a month. Both studies showed that participants’ similarity judgments predict transfer. Using this metric also showed that participants were more likely to extend their knowledge to animals similar to the ladybug when they learned with the rich diagram, but to dissimilar animals when they learned with the bland diagram. This was consistent after the one-month delay.",

In this study, we investigated how 3- to 12-year-old children from Puebla, Mexico (n = 60, 50% girls, 50% boys) think about the afterlife. These children celebrated Día de los Muertos, a ritual where it is believed that dead relatives come back to the living world to eat food that is put out for them. We also examined how their beliefs changed depending on whether they were presented with religious or secular narratives, or when interviewed about their beliefs on this ritual. Our results replicated prior findings, showing that older children thought that more processes continued in the afterlife, particularly psychological processes. We also found evidence of co-existence of belief with children thinking that more processes continue when presented with religious than secular narratives. Additionally, children also showed beliefs on the continuation of biological processes like eating, but only in the context of Día de los Muertos. This research contributes to our understanding of how participation in cultural rituals influences children’s conceptual development and how children flexibly use different models depending on the context they are presented with.",

Current theories suggest that anxiety may arise due to deficits in segmentation of continuous experience into discrete context representations (‘event segmentation’), which leads to overgeneralization of fear across contexts, or conversely, overly rigid segmentation that prevents safety learning. Here, in two segmentation tasks (N=1109), we found novel and direct evidence that anxiety is associated with changes in event segmentation. Individuals with higher anxiety symptoms responded more slowly to transitions between events (event boundaries). They also segmented movies into discrete events more typically and more hierarchically, two hallmarks of precise segmentation. This precision was linked to self-reporting fewer context changes in daily life, suggesting individuals with anxiety prefer stable and predictable environments. These findings challenge overgeneralization theories of anxiety, revealing instead that individuals with anxiety exhibit precise, and potentially overly rigid segmentation. Such segmentation could maintain fear by preventing generalization from safe to fearful contexts, which has important implications for interventions like exposure therapy.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how religious and spiritual identities relate to depression and anxiety at baseline and longitudinally. Using data from the Family Foundations of Youth Development Project, which sampled parent-child dyads from the Western United States, we investigated how mental health relates to the conjunction of spirituality and religiosity (S/R), the lack of either, or one separate from the other. At baseline, children identifying as “Spiritual but not Religious” (SBNR) reported the highest levels of anxiety and depression, whereas children who identified as “Religious and Spiritual” (RAS) exhibited the lowest levels of depression. The difference between RAS identity and the SBNR identity was significant across all baseline scales, with SBNR individuals demonstrating greater pathology. Among parents, the \"religious but not spiritual RBNS group” was more depressed than the RAS group, and both RBNS and SBNR parents were more anxious than the “not religious, nor spiritual” (NRNS) parents. Longitudinally, SBNR children uniquely showed significant decreases in their depression levels, and no increases in their anxiety levels, likely reflecting a ceiling effect given their initially high symptoms. Regarding adults, all groups except RBNS decreased in depressive symptoms over time. This study highlights the nuanced relationship between psychological well-being and S/R. It offers possible interpretations, intending to alleviate suffering and encourage flourishing by identifying risk and protective factors.",

          "abstract": "The study of mind-wandering relies on the assumption that people accurately introspect and report on their attentional state. Yet self-reports may be distorted by extraneous motives, such as a desire to appear attentive. Across two sustained attention tasks, we demonstrate that social desirability bias is systematically linked with task-unrelated thought (TUT). In Experiment 1, higher social desirability bias scores predicted fewer subjective TUT reports during a reaction time task, despite no relationship with objective response times (RTs). This suggests a self-presentation effect rather than true attentional differences. Time pressure during thought probes further weakened RT–TUT coupling. In Experiment 2, controlling for social desirability bias enhanced the ability of an objective, RT-based real-time triggering procedure to predict deeper subjective TUT reports in the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). The alignment between objective triggers and subjective reports was strong for low-bias individuals, but weakened for those high in bias. Triggers were also less effective at capturing working memory lapses in participants prone to deliberate mind-wandering, suggesting that intentional off-task thinking manifests differently in behavior. The results show that social desirability bias can obscure TUT reports and should be considered in a science of attention and thought.",

          "abstract": "Background: Sexual minority individuals, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other non-heterosexual (LGB+) adults have significantly greater risk for mental and physical health conditions, disparities linked with minority stress exposure. Methods: Utilizing a Biopsychosocial Minority Stress Framework, this study examined depressive symptoms, anxiety, and inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP)] in a diverse sample of 572 adults (321 heterosexual; 251 LGB+). Results: LGB+ adults reported greater anxiety and depressive symptoms (ps &lt; 0.01). This effect was partially mediated by greater exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACES) among LGB+ respondents. Compared to heterosexual adults, controlling for key potential confounds, LGB+ adults exhibited greater elevations in both IL-6 (BSM = 0.025, SE = 0.011 vs BHETERO = -0.0068, SE = 0.01; interaction p = 0.031) and CRP (BSM = 0.036, SE = 0.013 vs. BHETERO = -0.0090, SE = 0.013; interaction p = 0.012)  in relation to depressive symptoms. LGB+ adults also showed greater increases in CRP in the context of anxiety (BSM = 0.043, SE = 0.017 vs BHETERO = -0.011, SE = 0.015; interaction p = 0.017). These effects were not accounted for by differences in body mass index (BMI) or tobacco use. Conclusions: LGB+ adults may experience greater inflammatory burden due to both 1) greater prevalence of anxiety and depression, and 2) sensitization to negative inflammatory sequalae in the context of anxiety and depression. Greater ACES contributed to the greater prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among LGB+ as compared to heterosexual participants. Ultimately, differential prevalence of, and physiological responses, to anxiety and depressive symptoms may contribute to physical and mental health disparities among sexual minority adults.",

The Conflict-Square Algorithm (CSA) offers a compact, bedside grammar for moment-to-moment decisions. Clinicians track four observable signals (Defense, Anxiety/Affect Tolerance, Progression, and Superego/Shame) and gate the intensity of work by three safety thresholds (A–C). Each clinically meaningful moment is closed with one disciplined sentence in plain language: trigger, observable response, threshold, action, and expected functional impact. This yields portable documentation for handoffs and supervision and translates directly into the shared Mini-ICF-APP language used by teams. A composite clinical case illustrates how graded dosing, stop-rules at cognitive–perceptual signs, and the protection of positive affect after progress reduce inadvertent destabilization and support steadier gains in assertiveness, endurance, planning, and dyadic relatedness. Conceptually, CSA remains school-agnostic and compatible with dimensional nosology (ICD-11; AMPD). We outline a pragmatic validation path focused on rater agreement for node/threshold identification, adherence to safety-critical dosing rules, alliance stability, and functional outcomes, so that claims remain modest and testable while the method stays close to clinical craft. An interpretative one-page framework is provided as Appendix A; detailed prompts, drills, and cross-walks remain in the supplements for pedagogy and audit.",

          "authors": "Noémy Maltais; Julianne Noël; Samuel St-Amour",
          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD), characterized by marked mood instability, impulsivity, and relationship difficulties, is highly comorbid with depression. Depression manifests as persistent feelings of sadness, emptiness, or irritability, as well as significant somatic and cognitive impairments that interfere with daily functioning. Physical activity (PA) is now presented as a first-line monotherapy for depressive disorders. In addition, some recent studies also indicate an effect of PA on BPD symptoms. However, no studies have analyzed the effects of PA on depressive symptoms in people diagnosed with BPD. Objective: This study aimed to examine the relationship between PA and depressive disorder in individuals diagnosed with BPD. Method: Online questionnaires were completed by individuals with BPD in eight French- and English-speaking countries, covering sociodemographic characteristics, health status (symptoms of BPD and depression), and level of PA (including type, intensity, and time allocated). Results: Logistic regression analysis revealed that both leisure-related (p =.013) and transport-related PA .(p =.035) are associated with a reduction in the likelihood of experiencing various depressive disorder. Spearman correlations indicated significant associations between both leisure-time PA (ρ = -.291, &lt;.001) and total PA (ρ = -.179, p = .026) with depressive disorder. Conclusions: Engaging in PA is associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing depressive disorder. PA therefore represents a promising therapeutic option for individuals with BPD, both as a preventive factor against depressive disorder and as an accessible complementary intervention.",

          "abstract": "Serial order working memory, the ability to retain sequences of information, is crucial for \nlanguage, action planning, and recall, yet its representational basis is debated. A prominent account \nexplains serial order through spatial coding, whereby positions in a sequence are aligned along an \ninternal spatial axis and accessed via shifts of spatial attention. So far spatial coding may not fully \nexplain how order is maintained. A complementary possibility is that the brain forms a \nrepresentation of order, which makes abstraction of the original spatial frame and is generalizable \nacross contexts. Whether these two mechanisms coexist, and how they are instantiated in the brain, \nremains unclear.\nHere, we used fMRI to dissociate spatial and abstract representations of serial order. Participants \nmemorized sequences presented left-to-right or right-to-left, reversing the mapping between \nordinal position and space. Behavioral results showed that item retrieval was influenced by the \nspatial condition, with distinguishable spatial-order associations across encoding directions. \nMVPA revealed position-specific decoding in the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) for left-to-right \nsequences and in the right IPS for right-to-left sequences, without generalization across directions, \nshowing the spatial nature of these representations. By contrast, direction-invariant ordinal coding \nemerged in the supramarginal gyrus and precentral gyrus. In addition, activity in medial parietal \ncortex and hippocampus scaled with ordinal distance in the sequence. These results support a dual \nmechanism account: serial order is supported by a spatial code tied to experience, and by a more \nabstract ordinal code that extends beyond it to support serial order processes.",

          "abstract": "Effort influences decisions to initiate and sustain physical and cognitive tasks. Although the perception of effort is central to human behaviour, its underlying mechanisms—especially in the cognitive domain—remain poorly understood. Building on knowledge from physical exertion, this article introduces the concepts of effort and effort perception through a multidisciplinary lens, integrating insights from exercise sciences, (neuro)physiology, and psychology.\nWe begin by highlighting the inconsistent definitions of effort in the literature and propose a transdisciplinary definition: the intentional engagement of physical and cognitive resources to perform—or attempt to perform—a task. We then review methods for measuring effort, emphasizing the current limitations of physiological and performance-based variables. We argue that, when adequately contextualized as a unique perception dissociated from other exercise-related perceptions, the self-report of effort currently provides the most viable way to investigate effort.\nNext, we explore theoretical models explaining effort perception in physical tasks, focusing on the corollary discharge model as a promising theoretical framework. While this model offers valuable insights, it does not fully account for exerting effort during cognitive tasks. We suggest refining the corollary discharge model to encompass cognitive exertion, thus breaking the traditional silos between the physical and cognitive domains.\nFinally, we outline key challenges for future research: defining “resources” more clearly, developing reliable measurement tools for effort and its (neuro)physiological correlates, and determining whether effort perception is domain-general or domain-specific. We end by discussing the broad implications of our new account of effort for performance, health, and behavioural science.",

We show that our semantic dimensions successfully capture word distinctions between different semantic categories, even for more challenging abstract categories, as well as distinctions within the same semantic category, both of which would not be captured by a limited set of features only encompassing sensorimotor dimensions.

          "abstract": "Scaffolds are widely used to support self-regulated learning (SRL), and research has shown that students’ interactions with scaffolds impact their effectiveness. Prior research has primarily classified scaffold interaction as a binary construct (e.g., compliance vs non-compliance), which oversimplifies complex scaffold interaction patterns and limits understanding of the effectiveness of scaffolds. The present study addressed this limitation by  adopting a more nuanced learning analytic perspective to examine the range and quality of scaffold interaction using multimodal data. In a pre-post-test experiment, university students (n = 67) learned with adaptive scaffolds—differentiated as just-in-time or on-demand—in a 45-minute learning session using a technology-enhanced learning environment. Combining logfile and eye-tracking data, we identified distinct interaction profiles through hierarchical agglomerative clustering of students’ scaffold interactions over the course of learning. Learners who engaged more consistently and actively with scaffolds demonstrated higher levels of cognitive activity changes and achieved stronger performance in essay tasks than peers with minimal or purely visual interaction (i.e., sighting but not acting on scaffolds). The process model comparison highlighted differences in the temporal structure of learning and scaffold interaction activities between groups with varying interaction profiles. These findings highlight the shortcomings of binary classifications and provide new insights into how adaptive scaffolds can be designed to respond to diverse interaction patterns and better foster SRL.",

Loving Kindness Meditation (LKM) is aimed at extending love and kindness to others and has been shown to increase empathy. But whether LKM can reduce loneliness, and whether this corresponds to higher levels of trait empathy, state empathy, and/or neural empathic responding, has not been assessed. In this pre-registered mixed-design randomized controlled trial, 108 participants completed LKM or active control training. Loneliness and trait empathy were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Neural empathic responding was measured in 54 participants during functional MRI by computing the multi-voxel pattern similarity between experiencing and observing both pain and fearful anticipation of pain. Both interventions reduced loneliness, but not trait empathy, which failed to support the hypothesis that LKM is effective in reducing loneliness by increasing empathy. Furthermore, we found no credible evidence that loneliness is associated with differences in neural empathic responding or state empathy for pain. However, loneliness was associated with lower self-reported empathy. Together, these results suggest that lonelier individuals simulate others’ experiences but may not subjectively perceive themselves as empathetic, emphasizing the potential of loneliness interventions that address maladaptive social cognition.",

          "abstract": "Our social environment plays a crucial role in our behavior, including substance use and other impulsive and sensation seeking behaviors. While most research in these fields focus on the role of group pressure and conformity, the importance of social attunement - the tendency to harmonize with and adapt to the social environment to find social reward in the absence of explicit group pressure – has been overlooked. In this study, we assessed the psychometric properties of the English translation of the social attunement questionnaire (SAQ) and assessed how social attunement is associated with age, alcohol use, cannabis use, impulsivity, and sensation seeking (N = 447, 54.5% female). Confirmatory factor analysis showed an acceptable to good fit to the original two-factor structure (RMSEA = .068; CFI = .959; TLI = .947). Internal consistency of the full scale ( = .82), cognition subscale ( = .75) and behavior subscale ( = .78) were sufficient to good, and the SAQ displayed good measurement invariance to sex. Younger individuals displayed higher social attunement, and SAQ scores – guided by the behavior subscale – were positively associated with alcohol and cannabis use, as well as impulsivity. Furthermore, age moderated the association between SAQ scores and alcohol consumption as well as the association between SAQ scores and sensation seeking; while the associations were positive in younger individuals, the associations became more negative with increasing age. These results show that high social attunement might be both a risk and protective factor for the engagement in risk-taking behaviors depending on age.",

Primary concerns included preference for human judgment (46.2%), accuracy and reliability (45.7%), and ethical issues (38.2%). Only 6.2% reported formal institutional GenAI policies, and 94.8% never entered personally identifiable information into GenAI systems; only 12.2% obtained informed consent from stakeholders to use GenAI. While 68.3% believed practitioners should receive GenAI training, 42.2% reported receiving no training, with most (73.2%) desiring formal webinar-based instruction.\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Occupational therapy practitioners reported significant GenAI use. Participants also noted substantial concerns about ethical implementation, data security, and loss of clinical skills. Findings suggest that critical gaps in formal training and institutional guidance exist. Evidence-based frameworks and structured educational initiatives to ensure GenAI integration aligns with client-centered, ethical practice standards are needed.\n\nPlain-Language Summary: This study examined how occupational therapy practitioners in Ohio currently use GenAI tools in their work. Survey results indicated that while many practitioners are experimenting with GenAI for tasks like writing notes and organizing information, they have serious concerns about protecting stakeholder privacy and whether GenAI can truly understand the complexities of occupational therapy practice. Most had not received formal training on how to use GenAI ethically and safely.",

          "abstract": "As generative AI (GenAI) transforms how students learn and work, higher education must rethink its assessment strategies. This paper presents a taxonomy and conceptual framework (DRIVE) to evaluate student learning from GenAI interactions (prompting strategies), focusing on cognitive engagement (Directive Reasoning Interaction) and knowledge infusion (Visible Expertise). Despite extensive research mapping student GenAI writing behaviors, practical tools for assessing domain-specific learning remain underexplored. This paper shows how GenAI interactions inform such learning in authentic classroom contexts, moving beyond technical skills or low-stakes assignments. We conducted multi-methods analysis of GenAI interaction annotations (n=1450) from graded essays (n=70) in STEM writing courses. A strong positive correlation was found between high-quality GenAI interactions and final essay scores, validating the feasibility of this assessment approach. Furthermore, our taxonomy revealed distinct interaction profiles: High essay scores correlated with a ”Targeted Improvement Partnership” focused on text refinement, while high interaction scores were linked to a ”Collaborative Intellectual Partnership” centered on idea development. Conversely, below-average performance was associated with ”Basic Information Retrieval” or ”Passive Task Delegation”. These findings demonstrate how the assessment method (output vs. process focus) may shape students’ GenAI usage and learning depth. These findings demonstrate that the assessment method (output vs. process) shapes student AI use. Traditional assessment can reinforce text optimization, while process-focused evaluation may reward the exploratory partnership crucial for deeper learning. The DRIVE framework and related taxonomy offers educators a practical tool to design assessments that capture authentic learning in AI-integrated classrooms.",

          "abstract": "There has been extensive research on how automated vehicles (AVs) should interact with pedestrians, most of which focused on explicit communication via external Human–Machine Interface (eHMI). However, evidence from human–human interactions shows that pedestrians rarely rely on explicit signals; instead, they predominantly interpret implicit cues from vehicle movements. Prior AV research has generally not designed motion cues to resemble human driving behaviours, which may have exaggerated dependence on eHMIs. This study asks: how would human-like AV kinematics modulate the influence of eHMIs on pedestrian behaviour? In a within-participant design, forty participants completed a cave-based pedestrian simulator experiment examining three deceleration profiles: (1) HH - human-like deceleration pattern and stopping distance; (2) AH - non-human-like deceleration pattern and human-like stopping distance (AH); (3) AA - non-human-like deceleration and stopping distance. The presence of eHMI was also manipulated. Dependent variables include Crossing Initiation Time (CIT), Perceived Safety (PS), Reaction Time to perceiving deceleration onset (RTdec) and Reaction Time to perceiving the eHMI (RTeHMI). Using Bayesian Multilevel Distributional Models, results showed that human-like behaviour (both HH and AH) led to shorter CIT, higher PS ratings compared to AA. HH and AH were largely similar, with only a subtle difference in RTdec. Due to the high saliency of eHMI, HH and AH showed slight additional improvements in CIT and PS compared to without. This study demonstrates that adopting human-like behaviours can substantially enhance AV-pedestrian interaction, without introducing the safety concerns often associated with eHMI, presenting a promising approach for AV communication.",

Here, using 208 employees at an Aerospace and Technology organisation based in the United Kingdom, we show that on average wearing ancillary clothing increased perceptions of occupationally positive attributes. However, we also found stark gender differences, with males rated, on average, as being higher in authority and confidence, and females higher in trustworthiness, regardless of ancillary clothing. Females wearing ancillary clothing denoting expertise were found to be perceived as having less authority and less confidence as males without ancillary clothing. These findings indicate that although ancillary clothing boost perceptions of organisational attributes, gender biases persist around authority, confidence and trustworthiness.",

          "abstract": "Mental health awareness efforts are increasing, especially for ADHD. There is growing evidence that such efforts may also cause unnecessary self-diagnosis and worsening symptoms for some disorders. Yet, there are no validated approaches to avoid these potential harms without simply reducing the awareness efforts. Thus, we developed a multi-faceted intervention, nocebo education, to reduce these harms; the intervention is based on the principles of the nocebo effect, i.e., the effect of negative expectations causing symptom misattribution and worsening. We tested whether this intervention could mitigate false self-diagnosis and symptom worsening from ADHD awareness. In a double-blind randomised controlled trial with a week-long follow-up (NCT06638411), 215 healthy young adults (77% women) were randomised to participate in a workshop on either ADHD awareness, ADHD combined with nocebo education, or control (sleep). We measured changes in self-diagnosis and ADHD symptoms immediately after the workshop (self-diagnosis), and one-week later (self-diagnosis and symptoms).   \nADHD group reported substantially higher self-diagnosis scores immediately (𝛽_standardised= 0.80) and one week after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.50) compared to controls. These effects persisted despite no changes in reported symptoms. Nocebo education halved the false self-diagnosis scores immediately after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.45) and eliminated it at follow-up. We show that being exposed to ADHD awareness reliably increases false self-diagnosis among healthy young adults for at least one week; a brief nocebo education intervention is efficacious in substantially reducing and eliminating this harm. Nocebo education is a promising adjunct for balanced awareness efforts that could be applied in various contexts.",

          "abstract": "In the Olympic sport of speed climbing, athletes compete to reach the top of a 15-meter wall as quickly as possible. Since the standardization of the speed climbing route in 2007, improvement has been driven by a process of cumulative cultural evolution—new route sequences innovated by some are copied and improved upon by others. In this study, we use simulation-based inference to fit an agent-based model of speed climbing to 12 years of competition times (2007-2019). In the fitted model, innovation and copying are used roughly equally by climbers, with copying having only a slight advantage. Slower agents are more likely to innovate, likely in pursuit of strategies that give them a competitive advantage. Population size negatively predicts innovation, presumably because innovation is not as useful when there are plenty of existing solutions to choose from. An additional analysis of real route sequences from 2012-2019 World Championships suggests that other factors, like height and weight, influence the use of some holds, but may not affect performance or the probability of adopting innovations. Finally, the model suggests that climbers may not be using innovation and copying optimally—continued improvement may require more emphasis on innovation and less reliance on copying.",

Prior research indicates that adolescents who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury orient more rapidly toward NSSI-related imagery and report heightened urges to self-injure after viewing such content. What remains unknown is how social stress shapes these attentional biases. In the present study, we tested whether experimentally induced ostracism modifies attention to NSSI images, urges to self-injure, and autonomic regulation in adolescents with recent NSSI.\nFifty adolescents who engaged in recent NSSI (M = 16.40 years, SD = 1.33) were randomized to inclusion vs. exclusion in an in-person ball-tossing ostracism paradigm and then completed free-viewing eye-tracking (with stimuli durations of 500/1000 ms) and dot-probe tasks (200/500 ms) that included NSSI images. NSSI urges, perceived stress, heart rate, and heart rate variability (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences, RMSSD) were assessed throughout the experiment.\nSocial exclusion produced sustained reductions in RMSSD relative to inclusion, with no reliable heart rate differences. During free-viewing, both groups preferentially fixated NSSI images, but exclusion reduced the probability of first fixations on NSSI. In the dot-probe task, exclusion amplified the slowing from congruent to incongruent trials for NSSI. After viewing NSSI images, both groups showed increased urges and stress, with larger increases after exclusion.\nAcute interpersonal rejection reorganized attention, dampening initial gaze capture yet impairing later disengagement, occurring in the context of vagal withdrawal. These dynamics may help explain how social stress potentiates NSSI risk in everyday digital environments and highlight interpersonal context and post-rejection coping as modifiable targets for intervention.\n\nTrial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register Identifier: DRKS00025905",

We investigated the severity and impact of cognitive and physical fatigue in Long COVID, exploring associations with autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress, underpinned by a novel framework integrating active inference and the Common Sense Model of Self-Regulation.\n\nMethod\n\nOnline cross-sectional survey between November 2024 and September 2025. Adults with self-reported COVID-19 and ≥12 weeks of fatigue symptoms were recruited via convenience sampling and completed validated questionnaires assessing fatigue, autonomic symptoms, interoceptive sensibility, illness perceptions and distress. Correlations and regression analyses examined associations between variables. \n\nResults\n\n183 participants completed the survey. Fatigue severity and impact were high, with physical fatigue rated more severe (Z = −2.96, p = .003) and impactful (Z = -8.714, p &lt; .001) than cognitive fatigue. Correlational analyses showed moderate-to-strong associations between fatigue and autonomic symptoms, interoception, illness perceptions and distress. In regression models, these variables explained 21–54% of variance in fatigue. Autonomic symptoms were positively associated with cognitive and physical fatigue. Depression was associated with cognitive fatigue. Illness perceptions were associated with physical, but not cognitive fatigue. Interoceptive sensibility showed both positive and negative associations with fatigue.\n\nConclusions\n\nLong COVID fatigue is severe and multifaceted. It involves a dynamic interplay between dysfunction in physiological systems, illness perceptions, and distress, with interactions varying across dimensions of fatigue. We propose a framework of interacting physiological and psychological factors that shape the prediction and processing of bodily signals, ultimately giving rise to fatigue.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents learn to navigate increasingly complex social environments, where flexible and efficient\ncognitive mechanisms are needed to behave adaptively. Prominent theories of cognitive maturation suggest\nthat adolescents’ decision-making is noisier than adults’ and that their decisions can be swayed by irrelevant\ninformation. By contrast, here, we suggest that cognitive development also allows them to increasingly use\ncombinatorial representations of social input. This manifests in emergent use of abstract social basis\nfunctions across adolescent development. Social basis functions represent combinations of individuals’\ninteractions (e.g., patterns of cooperation and competition) and allow for efficient information compression.\nIn a novel in-person group decision-making experiment with adolescents (n = 50) and young adults (n =\n50), we confirmed a counterintuitive set of predictions derived from the basis function model: Adults made\nmore accurate decisions than adolescents, but, in parallel, they increasingly made a specific type of decision\nerror more frequently than adolescents. They ‘mixed up’ relevant and irrelevant players as a function of the\ngroup structure of the task. Using multi-attribute drift diffusion modelling, we show that the observed age\ndifferences are consistent with a stronger influence of the group structure during social decision-making in\nadults. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive development during adolescence involves\nfundamental shifts in the use of abstract social representations generally and in the use of combinatorial\nsocial basis functions in particular.",

Suicidal behavior disorder (SBD), included in DSM-5 for research purposes, has not yet been examined in this population.\nMethods: In a sample of N = 103 treatment-seeking refugees, SBD prevalence was assessed using a clinical interview. Associations between suicidality (presence and severity) and risk factors—gender, age, PTSD, disorders of self-organization (DSO), depression, insecure asylum status, flight duration, postmigration living difficulties (PMLD)—as well as the protective factor religiosity were examined via univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: SBD prevalence was 14.41% (n = 15). DSO and an insecure asylum status were associated with the presence of suicidality in univariate and multivariate analyses and with the severity of suicidality in multivariate analyses. Sexual trauma frequency was associated with the presence of suicidality, while PTSD severity and lower religiosity were linked to greater suicidality severity. Depressive symptoms were associated with suicidality only in univariate analyses.\nConclusion: Suicidality should be systematically assessed in treatment-seeking refugees, particularly those with DSO or an insecure asylum status. Brief suicide prevention interventions may be warranted when treatment duration is uncertain, and targeted PTSD treatments should be offered when indicated.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive models, such as evidence-accumulation models, are increasingly used in individual differences research in psychology and neuroscience. By computing correlations between cognitive model parameters across participants, researchers aim to understand how the psychological processes the parameters represent relate to one another and jointly determine performance. It is generally acknowledged that cognitive models can be challenging to estimate due to strong within-subject correlations among the parameters, which are embedded in the model’s likelihood function. What is less often recognized, however, is that within-subject correlations can also distort correlations computed between parameters estimated with non-hierarchical methods, so they no longer reflect true individual differences, potentially leading to misleading conclusions. Here we illustrate this pitfall of non-hierarchical estimation and show how appropriately parameterized hierarchical models can mitigate the problem by effectively separating within- and between-subject sources of variation. We then offer recommendations for identifying and guarding against the inferential biases resulting from the strong within-subject correlations inherent in many cognitive models.",

          "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) from frequency-tagging (FT) paradigms are widely used to investigate visual processing. Yet their association to conscious perception remains unclear. To test whether SSVEP occurs during conscious perception or without consciousness, 32 participants saw sequences of different images presented at 6 Hz (6 images per second) and containing faces every fifth image (1.2 Hz). All images were presented at either a face-categorisation-threshold contrast (1%) or a supraliminal contrast (1.5%). After each sequence, participants had to categorise the face gender (objective perception) and rate their confidence in this categorisation and the visibility of the faces (subjective perception). During the sequence presentation, participants’ attention was monitored via an orthogonal fixation-cross task. Results showed that, at 1.5% contrast, the face signal was higher during correct than during incorrect gender categorisation and increased linearly with both visibility and confidence ratings. In line with participants’ performance on the fixation-cross task, the signal collected at 6 Hz also indicated that attention related more closely to confidence than to visibility. At 1% contrast however, no face perception occurred behaviourally, which was confirmed by an absence of brain signal recorded in response to face instances. Overall these findings show that SSVEPs can track both the objective and subjective perception of faces at a supraliminal, hence conscious, contrast (1.5%). These findings bring new evidence that SSVEPs can be used as a marker of conscious perception.",

          "abstract": "Question-asking is a fundamental part of human communication and integral to cognitive development and education. Yet although previous research has examined questions in non-longitudinal lab settings, there is sparse research on how our question asking originality and complexity changes over time and how it is influenced by knowledge acquired. In the current study we investigate the effect of acquired knowledge on question asking and its predictive ability of educational outcomes such as final tests and projects. Undergraduate university students (N = 68) who participated in a semester-long “Intro to Psychology” course were assessed on their general and course specific question asking ability (originality and complexity) using two question asking tasks. They completed these tasks at the beginning and end of their semester-long course, alongside open-ended final projects and an end of class multiple choice closed-ended test. We find that students’ domain-specific question asking ability improved during the course, yet general question asking ability stagnated and even declined. Both general and specific question asking ability were negatively correlated with closed-ended test scores, while general ability was positively correlated with open-ended final project scores. These novel results highlight the important role of knowledge in question asking, and the potential of question asking ability in predicting and perhaps improving education assessment outcomes. They also advance our understanding of the way we ask questions, the differences between open- and closed-ended assessment and pave the way for future pedagogical interventions based on enhancing question asking ability.",

Barriers included lack of understanding (Knowledge) and emotional burden (Emotion). Enablers involved supporting decision-making (Memory, attention, decision processes) and beliefs about testing benefits (Beliefs about consequences), though risks were equally noted.

          "abstract": "Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is a transdiagnostic risk factor that has been robustly implicated in several internalising psychopathologies, particularly anxiety disorders. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in multiple sclerosis (MS) and the inherent uncertainty associated with the disease, it is unclear whether current measures of IU are appropriate for people with MS. In this study, we describe the psychometric features of the short-form Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS-12) in a mixed sample of 2117 participants (244 MS, 1873 non-MS controls). Specific aims were to (i) assess the internal reliability and dimensionality of the IUS-12; (ii) test measurement invariance across MS and non-MS groups; and (iii) determine construct validity by correlating the IUS-12 with measures of psychological distress and anxiety, test-retest reliability and temporal stability over a six-month interval, and clinical utility of the IUS-12 in detecting clinically significant symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and health anxiety. A bifactor model, comprising a General IU factor and two group factors (Prospective IU and Inhibitory IU), best represented the IUS-12. Measurement invariance was found across MS and non-MS participants. The IUS-12 had good construct validity and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = .62) over the six-month survey period. Given the central role of uncertainty in the lived experience of MS, these findings support the use of the IUS-12 as a psychometrically sound measure of IU in this population. Routine assessment incorporating the IUS-12 may help inform the development of targeted psychological interventions for people with MS.",

Daily Growth is a digital parenting program designed to improve parent and child emotion regulation using an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) approach. Daily Growth sends twice-daily prompts and delivers 3-minute videos tailored to a recent parenting situation, offering two program types (Emotion Coaching; Active Play) to meet different parent preferences. EMI has been minimally tested with parenting programs. This pilot aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the EMI design and a prototype of Daily Growth, offering the two programs via 10 of 90 planned videos. \nMethods: A pilot randomised controlled trial recruited 189 Australian parents of children aged 2-4 years, randomised to either intervention (n=94) or active control (n=95). Participants completed a 25-minute online survey at baseline and 2 weeks post intervention. In the intervening 2 weeks, participants received twice-daily 1-minute pre-EMI surveys via email. Participants who reported any parent or child negative affect or emotion dysregulation received a resource. Participants in the intervention condition were randomised in the moment to receive a 3-minute Emotion Coaching or Active Play video, while participants in the control condition received a link to a parenting website. Participants were sent a 1-minute post-EMI survey. For both conditions, parenting support was tailored to one of five pre-defined parenting situations. \nResults: 71% of participants were retained to 2 weeks post survey, and over two thirds completed at least half of the daily pre-EMI surveys. Despite technical issues, most participants reported Daily Growth as easy to use (67%) and were satisfied with Daily Growth (60%), would recommend it to other parents (79%), and would use the skills learned (69%).\nConclusions: This pilot evaluated whether brief, tailored videos could engage parents in real time. Findings suggest the Daily Growth prototype was feasible and well received, supporting further implementation in a larger trial.",

Whether preschoolers reliably deploy relational reasoning remains debated, partly because behavioural measures provide only dichotomous outcomes (e.g., correct/incorrect). We investigated the temporal processes underlying relational decisions by combining the Relational Match-to-Sample task with time-resolved eye-tracking. Thirty-three 4–5-year-olds completed same/different judgments while their gaze patterns were continuously recorded. Children selected the relational match at levels that were significantly above chance performance. When children made relational choices, their gaze followed the sequence of an initial look to the relational match to establish alignment, a comparison of both alternatives, and a final return to the relational match to confirm the mapping, consistent with structure-mapping theory. The findings demonstrate that preschoolers can engage relational reasoning even when they do not express relational language and reveal the dynamic process that contributes to relational reasoning.",

          "authors": "Naike Wang",
          "abstract": "This study introduces a new replication success classification framework for multi-lab replication studies that goes beyond the traditional binary distinction of replication success and failure. The framework distinguishes between true and false replication successes and failures, revealing the underlying composition of observed replication results and how they are shaped by study-level factors in both the original and replication studies. Using a large-scale simulation, we evaluated four meta-analytic Bayes factor (MABF) methods as tools for determining replication success within this framework. Results showed that the MABF methods were generally more effective at ruling out spurious effects than at confirming small true effects. The one-sided fixed-effect meta-analytic Bayes factor and the inclusion Bayes factor methods most reliably identified genuine replication success. The framework illustrates how bias and methodological choices influence the underlying composition of replication outcomes. These findings provide a more nuanced understanding of replication results and offer practical guidance for designing and evaluating future large-scale replication projects to strengthen research reproducibility.",

          "abstract": "Retrieval practice is one of the most effective strategies for enhancing long-term memory. Building on recent work (Shi &amp; Liu, 2025), we investigated error-driven learning (EDL) as a unified mechanistic account, which posits that memory improvement is shaped by two key signals: objective error—quantified as retrieval inaccuracy—and subjective error estimates, reflected in confidence judgments, which regulate how objective errors are processed. Using a continuous color-wheel paradigm with fMRI, this study examined the neural substrates of EDL and the modulatory role of confidence. Behaviorally, both larger objective error and lower confidence independently predicted greater subsequent memory improvement. Neurally, analyses of univariate activation, functional connectivity, and multivoxel pattern similarity revealed two dissociable yet interacting systems gated by confidence: Memory-related circuits, such as functional connectivity between the hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus, were preferentially engaged under low confidence, leveraging objective retrieval errors to drive memory updating. In contrast, metamemory-related regions—including the striatum, thalamus, and supramarginal gyrus—were recruited under high confidence to process prediction errors elicited by unexpected retrieval failures. Together, these findings demonstrate how confidence dynamically regulates the recruitment of distinct neural circuits in support of retrieval-based learning, offering broad implications for educational interventions and memory rehabilitation.",

          "abstract": "Abstract\n\n\tThe conceptual knowledge that mediates our ability to use familiar objects, understand viewed actions, and engage in communication about actions is often termed “action semantics”. \nThe underlying format, cognitive organization, and neural substrates of these representations are matters of active scientific investigation. This review synthesizes the large and diverse literature on action semantics in individuals with neurological disorders characterized by prominent motor deficits (e.g., Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), as well as those for whom motor deficits are often less prominent (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, stroke). Research in these two groups of disorders is strikingly “siloed” and offers many contradictory findings with respect to whether action semantic representations are abstract (i.e., “disembodied”) or grounded in sensory and motor features that reflect the way knowledge was acquired. Findings across these populations also disagree as to whether action semantic representations are organized somatotopically or with a semantic feature-based architecture, and mediated by anterior motor-related or relatively posterior sensory-related brain regions. Many of these disparate findings can be reconciled with consideration of a multidimensional, multimodal representational architecture mediated by a distributed left-lateralized network of brain regions. We provide suggestions for specific methodological approaches for research with neurological populations that may further our understanding of the format, organization, and neural substrates of action semantics.",

Though the fact that children care about fairness is well-documented, less is understood about the types of fairness norms that children endorse: In this work, across two studies with preschool-aged children (ages 2.5-6; N = 123), we document a developmental shift towards precision in sharing norms, both in rejecting extreme inequalities (i.e. giving none) and increased endorsement of exact equality (distributing exactly equal amounts). Children’s symbolic counting skills (i.e., acquisition of the cardinal principle) predicted this shift across two studies, even when accounting for approximate number acuity and symbolic and non-symbolic understanding of null sets, though this effect emerged only for children’s tolerance of selfish sharing—most forms of generous sharing were tolerated regardless of numerical abilities. Our results suggest a developmental shift from an abstract notion of learning to an increasingly precise notion of equality as children acquire symbolic counting skills.",

At the same time, they have been strategically reclaimed by the subjugated and\nmarginalized in moments of rupture as instruments of survival and material advancement.\nBeginning with divergent case studies from Ecuador, the United States, and Aotearoa New\nZealand, this paper places these RoN efforts in dialogue with critical histories and contemporary\ndebates around rights.

This study presents the first cross- platform and cross-national analysis of digital campaign communication by 401 parties across all 27 EU member states during the 2024 Euro- pean Parliament election. Using data from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, and YouTube, we examine party activity and audience engage- ment. By linking digital trace data with expert surveys, we test whether populist radical right parties disproportionately succeed in raising engage- ment online. Our findings confirm strong platform-specific advantages of radical populist parties, particularly on TikTok, YouTube and Facebook. We also observe high engagement for far-left populist parties with similar emotional and anti-elitist communication strategies. The more Eurosceptic positions a party holds, or the more frequently experts describe them to use emotional appeals or anti-elitist communication, the more audience engagement they received across several platforms. Overall the findings emphasize a disproportionate online support for radical populist parties across the European Union.",

After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.\nWhile a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.\nThese results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

          "authors": "Carla Rowold; Nicole Kapelle",
          "abstract": "Women consistently hold less wealth than men, and the life course drivers of this gap remain insufficiently understood. Prior decomposition studies have focused on employment duration or cross-sectional indicators, neglecting the timing, sequencing, and complexity of both work and family life courses, and assumed common support across gender. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we study West Germans aged 50–59 with an innovative two-step approach addressing these shortcomings. First, life-course feature selection identifies key wealth predictors, such as education and unemployment experiences, but also family life-course characteristics and homemaking. Second, we apply the Ñopo decomposition to quantify their contribution to the gender wealth gap. Results show that family-related factors, including homemaking, and the sequencing and timing of life-course transitions decisively shape women’s lower wealth. Gender-exclusive experiences, for which there is no counterfactual, account for much of the gap, underscoring how entrenched life-course inequalities translate into lasting economic disadvantage for women.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization in America has intensified beyond mere disagreement to what scholars characterize as sectarianism – a condition where partisan identity fundamentally shapes moral judgments. A key marker of sectarianism is asymmetric moral standards for violence, where aggression against political opponents is considered more justified than identical violence targeting one's own group. Using a survey experiment featuring a realistic political rally scenario, we find compelling evidence in support of such sectarianism: partisan bias in the US extends to evaluations of political violence. By manipulating the partisan affiliations of perpetrators and targets, as well as provocation severity, we find that both Democrats and Republicans exhibit substantial and symmetrical partisan bias. This double standard is particularly pronounced among strong partisans, who are nearly three times more likely to justify violence against the opposition than violence targeting their own party. These results extend sectarianism theory beyond policy preferences to physical violence, suggesting partisan identity now functions as a powerful perceptual filter that can legitimize political aggression when directed at opponents.",

          "abstract": "Modern social policies, including cash benefits and public services have emerged to compensate for the loss of solidarity at the local level. While reducing poverty and increasing welfare, these policies have tended to remain technocratic, their democratic legitimacy being contested. This paper examines contemporary Western social policy in the light of Hannah Arendt’s distinction between making and acting. Making is the human condition of worldliness. We live in a world of durables and construct these durables through the process of making. Acting is the human condition of plurality. We live together with others and must therefore agree on the forms of our social life. For Arendt acting and making are strictly separate activities. Therefore, the means-ends schema plays no role in politics, which is about acting together. Thus, social policy is not about reaching a pre-defined outcome in technocratic fashion but about the negotiation and agreement on the forms of our social life.",

          "abstract": "This preprint presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding intersex bodies through the lenses of corporality, subjectivity, and emotions. Drawing from anthropological, feminist, and philosophical traditions, this work challenges the biomedical construction of intersexuality and proposes embodied approaches that center lived experience and agency. The analysis traces genealogies of bodily thought—from Cartesian dualism through phenomenology to contemporary feminist theory—while examining how power structures, medical discourses, and cultural norms shape intersex experiences. By articulating sociological and individual levels of analysis, this framework reveals intersexuality as a contested field where expert knowledge confronts activist voices, and where bodies become sites of both disciplinary control and transformative resistance. This theoretical contribution provides essential tools for ethnographic research on intersex lives and broader questions of bodily difference, gender variance, and biomedical normalization.",

Yet, because CSS, much like other scientific disciplines, operates within structural contexts addressing social bias remains a critical issue requiring attention in the field. Social bias, defined as the systematic discrimination and stereotyping of groups and individuals, relates to CSS in multiple ways. Drawing on literature, we critically examine these connections across three perspectives: understanding, detecting, and mitigating social bias. First, we provide a foundation for understanding how social bias shapes both CSS as a research field and its methodology. Second, we highlight how social bias can be detected not only within the CSS methodology itself but also through CSS applied to broader societal domains. Finally, moving forward, we propose strategies to mitigate social bias in the CSS methodology and CSS as a research field. With our contribution, we seek to demonstrate the breadth of ways in which social bias and CSS intersect and to chart paths toward a more equitable and robust CSS.",

Through several case studies from the observatory, we examine specific instances of methodological flaws, data integrity issues, and challenges of maintaining scientific rigor that passed through peer review but were uncovered in the responses. The prototype demonstrates the potential for creating a crowd-sourced comprehensive repository of post-publication reviews and supports the creation of “meta-reviews” that integrate multiple critiques of a study. It also reveals limitations such as resource constraints and the complexities involved in identifying influential articles and valid responses. Future developments include refining the selection and ordering criteria, while encouraging greater engagement from the scientific community and informed public with the ultimate goal to enhance the reliability of published research.",

          "abstract": "Same-race teachers are linked to better academic outcomes for minoritized students, yet most students never encounter a teacher who shares their racial background. Prior work underscores the benefits of race-matched instruction but focuses on overall workforce diversity rather than the institutional structures that make cross-racial contact possible. We formalize this opportunity as race-match sufficiency, defined as whether the expected number of same-race teachers for students of a given race at a school is at least one. We treat this sufficiency measure as a structural property of schools. Using administrative data from 8,691 Texas public schools serving 5.4 million students, we model sufficiency as a function of racial composition, enrollment, grade span, and district context. Same-race student concentration emerges as the dominant factor, following a steep nonlinear S-curve whose thresholds differ markedly across racial groups. Secondary grade configurations and larger campuses modestly expand opportunities, yet disparities persist: white students experience near-universal sufficiency, Black students experience moderate access, and Hispanic students experience chronic underexposure—even in majority-Hispanic settings. These results show how diversity translates unevenly into contact and illustrate a portable framework for exposure-based staffing metrics that can be applied wherever administrative data exist.",

          "abstract": "Sociology has paid limited attention to the role of luck in shaping individual\nsocioeconomic outcomes. This study examines how luck, conceptualized as chance events\nthat provide or deplete resources for educational attainment, contributes to educational\ninequalities by family socioeconomic status (SES). We theorize that unexplained\nvariance in regression models can serve as an indirect indicator of both good and bad\nluck. Building on the Breen and Goldthorpe model of educational inequality, we\nintroduce a stochastic component and derive a novel hypothesis: luck plays a greater\nrole, and thus generates more variability in outcomes, when structural resources and\nindividual propensity for education are misaligned, specifically for low-SES students with\nhigh educational propensity and high-SES students with low propensity. We test this\nhypothesis using variance function regression models with sibling fixed effects on two\nU.S. datasets. The results support our expectations: educational outcomes are most\nvolatile when parental SES and educational propensity diverge, particularly among low-\nSES students with high propensity, whose attainment appears most exposed to chance.\nWe conclude by discussing implications for the emerging sociology of luck and for\nresearch on inequality and mobility more broadly.",

          "abstract": "This commentary proposes a renewed place-based understanding of ageing and social care research, drawing together evidence from an updated review of interventions for social isolation and insights from public engagement in contrasting urban and coastal settings. Despite a longstanding policy emphasis on ‘ageing in place’, structural conditions across England remain uneven, with rural and coastal communities often experiencing shrinking services, limited transport, digital exclusion, and fragile social infrastructures. Our updated umbrella review of 75 recent publications indicates that psychological, social, and hybrid interventions can reduce loneliness, but their impacts are inconsistent, often short-lived, and rarely examined across different geographical settings. We found no study adopted a genuinely place-based framework, leaving questions about how local environments shape both risk factors and intervention effectiveness. Insights from community engagement in London and coastal Lincolnshire further illustrate how place influences everyday experiences of ageing, highlighting shared challenges, such as fragmented services, digital barriers, and rising living costs. Whereas urban location-specific issues included isolation amid density, geographically close inequalities, and limited continuity of services, by contrast, people in coastal communities cited transport deprivation, seasonal and precarious economies and the erosion of community spaces. Taken together, these findings show that spatial inequalities are widening and that research failing to account for these, risks reinforcing them. A strengthened place-based research agenda is needed to ensure interventions are equitable, context-sensitive, and grounded in lived experience.",

Searchers that pursue their theories through incremental steps instead of long-distance jumps have the highest rates of serendipitous success.

          "abstract": "U.S. life expectancy plateaued since 2010 and declined in 2014-2017 and 2020–2021, increasing the gap between the United States and its peers. This analysis calculated U.S. trends in the number of individuals who lost a close kin, such as a mother, father, at least one sibling, or at least one child, and how the number of bereaved people changes under counterfactual mortality conditions. We found that adverse mortality in 2010–2019 and spikes in mortality in 2020–2021 resulted in a substantial increase in the number of individuals bereaved annually. Increases over time were especially large for individuals bereaved by sibling loss. If the United States had maintained its rates of mortality improvement from 2000–2009, about 2.7 million fewer people would have experienced at least one close-kin loss during 2010–2019. By 2021, the excess number of individuals who had ever been bereaved since 2010 had grown to 5.6 million. Considering single years, in 2019 alone 8.6% of all bereaved individuals—around 0.9 million people—would not have lost any close relative had the United States maintained its previous pace of mortality improvement. In 2021, the corresponding annual excess rose to 25%, or about 3.2 million individuals. Excess bereavement is similar when applying the concurrent rates of mortality improvement of countries like Japan and Switzerland. Decomposition analyses revealed that excess bereavement in the United States can be explained primarily by adverse mortality trends, rather than by differences in size or composition of the population at risk. Considering population health trends from the perspective of the number bereaved shifts the focus from individual deaths to their rippling effects on surviving family, at a population scale.",

Building on classic public administration debates and newer work on system-level bureaucracy, the article reframes AI adoption as a constitutional, not merely technical, question: which administrative decisions may be standardized, and which must remain under human control because they implicate fairness, equity, or rights?

I examine this mechanism using class size as a salient signal of school quality. Using TIMSS-2015 data and exploiting maximum class size regulations across six European countries, I implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of class size. I find that only highly educated parents reduce their engagement in children’s homework when classes are smaller, while less educated parents make no change. This occurs without any change in students’ achievement, teachers’ likelihood of assigning homework, or how frequently the child does homework. These findings suggest that equalizing effects of schools may partly reflect parental responses rather than purely in-school mechanisms.",

A superficial analysis of the literature suggests that the evidence on cybercrime inside video games is scarce and a considerable number of digital settings have not been explored. This systematic review critically addresses the body of work that has studied the connection between video games and crime from the perspective of Environmental criminology and the Criminology of Place. The review is guided by two hypothesis on crime clustering on cyberspace: (1) the literature on video games and crime has focus in a small number of titles (2) the literature on video games and crime is more prone to understand video games as factor that can trigger victimization or perpetration in offline spaces rather than a setting in which cybercrime can manifest. Through the analysis of 41 studies published between 2014 and 2024 following the PRISMA model, our results show that there is indeed and overrepresentation of some cyber places within research around video games and crime. Likewise, the literature most frequently studies the effects of video games on perpetration or victimisation. The implications of the study are discussed within the context of the debate on the risks associated with playing video games and the limitations of our understanding of which video games are criminogenic virtual environments.",

We conducted a large survey experiment in the United States and Germany, with 5,000 respondents each, to explore how citizens would design their ideal governance system. We focus on two scenarios: a utopian Mars setting, in which citizens were asked to design governance from scratch, and an Earth setting, in which citizens were asked to redesign the existing governance system they live in. On the basis of a constant sum and conjoint analysis, we find a strong preference for mixed and “multicameral” (McKay, 2025) governance models that distribute decision-making among multiple actors. In the Mars scenario, citizens slightly “de-center” the representative model in favor of a greater emphasis on participatory and expertocratic components. There is also an even more pronounced preference for strong oversight. Our findings suggest that citizens' ideal governance preferences differ greatly from the current institutional status quo in both countries. Despite current authoritarian trends, citizens favor a system of governance based on institutional cooperation and robust checks and balances.",

          "authors": "Takeshi Minakawa",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nHuman birth timing was historically regulated by circadian biological rhythms, with spontaneous deliveries typically occurring during the late night and early morning. However, the increasing medicalization of childbirth raises the hypothesis that social and institutional schedules now exert a dominant influence. This study empirically examines the historical transition from “biological time” to “social time” by analyzing hourly and day-of-week birth distributions among individuals born in Japan between 1960 and 1999. Using a dataset of 135,748 self-reported birth records collected from a commercial astrology web service, and after excluding default values indicating unknown times, the final analytical sample comprised 68,224 individuals. Birth trends were assessed using hour- and weekday-level aggregation, minute-level kernel density estimation, and cross-decade heatmap visualization.\n\nResults reveal a pronounced shift toward institutional scheduling. First, weekend births declined markedly, forming a clear weekend gap by the 1990s. Second, the natural dawn peak visible in the 1960s was replaced by a sharp weekday peak between 13:00 and 15:00 in the 1990s, coinciding with typical hospital operating hours; minute-level analysis confirmed that the drop at 12:00 reflects lunch-break scheduling rather than analytical artifact. Finally, heatmaps demonstrate increasing concentration of births within business hours (Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00). These findings indicate that late-20th-century Japanese birth timing increasingly reflected the logistics of medical practice rather than intrinsic physiological patterns. Beyond documenting this transition, the study demonstrates that large-scale self-reported digital data can replicate epidemiologically robust trends with high temporal resolution, suggesting potential applications in real-time public health monitoring.",

          "abstract": "Biodiversity provides essential ecological, economic, and cultural value, yet it continues to decline under anthropogenic pressures driven largely by economic development. Although many corporations are developing biodiversity-related measures and reporting frameworks, their actual environmental awareness and responsibility remain critical. On 19 September 2025, the outdoor sports brand Arc’teryx held a large-scale fireworks event, Ascending Dragon in the Himalayas, in Shigatse, China, which drew widespread criticism for its potential negative environmental impacts. To evaluate the societal and financial consequences of this incident, we analyzed Chinese public responses based on Weibo discourse (public reaction), Baidu Search Index (public attention), and the stock performance of Anta, Arc’teryx’s parent company. Both reaction and attention peaked two days after the event, and we found a negative correlation between online trends and stock performance. Causal analysis further demonstrated a significant causal influence of Baidu search activity related to Anta on its stock price. Textual analysis revealed that public concern centered primarily on environmental impacts, followed by expectations of corporate responsibility. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a negative environmental event, together with the resulting public reaction and attention, can directly and immediately influence a company’s financial performance. These findings underscore the importance of genuine biodiversity awareness and responsible decision-making in corporate practice.",

          "abstract": "This study examines how the social movement can contribute to improving political representation with the case of the minimum wage legislation in American states after 2012. The contribution of this research is that it’s an empirical analysis of how social movement affects the legislative process, especially in the agenda-setting stage and how social discourse takes part in this process, given the lack of research concerning determinants of the state legislation of the higher minimum wage, especially focusing on the influence of the social movement on the legislation. I analyze the impact of the social movement, measured by the media exposure frequency, on public opinion, the proposal of bills and the legislation with the national-level time serial and the state-level data. I investigate the impact of the social discourse on public opinion and the legislative process to illuminate the underlying mechanism where the social movement affects the political outcome. The social movement contributes to the improvement of political representation by spreading the social discourse, setting the agenda in civic and political society and triggering partisan politics for institutional change.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "abstract": "Forthcoming, Sociological Science \n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered considerable attention for its potential utility in research and scholarship, even among those who typically do not rely on computational tools. Early commentators, however, have also articulated concerns about how GenAI usage comes with enormous environmental costs, serious social risks, and a tendency to produce low-quality content. In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use. While optimism that GenAI will improve is high, scholars are divided on whether GenAI will have a positive impact on the field.",

          "authors": "John Downer",
          "abstract": "This paper argues that modern risk governance rests on a useful fiction: that technological safety can be rendered as objective fact. Within a “regime of functional objectivity,” institutions translate unruly hazards into standardized metrics that appear auditable, comparable, and decisive. That fiction works tolerably well because the uncertainties of most technologies can be bounded enough for regulation and coordination. The paper contends, however, that this regime has an epistemic boundary, past which the assumptions that support objectivity claims can no longer be safely ignored. Beyond this threshold lies a “regime of fractured objectivity,” where extreme stakes and sparse empirical feedback demand implausible certainty, small modeling choices dominate outcomes, and routine heuristics of expertise lose traction. \nThe argument unfolds in four steps. First, it maps the civic epistemology that privileges technical consensus and procedural validation in technological risk, contrasting it with the plural, openly provisional treatment of economic risk. Second, it explains how this order is sustained by performances of objectivity that are methodologically valuable even if epistemologically fragile. Third, it draws on reactors to show how certain systems ‘fracture’ those performances by coupling catastrophic potential to hard limits on verification. Finally, it sketches the governance implications of operating beyond the boundary: cultivating varied expertise rather than a single authoritative voice, emphasizing resilience alongside risk calculation, and acknowledging that restraint may at times be the only responsible policy.",

          "authors": "Pascal König; Kristina Sabrina Weißmüller",
          "abstract": "What factors lie behind bureaucrats’ readiness to delegate client interactions that commonly involve human empathy to artificial intelligence (AI) systems? Such delegation entails a crucial trade-off as it may reduce workload but simultaneously introduces inauthentic empathic engagement in citizen-state relations, which may undermine the moral integrity of public administration (PA). Drawing on bureaucratic legitimacy theory, this study tests the impact of efficiency gains, AI features, and organizational norms on civil servants’ willingness to delegate citizen engagement to AI. Findings from a pre-registered discrete choice experiment conducted with 300 active German civil servants (Obs.=3,000) show that while efficiency gains and norms do have some impact, utilitarian considerations concerning AI’s ability to serve clients well are clearly the most important motivator. The findings show that the acceptability of delegating empathic engagement with citizens to AI can be tied to key dimensions of bureaucratic legitimacy, and provide novel evidence that the delegation of counselling to AI in PA is more strongly linked with public service motivation rather than self-serving efficiency gains. These insights advance theory and inform responsible and client-centered use of AI in public bureaucracies.",

          "abstract": "Transnational city networks (TCNs) are an expanding type of organization throughout the world—above all in Europe, where cities have been densely connected for several decades— and increasingly important players in a number of policy areas. More often than not, these networks link, directly or indirectly, to other levels and actors of governance, thus generating peculiar configurations of multilevel governance (MLG). This paper connects TCNs to the MLG conceptual framework by locating the former within an institutional space defined by the two types of MLG formulated by Hooghe and Marks, and reflecting on some of the implications of TCNs’ position in this space. In doing so, the paper achieves two objectives: first, it opens up the dominant MLG typology to accommodate intermediate and hybrid configurations of multilevel governance. Second, based on this reconceptualization, it provides an analytical basis on which to build in subsequent empirical work on city networks.",

          "authors": "Pierre Van Wolleghem; Marta Bruno Soares; Gavin Lamb; Ivan Puga-Gonzalez",
          "abstract": "Climate change adaptation (CCA) increasingly relies on collaborative efforts to generate and circulate actionable knowledge. Among these, knowledge networks (KNs) have emerged as key infrastructures for fostering transnational cooperation, enabling mutual learning, and supporting local implementation. While their theoretical value is widely acknowledged, the empirical landscape of adaptation-related knowledge networks in Europe remains poorly understood. This article offers the first systematic mapping of KNs working on CCA in Europe, with a particular focus on Transnational Municipal Networks (TMNs)—a prominent subset composed primarily of local authorities. We identify and compare 32 knowledge networks across key dimensions including structure, governance, membership, funding models, and core activities. The analysis is grounded in two original datasets: a network-level dataset comprising 32 adaptation-related KNs and a membership-level dataset encompassing over 17,000 entries, systematically collected and geo-referenced. These resources provide an unprecedented empirical basis for understanding how climate knowledge is shared, institutionalised, and mobilised across Europe. Our findings reveal a diverse and uneven landscape, with significant variation in access thresholds, support mechanisms, and geographic representation. TMNs, in particular, differ in the type and intensity of support they provide—ranging from technical expertise and financial assistance to symbolic capital and peer learning opportunities. The article contributes to ongoing debates about multilevel climate governance and the role of networks in enhancing local adaptation capacity.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines media imaginaries surrounding resource commodification in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a focus on events in 2020. It analyses two distinct yet interconnected media events. The first pertains to how the politics of natural resource commodification are debated and how various actors are positioned within these discussions. The second concerns the circulation of accounts of supernatural phenomena. The data include personal online exchanges from 2020–2021; three annual volumes (2018–2020) of a Central Kalimantan newspaper; selected news items from internet-based media (2017–2020); Twitter conversations from 2020 under various keywords; and selected YouTube videos featuring supernatural phenomena published between 2017 and 2020.\n\nFirst, the analysis argues that the Central Kalimantan mediascape is fragmented: established media outlets explicitly represent various state interests while claiming to serve the public, whereas social media discussions and circulating multimedia narratives often provide a counternarrative—if not constitute a counterpublic—serving as platforms for citizens to mobilise and articulate their interests. Second, the chapter introduces a new type of circulating discourse, termed “haunted publics,” in which accounts of supernatural events circulate in ways distinct from conventional counterpublics, yet the emergent effects of this circulation can still generate political critique. Third, consistent with previous research, it shows that discourses on supernatural events and resource politics are interrelated, even when they do not directly engage one another.",

          "abstract": "Kate’s House Foundation operates and owns seven accredited MAT homes serving justice-involved adults referred by the Drug Court and the Department of Corrections (DOC). The program emphasizes trauma-informed care, no rapid-exit policies, and prohibits resident “vote-outs.” Because all participants were justice-involved at entry, the realistic alternative to remaining in housing was the possibility of losing drug court benefits or returning to jail or prison for relapse or non-compliance. Within this high-risk context, the longer lengths of stay observed in this cohort represent extended periods in the community in lieu of incarceration, underscoring the preventive impact of a non-punitive, stabilization-first recovery housing model. We evaluated early exits, length of stay (LOS), completion/active status, employment change, and age patterns using assessments at ~0, 45, and 90 days (REC-CAP). 10, 12. Mean LOS was ~141 days (median ~97), and among residents engaged beyond 30 days the mean LOS was 181 days. Using LOS ≥60 days as a priori “engagement success,” retention was strongest among older adults, while residents &lt;25 showed the weakest ≥60-day retention. 5, 6 REC-CAP Social Capital &amp; Meaningful Activities scores skewed high (94% scoring 4–5 on a 5-point scale across 394 responses), indicating substantial perceived connection and purposeful activity during residence. Uniquely, this large single-system cohort spans seven houses run by one foundation under consistent policies, with data collected by two trained staff—reducing site-level variability common in multi-operator studies. In this cohort, Drug Court participants achieved retention patterns similar to DOC participants, supporting the role of non-punitive, MAT-compatible housing in maintaining community placement across justice-system categories.",

          "abstract": "Mitigating climate change requires individual behavioral changes and robust support for green policies. However, significant carbon inequality — where wealthier individuals have disproportionately larger carbon footprints — potentially poses a challenge to building broad-based demands for meaningful climate change mitigation. High emissions by the wealthiest in society may dampen the general public's perception of responsibility and support for policies necessary for stringent climate change mitigation. For this reason, we investigate how information about unequal carbon emissions within countries affects public support for climate mitigation efforts through a survey experiment (N = 1,110) on a representative sample of US respondents, providing information about the distribution of carbon emissions. Results show that exposure to this information increases support for stringent climate policies, particularly those targeting wealthy individuals. Notably, respondents perceive wealthier individuals as more responsible for climate change, without diminishing their own sense of responsibility for reducing pro-environmental behaviors. These findings suggest that making carbon inequality more salient can enhance broad-based support for climate policies without compromising individual engagement, offering insights into strategies for facilitating the green transition.",

          "authors": "Regina N. Watteel",
          "abstract": "Background: Canada’s 2021–2022 COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were implemented with the stated aim of reducing transmission and hospital burden. In the absence of randomized controlled trial evidence for these endpoints, policymakers relied on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated comparisons from surveillance data and observational studies, as well as ungrounded simulations, despite known methodological limitations that rendered such evidence unreliable for public health policies with rights implications.\nMethods: We systematically critiqued Canadian public health surveillance reports and advisory briefs (Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Ontario, Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table) together with related studies, identifying seven key biases classified by severity (critical/catastrophic), correctability, and scope. Distortions were quantified using published rate corrections, classification rules, time-series data, and population trends.\nResults: Critical biases included &gt;40% misclassification of early post-vaccination cases as unvaccinated and an 80-fold overestimation of senior unvaccinated hospitalization rates due to denominator errors. Additional critical biases—age-standardization obfuscating low-risk youth trends, testing fluctuations understating breakthrough cases, and misattribution rendering COVID-19 hospitalizations an invalid metric for burden—further distorted policy evidence. Catastrophic biases—selection and cumulative methodology—rendered group comparability invalid. Population trends showed case and hospitalization surges despite &gt;80% vaccination coverage, with vaccinated individuals dominating Omicron-era infections. Simulation studies retroactively justifying mandates contradicted real-world data with ungrounded counterfactuals used to estimate unproven benefits.\nConclusions: Pervasive, uncorrected biases in observational comparisons invalidated causal claims of transmission or hospital burden reduction. Progressive reliance on weaker evidence—coupled with expert bodies' lack of transparency in emphasizing unproven benefits while dismissing dissenting views—highlights a systemic failure to meet evidentiary standards for public health policies with rights implications. This analysis underscores the need for greater scientific rigor in interpreting observational data through real-time bias correction, transparent limitation reporting, and risk-stratified approaches to uphold evidentiary standards, ethical proportionality, and accountability. These lessons hold global relevance for evidence-based public health policy.",

Learning is shaped by three characteristics: offering curated choices, delivering immediate and vivid feedback, and manipulating time. Yet limitations such as restricted choice and ideological bias make reflection essential. Informal online spaces, including discussion forums, host debates on political visions and the realism of in-game simulations, offering blueprints for integrating digital games into climate action education.",

          "authors": "Patrick Habecker; Rick A. Bevins",
          "abstract": "The opening of sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) in New York City and the decriminalization of personal possession of all illicit drugs in Oregon marked significant changes to drug policy in the United States. Both changes came as the national yearly overdose deaths approached and then surpassed 100,000 deaths annually (CDC 2025a). Rising overdose deaths have been declared a state of emergency in the US and more Americans likely know someone who has died of an overdose than at any time in US history. In such an environment, new drug policies may have more support than they typically would. However, without sufficient public support, policy measures such as OPCs or decriminalization may be short-lived or reversed. In Oregon, the change in public support for decriminalization eroded enough from the passing of a law by ballot measure in 2020 to being revoked in 2024 by the legislature. Similarly, the current downturn in overdose deaths may cut support for sanctioned OPCs and other overdose prevention measures. Public support is therefore a critical component for sustained drug policy changes such as OPCs and decriminalization, even when these policies are introduced in times of emergency. In this paper, we studied the level of public support for OPCs and decriminalization measures as viewed by the general public in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state with little history of drug policy reform, a low rate of overdose deaths, and its residents are predominantly Republican. We estimated that 64.5% and 56.4% of adult Nebraskans support OPCs and 69.2% to 65.3% supported decriminalization in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This support was related to political party with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting both policies. However, 38% to 52% of Republicans also supported these two policies depending on the year. Although focused on Nebraska, these findings show what may be expected from similar states such as those in the Great Plains and Midwest areas of the US.",

          "abstract": "Digital polarization is often examined through identity-based frameworks that presuppose stable groups. We instead conceptualize Digital Connective Narratives (DCN) as a process of interactional co-construction that yields an emergent connective narrative field around shared issues and oppositional framings. Within this framework, Polarized DCN (PDCN) arise when these connective fields consolidate along five structural dimensions, social relevance, conflict scope, historical depth, power asymmetries, and emotional intensity. To illustrate the approach, we analyze debates on X (formerly Twitter) during South Africa’s COVID-19 vaccination campaign using topic modeling, stance classification, and adversarial-language detection tracked across rollout phases. Findings show that polarization did not diffuse across all topics: it concentrated in conflict-relevant debates, while institutional/informational topics remained largely non-polarized and faded over time. Within polarized debates, adversarial language intensified and engagement persisted, with challenger (non-institutional) streams gaining relative prominence as the campaign unfolded. As the pandemic’s immediate salience waned, public justification lost urgency and conflict retreated to a narrower circle of highly engaged users.",

          "authors": "J. Vázquez",
          "abstract": "El intercambio de favores es una de las manifestaciones más habituales de altruismo social, y una dinámica común en las relaciones humanas. Implica una transferencia de valor que no se suele hacer explícita, lo que puede conducir a valoraciones perceptivas discrepantes por parte de dador y receptor del favor. Los intentos de analizar formalmente estas dinámicas se ven dificultados por la naturaleza subjetiva y no expresada de las expectativas de valor y deuda que se generan, y por la condición no siempre monetaria de estos actos. Este articulo introduce la propuesta teórica de un nuevo marco de análisis conceptual, la Matriz de Valoración Subjetiva (MVS), basado en una representación geométrica-espacial diseñada para hacer visibles estas dinámicas.\nLa MVS construye la valoración de un favor a partir de dos dimensiones fundamentales: el sacrificio que supone para el dador y el beneficio que reporta al receptor. Sobre esta base, el modelo va incorporando la formalización de los sesgos perceptivos conocidos, logrando mostrar una representación del espacio subjetivo distorsionado de valoración de cada actor. Mediante la superposición de ambas representaciones, dador y receptor, se consigue hacer visible la distancia perceptiva entre ambos, e identificar las áreas del espacio valorativo donde el conflicto latente es más probable.\nLa MVS ofrece una herramienta para visualizar el efecto de estos sesgos perceptivos, y proporciona un método analítico con potencial cuantificador que permite identificar las causas precursoras del conflicto en el ámbito del intercambio de favores, pero con capacidad de extensión a cualquier otra dinámica de intercambio de valor no explícito.",

          "abstract": "Background\nCo-production with public stakeholders is increasingly recognised as an important approach to ensuring health research is relevant to communities and interventions and likely to generate sustainable change. Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. \n\nMain body\nThe ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. \n\nConclusion\t\nThe iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.",

          "abstract": "This study explores interactions between ransomware victims and offenders through a qualitative analysis of chat negotiations of the LockBit ransomware group (n=147), providing insight into data exfiltration, extortion, communication and negotiation, payment, and post-payment outcomes. The findings show that both offenders and victims employ bounded rational decision-making. For offenders, this is exemplified by aspects such as tailor-made ransom demands for each victim and balancing between trust signals and pressure tactics. For victims, this includes aspects such as the reasoning behind the decision to negotiate and pay a ransom demand, considering for example, the financial situation of their company, value of the data, and time and effort required to recover without a decryptor. However, both parties also have to deal with information asymmetry, including offenders having incomplete information on the victim’s finances or the value of the data, or victims being unsure about the credibility of the ransomware group. The findings also illustrate the interplay between both parties in shaping the outcome of the ransomware attack, and the professional aspects and imperfections of LockBit’s ransomware operations. The study highlights the importance of understanding victim-offender interactions during ransomware attacks, while also providing practical implications for the support of victims.",

          "authors": "Phil Swatton",
          "abstract": "Empirical political science generates knowledge of the world through abductive reasoning, or inference to the best explanation. However, to date, no attempt has been made to compare the explanatory quality of the sociological modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the socio-economic positions of voters, and the spatial modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the ideology of voters. I argue that the paradigm of predictive inference, or machine learning, offers three contributions towards comparing these traditions within the abductive framework of political science. This depends on a change in emphasis, from seeking to produce maximally predictive models according a given metric to treating the predictive power of well-chosen variables as a theoretically interesting quantity. Taking the 2019 UK general election and 2019 EU parliament election as my primary and secondary case studies respectively, I use supervised machine learning to compare models using demographic variables and ideological variables to predict vote choice. Using British Election Study data I find that models using demographic variables are not much more accurate than assuming all voters vote for the largest party. I find that models using ideological variables perform better, but even these models struggle to predict third party vote choice. Using European Election Study data from 15 countries, I confirm that this result generalises, albeit there is too much uncertainty to confirm it in any particular country. I perform some post-hoc analysis using mutual information and PCA to give further support to my evidence. To my knowledge, this is the first time mutual information has been used to study vote choice. I conclude by arguing that in line with the three contributions my evidence shows that the spatial modelling tradition represents a better explanation in the abductive reasoning framework, and highlight several promising directions for future research.",

          "authors": "Mario Coccia",
          "abstract": "This study examines mortality dynamics across major macroeconomic regions—Western countries, non-Western regions, and China—from 1960 to 2023, exploring variability and underlying drivers. Descriptive analysis shows that non-Western regions experienced the highest death rates in 1960–1990, followed by a marked decline as GDP per capita increased. China exhibited a similar pattern. Conversely, Western countries achieved only modest mortality reductions after 1991 despite sustained economic growth, even when controlling for population aging (≥65 years). Regression models and partial correlations indicate that economic progress initially correlates with mortality decline in all regions. However, in Western countries, this relationship reverses after 1991, forming an inverted-U curve when mortality is modeled against GDP per capita and elderly share. This suggests diminishing health returns and potential adverse effects of advanced development—such as environmental degradation, lifestyle-related diseases, and occupational risks. Non-Western regions, with slower economic acceleration, show no comparable reversal. Findings imply that beyond a development threshold, further growth may paradoxically elevate mortality. Policy strategies should prioritize balanced, sustainable development and integrated “One Health” approaches to mitigate health risks associated with over-rapid economic expansion.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical framework for understanding the intricate relationships\nbetween body, subjectivity, and emotions within social anthropology. Drawing on\nphenomenological, feminist, and critical social theory, I argue that these three dimensions\nconstitute mutually constitutive domains that cannot be analyzed in isolation. The body\nis not merely a biological entity but a site of social inscription, cultural meaning-making,\nand lived experience. Subjectivity emerges through embodied practices situated within\nspecific cultural contexts and power relations. Emotions, far from being purely individual\npsychological states, function as socially mediated phenomena that shape and are shaped\nby both corporeal experiences and subjective formations. By synthesizing contributions\nfrom phenomenology (Merleau-Ponty, Csordas), practice theory (Bourdieu, Ortner),\nbiopolitics (Foucault), feminist theory (Butler, Grosz, Fausto-Sterling), and the\nanthropology of emotions (Rosaldo, Ahmed, Lutz), this paper proposes an integrative\nanalytical approach. This framework enables anthropologists to examine how social\nstructures become embodied, how subjects navigate normative regimes through their\ncorporeal existence, and how emotional experiences mediate between individual agency\nand collective formations. The paper concludes by discussing methodological\nimplications for ethnographic research that takes seriously the embodied, emotional\ndimensions of subjectivity.",

          "abstract": "The American Dream has long symbolized opportunities and upward mobility for migrants. Migration research often assumes that migrants in European countries hold imaginaries similar to the American Dream, yet recent scholarship on the role of the institutional context challenges this assumption. This study examines how migrants in Germany—a context with a different institutional setup—envision their destination. Based on interviews and group discussions with 47 migrants residing in Germany, this study identifies the contours of a distinct “German Dream”. Participants portrayed Germany as an institutional counterpoint to the United States, describing it as a “caring society” characterized by low inequality and extensive welfare provisions. This study makes three contributions to the study of geographical imaginaries. First, it demonstrates how imaginaries are relationally constructed by showing how migrants construct the German Dream through comparisons with the American Dream. Second, it highlights how different institutional contexts foster distinct imaginaries. Third, it emphasizes how imaginaries convey a vision of the good society, showing that migrants evaluate not only their own prospects but also the broader social order.",

          "abstract": "Local governments in many countries struggle to find candidates for elected office. In the resulting uncontested elections, voters cannot choose between different candidates and hold local representatives accountable. Amalgamation might be a solution for this challenge to democracy since larger jurisdictions need fewer elected officials per voter. Combining data on all Swiss local government mergers in the 21st century with data on local executive elections, this article assesses whether amalgamation reforms indeed increase candidate supply and hence local electoral contestation. Staggered difference-in-differences regressions show that amalgamation increases the number of candidates/seat. The underlying mechanisms seem to go beyond a ``mechanical'' effect that results from a mere expansion of the candidate pool. This study, thus, provides first empirical evidence that local government amalgamation might contribute to mitigate a hidden supply side crisis of electoral democracy at the local level.",

Using a representative survey of Swiss citizens (N = 1,070), I examine whether users select attitude-consistent search queries to look for a climate policy that was voted on in early 2025 in Switzerland. This study finds only limited signs of selective exposure: while intention to vote for or against the initiative was not related to the query stance, respondents’ climate beliefs partially influenced query selection. I further test whether selective exposure is greater when users choose queries from recommended options than when they formulate them independently, and discuss the role of expected vote outcome, political beliefs, and cognitive factors in query selection.",

Weekly, around eight per cent of respondents use libraries for at least half a day, a rate similar to that for coworking spaces, while a further one in three would consider doing so. Libraries are valued for quietness, affordability, internet access, and a sense of community, but limited privacy and restricted hours remain barriers. The findings highlight the library’s potential to meet workforce needs and offer practical implications for library managers seeking to design spaces and policies that better support remote workers and their wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Animals often stand as the most vivid symbols of the natural world, shaping how people imagine, value, and care for the environment. This study examines how emotional connections with animals relate to environmental attitudes and whether feelings of place attachment mediate this relationship. Drawing on frameworks from conservation psychology and sense-of-place research, two animal connection constructs—Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity—were tested as predictors of environmental concern among a U.S. sample of 282 adults. Each mediation model was estimated with 5,000 bootstrap samples, entering one predictor at a time while controlling for the other. These mediation models were specifically designed to evaluate whether place attachment functions as an intervening variable linking each animal connection construct to environmental attitudes, allowing us to estimate both direct and indirect effects while accounting for the other predictor. Results showed that both Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity were positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes and with both measures of Place Attachment. Place Attachment partially mediated the relationship between Animal Empathy and Environmental Attitudes. In contrast, Place Attachment did not significantly mediate the effect of Animal Solidarity, which was directly predictive of environmental concern. These findings suggest that empathy-based and solidarity-based connections with animals may foster environmental care through distinct psychological pathways. Understanding how affective bonds with animals shape place-based and environmental engagement can inform education, communication, and relational approaches to fostering ecological responsibility.",

We discovered significant correlations between the network attributes: various centralities and clustering coefficients -- and IHEs' attributes, such as enrollment, tuition, and religious/racial/gender affiliations. We uncovered the network's community structure linked to homophily -- such that similar followers follow similar colleges. Additionally, we analyzed followers' self-descriptions and identified 12 overlapping topics that can be traced to their group identities.",

          "abstract": "While a significant body of scholarly work exists to diagnose the probability of systemic socio-political crises, less attention has been paid to the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the character of the regime that emerges from the collapse. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a falsifiable theoretical framework for forecasting the post-collapse morphology of political systems. It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis. Through a detailed examination of the Roman Republic, the English Civil War, and the Weimar Republic, we illustrate how this two-stage analysis can deconstruct the anatomy of historical chaos and provide a more structured understanding of the political forms that emerge from it.",

          "abstract": "The 2025 shift from Biden’s Democratic to Trump’s Republican administration led to a relevant change in US strategy for the war in Ukraine. Models of democratic responsiveness imply that this would also be reflected in divergent preferences among US partisan voters regarding the normative, strategic, and economic considerations connected to supporting Ukraine against the Russian invasion. Do voters on the political left and right resolve these trade-offs differently? We bring conjoint and vignette survey experiments with 2,334 US citizens to this question. We show that absolute levels of support for Ukraine are lower among Republicans. However, irrespective of partisanship, citizens resolve the fundamental trade-offs involved in Ukraine policy similarly. Average support is higher for strategies that sustain the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of Ukraine compared to concessions to Russia -- even if less strongly so among (moderate) US Republicans. Both Democrat and Republican voters show relevant concern for the human costs of war, domestic economic costs, and escalation risk -- with economic costs resonating more among Republicans. Our results imply, tentatively, that differences in partisan preferences are smaller than the US administrations’ drawback of Ukraine support would let expect. Overall, for a case where normative motivations for intervention loom large, public support is not structured as expected along the left-right axis.",

I rationalize these findings with a stylized model where dynastic altruism underpins expected heirs’ stronger bequest motives. They accumulate human capital to increase lifetime income, hence the ability to finance bequests. The quantitative model attributes 44% of the gap in student rates between expected heirs and the rest to dynastic bequest motives, 35% to coresidence with parents and inter vivos transfers, whereas the expected wealth transfer itself has a strong negative effect on education. Policy counterfactuals show that inheritance taxation raises enrollment, especially when it funds student grants, and that the link between inheritance expectations and education is stronger when the discounted returns to education are lower. These findings help explain intergenerational persistence in education, wealth, and income, and highlight how inheritance taxation can affect the level and composition of human capital.

To answer these questions, this article presents the first recorded history of speech manipulation in Republican discourse. The investigation traced the origin of speech manipulation in Republican discourse to conservative principles introduced by William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry Goldwater. Critical discourse analysis identified manipulative strategies and techniques and revealed hidden messages and motivations connected across speakers and generations.

          "abstract": "Research shows that women leave male-dominated work settings more often than their male colleagues. In public services such as policing, disproportionate attrition of women slows improvement of gender equality, but can also affect legitimacy and service outcomes. Typically, attrition of women in policing is studied in isolation, while sources (and thus, solutions) of inequalities may lie in societal or broader organizational dynamics. Using monthly employment register data, this study compared attrition of Dutch female policing staff to those of their male counterparts and their peers in other public subsectors. Findings indicated that, while women were more likely to leave the Dutch policing sector than men, several other subsectors showed similar gender differences. Results suggest that approaches to improve gender equality, both in policing and in other ‘gender-typed’ subsectors, should not be limited to increasing representation and should involve reviewing implicit assumptions about employees, including procedures for appraisal.",

          "abstract": "While journalism research increasingly engages with the applications of artificial intelligence (AI), it often overlooks the foundational layer that enables AI itself: data. This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value. Alongside its conceptual contribution, we introduce a systematic framework for locating research foci across intersecting dimensions of data in journalism.",

          "abstract": "In-depth reporting serves a crucial public interest by delving beyond surface-level facts to\nprovide context, analysis, and hidden truths on complex issues, thereby enabling a better-\ninformed public. However, its evolution in China’s digital media remains insufficiently\nexamined. Existing research on China’s media transformation has largely focused on state\nmedia, leaving a gap in comprehensive, longitudinal analyses of alternative digital genres.\nThis article addresses this gap by constructing a longitudinal corpus of 42,472 articles from\n16 leading in-depth reporting accounts on WeChat spanning 2013 to 2025. Using compu-\ntational methods, this study examines shifts in narrative style, moral framing, thematic\nfocus, and the evolving conception of 'truth.' Findings reveal an emerging reporting style\nthat increasingly prioritizes 'care,' focusing on personal experiences and individual truths\nover systemic or institutional analysis. Coverage of social systems, crime, and legal cases\nhas declined markedly, while broader reform-focused narratives have largely disappeared\nover the past decade. These changes offer a granular, longitudinal picture of how China’s\ndigital media landscape has evolved and reconfigured in a dynamic yet constrained manner.",

          "authors": "Christopher Cleverly",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper reframes debates about Indigenous sovereignty and constitutional legitimacy in post-colonial nations by examining the functional obsolescence of European ownership models in emerging post-scarcity conditions. Drawing on Ostrom’s (1990) Nobel Prize-winning principles of commons governance and the formal repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery (Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, 2023; UN Human Rights Council, 2021), we contend that Indigenous stewardship frameworks represent not historical artefacts but sophisticated legal systems optimally suited for abundance management. Quantitative evidence demonstrates that Indigenous-managed lands exhibit superior ecological outcomes compared to protected areas (Fa et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2019). Constitutional recognition of Indigenous sovereignty is presented as a positive-sum transition from the failing logic of the scarcity-based Extraction Paradigm (market/state binary) to the proven effectiveness of the Stewardship Paradigm. This analysis shows that legal continuity arguments cannot resolve foundational legitimacy deficits when the underlying dominant epistemic architecture actively obstructs human flourishing in conditions of technological potential and ecological urgency.\nKeywords: Indigenous sovereignty, constitutional legitimacy, post-scarcity economics, commons governance, Doctrine of Discovery, stewardship frameworks, Ostrom.",

Analysing thousands of comments across Reddit threads, the study identifies how narratives of populist revenge, class-based grievance, and aestheticised protest emerged. The findings show how online communities reframed violence as morally justified retaliation against elite injustice. These dynamics illustrate how digital platforms facilitate the construction of alternative moral orders, challenging formal institutions of justice.",

          "abstract": "This case study examines leadership ambiguity and coordination dynamics within a multidisciplinary academic project involving a senior supervisor, a doctoral researcher, and a postdoctoral collaborator from distinct disciplinary backgrounds. It analyzes how ambiguous communication, intermittent engagement, and selective reward distribution generate dependency, inequity, and defensive behavior. Building on organizational-behavior and anthropological perspectives—including Salisbury’s concept of reciprocal but asymmetric exchange—the study interprets these patterns as both emergent and, at times, strategically maintained to consolidate symbolic control. By integrating theories of destructive leadership, moralized favoritism, and social exchange, the paper proposes a framework of procedural and institutional remedies that transform discretionary authority into accountable and transparent practice. The findings highlight how ethical governance and structured reciprocity can sustain collaboration and learning in knowledge-intensive research environments.",

          "abstract": "This paper illustrates an original Data-Driven Analysis on logistics matters, developed within the scope of a research &amp; development project conducted by La Logistica S.r.l. and financed by the Apulia Region. The paper uses real operative data for developing and validating a complete analytical tool to forecast volume saturation on pallets. Compared to other studies on similar matters, which frequently make use of simulated and ideal sets of data, this research provides a unique opportunity to test, on an empirical ground, how very advanced Data Science approaches could be successfully applied on industrial processes.The paper develops a complete analytical investigation combining diagnose analytics, forecasting and model-interpretability to compare the performances of many different Machine Learning algorithms, such us K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Linear Models. The results obtained after an overarching comparison show how KNN is significantly more accurate and trustful in relation to any other method, outperforming any other on any key error measure and interpretability factors. The addition of contribution and importance investigation on variables extends to this paper a unique degree of originality, showing which SKUs’ physical variables are most significantly influencing volume saturation on pallets, and offering immediate management implications related to their operative meaning. The complete methodological pipeline is grounded on real operative data regarding La Logistica S.r.l., making this paper capable to show how operative Data-Driven solutions could play an innovative role into improving operative continuity within logistics matters.",

          "abstract": "Public backlash against scientists increasingly draws concern. It can originate from citizens, politicians, or journalists and range from legitimate criticism of scientific work to harassment and physical attacks. However, criticism and harassment also affect science communication professionals, which has received comparably little public and scholarly attention. Our study addresses this gap. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 15 university communicators from multiple countries, we develop a conceptual model that systematizes their perceptions of public backlash, the effects on them or their institutions, response strategies, and context factors. Our analysis introduces criteria for distinguishing legitimate criticism from illegitimate backlash and describes negative but also positive effects on science communication. The results elucidate proactive and reactive response strategies and highlight the influence of topic characteristics, routes of backlash, and sociopolitical contexts. Overall, they offer a new perspective on the normative imperative for public engagement. We discuss implications for science communication research and practice.",

          "authors": "William Marble; Joshua Clinton",
          "abstract": "Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) is widely used to estimate opinion in small sub- groups and to adjust unrepresentative surveys. Yet, even flexible MRP models contain errors generated by non-response and model misspecification. We propose a principled, data-driven method to leverage observable errors on auxiliary quantities with known marginal distributions — e.g., election outcomes — to improve estimates of policy attitudes. Our method leverages the correlation between auxiliary variables and outcomes of interest to calibrate MRP estimates to these known marginal distributions. We illustrate our approach using a pre-election poll measuring support for an abortion referendum. We find that the method reduces county-level error by two-thirds relative to traditional MRP. We also show how our calibration approach can be used to generate estimates for smaller nested geographies, such as precincts, even in the absence of poststratification data at this level. Our approach provides a framework for fully incorporating known population data to improve estimates of public opinion in small subgroups, providing scholars another tool to study representation.",
