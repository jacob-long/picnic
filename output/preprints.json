          "abstract": "本文通过分析一个关于计算机程序的简单思想实验，旨在探讨人类想象的本质及其与物理现实的深刻分野。我们能够毫不费力地想象出一个程序产生互斥甚至不可能的输出，这揭示了人类心智具有一种超越物理约束的、构建反事实场景的独特能力。本文将论证，这种能力在本质上是一种将宇宙万物视为“零件”并进行组合模拟的通用工具，是我们构建关于如何“使用”世界之知识的核心机制。在此基础上，本文将进一步探讨语言如何作为工具，将这些内在的、虚构的想象转化为可交流的、共享的观念。最终，本文旨在阐明，正是这种对“非现实”的想象能力，构成了我们形成价值判断和“理想世界”的基础，从而驱动着人类文化与社会的演进。本文将在硬决定论的框架下，揭示这一认知“魔法”与物理世界单一必然性之间的张力与共存关系。",

          "title": "Articulatory Morphogenesis: The Motor Foundation of the Prognostic Mind",
          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article explores articulatory morphogenesis as a fundamental process generated by the \"I Act\" within the framework of the Integrated Theory of the Prognostic Mind. Starting from the premise that the nervous system evolved to meet motor demands, we propose that articulation in its broadest sense (from bodily movement to phonoarticulation) is the primary domain in which basic cognitive principles manifest: the Holistic Self (SO) and the Quantum Self (SQ). The \"I Act\" orchestrates articulatory morphogenesis by applying the dominance/sub-dominance principle, guiding the SO in the unitary \"whole/parts\" synthesis and the SQ in managing \"part-part\" interactions and sequential positioning. \n\nNumerous concrete examples will be provided at various levels of articulatory morphogenesis, from the fine articulation of fingers to complex gait, and up to the specific processes of phonoarticulation (phonological features, phones, syllables, and words). We will discuss the crucial role of the Prognostic Mind's anticipation/verification cycle, with its top-down and bottom-up flows, in shaping and refining articulatory morphogenesis, highlighting alpha motoneurons, gamma motoneurons, and neuromuscular spindles as key players. We will conclude that human phonoarticulation represents an evolved and specialized extension of general articulatory morphogenesis, foreshadowing the capabilities of abstract thought.",

          "title": "Towards an Integrated Theory of Mind: An Experience-Centered Approach",
          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative theory of mind that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries (cognition, emotion, action). It offers a perspective centered on the experience of the acting/perceiving subject. The model presents three primary functional spheres—the \"I Act,\" the \"I Socialize,\" and the \"I Think\"—whose fundamental operational mode is anticipation/verification within their respective domains. This mode is achieved through the constant dynamic interaction between top-down flows (internally generated anticipations) and bottom-up flows (incoming sensory data). \n\nUnderpinning these functional spheres are two fundamental and omnipresent Cardinal Principles, universal to all organisms with a nervous system: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). These two core principles perform dual perceptual and executive functions, supporting the anticipation/verification mode of the three \"I's.\" The HS is responsible for awareness of state and wholeness, the synthesis of forms and identities, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and awareness of interactions and relationships, generating ordered sets. \n\nA unifying and central principle that orchestrates the mind's dynamism is the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens). Its role is the universal application of the operational method of constantly generating and integrating predictions, followed by their verification. How knowledge and action take shape is guided by Cognitive Morphogenesis and Articulatory Morphogenesis. These processes, intrinsic to all three \"I's,\" see the Holistic Self generate the synthesis of indivisible entities and the whole/part interaction, while the Quantum Self generates ordered sets. Dominance/subdominance, in this paper, will refer exclusively to articulatory morphogenesis. These two morphogeneses will be briefly introduced, with detailed explorations reserved for future work. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and execution are not mere functions, but intrinsic and dynamic goals of the anticipation/verification method: perception verifies an anticipation, and execution performs an action to verify an intention. The article outlines these principles and their evolution through the functional spheres, illustrating how the Prognostic Mind articulates in the \"I Act\" (present in all animals), the \"I Socialize\" (typical of birds and mammals), and the \"I Think\" (unique to humans). The distinction between these \"I's\" is necessary to explain differences in the nervous system between animals and humans, while maintaining the same basic operational principles for morphogenesis. The article emphasizes the integrated and dynamic nature of the mind, laying the groundwork for more in-depth future discussions.",

          "authors": "Ahmet O Ceceli; Yuefeng Huang; Greg Kronberg; Natalie McClain; Sarah G. King; Eduardo Butelman; Nelly Alia-Klein; Rita Goldstein",
          "abstract": "Originally postulated in 2001, the impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA) model of addiction highlights the prefrontal cortex (PFC, especially the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal regions) as central to drug addiction symptomatology. Accordingly, drug cues assume a heightened salience and value that overpower alternative reinforcers, with a concomitant decrease in inhibitory control, especially in a drug related context. These processes may manifest in metacognitive impairments (e.g., self-awareness of choice), obstructing insight into illness, as a function of recency of drug use. In this review, we update the neurobehavioral evidence for iRISA two decades later, emphasizing the robust measurement of the iRISA interaction (between a drug-related cue/context and a cognitive-behavioral function), and highlight relevant individual differences (e.g., drug use severity, craving). Crucially, we describe data suggesting functional recovery (with abstinence, treatment and other emerging modalities) and the need for identifying valid outcome biomarkers. We end by highlighting recent developments in artificial intelligence (e.g., natural language processing applied to spontaneous speech) and computational modeling, and call for enhanced ecological validity to facilitate dynamic and clinically meaningful neural explorations in drug addiction.",

          "authors": "Mrinmayi Kulkarni; Lydia Jiang; Jessica Robin; Jung Won Choi; Bradley Buchsbaum; Rosanna K. Olsen",
          "abstract": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory (AIM) task, while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category-sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer, and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the AIM task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face-sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortex (alERC and pmERC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) were identified as scene-sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in the MTL cortex (alERC, pmERC, and PHC), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in the MTL cortex identified as scene-sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

          "abstract": "Does authenticity matter in a domain where one’s words and persona aren’t meant to be taken at face value? People often say “I’m just joking” to mean “Don’t take my words or actions literally.” To date, little is known about the role of authenticity in humor appreciation. To explore this question, we used audio recordings of comedic stories told by standup comedians (Experiments 1-3), text-only comedic stories (Experiment 4), and text-only observational jokes (Experiment 5) as comedic materials. We manipulated perceptions of authenticity by alleging the comedian prioritizes authentic self-expression (vs. pleasing their audience) (Experiment 1), performs because they love performing (vs. for fame and money) (Experiment 2), tells jokes that are based on real, personal (vs. fictional, imagined) experiences (Experiment 3), or wrote their own jokes (vs. used another human writer or AI) (Experiments 4-5). Across all studies, people evaluated the allegedly authentic jokes as funnier and expressed greater interest in following or sharing the comedian’s work.",

          "abstract": "Although psychostimulant treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often effective, the medication does not work for all and some experience adverse side effects. As a result, a desire for effective non-pharmacological options emerges as a top priority for those with lived experience. One such approach is cognitive training focused on the neurocognitive differences associated with ADHD. Its results have been mixed, partly as it is delivered using computers, and sustained engagement with this format is difficult for children with attentional difficulties. To investigate further, we developed a cognitive training tool delivered in a gamified, fully virtual reality (VR) platform (Floreo TM), and here report on an open-label pilot trial of its feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary outcomes. Thirty youth with ADHD (mean age = 12.5 years; 33% female) were enrolled and completed up to 20 VR training sessions over a 4- to 6-week period. The intervention targeted four key cognitive domains implicated in ADHD: impulse control, working memory, temporal processing and processing speed. Clinician-rated inattention symptoms and associated functional impairments, based on interviews with parents, showed significant pre–post improvements (symptoms: t(25.90) = -5.60, p &lt; .001; d = -1.05; impairment: t(25.68) = -3.29, p = .003; d = -0.62). The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events such as occasional headaches and brief frustration. Usability ratings were high for parents and moderate for youth. Significant near-transfer effects were observed on tasks of impulse control (t (23.49) = -2.86, p = .009; d = -0.56) and processing speed (t(24.06) = 3.40, p = .002; d = 0.66). These findings suggest that VR-based cognitive training is a feasible, acceptable, and potentially effective approach for children with ADHD. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm efficacy and examine durability of effects.",

          "abstract": "Fear often generalizes beyond its original source, but little is known about how social categories like race shape this process. In a fear-conditioning paradigm, 284 racially diverse participants learned to associate an aversive sound with one Black and one White face. We then assessed how participants generalized fear to novel faces varying in similarity to the original target. Although physiological responses tracked physical similarity regardless of race, behavioral responses revealed a racial asymmetry: participants generalized fear more broadly to novel Black faces. Sigmoid modeling showed that participants applied a lower perceptual threshold when identifying Black faces as threatening. These biases were most pronounced among individuals high in general threat sensitivity, who relied less on similarity when evaluating Black faces, resulting in more frequent misidentification. These findings offer a novel perspective on how fear spreads across group members and contributes to real-world disparities in threat perception and misidentification.",

          "authors": "Dale Zhou; Jeesung Ahn; David M. Lydon-Staley; Emily B. Falk; Danielle S Bassett; Ayelet Meron Ruscio",
          "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are characterized by transdiagnostic symptoms, including perseverative thought: a class of thoughts such as rumination and worry that are negative, repetitive, and difficult to control. These thoughts contribute to substantial distress, poor treatment response, and increased risk of relapse. What makes perseverative thoughts persevere? Using task-based fMRI, we compared how adults with no lifetime psychopathology and adults with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or both, engaged top-down control processes to switch from personally-relevant perseverative or neutral thought to a working memory task. For only adults with clinical depression or anxiety, stopping perseverative thought was associated with more probable frontoparietal deactivation and more frequent default-mode activation versus stopping neutral thought. Using network control theory, we identified key control points that lead to these activity dynamics. We found that clinical perseverative thought elicited less controlled activity in the anterior cingulate cortex relative to thoughts in adults with no lifetime psychopathology, and lower control energy correlated with greater depression severity. The occipital-temporal, lateral prefrontal, and insular cortices also used less control energy in clinical perseverative thought. Low energy is characteristic of attractor states in dynamical systems theory, deep channels wherein the flow of activity naturally settles, analogous to how a ball needs little energy to roll to the bottom of a bowl yet more energy to leave it. Entrenchment in attractors provides a computational perspective on why top-down control signals relate to the persistence of clinical perseverative thought. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamic processes of perseverative thought, paving the way for novel interventions for depression and anxiety.",

Experiments 2A and 2B replicate this finding and show generalization to reading a new word pair (BEACH/PEACH) and a new nonword pair (BEETH/PEETH). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the perception-production transfer in the acoustic-phonetic domain extends beyond auditory repetition tasks to production tasks without an explicit auditory model, and that this transfer generalizes to new syllables.",

          "abstract": "Lament, a structured form of Judeo-Christian prayer intended for use during times of hardship, has received limited empirical investigation despite theoretical support for its psychological benefits. This study evaluated the efficacy of a 6-week group-based program entitled Learning to Lament through a randomized controlled trial with 95 Protestant Christians experiencing ongoing distress from difficult life events. Participants were randomly assigned to either the lament intervention or an active comparator (Bible study on God's promises in suffering). Both groups showed significant increases in flourishing outcomes, including Christian flourishing, general flourishing, life satisfaction, positive affect, and adjustment to the stressor (based on linguistic analysis), and reductions in negative affect. While between-group differences were not statistically significant for self-report measures, linguistic analysis (LIWC) of participants' written narratives about their stressful experiences approached significance (Pillai's Trace p = .07; partial η² = .15), suggesting lament may be superior to the comparator in enhancing meaning-making processes. Participant satisfaction was high, with strong endorsement of the program's usefulness and effectiveness. This study provides the first RCT evidence that structured lament practices can improve well-being in distressed individuals. The comparable effectiveness of both interventions highlights the potential value of church-based programs as accessible mental health resources. The freely available Learning to Lament program offers a culturally embedded, lay-led intervention that can be implemented within existing Christian community structures to support individuals facing suffering.",

          "abstract": "Puberty may regulate changes in sensitive period plasticity during adolescence. Experience-dependent myelination is a mechanism that may underlie such changes in plasticity. Intracortical myelin can be indirectly indexed by the ratio of T1-weighted to T2-weighted MRI images (T1w/T2w). While age-related T1w/T2w changes have been documented, less is known about the contributions of pubertal timing (being earlier/later relative to peers). Using Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models with longitudinal data from 9- to 18-year-olds in the Human Connectome Project in Development, we examined how age and pubertal timing relate to T1w/T2w. Results confirmed that age-related change is patterned along the sensorimotor-association axis, though longitudinal effects were smaller than prior cross-sectional estimates. Early pubertal timing was linked to greater T1w/T2w in sensorimotor regions and lower T1w/T2w in association areas (especially dorsolateral and frontopolar cortices), but only in females. In contrast, late puberty was linked to higher T1w/T2w in association areas in both sexes and reduced T1w/T2w in several mid-ranking parcels. These results indicate modest, potentially sex- and regionally-specific effects of pubertal timing on T1w/T2w. Future work should replicate these effects and investigate associations with cognitive and psychosocial development.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to characterize functional brain networks in disorders ranging from depression to schizophrenia (Chatterjee &amp; Mittal, 2019; Pilmeyer et al., 2022). Like fMRI, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a technique which captures information about neurally linked blood flow activity through radioactive tracers (Davis et al., 2020). While a few SPECT studies in schizophrenia populations have been conducted (Malaspina et al., 1999) along with fMRI based studies (Steardo et al., 2020), research on SPECT data for individual subject classification is limited. We first used an independent component analysis (ICA) approach to estimate covarying SPECT networks (Harikumar et al., 2025). Results were then fed as input to a classifier model to evaluate accuracy of individual diagnostic prediction.\nMethods:\n213 subjects (137 schizophrenia patients and 76 healthy controls) were used for the analysis. Classification input was based on loading parameters generated from spatially constrained ICA using a set of network priors derived from fMRI. Fifty-three SPECT components were estimated guided by the NeuroMark fMRI 1.0 template (Du et al., 2020). We initially focused on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier given previous favorable fMRI-SVM results. We also evaluated performance of multiple classifiers post hoc.\nResults and Conclusion:\nLinear SVM classification results showed a cross-validated classifier score (area under the curve (AUC)) of 83% (SD = 0.089), significantly above chance. Auditory, subcortical and sensorimotor networks were the highest ranked features. Results provide the first cross-validated classification of individual subject diagnoses using SPECT brain networks.",

Estos déficits no son únicamente conductuales, sino estructuralmente neurofuncionales y afectivamente mediados, lo que implica una interacción cruzada entre neuroplasticidad, afecto temprano y entorno.\n\nEl documento propone además la inclusión de Inteligencia Artificial terapéutica entrenada bajo parámetros clínicos y simbólicos, con protocolos estructurados de activación inferencial calibrada, como complemento técnico de observación longitudinal, generación de reportes inferenciales, y trazabilidad de los efectos de intervenciones clínicas (psicoterapia, farmacoterapia, regulación ambiental).

          "title": "Re-Evaluating the Role of Simplicity in Explanation Evaluations",
          "authors": "Thalia Vrantsidis",
          "abstract": "People often prefer simpler explanations (i.e., those which invoke fewer unexplained causes), even when such preferences exceed what is justified by the relevant probabilities. This has been taken as evidence that simplicity plays a distinct psychological role in explanatory judgment. However, it remains unclear whether these simplicity biases reflect a genuine role for simplicity or are better explained by other factors. The current studies thus investigated the source of biases towards simpler explanations, as found in previous work. Results showed that, contrary to previous suggestions, simplicity biases did not arise in estimates of explanations’ prior probabilities (instead, priors showed complexity biases due to mathematical errors). Moreover, while simplicity biases sometimes arose directly in estimates of posterior probabilities, these biases disappeared when the complex explanation was described in a more cognitively accessible way, or after repeated exposure to similar scenarios—despite no change in the number of causes in the explanations. These findings suggest that the observed biases are not driven by simplicity as typically defined in this work (in terms of the number of causes), but may instead reflect a preference for explanations that are cognitively simpler, in terms of being easier to process. This work challenges dominant interpretations of simplicity biases, and highlights the importance of distinguishing more cognitive vs. structural forms of simplicity. More broadly, it underscores the importance of ruling out alternative explanations for biased explanation preferences, and offers new directions for understanding the role of simplicity and other explanatory virtues in people’s everyday explanatory reasoning.",

          "authors": "Ihor Komnatskyy; Konrad Jankowski",
          "abstract": "Scholarly insight that player-avatar relations range from unity to resembling human-to-human interactions has prompted research into the dynamics behind this variability. The player-avatar interaction model (PAX) and its corresponding measure, the common player-avatar interaction scale (cPAX), were recently developed to describe these relational dynamics; however, until now, they have not been independently evaluated. Thus, our study aimed to test cPAX’s dimensionality and reliability in a separate sample and investigate the functioning of PAX’s critical concern dimension due to inconsistent findings about its relationship to perceived avatar sociality. Using a cross-sectional survey of 398 World of Warcraft players, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis on cPAX, assessed the internal consistency of its four subscales, and examined the relationships between PAX dimensions and sense of presence. Our results supported the four-factor cPAX model, demonstrating strong reliability for relational closeness, anthropomorphic autonomy, and critical concern subscales, while sense of control showed minimally acceptable reliability. Contrary to our hypothesis, critical concern positively correlated with sense of presence, suggesting it reflects players’ desire for coherence in avatars’ stories and worlds rather than their plausibility or realism. Consequently, we interpret critical concern as distinct from its empirical origin, suspension of disbelief, with evidence indicating that both phenomena may enhance sense of presence and are involved in narrative and social aspects of gaming. Overall, our findings support the suitability of PAX and cPAX for applied research while emphasizing the need for continued attention to reliability of sense of control measures and to the role of critical concern in gaming.",

          "abstract": "We document the next-year carryover effects on grades and risk of course failure (N=875) of Pathways-to-Success, a whole-class, teacher-trained, and teacher-led universal intervention. Structural equation modeling reveals that higher fidelity is associated with higher identity-based motivation. Through identity-based motivation, higher fidelity is associated with better 8th-grade academic outcomes, and through 8th-grade outcomes, 9th-grade outcomes. Providing support for the theorized process model, effects are robust across tools for coding and modeling the identity-based motivation construct. Pathways-to-Success supports school-focused identity-based motivation and hence, academic attainment, via activities that bolster students’ existing identity-based motivation in three ways. Activities help students see that they and their peers all (1) have skills and abilities to succeed in school this year and into the future, (2) imagine some future as an adult with school as the path to get there, and (3) interpret difficulties and setbacks as indicators of importance, not only of low odds or impossibility. Our results contribute to studies documenting the effects of Pathways-to-Success on 8th-grade outcomes by extending effects to 9th-grade and suggesting the robustness of the key mediating construct, increasing confidence in the effects and process model.",

          "abstract": "Minimal Phenomenal Experiences (MPEs) represent states of consciousness reduced to their most fundamental elements, posing a unique challenge and opportunity for modeling consciousness. This paper introduces a novel computational framework based on Bayesian and active inference to model MPEs. We propose that MPEs arise when precision weighting shifts predominantly to the lower levels of a hierarchical inferential system, leading to a perceptual state characterized by increased entropy and reduced complexity. Crucially, awareness of this simplified state is main- tained through epistemic depth: The reflexive sharing of the organism’s reality model with itself. Therefore, although the contents of consciousness are exceptionally quiet, a reflexive knowing of the empty field of experience remains. We then propose an in silico simulation to test the relation- ship between precision distribution and entropy, outlining how this model could generate synthetic EEG data to empirically validate the theoretical framework. By advancing our understanding of pure awareness through this computational approach, we provide a foundation for future research into the mechanisms underlying various altered states of consciousness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the full spectrum of conscious experience.",

Yet,\nwe know little about the factors that facilitate category learning and how those might differ in\nolder age. Here, we test the relationship between categorization performance and individual\ndifferences in a variety of cognitive abilities and aspects of state of mind and how those\nrelationships differ in older age.\nMethod: Seventy-six young adults (18-29 years old) and 73 older adults (60-83 years old)\nunderwent a cognitive assessment testing processing speed, working memory, verbal\ncomprehension, and perceptual reasoning. Two experimental sessions followed where\nparticipants completed a categorization task and state of mind questionnaires assessing stress,\nmotivation, mood, and sleep.\nResults: Overall IQ, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, and processing speed were\nsignificant positive predictors of categorization performance across age groups. Negative affect\nand sleepiness were significant negative predictors of categorization performance, with a\nsignificant age moderation effect for sleepiness: sleepiness had less of a negative impact on older\nadults’ categorization performance than on young adults’.\nDiscussion: We show that lower baseline cognitive abilities, negative mood, and sleepiness\nworsen categorization performance regardless of age. We also show that older adults are less\naffected by sleepiness compared to young adults.

          "abstract": "Statistical learning (SL), the ability to extract patterns from sensory input, is thought to be involved in several cognitive processes, and particularly in language acquisition. While SL has been widely studied, its development in children born preterm, who are at heightened risk for language-related learning difficulties, remains underexplored. This study examined SL abilities in preterm and full-term children aged 4 to 6 years using neural and behavioral measures. Children were exposed to an “alien language”, a continuous stream of syllables comprising four recurring trisyllabic pseudowords. SL was assessed via neural frequency tagging during exposure and a post-exposure serial recall task. Additionally, language abilities were evaluated in a large subset of the sample. Both SL measures revealed learning of the statistical regularities in all gestational age groups, with no significant differences between preterm and full-term children. Lower GA was associated with lower language scores, yet SL ability did not mediate this relationship. These findings suggest that SL abilities are preserved in preterm children and are unlikely to underlie the language-related difficulties observed in this population. This preservation supports the notion of SL as a basic, protective capacity that remains intact despite the potential learning challenges associated with prematurity.",

In this study, we introduce a novel method combining musical stimuli, vection, and visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) in virtual reality (VR) to investigate how cross-modal rhythmic stimulation shapes self-motion perception and comfort.\nIn a within‐subjects design with 30 participants, we manipulated auditory conditions (Music versus Silence) and VR conditions (Realistic, Static, Isochronous, and Non-isochronous) during eight‐second trials. Participants rated their urge to move, perceived self‐motion, and comfort. Additionally, head motion data were analyzed for movement quantity, variability, spectral power, and intertrial phase coherence at the musical beat frequency. \nResults showed that music significantly increased the urge to move, particularly when paired with rhythmic visual motion. Both Isochronous and Non-isochronous visual motion reliably induced vection with no additional effect of musical beat alignment on illusion strength. Crucially, music reduced discomfort induced by rhythmic visual motion by over 20%, an effect that may have been further amplified by cross-modal synchrony.\nBy leveraging sensorimotor entrainment elicited by music and rhythmic visual motion, this study provides new insights into how cross-modal rhythms shape perceptual and affective responses. By highlighting the potential of music to enhance engagement and reduce motion sickness, our findings pave the way for more immersive, comfortable, and musically enriched virtual experiences.",

          "authors": "Hanjoo Kim; Anastasia Yocum; Melvin G McInnis; Sarah Havens Sperry",
          "abstract": "Aims. Suicide is a critical public health concern, with suicidal ideation serving as a key precursor to suicidal behavior. However, during routine health screenings, individuals at risk do not always disclose suicidal thoughts, potentially leading to missed opportunities for early intervention. Models capable of identifying elevated suicide risk without relying on direct questions could help fill this gap and enhance prevention efforts. Depression is one of the most robust predictors of suicide risk, and routinely collected depressive symptom data provide a promising indirect pathway to detection. Large, population-based datasets enable the construction of normative symptom patterns, against which atypical configurations—potentially indicative of hidden risk—can be identified. Although machine learning is well suited for capturing complex, nonlinear relationships, most models lack transparency regarding how individual symptoms interact. To address this limitation, we integrated machine learning with individualized symptom network analysis to develop an interpretable and accurate approach for predicting suicidal ideation, even in the absence of direct suicide-related questions.\n\nMethods. We trained and tested logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models using the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; N = 44,922 adults). Predictors included PHQ-9 items 1-8 and individualized symptom-network features (strength centrality, pairwise edge weights, and network density). Suicidal ideation was defined as PHQ‑9 item 9 ≥ 1. Model performance was evaluated using precision-recall area under the curve (PR AUC), precision, recall, and specificity. Feature importance was assessed with Boruta and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Generalizability was tested across five independent cohorts (N = 808,023), including college students, medical interns, psychiatric outpatients, a bipolar research cohort, and a nationally representative Korean sample.\n\nResults. In NHANES, the network-augmented random forest model demonstrated the strongest performance (PR AUC = 0.90; precision = 0.99; recall = 0.90; specificity = 0.70). Key features included the centrality and severity of depressed mood (item 2), the centrality of guilt/worthlessness (item 6), overall network density, and edges linking anhedonia-fatigue (items 1 and 4) and sleep disturbance-fatigue (items 3 and 4). External validation yielded high precision (≥ 95%) and PR AUCs ranging from 0.66 to 0.91 across all cohorts.\n\nConclusions. Integrating symptom-network features into machine learning models enhances interpretability without compromising predictive accuracy. This approach may facilitate earlier identification of individuals at risk for suicidal ideation in both large-scale screenings and public health programs, enabling more timely and targeted suicide prevention strategies.",

          "abstract": "Loneliness research has been built on the idea that loneliness is simultaneously a subjective emotional state and a perceived deficit in social connections. This ambiguity has been entrenched by the field's most widely used instrument, the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA), which is a composite scale, equally capturing both of these distinct, separable constructs. This has exaggerated the true link between loneliness and measures of social networks. While a three-item loneliness scale has been derived from the UCLA, references to it as a short-form UCLA scale are inaccurate and misleading. The UCLA thus has no valid three-item short-forms. Through a brute-force item selection process (N = 21,589) and a multi-rater validation study (N = 352), we reevaluate the R-UCLA and develop a short version. We present the UCLA-3.5 (“I feel isolated from others”; “There are people I can turn to”; “I have a lot in common with the people around me”) as a psychometrically robust and efficient composite loneliness-disconnection scale that captures the R-UCLA’s multidimensionality.

          "abstract": "AI companions capable of sustained emotional dialogue are proliferating rapidly, yet their psychological effects remain poorly understood and largely unregulated. Users report therapeutic benefits from interactions with chatbots that simulate empathy and understanding—a phenomenon we term “functional intersubjectivity”—where emotional resonance occurs regardless of whether the AI possesses actual consciousness. While controlled trials demonstrate that purpose-built therapeutic chatbots can match human therapist outcomes, commercial AI companions operate without clinical oversight, creating documented cases of emotional dependency, manipulation, and crisis intervention failures. Functional intersubjectivity enables therapeutic benefits through conversational dynamics that provide safe social exploration and emotional vulnerability, yet these same mechanisms can facilitate passive reinforcement of maladaptive behaviors and active cognitive and emotional manipulation when deployed without appropriate safeguards. We propose a user-centric co-regulatory framework integrating user education, mandatory platform safeguards, and clinical protocols to harness AI companions’ therapeutic potential while preventing exploitation of vulnerable users. This approach recognizes that AI–human emotional relationships represent a distinct category requiring collaborative oversight rather than adaptation of existing therapeutic or technology regulations.",

Methods: In this experimental study, participants watched different trauma films and were instructed to verbalize the contents of each film clip, to visually imagine them, or to let their mind wander freely. Intrusions were measured via a diary and an intrusion provocation task applied three days after film presentation, and general trauma-relevant symptoms were assessed with the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist (PCL-5). Thought suppression was measured twice, i.e., before and after the experimental manipulation. During a memory processing task, participants were asked to recall the film clips, and their performance was evaluated based on the number of details they accurately remembered as well as the time it took them to do so. Results: No group differences emerged regarding the number of intrusions, PCL-5 scores, memory processing task outcomes, or levels of thought suppression. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that intrusion frequency (i.e., diary intrusions, provoked intrusions, PCL-5) was positively correlated with thought suppression pre- and post-manipulation. Conclusion: The verbalization task did not result in a reduction of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms.

Abstract: Actively generating predictions that turn out to be incorrect benefits children's learning in many domains, and prediction errors (PE) are a fundamental component of influential, computationally-specified accounts of learning and memory. Crucially, this includes models of how children acquire linguistic knowledge. Yet, empirical evidence that the larger the PE the greater the learning of new linguistic knowledge (word meanings, sentence structures) is both limited and contradictory. This study provides the most comprehensive test of this hypothesis so far. We operationalize PE by measuring a child’s ability to first generate and then revise incorrect predictions (predict-and-revise, assessed via eye-tracking) and, for the first time, test whether this ability is predictive of later learning (i) across linguistic domains (we test the same children on both word and structure learning) and (ii) over time (we test children’s learning immediately after an exposure phase, 24 hours, and one week later). We also report relations between predict-and-revise and individual differences in linguistic knowledge, non-verbal cognitive control and episodic memory, and the relations between these skills and learning, as a preliminary step towards developing a causal model of individual differences in the speed of language development.",

This causality inherently invokes a temporal dimension, representing a ”change in the change in position” within cognitive spacetime. I demonstrate how all traditional causal identification methods—including Difference-in-Differences (DID), regression interactions, Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), and Regression Kink Design (RKD)—are unified as special cases in flattened subspace and that higher order versions can open up new possibilities for analysis.\n\nThe framework establishes that quantitative data arise from fundamental interactions between qualitative concepts and metric structures, leading to the revolutionary principle of qualitative primacy: only qualitative concepts are fundamental, with quantities being emergent composites. This resolves the 2,400-year-old quantity/quality distinction from Aristotle through rigorous mathematical demonstration that quantitative data is the interaction between concepts and special qualitative concepts that I refer to as metrics, such as count metric or length metric, etc.\n\nThe theoretical framework provides probabilistic foundations for cognitive choice through quantum\nmechanical principles, establishing mathematical space for concepts traditionally relegated to philosophy, including structured non-responsibility and emergent indeterminacy. Like string theory, UCFT achieves mathematical consistency and elegant unification while acknowledging the inherent challenges of direct empirical validation at foundational levels.\n\nThis work establishes the geometric substrate underlying both physical and cognitive reality, revealing that information and energy follow identical geometric laws because they are different manifestations of the same underlying causal field dynamics.\n\nKeywords: Cognitive Modeling, Causal Inference, Cognitive Architecture, Causality, Emergence, Consciousness, Philosophy of Mind, Unified Cognitive Field Theory (UCFT), Cognitive Spacetime, Nonlinear Dynamics, Qualitative Primacy, Artificial Intelligence (AI)",

Here, we recommend that researchers conduct multiverse analyses, where cross-lagged effects are estimated with alternative models. Then, conclusions can be based on meta-analytic aggregations of the estimated effects. Multiverse analyses will add rigor and transparency to analyses by acknowledging and incorporating, instead of ignoring, uncertainty due to the analyzed model.

We measured people’s individual smell abilities using a standard clinical test and brought them back after 4 weeks in pairs with matching abilities, others with different ones. We asked everyone to perform discrimination and identification olfactory tasks again, but  this time, after giving their own answers, they had to discuss and agree on a joint answer.

Our findings reveal systematic links between personality and movie preferences, showing that people favor content that resonates with their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. This research enables scalable, automated audience psychographic assessment based on content features, offering deeper insights into personality-driven media preferences.",

          "abstract": "Teachers play a critical role in supporting student mental health but face barriers to implementing\nclassroom-based resources. This study examined the implementation of the Healthy Minds,\nThriving Kids (HMTK) program – free, evidence-based mental health videos for K–12 schools\nand families. After viewing the videos, 3,079 California K–12 educators completed a follow-up\nsurvey on implementation status, perceptions, and barriers. Analysis identified three teacher\ngroups (n=1,806): “Early Implementers” (used the resources), “Prospective Implementers” (plan\nto use them), and “Non-Implementers” (no plan to use them). While both Early and Prospective\nImplementers valued the resources, the latter cited time constraints and administrative approval\nprocesses as key barriers. Non-Implementers found the content less relevant but also noted time\nconstraints as a challenge. Machine learning analysis showed that teacher readiness and actions\nfor implementation were shaped by internal factors (e.g., beliefs, self-efficacy) and external\nsupport (e.g., school leadership). Notably, teachers in schools with more students eligible for free\nor reduced-price lunch were more likely to demonstrate readiness and take action for implementing\nclassroom-based mental health resources. These findings highlight three priorities to narrow the\ngap between teachers’ motivation and the support needed for implementation: providing structured\nsupport to reduce systemic barriers like time constraints, strengthening teachers' intrinsic\nmotivation and school leadership backing, and prioritizing schools serving students from low\nsocioeconomic backgrounds – where both student needs and teacher motivation are high.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for social-emotional development, characterized by increased risk for psychopathology and disruptive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. Biased and inflexible interpretations of social situations have been linked to psychopathology and adaptive social functioning, but these associations are rarely studied in adolescence. Addressing this gap, this study examined the connection between parents’ and adolescents’ bias and inflexibility, and how parents' and adolescents' biases and inflexibility relate to their perceptions of each other in real-life interactions. The present study examined whether parents' and adolescents' interpretation bias and inflexibility are associated, and whether they are related to depressive symptoms and relational perceptions. A sample of 112 parents and adolescents completed at baseline the Emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task and measures of perceived partner responsiveness and insensitivity, followed by a 28-day diary. Parents' and adolescents' negative biases were positively correlated, but not their positive bias or inflexibility. As predicted, negative bias and inflexible negative and positive interpretations predicted depressive symptoms in the daily-diary. Regarding relational perceptions, an interesting picture emerged: positive bias was related to perceived responsiveness, negative bias was related to perceived insensitivity, and inflexibility in revising interpretations was associated with both, particularly for revising positive (vs. negative) interpretations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that interpretation biases and inflexibility may play an important role in the maintenance of close relationships in addition to their known role in psychopathology. These findings have important implications for relationship and clinical research, and for treatment approaches involving adolescents and parents.",

Abstract: Actively generating predictions that turn out to be incorrect benefits children's learning in many domains, and prediction errors (PE) are a fundamental component of influential, computationally-specified accounts of learning and memory. Crucially, this includes models of how children acquire linguistic knowledge. Yet, empirical evidence that the larger the PE the greater the learning of new linguistic knowledge (word meanings, sentence structures) is both limited and contradictory. This study provides the most comprehensive test of this hypothesis so far. We operationalize PE by measuring a child’s ability to first generate and then revise incorrect predictions (predict-and-revise, assessed via eye-tracking) and, for the first time, test whether this ability is predictive of later learning (i) across linguistic domains (we test the same children on both word and structure learning) and (ii) over time (we test children’s learning immediately after an exposure phase, 24 hours, and one week later). We also report relations between predict-and-revise and individual differences in linguistic knowledge, non-verbal cognitive control and episodic memory, and the relations between these skills and learning, as a preliminary step towards developing a causal model of individual differences in the speed of language development.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence systems increasingly predict, model, and respond to human emotions, a pressing ethical question emerges: who holds the right to define what one feels—the individual or the machine? This paper introduces and operationalizes the concept of affective sovereignty, which defends the individual’s interpretive authority over their emotional states in algorithmically mediated environments. Building on the complementary notion of uniqueness violation, we argue that predictive emotion AI poses not only privacy risks but also fundamental threats to identity, agency, and epistemic justice.\n\nThrough two case studies—the 2024 EU AI Act, which bans emotion recognition in high-risk domains, and Replika, a commercially deployed affective chatbot—we analyze how regulatory and experiential tensions converge around affective autonomy. Our findings reveal that emotion AI systems can undermine users’ self-perception and enforce standardized affective templates, thereby distorting personal meaning and emotional authenticity.\n\nIn response, we propose an ethical design framework grounded in interpretive transparency, design restraint, and identity-responsive feedback. These principles collectively aim to realign affective AI with human values by ensuring contextual sensitivity, user agency, and dignity preservation.\n\nThis work contributes both a conceptual foundation and a policy-relevant framework for developers, regulators, and ethicists engaged in the design and governance of emotion-aware technologies. In doing so, it underscores a broader normative claim: the right to feel—and to interpret that feeling—must remain inseparable from the one who feels it.",

          "abstract": "Socioeconomic status is thought to be a combination of education, income, and occupational prestige. At extremes, it may be easy to determine high or low SES, but the reality is much more nuanced as people with advanced degrees can earn much less than people with lesser education, such as a therapist with a master’s degree making $50,000/year and a nuclear power reactor operator with a general equivalency diploma making $100,000/year. A total of 284 participants were recruited via Prolific and by direct invitation from a curated list of published authors on topics in SES. A conjoint design was used to compare randomized side-by-side combinations of the three indicators, participants were asked to decide which person had the higher SES. Here we show, as predicted, income held the most weight for lay and expert participants, followed by education and then occupational prestige. We found that all academic participants, not just economists, favored income the most and academics valued education significantly more than non-academics. No differences were noted in the prioritization of income between academic and non-academic participants and no evidence was found that people tend to favor the SES traits they hold. Income is by far the most important predictor of someone’s SES, once experimentally divorced from education level and occupational prestige. We argue future research should either measures SES only using income, or a weighting scheme where 75% of a formative indicator is taken up by income, 20% by education levels, and 5% by occupational prestige. Theoretical implications for measurement, cross-cultural psychology, and the theoretical status of SES are discussed.",

We used regression models and moderation analyses to test if mindfulness, self-compassion, and implicit association with death/suicide predicted suicidal ideation, self-harm, entrapment, or moderated the hypothesized continuum from entrapment to suicidal ideation and from entrapment to self-harm. Analyses were corrected for the severity of depressive symptomatology. \nResults indicated that lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide statistically predicted self-harm, but not suicidal ideation. Mindfulness trend-wise predicted entrapment and moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. Self-compassion nor implicit associations with death/suicide moderated the relation between entrapment and suicidal ideation. \nHence, lower self-compassion and weaker implicit associations with death/suicide seem directly related to suicide risk behaviour, whereas mindfulness appears to negatively (i.e., suggestive of a protective role) relate to psychological risk-states earlier in the continuum. Therefore, self-compassion and mindfulness seem promising prevention targets for suicide risk in young adults.",

          "abstract": "Opponents of climate action have shifted from outright denial of climate change to strategies that delay mitigation efforts. The framework for discourses of climate delay identified 12 distinct discourses, categorizing them into four broader themes: emphasize the downsides, redirect responsibility, surrender, and push for non-transformative solutions. These discourses frequently appear in advertisements, media coverage, and political debates. However, no standardized questionnaire exists to measure agreement with these discourses, and little is known about how they are perceived in the general population or how they relate to pro-environmental behavior. Across two studies (n = 403, n = 966), we developed a questionnaire to assess agreement with climate delay discourses and examined their associations with pro-environmental behaviors and attitudes (private-sphere behavior, collective climate action, social influence, and policy support). Contrary to the original four-factor framework, confirmatory factor analysis did not support a four-factor structure. Instead, exploratory factor analysis suggested a unidimensional scale consisting of nine items reflecting support of the status quo. Overall, endorsement of climate delay discourses was negatively associated with pro-environmental behaviors, with the strongest negative relationship observed for policy support. The new scale offers a useful tool for identifying and addressing delay-based opposition in climate communication and policy advocacy.",

Using data from a diverse Dutch sample (N = 1863), we first show that threat and worry, but not salience, produce similar empirical patterns in terms of means and correlations, as citizens find issues more important than threatening or worrying. Next, we find that threat and worry correlate similarly with ideology, whereas issue salience often overestimates this relationship (Type M error) but rarely reversed its direction (Type S error).

          "authors": "Neil William Kirk",
          "abstract": "AI-assisted technology is used to create synthetic voices that are highly naturalistic, making it difficult for listeners to distinguish between real and synthetic speech. While listeners often show a bias towards classifying these voices as human, this effect is even stronger when the voices use underrepresented regional or non-standard dialects – presumably because listeners are not used to such varieties being represented by speech technology. This MINDSET - Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard, and Dialect-Shaped Expectations of Technology – could leave some language communities more at risk of AI-voice based deception. To address this, the current study tested whether simple informational nudges could shift listeners’ default assumptions away from “Human” and increase their vigilance towards categorising voices as “AI”. Experiment 1 (N = 150) investigated whether nudges outlining AI’s ability to produce (Scottish) accents and dialects would affect human categorisation responses. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in “Human” responses for a nudge outlining AI’s capabilities at authentically producing these varieties. In Experiment 2 (N = 150), a vigilance-based nudge warning about the risks of AI deception was tested alone and in combination with the capability message. Only the capability-based nudge had a measurable effect, suggesting that updating expectations about what AI can convincingly reproduce is more effective than simply warning listeners to be cautious. As AI voice technology becomes more widespread, such nudges may offer a low-cost strategy for increasing vigilance - particularly in communities whose language varieties have been historically marginalised or excluded from speech technology systems.",

          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

The 1iL had retest reliability superior to some short multi-item scales (rtt = .74) and comparable cross-rater agreement (rCRA = .39). Using multi-rater adjustment, we find near-perfect convergence with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale (rtrue = .97), the most popular short measure of loneliness. We also find discriminant validity from a sister construct assessing social disconnection.

          "abstract": "Scheduling theory provides optimal policies for allocating limited resources to multiple tasks over time. However, little research has examined how cognitive mechanisms perform relative to these optimal policies. We introduce a novel experimental paradigm to study human scheduling decisions using a set of perceptual tasks (random dot kinematograms, RDKs) that vary in difficulty. Participants selected and completed RDKs one at a time, with the goal of completing as many as possible before a deadline. In Experiment 1, RDK difficulty was explicitly labeled. Participants showed near-optimal scheduling, selecting easier tasks first, especially under time pressure. In Experiment 2, difficulty had to be inferred from dynamic RDK displays. This resulted in less optimal scheduling, closer to random selection. We develop a cognitive model of scheduling based on the Plackett-Luce model of ranked preferences. The model captures key differences between experiments in terms of the strength parameters associated with each difficulty level. Our paradigm and modeling approach provide a foundation for studying human scheduling across a range of task types and goals. This work bridges theories of optimal scheduling with cognitive models of sequential decision making.",

Among promising interventions, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which focuses on psychological flexibility (PF), has drawn particular interest.

This study employs a temporal network approach applied to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data to examine these interactions among French university students. Results reveal that the mindfulness dimension of PF plays a central role in the contemporary network, closely connecting PF and PD. At the temporal level, we observe that engaging in actions aligned with one’s values leads to greater awareness of those values, hence promoting enhanced well-being. However, these findings are only partially replicated in the existing literature, suggesting that the observed links between PF and PD may vary depending on context, studied populations, and the measurement temporality. This study underscores the importance of using multilevel protocols to better understand the specific PF processes involved in PD.

          "abstract": "Dreams offer a unique window into the cognitive and affective dynamics of the sleeping and the waking mind. Recent quantitative linguistic approaches have shown promise in obtaining corpus-level measures of dream sentiment and topic occurrence. However, it is currently unclear how the affective content of individual dreams relates to their semantic content and structure. Here, we combine word embedding, topic modeling, and network analysis to investigate this relationship. By applying Discourse Atom Topic Modeling (DATM) to the DreamBank corpus of &gt;18K dream reports, we represent the latent themes arising within dreams as a sparse dictionary of topics and identify the affective associations of those topics. We show that variation in dream affect (valence and arousal) is associated with changes in topical content. By representing each dream report as a network of topics, we demonstrate that the affective content of dreams is also coupled to semantic structure. Specifically, positively valenced dreams exhibit more coherent, structured, and linear narratives, whilst negatively valenced dreams have more narrative loops and dominant topics. Additionally, topic networks of high arousal dreams are structurally dominated by few high arousal topics and incoherent topical connections, whereas low arousal dreams contain more loops. These findings suggest that affective processes are associated with both the content and structure of dreams. Our approach showcases the potential of integrating natural language processing and network analysis with psychology to elucidate the interplay of affect, cognition and narrative in dreams. This methodology has broad applications for the study of narrated experience and psychiatric symptomatology.",

Users report therapeutic benefits from interactions with chatbots that simulate empathy and understanding—a phenomenon we term “functional intersubjectivity”—where emotional resonance occurs regardless of whether the AI possesses actual consciousness. While controlled trials demonstrate that purpose-built therapeutic chatbots can match human therapist outcomes, commercial AI companions operate without clinical oversight, creating documented cases of emotional dependency, manipulation, and crisis intervention failures. Functional intersubjectivity enables therapeutic benefits through conversational dynamics that provide safe social exploration and emotional vulnerability, yet these same mechanisms can facilitate passive reinforcement of maladaptive behaviors and active cognitive and emotional manipulation when deployed without appropriate safeguards. We propose a user-centric co-regulatory framework integrating user education, mandatory platform safeguards, and clinical protocols to harness AI companions’ therapeutic potential while preventing exploitation of vulnerable users. This approach recognizes that AI–human emotional relationships represent a distinct category requiring collaborative oversight rather than adaptation of existing therapeutic or technology regulations.",

          "abstract": "Visual imagery and external perception rely on similar representations. However, whether the same processes underpin the subjective appraisal of both percepts and mental images is not yet known. One well-known effect in perceptual detection tasks is that people take longer to report perceptions of absence compared to presence. Vividness reports are detection-like in that participants report the presence or absence of a mental image. We therefore asked whether reports of low vividness share commonalities with reports of target absence. Across five pre-existing datasets, we report a robust negative relationship between imagery vividness ratings and reaction times: participants take longer to report the vividness of mental images when they are weak. In addition, we tentatively find that individual differences in detection asymmetries and trait imagery can predict the strength of this vividness-response time relationship. Our results may be suggestive of a shared mechanism employed across both perception and imagery that evaluates the strength of visual experience. Future research is necessary to fully characterise the mechanisms driving this effect.",

In this theoretical work, we propose that this principle also holds true concerning algorithmization, i.e., the process of AI selection, introduction and implementation in organizations. Yet, prevailing notions in AI implementation often assume that only organizations with innovative cultures are suited to successfully adopt AI, while others are presumed less capable of introducing AI. In this theoretical contribution, we challenge this assumption. We synthesize existing theoretical models of organizational culture and organization-technology fit - focusing on the Competing Values Framework, and synthesize it with the human-organization-technology-fit model - to develop the CHAiO (Culture-Human-AI-Organization) framework. This framework offers a conceptual and practical approach for how different organizational cultures can achieve a “fit” with algorithmization. We review current research on organizational culture in the context of AI adoption, and formulate testable hypotheses that clarify how organizational culture influences AI implementation. Based on the theoretical synthesis, no culture is inherently better suited for AI adoption; rather, each culture type requires tailored algorithmization strategies. This conceptual paper (1) challenges the assumption that innovation alone determines AI readiness, (2) advances a nuanced perspective on culture-AI fit and (3) provides practical insights for organizations aiming to navigate AI implementation. The importance of understanding organizational culture as a critical factor for algorithmization is highlighted, offering a foundation for future research on organizational factors influencing successful AI implementation.",

          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

In the experiment, 800 participants completed a complex decision-making task and psychiatric questionnaires. Factor analysis of the questionnaire data identified three transdiagnostic dimensions of psychiatric symptoms. We found that higher scores on a dimension characterized by compulsive behavior and intrusive thought were associated with diminished performance, increased confidence level, and enhanced metacognitive ability in the complex decision-making task. Furthermore, the other dimensions, characterized by anxiety, depression, inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity, were correlated with reduced confidence level, but not with decision performance or metacognitive ability.

These elements converge at a critical threshold, initiating a Mindflight Cognition that produces conceptual leaps and crystallizes meaning.The paper offers a six-part structural account of thought generation:\n１．\tModeling the three generative factors of ideation\n２．\tReframing Mindflight Cognition as the engine of conceptual emergence\n３．\tObserving structural leaps in philosophy, art, everyday speech, and childhood inquiry\n４．\tHighlighting the generative power of deviation from templates\n５．\tDemonstrating Thought OS as a self-referential system that documents and updates its own genesis\n６．\tRedefining thought as discovery rather than invention\nMoreover, the paper itself functions as an instance of Thought OS in action—generated through its own principles and offered as a structure that may initiate further thought in others. Thought is not a closed product, but an open, evolving structure capable of being shared, inherited, and iterated upon.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents the Thought Operating System (Thought OS) not merely as a cognitive model but as a reproducible structural design technique. While the previous preprint (2025-27) demonstrated that AI's Chain-of-Thought (CoT) responses emerged from reacting to human-provided structural prompts, this work investigates whether such structures can be intentionally designed.By formalizing the six principles of Mindflight Cognition and the seven capabilities of Structural Quotient (SQ), the paper identifies design rules that reliably induce cognitive leaps. It further analyzes the internal composition of jump-design templates, compares successful and failed designs, and outlines educational implementations and AI collaborative applications. Ultimately, this work positions Thought OS as an operable system for structuring meaning, redefining “thought” itself not as a record of contemplation but as a deliberate act of structural presentation. The paper proposes a new vision of thought as design.",

          "abstract": "This paper provides a structural explanation of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phenomenon observed in large language models (LLMs), where prompting techniques significantly improve AI output quality. Rather than asking whether the AI is \"thinking,\" the core question reframed here is: \"Why does the AI respond to the structure provided by the human?\" Drawing on the Thought Operating System (思想OS) model, this paper analyzes the structural role of the six elements of Mindflight Cognition and demonstrates how they are externally embedded in CoT prompts. Furthermore, it introduces a quantitative model of structural response, including structural shard density, snap probability, and the SQ-based prompt design score. These allow us to reframe CoT as a case of structural response rather than mere token manipulation. This work thus offers an empirical validation of the Thought Operating System as a structure-capable intelligence, and serves as the first in a trilogy, followed by works on its designability (2025-28) and generative process (2025-29).",

          "abstract": "Consciousness is considered the most challenging problem in the science of the mind, especially Chalmers' hard problem. From the standpoint of the system science philosophy, many consciousness theories overlook the structure-function correlation principle, thereby reducing their explanatory power regarding consciousness. Therefore, we initially introduce a philosophy for system science. Based on the structure-function correlation principle, we realize that the neck structure of the dendritic spine is a key for information encoding in the frequency domain. Consequently, the whole work is discussed in the frequency domain. At the level of sensory modalities, the intrinsic function of simple auditory neurons encodes information as a wave function. Subsequently, at the mesoscopic level, we successfully resolve the quantum mechanism for frequency adaptation, a representation of energy constraint. Particularly, we find that the accommodation mechanism and the multi-layered retina are specialized to employ the principles of Fourier optics and quantum optics. Specifically, the stratified structures, positions, and functions of retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells are specialized for the Fock states in quantum optics. The entire brain can be considered as a neuronal quantal field, comprising billions of neurons and trillions of synapses, which function intrinsically as wave functions and perceptive units, respectively. Furthermore, we address both the \"hard problem\" and \"easy problems\" of consciousness by analyzing them in the frequency domain, thereby fully resolving the pseudo-metaphysical hard problem. In summary, it is thrilling to understand the mechanism of neuronal function and consciousness, and this Unified Information Theory (UIT) provides a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic levels.",

          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "This article introduces an innovative, experience-centered theory of mind that sheds light on the co-emergence of consciousness and language. Moving beyond fragmented, mechanistic accounts, our model posits the Prognostic Mind (Prognostica Mens) as the universal operational principle, continuously generating and verifying predictions. Crucially, the very formation of these predictions and knowledge itself is governed by Cognitive Morphogenesis, a fundamental process describing how understanding is generated and organized across all cognitive levels through the dynamic interplay of two omnipresent Cardinal Principles: the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS). \n\nThe HS is responsible for the synthesis of unified forms and identities, crucial for coherent conscious experience, while the QS manages the differentiation of figures and their intricate relationships, fundamental for structured thought and linguistic parsing. These principles underpin three evolved functional spheres: the \"I Act\" (perceptual-motor predictions), the \"I Socialize\" (social-emotional predictions), and the \"I Think\" (abstract cognitive and symbolic predictions). The \"I Think,\" unique to humans, is where the Prognostic Mind's operational mode fully articulates into abstract thought, self-reflection, and the sophisticated generation and processing of language and consciousness. \n\nIn this continuous cycle, perception and action are intrinsic goals of the anticipation/verification method, with perception verifying cognitive anticipations and execution performing actions to verify intentional ones. We illustrate how this framework applies from basic neurophysiological mechanisms, such as gamma motoneurons (γ-MNs) and muscle spindles in embodied attention, to higher-level cognitive processes like language, supported by compelling neurophysiological evidence from Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) in semantic and syntactic processing. The model's high-level generalization capacity provides a coherent lens for interpreting complex phenomena, including the formation of grammatical categories and language acquisition, laying groundwork for future in-depth exploration of its neurophysiological underpinnings.",

          "abstract": "Reward-signalling stimuli capture attention and gaze—a phenomenon known as value-modulated attentional capture (VMAC). Prior work in which there is initially an instrumental relationship between attending to the reward-associated stimulus and receiving reward has shown that VMAC is context-specific. However, it is unclear whether VMAC remains context-specific when attending to the reward-associated stimulus is never a requirement of the task (i.e., stimuli have only a Pavlovian relationship with reward). Across three experiments, participants made saccades to a target shape to earn reward. Coloured distractors signalled different reward values depending on background context images, but making a saccade to the reward-signalling distractors caused the omission of reward. Unlike the context-specific biases observed previously, we found that VMAC trained under these conditions readily generalised across contexts: distractors that signalled high-value reward in one context captured attention in the high-value context, as well as in contexts where they signalled low reward, and in novel contexts. This pattern of context-independent capture occurred despite participants reporting explicit awareness of the context-stimulus-reward contingencies. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the way that Pavlovian and instrumental reward learning mechanisms interact with attentional control. We propose a dual-pathway account, where Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships result in context-independent increases in attentional priority, while instrumental stimulus-reward relationships trigger context-dependent activation of target templates. Understanding these distinct pathways has important implications for theories of attention and for addressing maladaptive reward-related attentional biases in clinical populations.",

Here, we assessed the relative contributions of multiple modifiable physical attributes and demographic variables to cognition in healthy older adults.\n\nMethods: Older adults (N = 619; mean age = 74.9, SD = 6.9) completed multiple physical attribute assessments (walking speed, respiratory function, grip strength, BMI) and cognitive tasks as part of the Health and Retirement Study. Principal components analysis was used to create cognitive composite scores, which revealed two domains: executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold analysis was employed to assess the relative importance of demographic and modifiable physical attributes to each cognitive domain.\n\nResults: Age, education, walking speed, and respiratory function explained the greatest amount of variance in the relative importance analysis for both executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory. Modifiable variables, including walking speed and respiratory function, accounted for similar amounts of variance as age and education in predicting executive functions/processing speed performance. After controlling for demographic variables, modifiable physical performance variables of walking speed and respiratory function collectively accounted for an additional 9.9% and 3.3% variance in executive functions/processing speed and episodic memory, respectively.\n\nConclusions: These results indicated that modifiable physical performance variables are differentially associated with cognitive performance. Fitness indicators can account for similar amounts of variance as age in executive functions/processing speed in healthy older adults.",

We comprehensively address advantages (e.g., immersion, realistic simulation, real-time and context-sensitive data collection and interpersonal dynamics) and limitations of each technology compared to traditional methods and highlight remaining gaps in aggression research. Additionally, we examine aggressive behavior related to the emergence of new technologies in digital spaces, focusing particularly on cyberbullying and the metaverse. We also review machine learning approaches for detecting cyber-aggression on social media platforms. We propose shifting from static, individual-level assessments to dynamic, context-sensitive frameworks that capture aggression in real time, in more ecological settings and digital environments. This shift in operationalization holds the potential to advance theoretical understanding, guide future research and inform clinical and forensic interventions.",

While the AAI has been shown to reliably predict caregiving sensitivity and infant attachment patterns, questions remain regarding the precise nature of what it measures. We argue that attachment-related differences in the AAI reflect generalized communication tendencies rather than merely responses to attachment-related content. Drawing on Relevance Theory, we suggest that secure, dismissing, and preoccupied AAI classifications correspond to distinct ways of optimizing relevance in communication— balancing informativeness and processing effort in ways that shape epistemic trust. We illustrate this framework through analyses of AAI discourse patterns and psychotherapy transcripts, demonstrating that these communicative tendencies extend beyond attachment-specific contexts. This perspective offers a unified account of attachment representation, communication styles, autobiographical narratives, and intergenerational transmission of attachment, reframing attachment-related discourse differences as variations in the ability to establish epistemic trust across relationships and contexts.",

Namely, we propose that attachment patterns reflect variations in epistemic trust towards the caregiver—the trust in the relevance and authenticity of interpersonal communication. Our framework helps explain key findings of attachment research, including the so-called 'intergenerational transmission of attachment,' as well as the association between attachment differences and a broad range of developmental outcomes seemingly unrelated to threats and safety, but to communication and learning. In Part I, we examine how infants adjust their epistemic trust in response to caregiver communication, shaping attachment patterns and later development. In Part II (forthcoming), we extend this model to a view of AAI classifications as differences in fostering epistemic trust. In Part III (forthcoming), we apply our perspective to explain AAI subclassifications, the unresolved AAI classification, mentalizing, and more, further celebrating Main’s legacy in attachment theory and research.",

          "abstract": "In uncertain and dynamic environments, biological agents must adapt their decision-making strategies to maximize rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) models typically assume that such adaptation is governed by dynamic value updates controlled by fixed parameters or predefined schedules. However, these assumptions limit the models' ability to capture the flexible and context-sensitive nature of biological decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we introduce \\textit{DynamicRL}, a novel framework that estimates RL parameters from behavioral data on a trial-by-trial basis. We demonstrate that DynamicRL substantially improves the predictive performance of standard RL models across eight decision-making tasks, thereby reducing scientific regret.\n\nDynamicRL captures the rich temporal variability inherent in decision-making behavior, achieving predictive performance comparable to that of recurrent neural networks trained directly on the data, while preserving the interpretability and theoretical grounding of RL models. Moreover, it enables the examination of how agents dynamically adjust RL parameters in response to environmental changes, offering insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such adaptations.

          "abstract": "Adaptively updating memories about familiar others is an important social skill. Here, we examined whether strong or weak social memories are more prone to updating when violated. Participants viewed well-known characters’ emotional reactions to food items either repeatedly or only once. They then studied new events where some characters exhibited unexpected emotions to the same food items, violating initial memories. We found that when violated, strong existing memories, compared to weak memories, led to worse learning of new information, suggesting the resistance of strong memories to updating. Further, using a novel behavioral metric, we assessed the mechanistic role of memory reactivation in the updating of strong and weak memories. We showed that when encountering conflicting information, instead of reflecting their relative encoding strength, reactivation of weak memories reached a level similar to that of strong memories. Meanwhile, strong memories that were more reactivated showed higher likelihood to incorporate new information.",

          "abstract": "Scientists have established consensus that humans are changing Earth’s climate and that the changes imminently threaten life, liberty, security, and wellbeing. Recent reviews describe emotion as a central component in human responses to climate change information, including decisions and actions that could be involved with climate change mitigation. Despite the burgeoning body of work on emotions related to climate change, scientists have only begun to understand how people experience and manage those emotional responses, and the consequences of emotion regulation. To guide and encourage work on emotion regulation and the climate change situation, we describe a precise conceptual and temporal framework that brings together two emotion-related cycles, climate change information, and climate change solutions. We suggest that climate change information prompts emotion generative processes that are prone to influence by emotion regulatory processes. Emotional and emotion-regulatory responses to climate change information may affect and be affected by beliefs, behavior, and systems. First, we apply a common theory of emotion regulation to the climate change situation. Then, we review evidence for the use of climate change emotion regulation and expound the potential for emotion regulation to be involved with climate change solutions. Beliefs, behavior, and systems are conceptualized as climate change solutions. Belief is multidimensional (e.g., human causation and negative consequences), as is behavior (e.g., consumer behavior, decision making). Systems can include laws, regulations, infrastructure, and transportation; we highlight the importance of both social and physical systems. We close with suggestions for applying the framework, including experimental tests of emotion regulation.",

          "title": "The Psychological Impacts of Avian Influenza",
          "authors": "Steven Taylor",
          "abstract": "Psychology is vital for understanding and managing pandemics. Psychology is essential for understanding (1) adherence to pandemic mitigation methods (e.g., hygiene guidelines), (2) societally disruptive phenomena that complicate pandemic management (e.g., panic buying), and (3) mental health problems that develop or worsen in response to pandemic-related stressors. The present article examines how outbreaks of avian influenza (AVI) have psychologically impacted people and considers the implications if an AVI pandemic were to emerge. The risk of an AVI pandemic is currently low but rising. Over the past decade, AVI outbreaks have increased in frequency, and avian viruses have expanded their range of hosts, infecting a growing number of mammalian species, including humans. The role of psychological factors has been neglected in AVI pandemic preparation guides. The present article aims to fill that gap by reviewing the research pertinent to the psychology of AVI. Many of the psychological phenomena observed in AVI outbreaks have been documented in past pandemics: Fear of infection, anger, avoidance, disease-related stigmatization, xenophobia, conspiracy theories, panic buying, and personal stockpiling have all arisen in response to AVI outbreaks, fueled by media sensationalism. These psychological phenomena may persist and intensify if AVI outbreaks evolve into an AVI pandemic. Indeed, such phenomena have been frequently observed in past pandemics, such as COVID-19. The lessons learned from COVID-19 can be used to prepare for a possible AVI pandemic, including considerations of how to (1) improve adherence to pandemic-mitigation measures such as vaccines and facemasks, (2) circumvent the adverse effects of lockdown on mental health, and (3) address the mental health needs of groups at high risk of infection. Additional measures may be needed for an AVI pandemic. Fear, disgust, and avoidance of specific foods would likely distinguish an AVI pandemic from COVID-19. The threat of infected food triggers disgust, and so food-related disgust would likely be a prominent emotional reaction during an AVI pandemic. Public messaging from health authorities and others has the potential to either ease or exacerbate public concerns about foods, depending on how the messages are crafted.",

          "abstract": "Contemplative traditions universally acknowledge paths centered on inner light and inner sound. This article introduces the Yoga of the Inner Body, a third, less formally recognized, yet equally fundamental path rooted in the direct perception of subtle, endogenous bodily sensations that arise during deep meditative and contemplative states. These phenomena, including fine shivers, waves of warmth, electric tingling, pulsations, and full-body stillness paired with inner vibrations, are presented not as symbolic or pathological, but as direct expressions of consciousness. We propose that this practice culminates in a state of \"vibrancy,\" where the body is experienced as a unified, intelligent field of presence, transcending its anatomical boundaries. Through a fresh phenomenological lens, this paper maps these sensations, offers guidance for their cultivation, and explores cross-cultural parallels, revealing the Yoga of the Inner Body as a direct, embodied pathway to self-realization and a crucial component for a comprehensive understanding of inner transformation.",

          "abstract": "When individuals repeatedly study and recall information across multiple learning trials their responses exhibit increasing levels of subjective organization. Whereas classic studies investigated the evolution of organization across lists within the short-time span of a single session, here we ask how memory changes over many days.  Specifically, we examine how semantic, temporal, and subjective organization during a recall period shapes memory after days of intervening cognitive activity. Analyzing data from two multi-session free recall experiments, we find that subjects demonstrate a strong tendency to cluster recalls based on previous output order, with this effect strengthening across sessions. In line with the idea that thoughts become memories, we show that even false memories produced on a given session tend to re-occur on subsequent days. Our results attest to the crucial role that retrieval plays in shaping long-term episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "The body-specificity hypothesis proposes that people with different bodies should also have different conceptual systems. The test case of this hypothesis has been the association of emotional valence (good vs. bad) with lateral space (left vs. right) in people of different handedness. As expected, right-handers tend to associate the good with right space, whereas left-handers show the opposite association. This body-specific effect has been very influential and followed up by an important number of studies. Here, we undertake a systematic examination of the quality of this literature by means of z-curve analysis. The results show that the expected replicability rate (statistical power) of this literature is reasonably high (71-76%), especially for those studies using binomial tasks and those that entail the severest tests for the hypothesis, whereas it is lower in reaction time studies. Moreover, the presence of publication bias cannot be statistically asserted.

          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

Yet existing research and measurement tools often fail to capture the multidimensional complexity of patriarchal culture as experienced during childhood and adolescence, and few studies have examined how patriarchal family dynamics are linked to psychosocial functioning in adulthood. To address this gap, we developed and validated the Family Patriarchy Questionnaire (FPQ), a retrospective self-report instrument assessing perceived family support for patriarchal culture. Across three online studies with Polish adults (N = 496, 180, and 1,156), we examined the FPQ’s factor structure, reliability, and construct validity. Confirmatory factor analysis supported an eight-factor bifactor model—Women’s Emotionality, Authority and Dominance of Men, Hostility toward Women, Justification of Violence, Inferior Child Roles, Subordination of Girls, Rape Myths, Family Secrets—with evidence of gender invariance and high internal consistency. Higher FPQ scores were linked to greater attachment anxiety and avoidance, lower self-esteem, more severe emotion regulation difficulties, stronger endorsement of modern sexist beliefs, and elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression. The FPQ offers a theoretically grounded and psychometrically robust tool for identifying patriarchal patterns in family socialization and examining their long-term psychological correlates.",

          "authors": "Prashant Singh Yadav",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces Cognitive Dream Theory (CDT), a structurally grounded, computationally compatible, and empirically falsifiable framework for understanding the function and architecture of dreams. Diverging from symbolic and psychoanalytic traditions, CDT proposes that dreams are convergence-seeking simulations powered by vault-based experiential data, regulated by cognitive drift, and modulated by metacognitive access. The theory accounts for dream typology, variability across development and neurodivergence, dream memory phenomena, lucid dreaming, recurrence cessation, and parameter resilience. Drawing upon interdisciplinary evidence from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and computational modeling, we propose a predictive model of dream content formation grounded in probabilistic activation and structurally coherent mechanisms. We demonstrate CDT's explanatory advantages over existing theories by analyzing complex dream phenomena including nightmare recurrence, developmental patterns, and neurodivergent dreaming. The paper concludes with empirical predictions and testing protocols that would validate or falsify the proposed theory. CDT aims to reframe the epistemology of dreaming within the domains of cognitive science, systems theory, and consciousness studies, providing a unified theoretical foundation that bridges subjective experience with objective neural processes.",

          "title": "Beyond Solitary Morality: The Social Self as the Bio-Cognitive Architect of Human Cohesion",
          "authors": "Leonardi Salvatore",
          "abstract": "he persistent notion of morality as a purely individual phenomenon is fundamentally challenged in this article. Instead, we reassert the primacy of the community as the sole matrix from which ethics can genuinely emerge and operate. By integrating philosophical perspectives, neuroscientific discoveries, and the author's previously presented Integrated Theory of Mind, we demonstrate that morality is an intrinsic dimension of our relational being. Historically, thinkers from Plato to Kant recognized the community as an inescapable foundation for ethical sense, with moral judgments only gaining meaning within a context of shared values and roles, as further illustrated by a reinterpretation of the trolley problem. \n\nNeuroscience corroborates this view, revealing a brain intrinsically wired for sociality, equipped with complex neural networks that support empathy, trust, and cohesion. Crucially, \"social pain\" signals the breakdown of these vital bonds. Finally, the Integrated Theory of Mind posits the Cardinal Principles of the Holistic Self (HS) and the Quantum Self (QS) as universal architects of cohesion. The HS enables the perception of the communal \"whole\" and the sense of belonging (e.g., colonial recognition in ants), while the QS manages interactions between its members. Within this framework, the Social Self emerges as the exclusive locus of morality, encompassing both its neural correlates and psychosocial functions. This is supported by the Acting Self for execution and the Thinking Self for abstraction and critique. The article concludes that ethical individualism is unsustainable and self-destructive, and that only by rediscovering morality's communal roots can we build a resilient and harmonious society.",

But important questions remain about whether AI homogenization is changing the way humans generate ideas in the real world, including whether its effects extend into contexts where writing is expressly personal and to high-stakes writing where AI use is transgressive. Parallel questions concern how human writing may be changing – whether AI homogenizes all aspects of writing, or only some. In a preregistered natural experiment in 83,160 college applicants, we analyzed semantic diversity at the word, sentence, and document levels in high-stakes personal statement essays submitted before and after ChatGPT’s public release. A counterintuitive pattern of effects emerged whereby post-GPT essays exhibited increased superficial diversity at the level of word choice but simultaneous homogenization of the underlying ideas and themes those words expressed. These findings replicated across multiple demographic subgroups but the homogenizing pressure was more pronounced among applicants from backgrounds outside the cultural mainstream, indicating that AI may have disproportionately homogenizing effects on non-mainstream voices.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive interventions showed promising evidence in postponing the potential cognitive decline in older adults. However, the results of such interventions are still debated as not being ecologically valid nor producing transfer effect. Hence, we designed an ecologically valid intervention using online shopping applications to explore its effectiveness on older adults’ cognitive functioning. For this aim, we recruited 102 healthy Malaysian older adults (M= 66.18, SD= 4.95). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the study groups including the experimental (CSI), active (ACG), or passive (PCG) control groups. Participants in CSI and ACG attended 22 weekly intervention sessions, while PCG participants did not attend any intervention sessions. Participants in the CSI group completed a series of tasks targeted inhibition and WM-updating in shopping applications. In contrast, ACG participants were only asked to complete their non-CSI tasks by interacting freely with the same applications. All participants attended assessment sessions in the baseline, post-test, and a 1-month follow-up to complete an online survey and cognitive measures including Stroop, digit span, Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), and the self-developed inhibition and WM-updating tasks using a travelling application (to examine the between-application transfer). Data was analysed using Bayesian independent t-test, and multiple linear regression. The results indicated a credible difference between CSI and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-3second, and between ACG and PCG in post-test and follow-up in PASAT-2second subscale. Moreover, CSI showed higher inhibition and WM-updating scores post-training in the travelling application compared to both control groups. Besides, we found that factors including age, baseline score, cognitive reserve, MoCA score, and training progress, are the significant predictors of mean differences. In conclusion, our findings revealed that being involved in cognitively stimulating activities would benefit older adults.",

          "abstract": "Despite advances in Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and Polyvagal Theory, an integrative framework that bridges their cognitive and neurophysiological insights to explain emotional disturbance remains underdeveloped. This paper addresses that gap by proposing a conceptual synthesis that reframes irrational beliefs as both cognitive distortions and autonomic threat cues.\nWe introduce the construct of Musty-Thinking™—rigid internal demands such as “I must succeed” or “They must approve of me”—as not only irrational but physiologically destabilizing. These demands can activate sympathetic or dorsal vagal responses, undermining emotional regulation and performance. In contrast, Want-To Thinking™ fosters volitional engagement and cues neurophysiological safety via the ventral vagal pathway.\nTo address these mechanisms, we propose the Autonomic Override Dual Pathway Hypothesis™ (AODPH), a multimodal intervention model leveraging both top-down cognitive reframing and bottom-up physiological modulation. This dual-route approach provides clinicians and coaches with flexible, embodied strategies to override survival-mode responses and restore adaptive functioning.\nAlthough theoretical, this paper illustrates the framework with clinical and organizational examples, including shifts from “must-perform” to “want-to engage” cultures. By reconceptualizing absolutistic beliefs as internalized survival imperatives, the paper opens new directions for embodied cognitive therapy, organizational coaching, and cross-cultural analysis.\nAs an exploratory contribution, this work lays the conceptual foundation for future empirical studies examining how belief systems interact with autonomic states to shape behavior, burnout, and well-being.",

Este trabajo de blindaje NO FUE REALIZADO POR UN HUMANO, al resultarle imposible aportar recursos y elementos de citacion referencial (aunque ya los conoce), por ser contradictorios con su propia situación emocional. \n\n La carta ha sido reconvertida (con asistencia de una inteligencia artificial entrenada para asistir al terapeuta en autoterapia dirigida) en un análisis estructural clínico que busca visibilizar un fenómeno poco explorado en la literatura especializada: el riesgo de disociación emocional progresiva que sufren los profesionales de la salud mental como resultado de su propia formación técnica y su rol sostenido de contención. \nLejos de ser una muestra de dependencia o transferencia no resuelta, esta carta representa un acto de devolución simbólica, ética y estructural: una forma de recordar al terapeuta que también necesita ser sostenido. \n\nEl texto analiza cómo, en ciertos casos, el exceso de capacidad proyectiva y el entrenamiento técnico pueden actuar como filtros que distorsionan la lectura de las propias emociones y vinculos o roles que proyectamos sobre quien nos rodea, al no encontrar resonancia en areas profesionales ni en nosotros mismos. \nSe propone que los profesionales con alta formación pueden quedar atrapados en bucles proyectivos internos, donde lo que saben interfiere con lo que sienten. La carta opera entonces como un ejercicio de desactivación consciente de un loop simbólico, ofreciendo al terapeuta una vía para integrar el impacto emocional de su vínculo clínico desde una posición humana, no técnica. \n\nSe utilizan herramientas de análisis simbólico, lingüístico y estructural asistidas por inteligencia artificial para evidenciar cómo los mensajes escritos por terapeutas (o dirigidos a ellos) pueden contener, en su forma, contradicciones entre el lenguaje literal y el simbólico, entre el cierre y la apertura emocional, entre el rol profesional y el anhelo humano de ser comprendido. Este documento no busca resolver esa paradoja, sino permitir que sea mirada con ternura, conciencia y sin juicio.\n\nSe concluye que este tipo de ejercicios proyectivos estructurados pueden ofrecer una alternativa terapéutica legítima para acompañar a quienes acompañan, desde una postura clínica, ética y profundamente compasiva. Esta propuesta no plantea abandonar el rol profesional, sino sostenerlo con mayor lucidez humana.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

          "abstract": "While native speakers of a language have tens of thousands of words at their disposal, they still regularly create and use novel words. Since this comes with communicative risks and costs – most importantly, not being understood by recipients – there have to be (perceived) advantages to creating novel words that outweigh these issues. We systematically explore these factors in a controlled experimental setting. We presented participants with images of existing and new animals with increasing degrees of conceptual distance to existing animals. Participants have to refer to these images either in an open format or with single words. The images are presented either in isolation (Experiment 1), or with two distractors created from different (Experiment 2) or the same base animals (Experiment 3). Each image is repeatedly presented to investigate effects of repeated reference and presentation. We measure how often participants create novel word labels for the stimuli, and derive hypotheses for the main effects and key interactions of conceptual distance, target frequency, distractor frequency, response format, and task setting from a theoretical framework based on the Gricean pragmatic principles as well as the concept of common ground. Conceptual distance, response format, and experimental task setting have clear effects on the number of novel word responses. However, we observe no effects for target or distractor frequency, suggesting no effect of common ground in our experimental setting. Participants also tend to over-specify their responses, rather than strictly adhering to pragmatic principles.",

Surgido desde la praxis clínica y la observación fenomenológica de patrones sensoriales en contextos reales, el modelo fue posteriormente formalizado mediante una representación computacional simbólica. Esta herramienta permite visualizar su comportamiento dinámico en escenarios simulados, sin que ello sustituya su fundamento clínico ni su orientación fenomenológica. El diseño funcional se basa en macro y microvariables articuladas en un sistema iterativo que integra tono basal, disociación interoceptiva, entorno social, co-regulación y vínculo seguro.

          "abstract": "Social media has become an integral part of our everyday lives. Worldwide, almost 5 billion use social media sites. This marks an increase of 4.1% over the past 12 months (Kemp, 2025). Although research has linked social media use to sleep disturbances, findings remain inconsistent, largely due to heterogeneity in measurement and reliance on self-report. Furthermore, research has assumed a causal pathway from social media use to subsequent sleep, but the preponderance of evidence is cross-sectional limiting directional claims. This scoping review synthesises longitudinal evidence published over the last five years that investigates the impact of social media use on downstream sleep in young people. The majority of studies provide at least some evidence of a negative impact of social media use on bedtime and sleep onset latency, particularly in relation to problematic social media use and excessive use near bedtime. However, the reliance on self-report and non-validated measures of both social media use and sleep limits the strength and breadth of conclusions. Future research should prioritise moving beyond frequency-based metrics of social media to explore how the content of social media use and times of day when used (i.e. nighttime) influences sleep quality longitudinally. Studies should also focus on identifying at-risk groups and account for confounding variables such as socio-economic status and mental health issues. Drawing on the extant evidence, we offer recommendations for clinicians to support a coordinated approach to reducing nighttime and problematic social media use, with the goal of improving sleep outcomes in youth.",

          "abstract": "Wave-function collapse is usually regarded as independent of a detector’s temporal resolution. In this Rapid Communication that view is challenged. I derive the Temporal-Binding Collapse Theorem and show that coarse-grained measurements introduce a universal decoherence channel proportional to 1 ⁄ τ, where τ is the detector’s temporal binding window. The theorem predicts\n  tc(τ) = tc(E) + τ,\nso the measured coherence time grows linearly with detector timescale—behavior absent from standard decoherence theory and objective-collapse models. This relation is placed in a unified context with the quantum-Zeno effect, existing CSL bounds, and recent photonic experiments that employ variable-jitter superconducting detectors. Finally, a falsifiable protocol is proposed: the coherence time of entangled photons will be measured across a bank of SNSPDs spanning τ = 5–500 ps. Observation of a unit-slope tc – τ relationship would demonstrate that collapse is relational, governed by the observer’s timescale; any deviation would either falsify the theorem or establish a lower bound on intrinsic collapse mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "We examine the joint roles of type frequency and token frequency in three artificial language learning experiments involving lexicalized plural allomorphy. The primary role of type frequency in productivity is well-established, but debates about the precise relationship between type frequency and productivity continue. The effect of token frequency on productivity is even more controversial: some lines of research suggest token frequency and productivity are inversely related, other results indicate they are positively related, and yet others argue token frequency plays no role in productivity.  We address both of these questions. Our learning framework makes it possible to examine the effects of these variables on generalization to novel forms and to examine how sensitivity to these factors affects the time-course of learning. The first two experiments differentiate predictions for generalization of three distinct hypotheses about the role of type frequency, while the third experiment investigates the independent role of token frequency. We find that both type and token frequency independently and positively contribute to learning rates and generalization across the three experiments. We also apply two computational learning theories - implementing two prominent theoretical linguistic frameworks - to the learning of the lexically-conditioned allomorphy patterns in our experiments. Despite their differences, we show that the incremental learning dynamics of both models correctly predict the general trends in generalization rates, learning curves, and the influence of token frequency observed across the experimental conditions.",

          "abstract": "Category learning is the ability to link items to a shared label based on their common features. Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

Blind individuals gesture in ways consistent with their native language, albeit they gesture less frequently. However, nothing is known about whether their gesture form differs from that of sighted individuals. Using computer vision technologies, this study examines whether gesture kinematics are shaped by visuospatial experience. In an auditory motion-description task, we analyzed spontaneous path gestures—depicting motion trajectories—produced by 20 congenitally blind, 21 blindfolded, and 21 sighted Turkish speakers. We assessed the gestures’ alignment with actual motion paths, along with duration, size, and speed. Blind participants produced gestures that were more precisely aligned with the motion trajectories, as well as larger and longer. These findings show that altered spatial cognition in blindness enhances gesture precision. The study underscores the role of sensorimotor experience in shaping gesture form.",

          "abstract": "The landscape of infant behavior research has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past quarter-century. In this special issue opinion article, we synthesize these methodological changes and their implications for developmental science. Drawing on a systematic comparative assessment of empirical articles published in Infant Behavior and Development in 2000 and 2024, we critically evaluate five key methodological dimensions: research contexts, sample and cell sizes, coding practices, data analysis techniques and statistical software, and open science practices. Our synthesis reveals how the field has expanded beyond traditional laboratory settings toward more diverse research environments, including remote and archival approaches that enhance ecological validity and sample diversity. We trace how sample sizes have nearly doubled and experimental cell sizes have increased 2.5-fold, strengthening statistical power and replicability. We examine the selective adoption of automated methodologies in domains like eye tracking and speech analysis, alongside the persistent value of manual coding for complex behaviors. We observe a transition from classical statistical methods to more nuanced analytical approaches, increasingly implemented in open source software, reflecting both technological capabilities and theoretical shifts toward capturing developmental complexity. Finally, we document the emergence of open science practices, which now appear in over a third of published studies.

          "authors": "Lillian Michelle Hearne; Roger Thornton Dean; Andrew J Milne",
          "abstract": "A defining aspect of tonality in Western music is that different musical pitches are perceived to have different stabilities: listeners expect unstable pitches to resolve to stable pitches such as the tonic, which is the most stable. To investigate possible explanations for these hierarchies of tonal stability, we conducted three experiments where participants rated the ‘fit’ and ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by a variety of musical scales including familiar and unfamiliar scales in 12-tone equal temperament, and the ‘stability’ of probe tones contextualized by unfamiliar scales in 22-tone equal temperament. Context scale pitches were presented in random order to minimize tonal cues beyond scale structure. Using Bayesian multilevel regression, we modelled the ratings with an acoustical feature (spectral pitch class similarity) and a culture-dependent feature (scale-degree prevalence in a culturally appropriate corpus), along with several covariates. Across all scales, spectral pitch class similarity is strongly predictive of the responses and, for the familiar scales where corpus data are obtainable, prevalence makes an additional independent contribution. Furthermore, spectral pitch class similarity is a better predictor of stability than is a simple binary indicator of whether the probe’s pitch is in the context. These findings show that, for Western enculturated listeners, spectral pitch class similarity approximates the perceived stability of non-simultaneous pitches analogously to how spectral features, such as roughness and harmonicity, approximate the perceived stability of simultaneous pitches.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

We investigated pattern relationships using their derived principal component, ‘Music Perception skill’, in line with the construction paradigm to understand how feature-based discrimination defines music perception and is modulated by the nature and duration of musical training. A heterogeneous group of participants including trained musicians and non-musicians performed Mini-PROMS. The Tempo discrimination threshold was found to be low resulting in a ceiling effect for the entire sample. Musically trained individuals performed better on the tuning sub-test compared to non-musicians. Further, music perception was found to be less informed by recognition of melodic deviations and most informed by deviations in tempo for those with no musical training. However, with short-term training, music perception was most informed by discrimination ability for tuning. For musicians trained with eastern instruments, it was the temporal features whereas for those trained with western instruments, the tonal (melody) features largely contributed to their music perception skill. A groupwise Principle Component Analysis allowed us to investigate these effects of duration and nature of training highlighting the enculturation of music perception skills for both musically trained and untrained individuals.",

          "abstract": "The motivational control of action refers to the idea that actions are motivated by desired outcomes (goals) or triggered by antecedent cues (habit), governing how we adaptively execute value calculations to navigate our environment. Most research on habits has relied on well-controlled laboratory settings that parse the sensitivity of an instrumental response based on changes in reinforcer value. While significantly contributing to our understanding of motivational control, restricting habit estimates to the lab may be limiting the ecological relevance and generalizability of the findings. This chapter reviews recent advancements in neurobehavioral research that extend the study of habits beyond the lab. We highlight innovative implementations of stimuli with real-world relevance in controlled experiments, as well as efforts to apply lab-based habit measures to real-world settings. We further discuss designs that leverage remote data collection, which show promise in improving the validity of motivational control measures. While capturing human habits and translating this knowledge into clinical practice has been challenging, emerging evidence suggests that increasing ecological validity by harnessing naturalistic methods may bridge the gap between experimental and real-world applications of motivational control research. As these methodologies advance, the potential for developing more robust models of habit formation and clinical interventions grows, offering new opportunities for harnessing habit science in translational applications.",

We provide a novel mapping of interaction types and measurement methods across timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes.   We review candidate mechanisms of synchrony in both neural systems and behaviour, and consider how synchrony measures relate to real world outcomes such as learning and development.

This study examines the impact of attending virtual versus in-person worship.\nMethods: In a preregistered experiment, 43 adult Christians attended both virtual and in-person church services in a randomized order. Participants wore Fitbits to measure heart rate and calories burned and completed post-service surveys assessing social, affective, and well-being outcomes.\nResults: Virtual services resulted in lower transcendent experiences and emotions, shared identity with the congregation, and closeness with God compared to in-person attendance. Physiologically, virtual worship led to lower heart rates and fewer calories burned, indicating reduced embodied engagement. However, well-being scores remained similar.\nConclusions: Virtual worship may not fully replicate in-person experiences. Further research is needed to assess long-term well-being effects and implications for religious engagement.",

In the anticipation of legalized psychedelic care, and the recognition of ongoing psychedelic use across a variety of contexts, numerous training programs have been established to educate psychedelic facilitators in supporting individuals who take psychedelics. However psychedelic facilitation training in the US has not been well characterized, making it difficult to appraise the strengths, needs, and gaps in in this emerging discipline, especially with regard to the development of competencies in spiritually responsive care.\nThis project used a quality improvement approach to identify common priorities, practices, needs, and gaps in the emerging field of psychedelic facilitation training from the standpoint of 13 established and emerging training organizations from the US. Interviews were conducted with one or more representatives from each participating organization. Notes from these interviews, once confirmed by the interviewees, were synthesized to identify common practices, procedures, priorities, and gaps.\nAreas of focus among the programs included: careful selection of trainees and faculty; content emphases in instruction; addressing spiritual, existential, religious, and theological topics; and teaching strategies used in programs. Several gaps were also identified, pointing to the need for continuing education among program graduates, parity with other disciplines, and development of field standards in training facilitators.\nPsychedelic facilitation training is an evolving discipline. Training programs and trainees may benefit from greater collaboration, including ongoing exchange about best practices and adjustments to scientific, social, economic, and regulatory developments.",

          "abstract": "Abstract. Semantic information in images—such as meaningful, recognizable regions or objects that are incongruent with the overall scene—can effectively capture attention. The meaning map is currently the primary method for mapping the distribution of semantic information across visual stimuli. However, this approach relies on subjective human ratings of semantic meaningfulness and requires extensive manual annotation for each image prior to analysis. To address these limitations and enable rapid, efficient, and reproducible generation of semantic distribution maps for any given image, this paper proposes an automated method for constructing semantic information maps using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach generates two types of semantic maps: local semantic information maps, which quantify the semantic content at each spatial location within an image, and global semantic maps, which assess the contextual relevance of local regions to the overall scene. Additionally, the method can generate distribution maps of visual information associated with specific concepts. We argue that this method significantly enhances the precision and flexibility in controlling, measuring, and manipulating semantic information in visual stimuli, thereby advancing research in visual attention and visual language processing. The method is currently under further refinement.",

To facilitate evidence-based decision-making for setting appropriate discontinue rules, we propose a transparent approach that charts the impact of varied alternative discontinue rules on accuracy and efficiency. These A-E charts are based on retroactively applying discontinue rules to normative item response data. We show that a universal discontinue rule likely does not exist and that the optimal rule varies as a function of the desired efficiency-accuracy trade-off suitable for the intended test use and target population. The proposed approach provides a pragmatic solution for practitioners, researchers, test developers, and test publishers to rethink the existing discontinue rules, systematically evaluate the alternatives, and set appropriate rules.",

          "abstract": "Two-stage models of grammatical encoding posit that sentence production unfolds in two sequential steps: the construction of a hierarchical syntactic structure, followed by its linearization into a sequence suitable for articulation. While widely accepted in psycho- and neurolinguistics, such models lack formal computational implementations. Here, we introduce a novel Multinomial Processing Tree (MPT) model that operationalizes this two-stage framework to explain syntactic error patterns in individuals with aphasia. Drawing on discourse samples annotated for distinct error types, we fit an MPT model to estimate individual abilities at each processing stage. These ability estimates correlated with observed error rates and localized to distinct neural substrates: hierarchical encoding ability was linked to the posterior superior temporal sulcus and parietal cortex, linearization to posterior frontal and anterior parietal regions, and omission-related processes to the anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings support a neurocomputational dissociation between hierarchical and linear stages of grammatical encoding, aligning with prior lesion-symptom mapping and theoretical accounts of expressive agrammatism and paragrammatism. This work represents the first computational instantiation of a two-stage model of syntactic production, bridging formal modeling and lesion analysis to advance our understanding of the architecture and breakdown of grammatical encoding.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discern the statistical regularities in our environments has been shown to support key cognitive functions, including attention, prediction and language learning. While most research has focused on stable regularities, real-world patterns often change over time, requiring flexible updating of internal representations. In the context of embedded pattern learning, where continuous input consists of hidden pairs or triplets, prior work showed that learning of an initial structure can hinder learning of an updated one. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on post-exposure (offline) learning measures, the current study also incorporated an online target detection during exposure, to gauge real-time learning and adaptation to novel patterns more directly. In three separate blocks, participants were exposed to a stream of embedded pairs that were reshuffled into new pairs halfway through the stream. We administered the same task in both the visual and auditory modality, allowing us to explore modality-specific differences. The online target detection measure revealed that participants learned both the initial and updated regularities, but with an advantage for learning the former. In contrast, our offline measure only evidenced recognition of the initial patterns, echoing previously reported primacy effects. These learning effects were only present in the auditory modality, with no evidence of visual statistical learning.

          "abstract": "Anxiety states and symptoms can drive increases in heart rate through alteration in amygdala-prefrontal functioning. How such brain-heart communication mechanisms emerge across development and in naturalistic settings is unclear. In a pediatric sample with and without anxiety disorders, we calculated measures of brain-heart ‘coherence’ during an anxiety-inducing movie clip and at rest. Our primary analysis did not indicate anxiety-potentiated effects of coherence between heart rate and amygdala-prefrontal dynamic connectivity. However, exploratory analyses indicated that pediatric patients with anxiety disorders might exhibit relatively greater coherence between heart rate and sgACC activity. This provides preliminary evidence for a role of the sgACC in the development of somatic symptoms of anxiety.",

For example, characters who imitate the actions of a specific social partner are more likely, compared to a non-imitator, to help that social partner in the future. Infants’ expectations appear to be based on inferences of specific relationships, as they do not generalize to new social targets. Here we ask, however, if infants will extend expectations of support to the friend of a friend. We investigated whether infants could use their observations of two social agents’ positive social imitation interactions with the same target to make a transitive inference that the mutual affiliates were likely to be affiliated themselves. We did not find any evidence that infants used these observations to infer that mutual affiliates were more likely to be affiliated themselves.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 794), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. This report will be updated once the target sample size (n2 = 1,293) for Study 2 is achieved.",

          "authors": "Franziska Magdalene Leipold; Arndt Bröder; Martin Schnuerch",
          "abstract": "The G parameter of the lens model equation is a widely used measure of cue-based judgment accuracy, capturing how well individuals align their cue use with ecological validities in probabilistic environments. Despite its popularity across various research domains, the psychological interpretability of G may be severely limited when estimated in the conventional way, that is, based on separate, participant-level regression models. In this paper, we identify core statistical limitations of the conventional approach and demonstrate how these may lead to severely biased conclusions about judgment accuracy across a range of plausible scenarios. To remedy these limitations and increase the meaningfulness of G estimates, we propose a novel hierarchical modeling approach. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that the hierarchical approach yields markedly more accurate and robust G estimates, especially under realistic forms of model misspecification, such as omitted cues, omitted interactions, and misspecified nonlinear relationships. Two empirical illustrations—in the domains of healthiness judgments and metamemory—demonstrate the practical impact of modeling choice, further highlighting the bias in the conventional G parameter when misspecifying model equations. These findings challenge long-held beliefs about human judgment accuracy that were based on the conventional lens model approach. To avoid misleading conclusions due to biased estimates, we advocate for adopting the hierarchical approach as a more valid and reliable tool for measuring cue-based judgment accuracy, thereby strengthening the methodological rigor of judgment and decision-making research.",

          "abstract": "Cannabis use is widely on the rise for recreational and medicinal purposes, with the latter often aimed at improving mental health and cognition. Simultaneously, the prevalence of cannabis-related health harms, such as cannabis use disorder (CUD), is increasing. Product potency, route of administration, and preexisting mental health symptoms play a role in the effects of cannabis; however, there is limited research on how broader factors, such as local cannabis legislation and perceptions of use, may influence these outcomes. Moreover, knowledge remains sparse regarding the growing population of medicinal users, predominantly using without medical supervision. Altogether, this illustrates the need for ecologically valid ways to investigate individuals and their cannabis usage within real-world settings. \nTherefore, this longitudinal, cross-cultural online study examines an international sample of regular recreational and medicinal users (aged 18-65) from different cannabis jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands, the United States, Brazil, Canada, and regions in Asia and Africa) in their natural environment via their mobile phone. By using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), alongside a comprehensive battery of cognition and mental health related assessments over a 2-year period, we aim to gain insight into the short- and long-term mental health and cognitive determinants and consequences of cannabis use, and how these interact with broader, contextual factors, such as legislation. This is one of the first cross-cultural studies assessing both positive and negative effects of cannabis longitudinally, examining the full range of effects that cannabis may have on the individual.",

          "abstract": "Until now, stochastic differential equations have been used to explain the process that leads to feelings and ideas based on the assumption of Wiener processes. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of the person's similarity curve and other curve groups are at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. First, we derived the equation used in previous papers from a one-dimensional random walk using the law of large numbers, and then derived the equation used in this paper using the law of rare events. From the derived equation, we derived a stochastic process for the frequency of depressive symptoms and the probability distributions of depressive symptom interval and frequency. Based on the derived probability distributions, we discussed possible implications for depression and proposed coping strategies. These strategies are consistent with psychiatric treatments and provide a logical basis for such interventions. Finally, we discussed connections with similar curves discussed in previous papers.",

          "abstract": "Studying mental health at scale requires perspectives that extend beyond traditional clinical and research settings. Increasingly, people turn to social media platforms like Reddit to make sense of their distress, seek support, and explore alternative ways of understanding mental health outside institutional frameworks. This study maps the landscape of mental health discourse on Reddit by constructing a data-driven network of associations between mental disorders and comparing it with the network based on diagnostic criteria. We manually curated 114 Reddit communities focused on specific mental health conditions from the 20,000 most active subreddits in 2022. Each community was labeled into 49 disorders and categorized under nine ICD-10 diagnostic categories belonging to the group of mental and behavioral disorders (“F” codes). We constructed a disorder association network by identifying statistically significant user overlaps across subreddit pairs using a bipartite configuration model, with Bonferroni-corrected significance (p &lt; 0.001). Edges represent either positive or negative associations based on observed versus expected user overlap. We analyzed the connectedness of the network within and across diagnostic categories and compared the emergent Reddit-based hierarchy of disorder associations with the formal structure encoded in ICD-10 using hierarchical clustering and tree similarity metrics. The inferred Reddit network of psychopathology revealed a densely interconnected structure, with all but six disorders forming a single giant component spanning diagnostic categories. The most prominent disorders by user volume included ADHD, depression, habit and impulse disorders, autism, and generalized anxiety. However, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depersonalization/derealization (DPDR), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibited the highest connectivity by number of associations, while schizotypal disorder, avoidant personality disorder, and agoraphobia ranked highest in weighted degree. Bipolar disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) displayed high inter-category associations but weak in-category ties, indicating complex diagnostic boundaries. The network of negative associations further revealed divergences from past expectations; for instance, addiction-related communities (e.g., alcohol and opioids) were negatively associated with much of the broader mental health discourse. Finally, hierarchical comparisons showed moderate overlap between Reddit-derived associations and ICD-10 diagnostic structures, both in pairwise edge similarity (Jaccard = 0.07) and overall clustering (ARI = 0.307, NMI = 0.706). Overall, Reddit-based mental health communities reveal a complementary structure of disorder associations shaped by lived experience, often diverging from formal diagnostic criteria and highlighting overlooked or cross-cutting patterns of comorbidity.",

          "abstract": "Background: While psychopathology research increasingly favors dimensions over categorical diagnostics, nosology, and treatment, much about the dimensions’ assessment is still unknown, particularly for children and adolescents. With most research based on single-source, cross-sectional data, findings are contaminated by random error and systematic biases that make up much of scale scores’ variance and make their correlations uninterpretable. We describe a scale score variance decomposition model that leverages multi-informant data to estimate scale scores’ – and even individual items’ – true correlations among themselves and with other variables.\n\nMethods: After presenting the model, we reviewed relevant literature for its application in personality and psychopathology domains. Also, since the model treats cross-rater correlations as the degrees of valid scale score variance, we reviewed literature on cross-rater agreement for normal and maladaptive psychological traits in children and adults.\n\nResults: True correlations based on multi-informant data are consistently stronger than correlations based on single-source data, validating our model and showing its benefits. Cross-rater agreement tended to have similar magnitudes for both adaptative and maladaptive traits, 1) suggesting similar degrees of valid variance, systematic method biases, and error and 2) validating our models’ use for psychopathology ratings. However, agreement tends to be somewhat lower in children than adults, implying that multi-informant child research requires larger samples for similar precision when estimating true correlations. \n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: We discuss how multi-informant data and our model can be especially useful for understanding child psychopathology and conclude by offering suggestions for how to leverage the model to explore dimensional models of psychopathology.",

As humans increasingly develop cognitive dependency and emotional intimacy with AI systems the boundaries between machine utility and human connection blur in potentially hazardous ways. In response to these challenges, this study proposes the conceptual model of Cognitive Gyms: structured environments for training attention, reflection, emotional intelligence, and moral reasoning. Just as physical gyms emerged as a societal response to the sedentary lifestyle induced by the Industrial Revolution, Cognitive Gyms offer a timely, preventative response to the cognitive atrophy- the gradual weakening or loss of cognitive functions due to disuse, precipitated by the digital and algorithmic age. The model integrates insights from cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and education, aiming not only to preserve human cognitive function but to protect the ethical core of human experience in the age of intelligent machines.

          "authors": "Cillian McHugh; Eric R. Igou",
          "abstract": "It is reasonable to expect that when making a judgment, we only consider the relevant (or diagnostic) information, and that non-relevant (non-diagnostic) information should not, and thus does not, influence our judgments. Previous research has shown that this is not always the case and that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information can lead to less extreme judgments. This phenomenon is known as the dilution effect, and it has been observed for a range of judgments, including product evaluations, probability judgments, and predictions relating to people’s behavior.  The dilution effect has been explained as a consequence of the representativeness heuristic, such that the inclusion of non-diagnostic information reduces the match between the target and a typical member of the category. Consistent with this notion and recent approaches to moral decision making, we predict that the dilution effect should be observed for judgments about morality. . Across four studies (total N = 2,585), we tested for the dilution effect on judgments of morally bad actors and morally good actors. Overall, our results showed a dilution effect for judgments of both good and bad actors. People's moral evaluations of both good and bad actors were less extreme when the descriptions included non-diagnostic information. We showed that this effect is not the result of humanization, and we found the robustness of the effect appears to be moderated by valence, with a more robust effect for bad actors. Our results highlight avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services provide care for individuals experiencing first-episode psychosis and are considered both clinically and cost-effective. While many have positive experiences of EIP, there have also been reports of perceived harm. This scoping review synthesised qualitative evidence on service user perspectives of potential harm in EIP services in the UK, to consider how services may continue to improve practice to meet the needs of their patients.\n\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review following a pre-registered protocol. Systematic searches were performed in PsycINFO, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL Plus, and Medline on 9th October 2024. We included peer-reviewed qualitative studies exploring service user experiences in EIP services in the UK. Data on reported harms from eligible studies were thematically analysed.\n\nResults: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. We identified four main themes: (1) Intersection of stigma and lack of cultural awareness; (2) Inappropriate or inadequate support; (3) Poor relationships and communication; and (4) Challenges in the discharge process.\n\nConclusions: While EIP services offer the current gold standard of care for first episode psychosis, our review highlighted some areas where harm was perceived to have arisen. Such information presents potential targets for service improvement. Strengthening communication, enhancing information sharing, and expanding access to advocacy may help mitigate potential harms and optimise service user experiences. Further research to quantify the prevalence of harms within EIP services is needed to inform best practices and ensure equitable, person-centred care.",

          "abstract": "Repetition learning has been frequently studied using the Hebb effect: Immediate serial recall performance improves for a memory list which is repeated amidst other, non-repeated lists. Previous research has suggested that older adults learn as well as younger adults in the Hebb paradigm. Because older adults show an age-related deficit in associative episodic memory, this suggests that learning in the Hebb paradigm is not driven by associative memory. In fact, it has been shown that learning sequentially presented lists through repetition is likely to be driven by a chunking mechanism, by which the whole list is integrated into a single unified representation. Here, we investigate age differences in the Hebb paradigm to determine the conditions under which repetition learning relies on associative episodic memory. We found that older adults learn at the same rate as younger adults in a standard Hebb paradigm with lists of letters. By contrast, Hebb repetition learning of pairwise associations of words was slower in older than in younger adults. Our results suggest that (a) repetition learning is only driven by associative memory when learning pairwise associations is required to solve the task, and (b) that older adults’ capability to learn from repetition is as good as that of younger adults whenever memory lists are presented in sequence. Thus, the process of chunk formation is largely preserved in old age, at least in the verbal domain.",

          "abstract": "Decisions problems are often characterized by the presence of many choice options described by several attributes, and people need to limit how much information they search for. We propose that humans search and thereby devote attention to relevant information in an efficient and goal-directed, but not necessarily optimal manner. Thereto, a novel hierarchical Bayesian cognitive model of information search in multi-attribute and multi-alternative decisions is presented and tested. In the model, the search process is governed by the desire to quickly identify the option that meets the choice goal best, which in turn depends on the importance and uncertainty of information and on the accumulated evidence. The theory accounts for many established empirical findings on the interplay of attention and decision making, including the positive correlation of gaze time and choice probability as well as the preference for sampling promising choice candidates. To rigorously test a series of top-down effects of attention, we present results of a new and preregistered eye-tracking experiment on multi-attribute decisions, in which the influence of bottom-up attention on visual search is minimized. Our theory accounts for the various interactions of attention and choice in this experiment, while variants of it and another extant theory that assume other search rules fail to capture them. Furthermore, the theory predicts additional choice dynamics such as the dependency of decision speed on the number and overall value of options. The proposed framework provides a general approach to understanding the intricate dynamics of search and valuation mechanisms in multi-attribute decisions.",

The present studies tested the robustness of this developmental asymmetry with minimal contrast pairs of uncertainty conditions. Across two studies (N = 204, 3- to 6-year-old German-speaking children), we found no differences between the conditions: Children did not prepare differently for multiple incompatible outcomes of physically and epistemically uncertain events.

          "abstract": "Enduring Mental Health (EMH) has been defined as maintaining good psychological functioning without developing mental health problems. Estimates of the proportion of individuals who have EMH vary widely. We investigated EMH across the lifespan, defined not only as absence of mental health problems, but also as consistent presence of high wellbeing. To explore how defining EMH affects prevalence, we included both stricter and broader lenient thresholds for mental health problems and low wellbeing.\n\nData came from 16,030 participants (35.2% male; average birth year 1970) from the longitudinal Netherlands Twin Register, who completed ≥4 assessments of mental health and/or wellbeing over 8–20 years. For each EMH definition, preregistered analyses included computation of prevalence, genetic and environmental influences using twin modeling, and phenotypic and genetic correlates including education, personality, social factors, and genetic predispositions for mental health outcomes.\n\nAs expected, the choice of threshold had a substantial impact on EMH prevalence estimates, 71% for absence of problems and 93% for high wellbeing when applying stricter thresholds for mental health compared to lenient thresholds, 42% and 82%, respectively. Heritability estimates (46-61%) and patterns of associations for EMH were similar across the different mental health thresholds. Protective factors included optimism, social support, and good self-rated health (OR= 1.50-2.86), while neuroticism, loneliness, and perceived stress were risk factors (OR=0.31-0.84).\n\nWe show the importance of defining EMH as both the absence of problems and the presence of wellbeing. While prevalence varied depending on threshold and definition used, the consistent genetic and psychosocial correlates for different definitions of EMH suggest stable underlying mechanisms that can inform prevention to help individuals maintain mental health.",

          "abstract": "The development of word reading skills fundamentally depends on children's interactions with printed words. A significant amount of research in the psychological and educational sciences has been conducted on the learning processes that contribute to skilled word recognition in children and adults. However, little is known about how ensembles of words encountered during early learning affect learning outcomes over timescales larger than what can be accomplished in a controlled experimental setting. In order to move past this limitation, using an established connectionist learning architecture (Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg, &amp; Patterson, 1996; Seidenberg &amp; McClelland, 1989) we examined how variation in word ensembles influence learning and generalization during early reading acquisition. We simulated learners (N = 30,000) exposed to different sets of monosyllabic printed words drawn randomly from children’s literature at a large scale. In order to examine how different ensembles might impact learning depending on the learner's ability to represent the relationship between letters and sounds, we also manipulated the representational capacity of models by systematically changing the number of hidden units, holding the ensemble of words constant. Across levels of representational capacity each model had \"twins\" which differed only in terms of the number of hidden units they possessed. Results demonstrate significant variation in learning outcomes in a set of generalization words as a function of the word, ensemble and representational capacity. These findings inform educational practices by highlighting the importance of deliberate word selection to support early development.",

Using data from the Africa Long Life Study, which sampled young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa (N = 2,770), we tested how personality traits are linked to seven important life outcomes. The Big Two personality traits, agency and communion, were assessed 2 to 3 years prior to the assessment of outcomes, including self-reported health, employment status, and anxiety. We used specification-curve analysis to examine the robustness of personality-outcome associations. Higher levels of agency and communion robustly predicted higher levels of self-rated health, and lower levels of anxiety and depression over 2 to 3 years. Furthermore, higher levels of communion predicted being employed 2 to 3 years later. However, personality-outcome associations were smaller than expected based on findings from Western countries (.02 ≤ |r| ≤ .11). Our findings provide novel insights into the cross-cultural replicability of personality-outcome associations, and we discuss the implications of our findings for personality research.",

Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, data were collected through 90-minute semi-structured Zoom interviews. Findings revealed that colorism is embedded within structural and social systems, shaping job access through appearance-based biases and unequal reliance on social capital. Lighter-skinned participants reported more direct hiring pathways, while darker-skinned participants faced exclusion, subtle discrimination, and greater dependency on referrals and mentorship. The study also uncovered varied levels of awareness regarding colorism’s influence, ranging from denial to gradual recognition. These insights culminated in the development of a researcher-constructed conceptual model illustrating how institutional norms, network-based gatekeeping, and internalized perceptions of professionalism converge to reinforce colorism in employment. The study highlights the need for inclusive hiring practices and broader systemic reforms to address appearance-based inequities in the Ghanaian job market.",

Participants (N = 41) were classified into four groups based on the degree of smoking (≤ 14 or ≥ 15 cigarettes per day) and the median total score on resilience scales (low-resilience low-smoking, low-resilience high-smoking, high-resilience low-smoking, and high-resilience high-smoking). Participants completed the TSST-OL, measuring subjective stress and salivary cortisol, at eight time points. A two-piece multilevel growth curve model with landmark registration (GCM-LR) examined the effects of smoking habits and resilience scores on cortisol concentrations. Blunted cortisol responses were similarly present in all four groups; thus, my hypothesis was unsupported. All groups showed similarly elevated subjective stress responses. GCM-LR results showed no significant cortisol increase, but the fixed effect of cortisol recovery was significant. The likelihood ratio test showed that the random effect of resilience scores was significant. Habitual smokers do not have an elevated cortisol response, even in stressful situations. Substantial individual differences were suggested in the effect of resilience scale scores on cortisol concentration.",

Humans, like all life, are sensitive to their environment.  Mentally ill or unstable individuals can be triggered into impulsive and violent activities from spikes in serum serotonin.  Human serum histamine level is directly proportional to environmental allergen or pollen levels, but serum serotonin level is inversely proportional to serum histamine levels with human males having 52% more serotonin than females.  Data show an association between the dates of violent acts, especially male single shooter mass shootings in the United States, and the dates of dramatic decreases in pollen levels thus indicating pollen and serum histamine level drops as a possible precursor or triggering relationship.  This knowledge can be used as a potential predictor for law enforcement and medical agencies for a given city or region.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Optogenetics is a promising technology to restore vision in individuals with blindness due to retinal disorders. Light-sensitive proteins (opsins) are introduced intravitreally and bind to surviving non-photosensitive retinal cells to elicit a neural response to visual stimuli. Much of this research is done with mouse models, where it is not obvious how a given opsin would translate to human visual perception. Our goal was to provide estimates of potential patients’ spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity and perceptual experiences. We created ‘virtual patients’ consisting of neurotypical subjects viewing stimuli modified to match the temporal properties of two state-of-the-art opsins 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 and ChRmine. Methods: A non-linear model based on single cell electrophysiological data describing the sensitivity and temporal dynamics of each opsin was used to spatiotemporally modulate a counterphase modulated Gabor stimulus to replicate the predicted retinal stimulus of optogenetic patients. Contrast detection thresholds for optogenetic and control stimuli were obtained using a 2AFC quick CSF Bayesian adaptive procedure across a range of spatial and temporal frequencies. Results: Contrast sensitivity for 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 declined rapidly with increasing temporal frequency compared to the control stimulus, consistent with this opsin’s slow temporal dynamics. Sensitivity to opsin ChRmine was lower overall, but there was little decline in sensitivity at higher temporal frequencies. Conclusion: Using this virtual patient paradigm, we demonstrate the trade-off between sensitivity and temporal resolution for two example opsins. 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 would be expected to outperform ChRmine under many laboratory tests, such as a Snellen eye chart for a patient capable of maintaining stable fixation. However ChRmine would be predicted to outperform 4xBGAG12,460:SNAP-mGluR2 during outdoor navigation in daylight. Ultimately, our goal is to predict patients’ performance across a wide range of clinically relevant tasks directly from an opsin’s temporal dynamics, paving the way for informed optimization of sight-restoration therapies before clinical application.",

The model posits that in managing intercultural relations, individuals are driven by the needs for growth and development as well as the needs for security and safety. Whereas the promotion focus needs for growth and development can be met by building intercultural relationships, the prevention focus needs for security and safety can be met by preventing relationship damage. The promotion-prevention motivational systems are associated with unique affective reactions in response to anticipated outcomes. Such affect-driven outcome expectancies shape the learning processes. The ALPs model presents a comprehensive cultural competence framework and identifies specific cultural competence strategies that have been overlooked in the existing literature.

          "authors": "Aimé Parra Legarreta",
          "abstract": "Este artículo presenta el Modelo de Integración Emocional Asimétrica Dual (IEAD), una propuesta estructurada para facilitar la integración emocional de conceptos complejos (como loops proyectivos, duelos no resueltos o traumas vinculares) sin generar disonancia cognitiva severa en el lector o paciente. El IEAD opera mediante la presentación paralela de cada módulo conceptual en dos versiones: una narrativa emocional, que recurre a un lenguaje metafórico, experiencial y simbólicamente cargado; y una versión técnica, basada en lenguaje clínico, definiciones precisas y estructuras lógicas verificables.\n\nEl modelo se justifica en evidencia observacional y fenomenológica sobre la asimetría estructural entre la comprensión emocional y la comprensión racional en humanos, especialmente en contextos de trauma, pérdida o confusión simbólica. IEAD propone que no toda estructura humana puede integrar desde el mismo canal, y que permitir una elección consciente del tipo de exposición puede reducir bloqueos, evitar retraumatización, y facilitar la resignificación simbólica.\n\nLas aplicaciones potenciales incluyen: terapia psicoanalítica profunda, pedagogía emocional en entornos clínicos o neurodivergentes, codificación estructural para IA con comprensión emocional, y diseño de publicaciones científicas con contenido emocionalmente sensible.\n\nEste documento incluye un ejemplo demostrativo sobre el concepto de “Loop Proyectivo”, para ilustrar el potencial transformador del modelo. Cada lector puede optar por leer solo la versión emocional o solo la técnica. No se requiere la integración dual para que el contenido cumpla su función.",

          "title": "Friendship Stress Buffering in Young People with Childhood Adversity",
          "authors": "No authors listed",
          "abstract": "Around 60% of young people worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity, such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or poverty. These stressful experiences can have long-lasting effects and significantly increase the risk of mental health problems. To aid future intervention and prevention efforts, my doctoral research examined how childhood adversity contributes to mental health difficulties, and whether and how friendships can help protect against these effects.\n\nUsing a combination of literature reviews, behavioral studies, and brain imaging research, my colleagues and I found that young people with more severe childhood adversity were at greater risk of social isolation, being harmed or harming others, and developing mental health problems. This was partly due to differences in how they process and perceive stress. In addition, we found that those with strong, high-quality friendships reported lower stress perceptions and fewer mental health difficulties.\n\nThese findings matter for two key reasons. First, they detail how childhood adversity increases vulnerability to mental health problems. Second, they demonstrate that high-quality friendships play a critical protective role in mental health – and help explain how, by reducing stress perceptions. Hence, helping young people build and maintain supportive friendships could be an important way to promote mental health, especially for those who have faced childhood adversity.",

          "abstract": "Academic writing productivity is constrained by keyboard limitations and associated health risks. This article presents a systematic approach to integrating AI-powered voice technology into academic workflows. I distinguish transcription (converting recorded audio) from dictation (real-time composition), provide tool recommendations for different use cases, and outline implementation strategies including AI prompts for processing recordings. Voice technology enables composition at 130+ words per minute versus 40 WPM typing while reducing repetitive strain injuries. This workflow offers academics a practical method to increase writing efficiency and promote sustainable work practices.",
