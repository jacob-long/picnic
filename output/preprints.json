          "abstract": "Reproducibility of research is a hotly debated topic, including aspects like causes and consequences of low levels of reproducibility. While some research fields have led the way and introduced various reproducibility practices and procedures, the call for efforts to ‘improve’ reproducibility in research has not come without criticisms. The current study uses a future studies methodology to gather perceptions of developments in the research ecosystem related to reproducibility issues. It draws on input from representatives of four main stakeholder categories: scholarly publishers, funding agencies, qualitative social scientists and machine learning researchers. Particularly, it discusses the enablers and barriers that members of these stakeholder communities foresee on the road towards a research ecosystem that is more conducive to reproducibility.\nThe study finds that enablers and barriers can be categorised into five main clusters. The factors most prominently mentioned as potentially supporting or hindering a desired future are located within research culture, including norms, values and shared definitions; and in the infrastructure required to engage in reproducibility practices, including repositories, support staff, and digital infrastructure. Three other clusters of factors put forth by participants relate to policy efforts required to incentivise reproducibility practices; training and education to empower researchers and support staff to engage in reproducibility practices; and the financial resources required to facilitate the transition towards a desired future and to specifically fund replication studies. This manuscript also identifies several tensions between enablers and barriers perceived by diverse stakeholders and concludes with recommendations for addressing these.",

          "abstract": "Trust is essential to social interactions and our decisions to trust\nare not only determined with how trustworthy someone is but by what\nwe believe about their group membership. Here we investigated how\nparticipants observationally learn to trust or distrust one of two eth-\nnic groups and then use that knowledge when interacting with novel\nmembers of those groups. Overall we found that participants quickly\nadapted to actual trustworthiness of their partners, irrespective of\nlearned group characteristics and ethnic group. However, participants\nwere learned more observationally from ethnic ingroups compared to\noutgroups. Participants rated ethnic ingroups less favourably in how\ntrustworthy they perceived them when that group had been presented\nas being trustworthy. Trust is largely an adaptive process to actual\ncircumstances, but people’s tendency to treat in- and outrgroups dif-\nferently can interfere with people’s abilities to fully adapt to interaction\npartners actual behaviour.",

          "authors": "Luis Escobar L.-Dellamary",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the paradoxical relationship between humans and artificial intelligence through the lens of \"AI-lienation\"—a term capturing our tendency to experience AI systems as fundamentally alien despite their origins in human informational practices. Drawing on empirical evidence from psychological studies and human-AI interaction research, we demonstrate how this perspective stems from a fundamental attribution error: projecting qualities of \"otherness\" onto systems that represent extensions of our own informational activities. Through the Dissipative Representations (DiRe) framework, grounded in information theory and analytical idealism, we dissolve the false dichotomy between \"natural\" human intelligence and \"artificial\" computational systems, revealing both as patterns within the same informational field. Our methodology integrates psychological analysis with historical technological transitions and contemporary interaction studies to identify the ontological continuity underlying diverse manifestations of intelligence. By reconceptualizing the human-AI relationship through this non-dualistic lens, we propose practical implications for technological development, education, and cultural representation that foster more integrative human-AI interactions. This framework offers an epistemically economical alternative to dualistic models that have dominated both academic discourse and popular narratives about artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "In 2023, we conducted a study to examine hypotheses at the intersection of stigma, autism, and fashion sensibilities. As part of that work, we collected data examining some of the clothing, wearable item, and jewelry preferences of autistic and non-autistic people. This report briefly examines our findings. Overall, while our comparisons were limited by a small sample (N = 273, including 214 autistic and 59 non-autistic people), lack of comfort in clothing is a well noted characteristic in most of the autistic as well as non-autistic sensory experiences reported here. The annoyance of tags and seams; fitted or tight clothing and thick fabrics or clothing accessories causing feelings of heaviness and constriction; as well as the itchiness of certain fabrics all contribute to a general preference for comfort over style when autistic and non-autistic people make fashion purchasing decisions. Most respondents wore jewelry and reportedly, although they felt stigmatized and “othered” by existing market options, would or would consider purchasing jewelry-style or handheld objects (colloquially, fidget or “stim toys”) for emotional, attentional, or sensory regulation purposes.",

          "authors": "Paulina Szwed",
          "abstract": "One of Festinger’s core assumptions in cognitive dissonance theory was that dissonance reduction is an effortful process whose intensity varies with the magnitude of dissonance. That is, the greater the dissonance, the stronger the motivation to reduce it, and consequently, the greater the invested effort (Festinger, 1957). For many years, this assertion was accepted without direct empirical testing. Moreover, Motivational Intensity Theory (MIT; Brehm &amp; Self, 1989) provides well-established empirical evidence about the factors that determine motivated effort investment and explains why it is inaccurate to perceive dissonance reduction as always, an effortful process. Motivated effort is influenced by various factors, not just motivation, such as the difficulty of the task and the individual’s level of ability (which was incorporated into the original theory by Rex Wright, 1996). I argue that these principles should be applied to any mental activity, including cognitive dissonance reduction. The primary objective of this article is to propose an integration of Cognitive Dissonance Theory by Leon Festinger with Motivational Intensity Theory by Jack Brehm. I believe that this proposed integration significantly contributes to psychological knowledge.",

          "authors": "Paulina Szwed; Ewa Szumowska",
          "abstract": "In everyday life, we encounter information that contradicts our beliefs, often disrupting our self-concept and triggering cognitive dissonance. Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) suggests that discrepancies between cognitions create discomfort, motivating individuals to restore psychological consistency. It indicates that the magnitude of dissonance depends on the importance of conflicting beliefs, yet the role of importance has not been fully explored. Our hypothesis posits that the importance of a cognition moderates’ motivation to reduce dissonance. Two studies (N = 640) were conducted to test how people respond to discrepancy about their abilities. Study 1 showed that dissonance led to greater motivation toward reduction, but only for those who found those abilities as important. Study 2 (with a measure of the dissonance state) confirmed that dissonance magnitude and importance interact, influencing motivation to reduce dissonance. This research expands CDT by highlighting the role of importance in dissonance reduction.",

          "abstract": "How we live dictates how we will be remembered. Crucially, studying how our legacy endures may reveal new philosophical and psychological insights about human nature and social phenomena. In the current investigation, we present a large-scale analysis of over 38 million obituaries spanning nearly 30 years (1998-2024) and comprising nearly 7 billion words. Through dictionary-based natural language processing techniques, we map the moral and emotional landscape of these obituaries to investigate differences in how people are memorialized by gender and age. We find that men and older people were remembered with more words; women were remembered more for caring for others (in the case of love and friendship), whereas men were remembered more in contexts reflecting a lack of care (e.g., war, conflict), and this gender asymmetry intensified with age. The present work may be the first large-scale analysis of obituaries building toward a psychology of legacy.",

          "abstract": "Despite widespread discussions about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on society, little work has objectively measured how often people use this technology in the wild. The present paper collected up to 90 days of web-browsing data from students (Study 1: N = 499) and those in the general public (Study 2: N = 455), quantifying how often people used AI and evaluating the psychological correlates of such use. Upon coding 4.1 million websites in Study 1 and 9.9 million websites in Study 2, the evidence suggested AI use was relatively infrequent, totaling 1% of student web-browsing and 0.44% of general public web browsing, on average. The most consistent predictors of AI use across studies were aversive personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), albeit the traits were differentially associated with AI use across studies. Demographics were systematically unrelated to AI use across studies. Finally, we observed that self-reported AI use and actual AI use were only moderately correlated (ρ = .329), suggesting limitations in subjective measures of media use. These findings provide some of the first behavioral measurements of AI in naturalistic settings and establish important benchmarks for understanding the individual differences associated with AI adoption.",

          "abstract": "Psychological scientists are increasingly acknowledging the importance of transparency for research integrity. The present study examined one important facet of transparency: providing enough information about measures so that readers can evaluate aspects of construct validity. With a focus on social and personality psychology, we explored how often authors in one journal report a scale name, citation, example item, number of items, and reliability coefficient, as well as how often authors provide access to the study’s materials. We also investigated how measurement reporting practices have changed from 2010 to 2020, the decade encompassing the start of the “credibility revolution” in psychology. Across two samples, we coded 506 Social Psychological and Personality Science (SPPS) articles (N = 425 articles with at least one questionnaire measure; 1,198 questionnaire measures). Overall, ~31% of measures were reported with a name, ~53% a citation, ~66% an example item, ~76% the number of items, and ~78% of multi-item measures included some reliability information; approximately 22% of measures were single-item and 46% were ad hoc. We did not detect any apparent changes in the reporting practices examined from 2010 to 2020 in either sample, except for an increase in the availability of materials over time. Therefore, the replication crisis may have motivated increased access to studies’ materials in recent years but otherwise does not seem to be associated with more transparent reporting of measurement information for questionnaires in brief social and personality articles.",

          "authors": "Philip Pärnamets; Jay Joseph Van Bavel; Mark Alfano",
          "abstract": "Intellectual virtues such as intellectual humility are dispositions to seek out and respond to evidence and the testimony of others in ways that are conducive to the acquisition, maintenance, and transmission of knowledge. In recent years there has been a growth of interest in this topic, with the development of ten different scales designed to capture individual differences in intellectual humility and related constructs. In a series of ten studies (N = 5,922), we analyze the psychometric properties of these measures to consolidate them into a single inventory with five subscales (open-mindedness, sense of intellectual superiority, intellectual defensiveness, intellectual arrogance, and tendency to criticize one’s ingroup). Given the importance of intellectual humility in intergroup relations, we intentionally include items designed to capture the presence (or lack) of intellectual humility in an intergroup context. These items allow us to capture distinct aspects of intellectual humility where people remain open-minded about the perspectives of outgroup members or turn a critical eye to the beliefs and reasoning of ingroup members. Our new inventory — the Collected Intergroup Intellectual Humility scale (CIIH) — demonstrates good convergent and discriminant validity, as well as the power to predict a range of important outcome variables such as acceptance/rejection of warranted/unwarranted conspiracy theories, medical (mis)information, and (fake) news, as well as to update credences in light of social feedback. CIIH offers strong psychometric properties and greater utility than existing measures for assessing the willingness to learn from a wide variety of individuals and groups. Our results suggest that the disposition to criticize oneself and the disposition to criticize one’s ingroup are distinct.",

          "abstract": "This study presents a novel method, Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics, to analyze and understand unique semantic relationships in clinical populations. The initial paper presents the methodological foundation for the Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics, with subsequent papers focusing on clinical populations. Our method aims to elucidate personal idiolectic connections, providing a deeper understanding of the semantic landscape within and between individuals. This study analyzed group-level differences in the text of forum posts on a popular social media site and individual-level idiolect comparisons in OCD populations compared to more general population. Our results demonstrate significant differences in the semantic associations with the word \"attract\" between OCD users and general users. Specifically, OCD users exhibited more varied and less consistent associations, reflecting the diverse nature of their obsessions and compulsions, while general users showed more stable and uniform associations. Additionally, group-level comparisons between art and programming subgroups revealed significant differences in semantic distances in associations with the word “abstract,” indicating distinct word usage patterns across communities. These findings highlight the potential of Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics in uncovering meaningful differences in semantic relationships within clinical populations and online communities, both at group- and individual-level.",

          "abstract": "Humans make spontaneous judgments about who to trust, love, despise or avoid based\non facial appearance. Influential models of such social judgments posit that they are based on\ntwo main evaluations—the person’s intentions and their ability to carry them out. Two central\nmodels characterize these dimensions as trustworthiness and dominance, and warmth and\ncompetence respectively. However, emerging evidence shows that the facial features that drive\nthese central perceptions diverge. Here, we show that disparate models of social trait perception\ncan be unified when considering social traits in terms of latent facial features. By modelling the\n3D facial features that drive central social trait judgments using a classic data-driven method\ncombined with a modern generative model of the human face, we showed that two latent sets of\nfacial features drive social trait perception. It is the unique combination of these sets of features that gives rise to individual trait perceptions. Additionally, we highlight differences in social trait\nperception not only based on face sex but also across individual observers. Together, our results\nunify existing models of social trait perception and highlight the importance of representing\ndiversity in modern models of human behavior.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence increasingly mirrors human emotions, its capacity to simulate empathy challenges our understanding of connection. This exploration delves into how AI systems, from chatbots to companion apps, employ data-driven strategies to mimic emotional intelligence—analyzing speech patterns, sentiment, and behavioral cues to craft responses that feel deeply personal. Yet this \"understanding\" remains a carefully orchestrated mimicry, leveraging human psychological tendencies to project meaning onto algorithmic outputs. While users often experience comfort in these interactions, the essay interrogates the ethical and psychological consequences: the erosion of reciprocal human bonds, the commodification of emotional vulnerability, and the uncanny discomfort evoked by flawlessly sanitized compassion. Ultimately, it questions whether AI’s empathetic facade enriches or diminishes our capacity for authentic human connection.",

          "authors": "Manvir Singh",
          "abstract": "Human societies reliably develop complex cultural traditions with striking similarities. These “super-attractors” span the domains of magic and religion (e.g., shamanism, supernatural punishment beliefs), aesthetics (e.g., heroic tales, dance songs), and social institutions (e.g., justice, corporate groups), and collectively constitute what I call the “cultural manifold.” The cultural manifold represents a set of equilibrium states of social and cultural evolution: hypothetically cultureless humans placed in a novel and empty habitat will eventually produce most or all of these complex traditions. Although the study of the super-attractors has been characterized by explanatory pluralism, particularly an emphasis on processes that favor individual- or group-level benefits, I here argue that their development is primarily underlain by a process I call “subjective selection,” or the production and selective retention of variants that are evaluated as instrumentally useful for satisfying goals. Humans around the world are motivated towards similar ends, such as healing illness, explaining misfortune, calming infants, and inducing others to cooperate. As we shape, tweak, and preferentially adopt culture that appears most effective for achieving these ends, we drive the convergence of complex traditions worldwide. The predictable development of the cultural manifold reflects the capacity of humans to sculpt traditions that apparently provide them with what they want, attesting to the importance of subjective selection in shaping human culture.",

Consumer-grade devices tend to rely on heart rate (HR)-based estimation methods to classify PA intensity, which contrasts with traditional research-grade accelerometers that use count- or raw-acceleration metrics. Comparability issues are particularly salient across individuals with varying weight status. In this commentary, we discuss systematic discrepancies between HR-based (relative intensity) and acceleration-based (absolute intensity) classifications of MVPA among individuals with greater adiposity. Using Fitbit data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, we illustrate how HR-based PA intensity classification may indicate higher MVPA in youth with greater adiposity despite lower step counts and light PA levels. We highlight implications for research design, public health surveillance, messaging, policy, and interventions. We also call for greater transparency, standardized methodologies, and integrative measurement approaches to ensure more accurate assessment of PA behavior.",

          "abstract": "Based on previous findings and psychometric reasoning, we hypothesized that personality traits closely follow chronological age (chronAge), but that this has been obscured by reliance on limited and single-method personality assessments. We investigated how accurately chronAge could be predicted from personality traits (persAge) in 13,253 individuals (aged 20 to 70) whose personality domains and nuances had been comprehensively assessed by themselves and a close informant. Observed persAge, based on self-ratings or combined self- and informant-ratings, correlated with chronAge up to r ≈ .80. Latent persAge, based on the shared variance of both assessment sources, correlated with chronAge up to r ≈ .90. Over the 50-year age span, we estimated typical differences between chronAge and latent persAge to be less than 4.5 years. This implies latent persAge differences so large that the persAge distributions of younger and older people barely overlap. These findings suggest a strong normative component in personality development as a whole. Yet, individuals can arrive at the same persAge differently, and normative age-related factors are only one reason why people differ on any given trait.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

The present study investigated loneliness-linked alterations in goal-directed mental simulation involving imagining the steps one would take to achieve a goal state of social connectedness. Natural language processing (NLP) analyses of open descriptions from N = 1,071 participants across Australia were assessed alongside self-report ratings of mental imagery. Loneliness-linked individual differences in goal-directed mental simulation were examined across four domains: episodic detail richness, imagery perceptual vividness, emotional sentiment, and sociality. Results revealed that mental simulations reported by lonelier individuals were lower in internal episodic detail and imagery vividness, more emotionally negative, and were less social than those of less lonely individuals, with most associations persisting even after accounting for depression symptom level. Findings suggest lonely individuals may struggle to mentally simulate concrete, vivid, and emotionally rewarding future social interactions needed to alleviate feelings of loneliness.",

          "abstract": "Some psychological models—especially complex, typological ones or those with a three-dimensional structure—cannot be properly verified within the classical 2D measurement space. Their projection onto a plane geometrically distorts the actual relationships between variables or persons, leading to false simplifications and erroneous interpretations. In response to this limitation, the article proposes an expansion of the measurement space using tools from artificial intelligence—specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel—which enable the transformation of data into higher-dimensional spaces.\nThe article shifts the focus of measurement from relationships between variables to relationships between individuals, treated as vectors of psychological traits. It demonstrates that the kernel RBF not only classifies data but transforms the very space in which the data operate—creating a new geometric framework in which the verification of complex and deep models becomes possible. In this new logic, individuals become carriers of the model rather than mere data observations. The concept culminates in a proposal for a psychometric scale based on independent response vectors, compatible with the structure of kernel space. Altogether, this constitutes a breakthrough shift: from variable space to person space, from geometric projections to the structural depth of psychological models.",

To control for such variables, researchers working on German Sign Language (DGS) need to use stimuli rated for these constructs (e.g., iconicity) by an independent group of participants before implementing their actual experiment. Up to now, several research groups have made such rating data publicly available but a central resource is currently still lacking. Against this background, this short paper provides a roadmap for the collaborative creation of a so-called “DGS-LEX”, a lexical database for psycholinguistic research on DGS, similar to ASL-LEX. By integrating relevant data from different published and forthcoming studies, this joint effort aims to establish a new database for lexical variables in DGS primarily based upon subjective ratings.

          "abstract": "This study explores how collective ritual events can induce social bonding through the blurring of self-other boundaries, a phenomenon often associated with awe and self-transcendence. Building on insights from ritual studies, social bonding, and body ownership illusions, we designed an experiment where participants engaged in an art performance titled ‘MASS’. This performance involved dancers moving in synchrony or in-canon behind and next to a pair of seated participants, creating a ‘mirror fusion’ effect that blurred the boundaries between the two participants. The results show that experiencing a synchronous performance induces more self-other boundary blurring than an in-canon performance, and self-other boundary blurring significantly predicts the experience of awe and an increase in bonding with the other participant. These findings suggest that art performances induce social bonding effects typically observed in religious rituals, highlighting the role of synchrony and awe in inducing cohesion during collective experiences. This study contributes to the understanding of the embodied mechanisms of collective effervescence.",

We propose that this intuitive ``truth bias’’ may be an ecologically rational adaptation to environments where information is typically accurate. Across a large-scale pre-registered survey experiment and an incentivized replication, we test whether intuitions indeed adapt to the base rate of true versus false content. Participants viewed news feeds composed primarily of either true or false headlines. We find that individuals make more—and faster—errors when encountering the less frequent headline type, and fewer errors with the more common type. Computational modeling of the deliberative process reveals these effects are driven by intuitive responses that function like Bayesian priors about content accuracy, which exhibit some persistence. Our findings suggest that susceptibility to misinformation may not merely reflect a cognitive failure, but rather a rational byproduct of learning from statistical regularities in digital environments.",

Previous studies have pointed to the importance of the spatial associations between objects and scenes in informing search strategies. However, the assumptions about objects having a specific location that they are typically found does not take into account the imprecision inherent in the spatial associations of objects. In the current study, we investigated the effects of the variability of objects’ spatial associations on visual search. First, we quantified this variation and developed the Object Spatial Certainty index by having participants rate where 150 objects were expected to be found in scenes; the index provides a relative measure that ranks these objects from the most spatially predictable (almost always found in one region of the scene, e.g., boots) to the least spatially predictable (equally likely to be in every region of the scene, e.g., plant). In two experiments, we examined how these variations affected search by manipulating targets are either being High Certainty or Low Certainty. Our findings demonstrate that the variability of spatial association of objects significantly affected how effectively scene context influences search performance.",

While existing behavioral research on moral appeals has primarily focused on \nharms inflicted on animals, this study takes a different approach by examining whether \nemphasizing the negative impacts of factory farming on human well-being can influence \nattitudes and behavioral intentions. Drawing on two evolutionary frameworks—the Adaptive \nConservation Rule and Morality-as-Cooperation—we tested whether highlighting human\ncentered harms could shift perceptions of animal welfare and related behaviors. \nIn a preregistered experiment (N = 403), participants were exposed to messages \ndescribing how factory farming disrupts different domains of cooperation, focusing on human \nhealth, labor conditions, community well-being, and environmental outcomes. We assessed \nmoral concern for factory-farmed animals, intentions to choose more sustainable animal \nproducts, and willingness to support organizations opposing factory farming. \nThe messages did not produce significant effects on any outcome measures. However, \nperceived fitness interdependence (PFI)—the extent to which individuals view their well-being \nas linked to that of animals—consistently predicted pro-animal and anti-factory farming \noutcomes. Endorsement of moral values such as Loyalty, Fairness, and Reciprocity, as well as \nstakeholder identity, also influenced these outcomes. \nThese findings suggest that moral framing alone may be insufficient to shift consumer \nattitudes and behaviors.

Although the basic configuration of the JD-R model has hardly changed, it is increasingly being referred to as a theory. This paper sets out to critically review the framework, its basic assumptions, and the extent to which it lives up to this seemingly more mature status. Specifically, we argue that the ever-increasing attention the model is receiving paradoxically is due not to its logical capacity to explain when or why a particular (i.e. specified) resource or demand will instigate health impairment or a motivational process, but instead its superficiality. In this paper, we describe the qualities of a robust theory following principles of philosophy of science and demonstrate how the JD-R model performs in relation to scientific standards. In addition, we analyzed the ideological assumptions of the model, questioning aspects of the model that to date have not been critically discussed. With our review, we seek to stimulate greater understanding of whether and how conceptually distinct demands and resources constructs idiosyncratically relate to individual and organizational outcomes in different contexts, therewith encouraging the development of more robust and refined frameworks for understanding job-related stress.",

Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and illustrate how our approach can be applied to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam. We further demonstrate how it differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study and conclude with the broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

          "abstract": "Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has become popular to assess dietary intake in real life and real time. Available tools differ substantially in the type and number of implemented features including features to assess what and how much was consumed. The features require qualitatively different input that might exert differential impact on the participants’ cognitions and behaviours while taking part in the study. This preregistered online experimental study aimed to test whether more complex dietary assessment tools, indicated by the type and number of assessment features, induce more active information processing. A total of 373 participants (65.4% female; mean age 30.4 years) were randomly allocated to viewing one of eight EMA protocol mock-ups, each describing a food tracking process verbally and using screenshots. Afterwards, they rated the protocol in terms of its complexity (manipulation check), active information processing and its potential impact on eating-related cognitions, intentions and eating behaviour change. The eight EMA protocols differed regarding perceived complexity, i.e. protocols with more tracking features were perceived as more complex compared with ones with fewer tracking features. EMA protocols that were perceived to be more complex were also perceived to induce more active information processing. However, there were no differences regarding perceived impact on eating-related cognitions, intentions, and behaviour. These differences in complexity and usability may influence compliance and study results. Researchers thus need to carefully select the appropriate EMA protocol for their study to balance the need for collected information with the need for high compliance.",

This randomization approach allowed the estimation of peer group socialization effects unconfounded by selection effects. We conducted a series of robustness checks to determine whether regression to the mean constitutes an alternative explanation for the results. The preregistered, confirmatory models seemed to support the hypothesis of peer group influence for all Big Five traits, showing patterns of assimilation where an individual’s personality became more similar to the personality of the remaining group members over time. Robustness checks, however, demonstrated convincingly that these patterns were due to the statistical artifact of regression to the mean and should not be interpreted as substantive evidence for peer group influence.

Functional neuroimaging evidence shows that the motor cortex is involved in speech production and in perceptual phonemic processing. This highlights the embodied nature of speech perception, predicting the potential benefits of sensorimotor-based training approaches to enhance the acquisition of foreign speech sounds. Hence, here we first review current findings on the motor contribution to not only native but also non-native phoneme perception. Available evidence has established that motor cortical activity especially shows up under non-optimal perceptual conditions, such as when native phonemes are degraded by noise or when listeners perceive non-native speech sounds. Drawing upon this evidence, we then review training paradigms that have been developed for learning foreign phonemes, with a special emphasis on those embedding manual gestures as cues to represent phonetic features of the to-be-learned speech sounds. By pointing to both strengths and caveats of available studies, this review allows us to delineate a clear framework and opens perspectives to optimize foreign phoneme learning, and ultimately support perception and production.",

          "abstract": "Though theoretical accounts describe self-regulation as dynamic, empirical studies typically rely on static measures that fail to capture changes in self-regulation from day to day or moment to moment. As a result, little is known about how or why children’s self-regulation may vary within-person, despite clear relevance for educators. In this paper, we capitalized on repeated observations from wearable devices to test the idea that daily increases in activity (DIA) across the school day could reflect a school-age child’s inability to regulate their physical activity to be appropriate to the school setting. In a national sample followed from birth to age 26 (N = 747; 49% female, 76% White, 13% Black, 6% Hispanic, 5% Other), children showing greater DIA in third grade, objectively measured using actigraphy at school and charted across hourly intervals, were rated as more impulsive and disruptive by teachers and classroom observers, had lower academic achievement in high school (β = -0.11), and completed fewer years of education as adults (β = -0.05). These findings reveal a temporal dimension to children’s behavioral regulation at school. Findings suggest that children’s behavioral regulation, proxied by the ability to inhibit motor activity, deteriorates across the school day and that children who can sustain behavioral regulation for longer go on to greater educational success long-term. Findings also reveal temporal patterns of behavior in third grade that motivate future investigations into daily experiences that could restore children’s behavioral regulation.",

There are few studies in low-and middle-income countries where most of the worlds’ adolescents live. We investigated whether adolescents’ relationships with their parents and peers mediated the association between their economic circumstances and internalising symptoms in Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam.\n\nMethods: We analysed longitudinal data of 3,529 adolescents from the Young Lives study (1,741 female [49.3%]). Household consumption expenditure and adolescents’ subjective assessment of household wealth were measured at age 15. The mediators – adolescents’ positive relations with their parents and peers – were measured at age 19. The outcome – internalising symptoms, characterised by low mood and anxiety – was measured at age 22. Mediation was assessed through counterfactual g-computation formula, adjusting for baseline and intermediate confounders.\n\nFindings: We found no evidence that adolescents’ positive relations with their parents and peers mediated the association between economic circumstances and internalising symptoms in any country. Living in poorer economic circumstances was typically associated with greater future internalising symptoms.\n\nInterpretation: The role of adolescents’ parent and peer relationships in mediating the effects of poorer economic circumstances on internalising mental health is potentially less important in these countries compared to a more important role in high-income countries as highlighted by previous studies. Further research is needed to explore other potential mechanisms, including different aspects of social relationships, that might influence mental health outcomes for adolescents living in poverty across different settings.",

The current study attempts to address this gap in knowledge, recruiting a sample of straight and LGB participants (N = 242) to explore differences in consent attitudes across sexual orientations. Participants read four staggered vignettes depicting ambiguous sexual encounters. Findings revealed significant differences in consent attitudes between straight and LGB participants. On average, straight participants had fewer positive attitudes about consent compared to LGB participants. Additionally, exploratory analyses found that bisexual participants consent attitudes were more predictive of their consent judgements across vignettes featuring different gender combinations, compared to both straight and gay/lesbian participants. These findings suggest that not only do attitudes toward sexual consent vary across sexual identities, but the extent to which these attitudes inform judgments about consent may also vary.",

          "abstract": "The contemporary study of human language and communication has expanded beyond its traditional focus on spoken and written forms to incorporate gestures, facial expressions, and sign languages. This shift has been accompanied by methodological advancements that extend beyond classical tools such as tape recorders or video cameras and include motion-tracking systems, depth cameras, and multimodal data fusion techniques. While these tools enable richer empirical insights, they also introduce significant conceptual and practical challenges, particularly for researchers new to multimodal data collection. This paper provides a structured exploration of the methodological workflow essential to multimodal language and communication research. We present a flexible decision-making framework that guides researchers through key considerations, from data selection and its alignment with research questions, to data collection methods, technical requirements, and data management, including ethical considerations and data sharing. We also address critical factors such as equipment choice, data synchronization, and ethical concerns (e.g., privacy and data protection) while illustrating these processes with examples from different research contexts (i.e., lab-based experiments, large-scale annotated corpora, field studies including non-human primates). Rather than advocating a one-size-fits-all approach, our discussion emphasizes key decision points, trade-offs and real-world examples to help researchers navigate the complexities of multimodal data collection. By integrating perspectives from different disciplines, our flexible decision-making framework is intended as a practical tool for newcomers to address common conceptual and methodological challenges in the rapidly developing area of multimodal data collection.",

          "abstract": "For many deaf people, lip-reading plays a major role in verbal communication. However, lip reading is inherently ambiguous and does not allow for a complete understanding of speech. The consequences of these limitations are significant, potentially impeding language, cognitive, and social development. Cued speech (CS) was developed to eliminate this ambiguity by supplementing lip-reading with hand gestures, giving access to the entire phonological content of speech through the visual modality alone. Despite its documented efficacy in enhancing linguistic and communicative abilities, the mechanisms of CS perception remain largely unknown. The present study is the first to examine eye movements during CS perception, with a sample of deaf CS users, hearing CS users, and hearing naive controls. We presented silent videos of words, pseudowords, and sentences in their CS form, while recording the participants’ eye movements. All groups fixated almost exclusively on the face, and predominantly on the lips of the speaker, despite the effective processing of CS gestures by CS users. Deaf and hearing participants differed strikingly in the way fixation was distributed between the left and right halves of the face. While both hearing groups mostly fixated the left side of the speaker’s face, deaf participants showed a more symmetrical pattern. Finally, in CS users, stimuli that were phonologically, lexically or semantically more difficult tended to increase fixation in the inferior and left sector of the face. Apart from reading, CS stands as the sole system for visually conveying full phonological information of a spoken language. This study elucidates the fundamental behavioral tuning that facilitates the efficient recovery of phonology in this distinctive form.",

          "abstract": "Background: A high proportion of people with aphasia may have substantial difficulties with numerical processing and calculation. Such difficulties are likely to have a significant emotional and practical effect on individuals. However, numeracy difficulties are rarely assessed or managed clinically. This study aims to provide insight into speech-language pathologists’ (SLPs’) experiences of and attitudes towards supporting individuals with numeracy difficulties.\n\nMethodology: We disseminated an online survey to reach a representative sample of SLPs in the United States and United Kingdom. Sixty three respondents completed the survey comprising 22 items, collecting information about: difficulties observed in numerical processing and calculation; work carried out to address these; possible facilitators and barriers for work on numeracy.\n\nResults: SLPs reported observing a range of difficulties in numerical processing (e.g. counting, transcoding) and calculation (e.g. addition, multiplication), as well as in functional numeracy skills (e.g. paying bills, calculating a tip), but low levels of confidence regarding their assessment and treatment. Where difficulties were addressed in intervention, this most often targeted functional skills. Barriers to working on numeracy included a lack of standards relating to management of difficulties as well as appropriate assessments and intervention approaches.\n\nDiscussion: Respondents felt that numeracy was relevant in their work but that additional training would be beneficial. Future work could explore the effects of incorporating numeracy into clinical training on outcomes for aphasic individuals. The development of more assessments and evidence-based interventions for numeracy difficulties in aphasia could help to improve the management of this largely unmet clinical need.",

Leveraging advancements in natural language processing to overcome limitations of behavioral research, this study employed word embeddings to investigate more nuanced societal-level positive self-bias in human languages and its universality across cultures and historical periods using multilingual corpora totaling approximately two trillion words. We first validated the presence of positive self-bias in English. Cross-cultural comparisons then revealed self-deprecation tendencies in trait-based self-evaluation in specific Eastern languages, contrasting with Western patterns. However, affective self-positivity—the tendency to associate the self with generally positive rather than negative words—was universally observed across 11 languages. Analysis of 200 years of English texts further substantiated this dichotomy: while trait self-positivity fluctuated historically, affective self-positivity remained stable. These findings support a dual-dimensional model of positive self-bias that reconciles longstanding debates.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

Body dissatisfaction is a shared risk factor for EDs and depression. Given the limited nature of accessible, affirming resources, LGBTQ+ youth often seek mental health support online. To reduce body dissatisfaction at-scale, we developed a digital, single-session intervention (SSI)—Project Body Neutrality. A total of 218 LGBTQ+ adolescents (ages 13-17) with body image and mood concerns were recruited online and randomized to Project Body Neutrality or to a control. Both conditions were highly acceptable, and a qualitative analysis of open-ended feedback elucidates what participants found most helpful about Project Body Neutrality. Compared to control participants, intervention participants reported significantly greater immediate positive changes in body dissatisfaction, functionality appreciation, hopelessness, and perceived agency. At 3-month follow-up, these differences were not sustained. Across the full sample, there were no significant differences between groups in 3-month reductions in ED psychopathology or depression symptoms. However, an exploratory analysis indicates that the intervention had a significant effect on ED psychopathology among participants at-risk for EDs (as opposed to those above the clinical threshold). Future research would benefit from further investigation of when, for whom, and within what treatment-seeking context Project Body Neutrality may be most impactful (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06172452).",

          "abstract": "The meeting in which the United States and Ukraine were supposed to sign a rare earth minerals deal attracted a lot of attention, and its course elicited strong opinions, especially in Europe. Common views included President Zelenskyy having been treated unfairly. A closer analysis of the meeting reveals a more multifaceted picture of the events. \n\nThe main difference in perspectives appeared to be whether to take a judgmental attitude towards Russia or maintain a neutral position. Many interpreted taking a neutral stance to be an acceptance of the actions of Russia and a betrayal of Ukraine or democratic values. Taking a judgmental position was considered a moral requirement, whereas the White House considered a non-judgmental attitude a necessary condition for successful negotiations. Zelenskyy ignored previous guidance from the White House, stated his unwillingness to compromise, and maintained a distrustful attitude towards the capability of the White House to secure peace. Instead, he appeared to be looking for emotional support for the war trauma of his people and himself, whereas the White House considered such a pursuit in the context of the meeting an obstacle. \n\nThis article contributes an annotated transcript with a proposed emotional structure of the conversation, as well as some additional analysis. The main issue appeared to be Zelenskyy's refusal to agree to the necessary conditions set by the White House, combined with his distrust of Trump's judgment.",

Mental imagery vividness varies along a spectrum, with aphantasia at the lower extreme, where individuals report a reduced or absent ability to visualize voluntarily. However, they can recall visual information from memory. For example, they can state from memory that Bordeaux is left of Paris on a map of France while denying any mental imagery. What cognitive mechanisms underlie this dissociation? \nSome theories suggest aphantasia stems from impaired image generation, while others propose it reflects a lack of metacognitive awareness of visual mental imagery.\nThis study examines oculomotor and pupillometry patterns in typical imagery and aphantasia during a mental exploration task involving an imagined map of France. We test four competing hypotheses: (i) reduced eye movements in aphantasia due to absent mental images, (ii) increased exploratory eye movements as a sensorimotor compensatory strategy, (iii) typical eye movements with impaired metacognitive access, or (iv) heterogeneous eye movement patterns. We also predict greater pupil dilation in aphantasia, indicating increased cognitive load. By distinguishing between these possibilities, this study will contribute to the understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Teaching efficacy plays a crucial role in both teacher and student outcomes. Despite its importance, there are issues with the measurement and statistical representation of teaching efficacy. This study evaluated several measurement models of teaching efficacy, identifying the bifactor exploratory structural equation model (B-ESEM) as the best-fitting solution. We assessed its measurement invariance across five countries (Brazil, Mainland China, Singapore, USA, and Slovenia) and examined its criterion validity with respect to job satisfaction with the environment and the profession. The B- ESEM demonstrated strong measurement invariance, confirming that teaching efficacy, as measured by both general (G) and specific (S) factors, is interpreted similarly across different cultural and linguistic contexts. This contrasts with prior studies which used traditional confirmatory factor analysis that found only weak or partial invariance, highlighting the advantages of using B-ESEM to eliminate country- level biases. Criterion validity results indicated that general (G) teaching efficacy was systematically positively linked with job satisfaction and there was one single S-factor that was linked with job satisfaction: efficacy for student engagement was positively associated with satisfaction with the work environment, but not with satisfaction with the profession. These findings offer implications for theoretical refinement and applied research. Future research should explore longitudinal designs and continue employing advanced statistical methods to reflect the multidimensional nature of teaching efficacy.",

Presumably because of this, abrupt onsets tend to capture attention even when other types of distractors, such as color singletons, do not. However, there has been a lack of consensus on the definition and measurement of physical salience. As a result, it is unclear if high physical salience is indeed the reason why abrupt onsets tend to capture attention more strongly than other types of stimuli. Using a psychophysical technique recently developed by Stilwell et al. (2023), we explicitly quantified the level of physical salience of abrupt onsets, color singletons, and color singleton onsets. Surprisingly, abrupt onsets were the least salient among the three types of items. Despite this, only abrupt onsets captured attention in a subsequent visual search task, whereas the other two types of distractors were suppressed. These results indicate that high physical salience is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for abrupt onsets to capture attention.",

Characters were programmed with distinct \"cores\" and placed in ethically complex situations. Their behaviors, when observed across conflicting POVs, reveal that moral judgment is a byproduct of perspective, not truth.\nFindings suggest that in the absence of a centralized self, narrative continuity becomes the only viable method of psychological survival. The study demonstrates that fictional multi-POV modeling can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool for examining existential fragmentation and the illusion of moral objectivity.\nThis is not fiction as art, nor fiction as entertainment.\n It is fiction as function—designed to hold together a consciousness\n that no longer possesses a stable \"I\" to hold itself.",

          "abstract": "The lateral visual stream has been recently proposed as a third visual stream, in addition to the ventral and dorsal streams, specialized for processing dynamic social content. While prior work has suggested that the regions of this pathway form a hierarchy representing increasingly abstract information, the computations along this pathway are still largely unknown. High spatiotemporal resolution data are particularly informative for characterizing the information flow and thus neural computations across different brain regions. Using a novel regression approach, we combine data from EEG, fMRI, and behavior in response to the same videos to leverage the high temporal resolution of EEG and whole-brain spatial resolution of fMRI. We find that low-level visual features are represented in early visual cortex with a short temporal latency and are not represented in higher-level regions of the lateral stream. Further, we find that mid-level features are represented in mid-level lateral regions with a shorter latency than high-level features in more anterior regions of the lateral pathway. However, both mid- and high-level features were decodable in anterior regions of the lateral pathway with a similar latency. Together, these results provide evidence that features of social actions are processed rapidly in the lateral visual stream in a manner that is consistent with hierarchical processing, but the lateral stream does not exhibit a strict temporal sequence of representational transformations along the posterior-to-anterior axis.",

The dataset also includes detailed physical properties such as hand height, distance to the body, arm angle, hand configuration, palm orientation, repetitions, size, and speed, alongside 3D pose tracking data. Where possible, video recordings provide additional multimodal context. Notably, we identified several previously undocumented lexemes, expanding the current lexicon of gesture research.

This study aims to explore the use of the method of loci, which involves associating each item of a to-be-memorized list with a location along a familiar route, that we adapted to leverage pre-existing knowledge in semantic memory. The memory of young (18–30 years old) and older (60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci under two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a control condition. The objective was to assess memory performance improvement based on encoding conditions and age groups. The results showed significant memory performance improvements in both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, performance in the incongruent condition was similar to that observed during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic links for associative memory.  Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent associations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was not the case with incongruent associations. The method of loci applied in conditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for older adults.",

It was hypothesized that individuals with public speaking anxiety who hold on longer to a decrease in threat expectancy likelihood after the exposure exercise (slower speed of return to equilibrium), show greater benefit from subsequent exposure intervention (i.e., less public speaking anxiety). Participants with subclinical public speaking anxiety (N = 60, M age = 25.42) completed an exposure exercise and momentary assessments in daily life (eight times per day) three days before and four days after the exposure exercise. One week later, they did an online one-session exposure intervention to decrease public speaking anxiety. Result showed that threat expectancy likelihood decreased after the exposure exercise and public speaking anxiety decreased after the intervention. Against expectations, speed of return to expectancy likelihood equilibrium did not predict intervention effects. Potential explanations of null results are discussed, like sampling frequency to measure speed of return to equilibrium and timing of the exposure exercise. Given the potential of dynamic predictors for exposure therapy outcome, more research is needed to examine the conditions in which speed of return to equilibrium predicts subsequent treatment outcome in anxiety.",

          "authors": "Ana Carolina Kodama Cottington; Yuichi Shoda",
          "abstract": "Background: Camouflaging is a strategy widely used by autistic individuals to conceal their autistic behaviors in response to stigma; however, it is also associated with negative mental health outcomes. Because identity cues in social environments can signal either stigma or safety and shape how individuals experience their identity, they may also directly influence the extent to which autistic people engage in camouflaging. In a social psychological experiment, we examined the extent to which autistic adults adjust their camouflaging efforts in response to autism-affirming or stigmatizing identity cues within a controlled setting.  Method: Using the Highly-Repeated Within-Person design, we tracked 135 autistic adults’ reports of camouflaging efforts across 24 hypothetical situations each featuring either autism-affirming or autism-stigmatizing identity cues.  Results: Most participants reported significantly less camouflaging efforts in situations with autism-affirming (vs. autism-stigmatizing) cues. This was particularly the case for those who more strongly identified with the autistic community. The study also demonstrated substantial diversity among autistic individuals in the effect of identity cue type on camouflaging efforts, even after accounting for participants' strength of identification with the autistic community. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that autism-affirming cues can create environments where autistic people feel safe to express themselves authentically. At the same time, the finding that identity cues influenced camouflaging efforts differently for each participant highlights the limitations of a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, underscoring the need to further explore individual differences among autistic adults.",

          "abstract": "Adults often hold different goals for children’s achievement: Sometimes they want a child to learn and develop their skills as much as possible (i.e., a learning goal), while other times they may forego a child’s learning in favor of successful performance (i.e., a performance goal). How do children think these achievement goals influence adults’ child-directed behaviors? Across two preregistered experiments (n = 90 adults; n = 160 5- to 8-year-old children), we found that children systematically predict that an adult would select a more difficult task for a recipient child when the adult held a learning (vs. performance) goal, and when the recipient was more competent. Importantly, we found that this pattern matched adults’ actual task choices, although adults showed more sensitivity to choosing a task that anchors closely to what a child can reasonably learn from or accomplish. These results suggest children can reason about how adult’s achievement goals manifest into observable actions, which may have consequences for children’s own goal orientations and task selections.",

          "abstract": "Retrieved-context models of memory posit that a slowly drifting neural context signal is encoded alongside items in memory. However, this signal can be disrupted by event boundaries, affecting the temporal relationships between items across event boundaries. Here, we investigated how temporal proximity and event boundaries affect the detailed recall of events. Specifically, we assessed memory for events in the movie Forrest Gump, chosen specifically because of its hierarchical event structure with individual events in the movie being nested within broader life-periods (e.g., childhood, college, etc.). Importantly, the trial order at recall was structured such that adjacent trials tested events that were (1) either temporally close or far and (2) either within or across a life period. Participants provided both more event-specific details and more false memories for an event when the preceding event came from the same life period, suggesting that recall of the life period supported recall of episodic information, but also increased the likelihood of providing false information. Further, participants provided more intrusions from non-cued events after just recalling an event that was temporally distant, with this effect exacerbated if the preceding event was also across a life period boundary. Quantifying event similarity between the cued event and the sources of intrusions suggests that participants may be providing supplementary information to help scaffold memory for the cued event. Altogether, these results demonstrate that both temporal proximity and event boundaries affect detailed memory recall, extending previous findings into the domain of naturalistic events.",

Through a simulated narrative environment—designed using fictional characters with divergent psychological and sociocultural frameworks—the project examines how morality, agency, and emotional allegiance are constructed entirely from narrative positioning.\nThe researcher, lacking a stable core-self, employs artificial intelligence as a narrative processor and external mirror to explore questions of moral subjectivity and identity formation. Characters were programmed with distinct \"cores\" and placed in ethically complex situations. Their behaviors, when observed across conflicting POVs, reveal that moral judgment is a byproduct of perspective, not truth.\nFindings suggest that in the absence of a centralized self, narrative continuity becomes the only viable method of psychological survival. The study demonstrates that fictional multi-POV modeling can serve as a powerful diagnostic tool for examining existential fragmentation and the illusion of moral objectivity.\nThis is not fiction as art, nor fiction as entertainment.\n It is fiction as function—designed to hold together a consciousness\n that no longer possesses a stable \"I\" to hold itself.",

However, it is unclear which component processes are altered, and how other aspects of neurodiversity (e.g., ADHD traits) affect these processing stages.

In Study 1 we validated our approach and investigated relationships between diffusion-model parameters and autism- and ADHD-related traits in the general population (n=130). Study 2 investigated group differences between diagnosed autistic (n=100) and non-autistic (n=100) adults with comparable non-verbal reasoning ability, and assessed relationships with ADHD traits. Study 1 found no relationships between diffusion-model parameters and autism and ADHD-related traits in the general population. Study 2 revealed that autistic individuals had shorter non-decision times than non-autistic individuals, reflecting less time taken for sensory encoding and/or response generation, with no group differences in sensory evidence accumulation or response caution. We also found that individuals with higher motor hyperactivity-impulsivity had lower non-decision times and that individuals with higher verbal hyperactivity-impulsivity accumulated evidence more slowly. The diffusion model therefore reveals the convergence and divergence of processing stages in autism and across ADHD-related traits.",

Extant literature has typically sampled from countries where NCSII has long been illegal, such as the United Kingdom (UK); neglecting perspectives from countries lacking NCSII-specific legislation, such as Norway at the time of data collection. \nMethods: Participants (n = 477) from the UK and Norway responded to vignettes depicting NCSII, which differed by the survivor-perpetrator relationship depicted (i.e., casual vs. committed). \nResults: Controlling for participant sex and psychopathic personality traits (previously implicated in judgements of image-based sexual abuse), UK citizens perceived NCSII to have worse impacts on survivors than Norwegian citizens. Moreover, data trends suggested participants attributed increased victim-blame in vignettes featuring casual relationships, with higher self-reported psychopathic personality traits predicting judgements associated with viewing NCSII as less criminal in nature. \nConclusion: These findings emphasise a need to better understand the role of legislation in public perceptions of NCSII (and image-based sexual abuse more broadly) and the need to be conscious about further exploring technology-facilitated crime internationally.",

To shed light on learners’ metamotivational beliefs about rewards, this study investigated Saudi language learners’ (N = 316) attitudes toward, perceived effects of, and reported prevalence of certain task rewards (namely, competitively contingent, performance contingent, task contingent, non-contingent, unexpected, and positive feedback) to examine how these beliefs correspond to evidence-based recommendations. Results revealed that learners recognized the value of positive feedback. However, they also favored and believed that competitions and performance-contingent rewards would enhance motivation, contrary to empirical evidence. There were also some gender differences, with male learners favoring performance-contingent rewards more, while female learners reported a higher prevalence of competitions and performance-contingent rewards and a lower prevalence of positive feedback. The findings demonstrate a mismatch between learners’ metamotivational beliefs endorsing undermining rewards and research on their detrimental effects. These results have implications for enhancing intrinsic motivation, quality engagement, and psychological well-being.",

          "abstract": "A switch cost can be observed in cued task-switching on trials that follow a cue-only trial, which presents a task cue indicating a task to be performed but does not present a target stimulus to be responded to. This finding has provided important implications as to the source of the performance cost that emerges when switching tasks. However, cue-only trials differ from completed trials (for which the target occurs and is responded to) in several task parameters, and there are a few untested assumptions about a task-switch cost after cue-only trials, which restricted the conditions under which cue-only trials have been used. The present study first examined whether a switch cost emerged after cue-only trials when cue-only trials were matched with completed trials in as many task parameters as possible, and found that an expected switch cost following cue-only trials was absent in response time. In the subsequent six experiments, we explored critical task parameters to obtain a switch cost after cue-only trials. The present results indicate that the use of a short preparation interval was an important factor and that the switch cost was more short-lived and dissipated more quickly after cue-only trials than after completed trials. These outcomes are consistent with the proposal that there are at least two sources of a task-switch cost, one that originates from processing a task cue and another that originates from performing a cued task. Early processes of task preparation (e.g., cue or task identification) may be sufficient to produce the switch cost after cue-only trials, but response-related processes might generate a more persistent switch cost.",

          "abstract": "To understand how the brain responds to robots with varying levels of human-likeness, we investigated the electrophysiological neural correlates of the uncanny valley effect while human observers viewed pictures of various robot faces. We examined three event-related potentials (N400, N170, and Late Positive Potential, or LPP) and two oscillatory components (frontal alpha asymmetry and frontal-midline theta) and found characteristic non-linear trajectories of the N400 amplitude when plotted against the self-rated human-likeness of the robot faces, similar to the trajectory found for the self-rated likability score. The frontal alpha asymmetry also showed a similar trajectory but not was statistically significant, while the N170, LPP, and frontal-midline theta showed parabolic trajectories against the human-likeness scores. The N170 appeared to show larger amplitudes for more mechanical robot faces with little change across more human-like faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta produced the highest amplitudes for the middle ranges of the human-likeness scores, with lower amplitudes for more mechanical and near-human-like faces. These results corroborated the proposal that the uncanny valley effect stems from expectation violation for human faces, but they surprisingly provided little evidence for affective reactions to uncanny robot faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta could reflect increased cognitive control for ambiguous faces rather than their uncanniness, whereas the N170 appeared to reflect visual processing of facial configurations irrespective of their emotional contents. These findings suggest that the uncanny valley effect is primarily a cognitive phenomenon, and its emotional impact might be less prominent than commonly believed.",

          "abstract": "Our ability to produce words and sentences relies on lexical retrieval and structural assembly processes, which are supported by domain-general skills. Important topics in current psycholinguistics concern the degree of interaction of both processes and the cognitive costs they incur. Targeting the latter topic, we used an individual-differences approach to test whether the involvement of domain-general skills in language production varies as a function of task complexity. Our participants (n = 169) completed three production tasks that capitalized on lexical retrieval (picture naming) and structural assembly (phrase generation and sentence generation) processes, respectively. In addition, they completed 15 tests measuring linguistic experience, processing speed, working memory, and nonverbal reasoning. Our analysis showed that extensive linguistic experience sped up onset latencies. However, its effect interacted with task, suggesting that it benefited picture naming more than phrase and sentence generation. Critically, this effect was complementary to that of processing speed, which selectively predicted phrase and sentence production but not picture naming. Nonverbal reasoning affected onset latencies in all three tasks, suggesting a non-selective influence. Working memory only had a weak effect. Our findings suggest that while lexical retrieval is primarily supported by linguistic experience, structural assembly is more reliant on processing speed. By integrating multiple predictors, this study provides novel insights into the cognitive architecture underlying language production and highlights the value of a holistic individual-differences approach.",

Learners might find some of these analyses more attractive than others, explaining why an ambiguity arises when the distributional constraint is relaxed.\nWe employ an artificial grammar learning paradigm to test which interpretations of NPIs are preferred by learners when they encounter NPIs in a positive environment.

          "abstract": "Jessica Benjamin is a prominent figure in relational-intersubjective psychoanalysis. Her unique intersubjective recognition theory focuses primarily on the concepts of mutual recognition and the Third. Benjamin posits that dyads in interpersonal interactions engage in mutual influence and reciprocal shaping. Recognition, according to Benjamin, represents a psychic position where both parties are recognized as subjects, fostering a process of giving affirming responses to each other; the Third functions as a principle, function, or relationship that creates an intersubjective space, accommodating both commonalities and differences. Types of the Third includes the rhythmic Third, the differentiating Third, the moral Third, the symbolic Third, and so forth. The distinctiveness of Benjamin's intersubjective recognition theory are reflected in several aspects: The concept of recognition is inclusive because of the information transmission mode, the impact of intersubjective responsiveness, the manifestation of otherness, and the focus on both intrapersonal and intersubjective dimensions; the concept of the Third, akin to phenomenological reflection, is more effective than the concept of conflict. In general, Benjamin’s intersubjective recognition theory provides a paradigm for maintaining a tension between the scientific and humanistic dimensions of psychoanalysis.",

While event segmentation is a well-explored topic, its underlying mechanisms have remained a subject of debate. In this study, we address this debate by comparing the two contrasting theories of event segmentation: prediction error and contextual stability. In two experiments, we manipulated contextual stability while keeping prediction error constant. Event segmentation was more prominent when there were stable contexts (Experiment 2) compared to prediction errors among unstable contexts (Experiment 1). This stronger segmentation took place despite signs of a smaller prediction error in Experiment 2. We conclude that contextual stability plays a pivotal role in driving event \nsegmentation, highlighting its dominance over the role of prediction errors. Our study sheds new light on the mechanisms behind how our minds divide continuous experiences into meaningful memory units.",

Exposure to tobacco retail has been associated with smoking outcomes, but substantially less is known about how objectively logged day-to-day, real-world tobacco retail exposure is linked to smoking outcomes. \n\nObjective: To assess pre-registered hypotheses that individuals report greater craving and cigarettes smoked on days when their objectively logged retail exposure is higher than usual. Design: A 14-day within-person observational study combining objectively logged geolocation tracking, public tobacco-retail location records, and ecological momentary assessment. Data collection occurred from 2022 to 2024. \n\nSetting: A multimodal study including participants statewide in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. \nParticipants: Main eligibility criteria were: aged 21-65 years, smoked at least five cigarettes per day for the previous six months, owned an iPhone or Android smartphone, and a resident of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or Delaware. Participants were selected via convenience sampling. A total of 310 participants enrolled.\n\nExposure: To assess tobacco retail exposure, mobility data collected objectively via geolocation tracking was matched with locations of tobacco retailers across three states. \nMain Outcomes and Measures: Daily average craving and daily number of cigarettes smoked, reported via ecological momentary assessment. \n\nResults: A total of 273 participants were included in the final analyses (151 [55.3%] women; 175 [64.1%] white; mean [SD] age, 42.46 [10.69] years). Multilevel models revealed support for both pre-registered hypotheses. On days when individuals had more tobacco retail exposure than their usual baseline, they reported significantly higher levels of craving (b = 0.04, t(3,456.79) = 2.56, p = 0.01) and smoking significantly more cigarettes (b = 0.01, t(3,469) = 2.47, p = 0.01).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: People’s environments shape their feelings and behaviors. Exposure to tobacco retail in the real-world is associated with increases in craving and smoking. Findings highlight the significance of retail exposure in relation to smoking, information that is critical for developing effective tobacco control interventions, and lays foundations for broader health research on environmental factors shaping health behaviors.",

          "authors": "Ege Gür; Abigail Fergus; Keith Baxelbaum; Bob McMurray",
          "abstract": "Word recognition is supported by a competition process in which words that partially match the input are activated and vie for recognition. Recent work has shown that adolescents with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) do not fully resolve this competition, likely due to a deficiency in inhibition among words (lateral inhibition). It is not yet clear how this develops. Three experiments investigated the development of lateral inhibition using a variant of the Visual World Paradigm. Experiment 1 compared adults (N=35), older children (11-12) (N=43), and younger children (7-9) (N=45). In line with previous works, adults demonstrated robust inhibition, with marginal evidence in older children and no evidence in the youngest children. Experiment 2 tested 222 younger children to achieve greater statistical sensitivity and found a small but significant effect. Experiment 3 asked if these weaker effects were due to the younger listeners’ failure to activate competitors, or if competitors were active but simply not inhibiting the target. It found robust competitor activation even in younger children, suggesting the weaker effects may derive from true inhibition differences. Implications for DLD are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Conversation is a core component of human social life. Many influential theories treat conversation as a linear system, i.e., the sum of its parts. However, linear accounts of semantic entrainment lose explanatory power at their upper limits: discussing perfectly aligned opinions becomes boring. We propose an alternate account that treats conversation as a complex dynamical system. In such systems, pink noise is a hallmark of successful mutual adaptation. Here, we test whether pink noise can be found in interlocutors’ co-navigated trajectories through semantic space. Not only is pink noise present, but its strength predicts positive conversation outcomes, increases with practice, and is reflected in a large language model’s representation of conversation quality. These results demonstrate an important role for mutual adaptation in promoting successful conversation.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

Although lab studies provide the control necessary to identify the mechanisms behind behaviour, how these controlled situations generalise to activities in daily life remains unclear. Experience sampling provides useful descriptions of thought in the lab and real world and the current study examined how thought patterns generated by multi-dimensional experience sampling (mDES) generalise across both situations. We combined data from five published studies to generate a common thought-space using data from the lab and daily life. This space represented data from both lab and daily life in an unbiased manner and grouped lab tasks and daily life activities with similar features (e.g., working in daily life was similar to working memory in the lab). Our study establishes mDES can map cognition from lab and daily life within a common space, allowing for more ecologically valid descriptions of cognition and behaviour.",

          "authors": "Khena M. Swallow; Ruiyi Chen",
          "abstract": "The human mind automatically divides continuous experience into meaningful events (event segmentation). Despite abundant evidence that some kinds of situation changes (e.g., action, goal, or location changes) contribute to event segmentation, a component of experience that is critical for understanding and predicting others’ behavior, emotion, is rarely investigated. In two experiments, we sought to establish that viewers can track emotion changes while viewing naturalistic videos, and that these changes contribute to event segmentation. Participants watched commercial film excerpts while identifying either emotion changes or event boundaries (moments that separate two events) of different grains (Experiment 1: neutral-grain; Experiment 2: fine-grain or coarse-grain). We found that participants agreed with each other about when emotion changes occurred in the videos, demonstrating that viewers are able to track changes in the emotional content of dynamic naturalistic videos as they are experienced. Moreover, the emotion changes participants identified were temporally aligned with the event boundaries identified by other groups. In addition, valence and arousal ratings from separate groups of participants uniquely predicted the likelihood of identifying emotion changes and event boundaries, even after accounting for other types of change. However, emotion changes were more strongly tied to valence changes than arousal changes while coarse boundaries were more strongly associated with affective changes than were fine boundaries. These novel findings suggest that emotional information plays a substantial role in structuring ongoing experiences into meaningful events, providing a stronger basis for understanding how emotion shapes the perception and memory of everyday experiences.",

          "abstract": "To maintain and develop close relationships, people need to accurately represent the minds of their social partners. Although studies have characterized many aspects of children’s intuitive theory of the mind and children’s intuitive theory of relationships, it is largely unknown whether and how children think about mental state reasoning within relationships. In three experiments, we asked whether children think accurate mental state reasoning is a cue to social closeness. In Experiment 1 (n = 145), we found that 4- to 9-year-old children inferred that characters who are socially close know about each other’s goals and desires. In Experiment 2 (n = 137), we found that 6- to 9-year-old children, but not younger children, inferred that characters who are correct about each other’s minds are socially close. Children did not think that being correct about external states of the world was evidence that a character was close to another. In Experiment 3 (n = 79), we conceptually replicated the main findings from Experiments 1 and 2, and we found that 6- to 9-year-old children did not form the same inferences concerning knowledge about observable features of individuals (e.g., an individual’s outfit); children’s inferences were specific to unobservable mental content. Thus, by 6 years of age, children integrate their intuitive theories of the mind and relationships to make sense of whether and how people are connected to each other, as well as the strength and nature of those connections.",

          "authors": "Hirohito Okano; Michio Nomura",
          "abstract": "Self‑compassion, defined as compassion directed toward oneself in difficult situations, has been widely studied. However, the specific cognitive and behavioral patterns related to self-compassion remain poorly understood. Previous research that relies on predefined rating scales restricts the discovery of novel processes, whereas qualitative analyses of small free‑text samples suffer from limited generalizability. To address these limitations, we applied structural topic modeling—a natural language processing technique—to 9,360 free‑text responses (12 responses each from 780 participants; mean age = 43.0, SD = 10.6, range = 19–75) to identify thought and behavior patterns associated with self‑compassion. Participants responded to 12 free‑text prompts asking them to describe their typical thoughts and behaviors in three difficult situations (suffering, recognizing personal shortcomings, and experiencing failure). Higher self‑compassion was linked to topics reflecting problem‑solving orientation, balanced optimism, and adaptive flexibility. In contrast, lower self‑compassion was associated with self‑criticism, upward social comparison, envy, and depressive inaction. These patterns varied by context: for example, among individuals high in self‑compassion, balanced optimism predominated in contexts of suffering and failure, while adaptive flexibility emerged when participants recognized personal shortcomings. This study advances the literature by offering context‑sensitive, nuanced insights into self‑compassion across situations and providing a data‑driven foundation for future theoretical models and interventions. It also demonstrates that a data‑driven approach employing topic modeling on large‑scale free‑text data can uncover nuanced processes that conventional rating scales may not capture, with broad implications for emotion research and psychological science.",

By leveraging language’s unique properties - its efficiency in representing sensorimotor information, ability to extend across time and space, and generativity in constructing novel predictions - inner speech enables predictive processing to transcend immediate experience, encoding complex sensory experiences into linguistic forms for perceptual inference, while decoding abstract goals through situated action simulations for active control. By unifying previously disparate aspects of inner speech research, LAIT provides a comprehensive framework explaining how its diverse functions, varied phenomenology, and theoretical models emerge from its implementation of perceptual inference and active control through dynamic linguistic predictions, adapting to computational demands and fluctuating uncertainties across contexts. This synthesis generates novel testable hypotheses, underscores the need for methodological innovations in studying inner speech dynamics, and opens new perspectives on both related mental phenomena and the broader role of symbolic systems in cognition.",

Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) has emerged as a cost-effective intervention within workplace settings, but more generalisable evidence is lacking. This naturalistic, observational study investigated the impact of iCBT on work-related outcomes using nationally representative data from patients enrolled in routine care in Ireland. Methods. We analysed retrospective data from N=7125 patients enrolled in iCBT through the Irish national health service between March 2023-May 2024. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire was used to measure absenteeism, presenteeism, overall productivity loss, and activity impairment. Secondary outcomes included depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7). We used mixed-effects models to assess pre-post treatment changes in outcomes, and estimated cost-savings from productivity improvement using Irish median salary data. Results. Overall, patients showed significant improvements in all WPAI outcomes with small effect sizes (6-9%, d=.18-30). Greater improvements in workplace functioning were linked to larger reductions in depression (r=.10-.34) and anxiety symptoms (r=.06-.33), both of which on average reduced by ~3 points. Patients with higher baseline clinical severity experienced more substantial improvements in workplace functioning than subclinical patients. These productivity gains correspond to &gt;€4000 annual savings per patient treated, totalling to over €29 million for our nationally representative sample. Conclusion. Our findings support iCBT as a scalable, cost-effective intervention that can effectively improve workplace functioning associated with depression and anxiety when integrated within public health service provision.",

How do children think these achievement goals influence adults’ child-directed behaviors? Across two preregistered experiments (n = 90 adults; n = 160 5- to 8-year-old children), we found that children systematically predict that an adult would select a more difficult task for a recipient child when the adult held a learning (vs. performance) goal, and when the recipient was more competent. Importantly, we found that this pattern matched adults’ actual task choices, although adults showed more sensitivity to choosing a task that anchors closely to what a child can reasonably learn from or accomplish. These results suggest children can reason about how adult’s achievement goals manifest into observable actions, which may have consequences for children’s own goal orientations and task selections.",

We asked children and adults to view a television episode, a naturalistic task for which there exists a ground truth, and assessed their event cognition, forced-choice recognition for event details, ability to temporally order scenes, and free recall. Children’s free recall performance improved dramatically with age, with many young children recalling nothing, even though recognition measures showed retention. However, detail in free recall was related to both recognition and temporal order forced-choice memory performance in our full sample, showing agreement among memory measures. For children, free recall was additionally related to verbal skills and more adult-like event segmentation. We propose that free recall has a more protracted developmental trajectory because it requires more substantial verbal skills and better understanding of event schemas than forced-choice memory tasks.",

Residual IRTs exhibited strong sequential dependencies, being positively correlated at lags of one and two transitions.  We used this IRT model to evaluate the hypothesis that chunking helps subjects learn unstructured materials.  Specifically, we hypothesized that chunks would appear as a slow IRT, indicative of a boundary, followed by a sequence of fast IRTs.  Model-based analyses that included sequential dependencies in IRTs offered evidence for spontaneous chunking in free recall of lists that lacked any grouping or hierarchical structure.",

Quitting smoking is a good parallel to going veg*n in several ways: it’s a complex behavioral change, it’s good for one’s health (Oussalah et al., 2020) which motivates people to make the change (Faunalytics, 2021), and it’s a frequently-cued behavior. With this literature review, we explore this parallel using the concept of social contagion—the process of information (including attitudes or behaviors) spreading throughout a group— to examine peer influences on quitting smoking with the goal of generating hypotheses about peer-to-peer influence on veg*nism.",

          "abstract": "Universities usually support students with employability (i.e., interview) skills development using video content during classes.  The reason for searching for alternative learning approaches is mainly because of a lack of engagement from both staff and students. 3D full immersive VR application and 2D desktop computer simulations have previously been found to provide an effective alternative learning environment keeping students and staff engaged with the learning and teaching process. This study explores whether the independent learning environment using a 3D fully immersive application could enhance undergraduate students learning of interview skills compared to an independent use of the 2D desktop application and video presentation resources in a class environment. Students and staff took part in three different learning conditions (3D full immersive application, 2D desktop application and video in class), where participants' employability skills, user experience and presence were assessed. University staff rated the 3D fully immersive learning condition better for employability skills training, presence and user experience compared to the 2D desktop environment and lecture conditions. Students, on the other hand, found the 3D immersive application to be a more enjoyable experience than the other two learning conditions but no learning environment was significantly better than another. This raises a question regarding the integration of 3D fully immersive systems in class for employability training",

          "abstract": "Our emotional trajectories make up our affective experience—but these can be disrupted during mental illness. This study focuses on affect anchored to the parenting context (i.e., daily emotional exhaustion, emotional distance from children, and feeling fed up) to assess whether the way parenting affect fluctuates relates to dysfunction: parental burnout severity. We focus on three specific patterns (i.e., affective dynamic indices): inertia (i.e., persistence across days), variation (i.e., magnitude of change), and covariation (i.e., whether affect variables fluctuate together). We reanalyzed multiple datasets (from Belgium and the U.S.) yielding 180 parents who had rated their parenting affect daily for either three or eight weeks. We computed a regression model with all affective indices as predictors (controlling for mean levels), with parental burnout severity as the outcome variable. Results indicate that inertia of emotional distance predicts parental burnout severity across most sensitivity models (i.e., even with varied operationalizations of affective indices). No other temporal pattern (i.e., variation or covariation) robustly predicted parental burnout severity, although the mean levels of emotional distance and emotional exhaustion did. Results from sensitivity analyses emphasize that operationalization choices for affective indices can yield varying values and impact results.",

While previous research has examined various demographic and psychological factors, the role of personality traits remains relatively underexplored, especially in comparing attitudes toward AI and technology in general.

          "abstract": "Traditional measures of autistic traits such as the Autism Quotient (AQ) are argued to be male biased and may lead to missed or mis-diagnosed autism among females. The current study examined the efficacy of three questionnaires to identify adult autistic women: Autism Quotient (AQ50; male bias); Girls Questionnaire-Autism Spectrum Condition (GQ-ASC; modified for adult women); Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q; gender neutral). A sample of 343 autistic and 345 non-autistic women completed each questionnaire and the proportion of those scoring above or below each suggested cut-off were used to analyse specificity and sensitivity. The AQ50 was less sensitive in correctly identifying autistic women than both the CAT-Q and GQ-ASC. However, the AQ50 showed high specificity in correctly identifying most non-autistic women. The CAT-Q and GQ-ASC were equally highly effective in identifying autistic women but over half of non-autistic women scored above the cut-off for the GQ-ASC making it the least specific. Additional evaluative ratings and comments showed that autistic women found the AQ50 to be stereotyped and the least clear to interpret. The GQ-ASC was overall preferred despite some questions not feeling age appropriate. This study highlights the need for assessment questions that reflect the broader diversity of autistic traits.",

Beyond its well-documented emotional and executive dysfunctions, emerging evidence highlights distinct language processing abnormalities, including difficulties in resolving ambiguity, hyper-literal interpretations, and heightened sensitivity to threatening language. Recent advances in systematic review methodology and computational linguistics reveal gaps in earlier narrative reviews, particularly regarding methodological transparency, heterogeneity across OCD subtypes, and integration of objective linguistic biomarkers. This article synthesizes evidence linking neurotransmitter dysregulation (serotonin, dopamine, glutamate) and frontostriatal circuit abnormalities to language deficits in OCD, while emphasizing the need for rigorous methodologies, computational tools, and stratification by symptom dimensions. Preliminary findings suggest that language deficits may serve as endophenotypes, paving the way for personalized interventions.",

Mental imagery vividness varies along a spectrum, with aphantasia at the lower extreme, where individuals report a reduced or absent ability to visualize voluntarily. However, they can recall visual information from memory. For example, they can state from memory that Bordeaux is left of Paris on a map of France while denying any mental imagery. What cognitive mechanisms underlie this dissociation? \nSome theories suggest aphantasia stems from impaired image generation, while others propose it reflects a lack of metacognitive awareness of visual mental imagery.\nThis study examines oculomotor and pupillometry patterns in typical imagery and aphantasia during a mental exploration task involving an imagined map of France. We test four competing hypotheses: (i) reduced eye movements in aphantasia due to absent mental images, (ii) increased exploratory eye movements as a sensorimotor compensatory strategy, (iii) typical eye movements with impaired metacognitive access, or (iv) heterogeneous eye movement patterns. We also predict greater pupil dilation in aphantasia, indicating increased cognitive load. By distinguishing between these possibilities, this study will contribute to the understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying aphantasia.",

          "abstract": "Theories of embodied cognition suggest that after an initial visual processing stage, emotional faces elicit spontaneous facial mimicry (SFM), and that the accompanying change in proprioceptive facial feedback contributes to facial emotion recognition. However, this temporal sequence has not yet been properly tested, given the lack of methods allowing to manipulate or interfere with facial muscle activity at specific time points. The current study (N=52, 28 female) investigated this key question using EEG and facial neuromuscular electrical stimulation (fNMES) – a technique offering superior control over which facial muscles are activated and when. Participants categorised neutral, happy, and sad avatar faces as either happy or sad, and received fNMES (except in the control condition) to bilateral zygomaticus major muscles during early visual processing (-250 to +250 ms of face onset), or later visual processing, when SFM typically arises (500 to 1000 ms after face onset). Both early and late fNMES resulted in a happiness bias specific to neutral faces, which was mediated by a reduced N170 in the early window. In contrast, a modulation of the beta-band (13-22 Hz) coherence between somatomotor and occipital cortices was found in the late fNMES, although this did not predict categorisation choice. We propose that facial feedback biases emotion recognition at different visual processing stages by reducing visual processing load.",

          "authors": "Matti Toivo Juhani Heino",
          "abstract": "In today's rapidly evolving world, human behaviour plays a crucial role in addressing complex challenges. These span from mitigating non-communicable diseases, to climate action and pandemic preparedness. Traditional behaviour change research has focused on identifying and addressing specific factors that impede positive change, using a decomposition-based approach. This approach breaks key behaviours down into their component parts, and seeks to affect influences – again broken down into e.g. attitudes, social norms, resources and other opportunity-related factors – on these components. Component-dominant dynamics refer to a situation, where the behaviour of a system is determined primarily by the properties of its individual components, rather than by emergent phenomena. The decomposition-based approach is highly effective when this is the case. However, the approach may have severely limited effectiveness in contexts characterized by interaction-dominant dynamics, where outcomes are determined not by individual components, but emerge from the ongoing interdependent influences between them. Interaction-dominant systems have been studied in various fields under the interdisciplinary rubric of complex systems science. \n\nThis work argues that people are active agentic creatures, who are self-determined and self-organising experts of their own environments, which infuses social systems with inherent non-stationarity and hence uncertainty: Objects of study in behaviour change science, as well as their relationships, change. In addition, small events can cause large impacts, and long periods of apparent stability can be punctuated by rapid change. This implies that past data may be of limited use for inference and interventions across contexts or time. Indeed, the opportunities and risks laying in the future of complex systems or decision making contexts, are vastly more numerous than those which could be called merely complicated. Therefore, it should be carefully evaluated, to what extent a given situation is indeed amenable to decomposition-based solutions. While it might be impossible to predict the long-term future of some complex “non-linear” systems, risks and opportunities can be evaluated based on evolutionary potential of their space of possibilities. \n\nThe specific contribution of articles included in this work supports the argument as follows. Article I takes the view of people as agentic, autonomous decision makers, and points to the need to foster their capacity to self-organise. It describes a compendium of techniques, which (combined with proper scaffolding and support) could enable individuals to better self-manage their motivation and behaviour. Article II uses data containing self-management techniques to demonstrate a conceptually important model, where behaviours – and what the literature has conventionally considered their influences, precursors, or determinants – are represented as components of a mutually interacting network. The network representation reflects a deviation from the conventional conceptualisation, which hinges on component-dominant dynamics to depict simplistic causes and their effects with boxes and arrows. The article also discusses the importance of distributional shapes, as well as how summary statistics developed for simple, symmetric distributions can misdirect inference when the shape is more varied. Article III proposes a process definition of behaviour change, particularly calling for attention to some core features of complex systems; interconnectedness, non-ergodicity and non-linearity. It points out how interaction-dominant dynamics can produce distributional shapes, poorly amenable conventional analysis. It also discusses problems of traditional linear models of between-individual data for studying behaviour change, and expands the idea of aforementioned between-individual networks to those containing temporal recurrences of idiographic system states – attractors. Article IV depicts how the conceptualisation of behaviour change as movement in an attractor landscape can be used to understand change on different scales of observation, from individuals to communities and the society at large. It brings our attention to how non-linearities in interconnected systems can mean sudden transitions after long periods of stability and, more generally, the need to be wary of attractor states yet unseen, when there is uncertainty about distribution shapes.\n\nTo address the transparency and irreducibility concerns currently being voiced across scientific disciplines, all the data and analysis scripts are made publicly available online. Apart from Article I, these supplements are produced directly from the data as accompanying websites to reduce error and increase accessibility.",

Building on extensive research demonstrating that self-disclosure fosters interpersonal connections, we test whether political views that seem self-disclosing increase connection, respect, and willingness to interact among opponents. Across six studies, we demonstrate that self-disclosure reduces partisan animosity, through building connection between political opponents. While previous work showed that political discussions based on sharing personal experiences bridge divides better than fact-based discussions, our results indicate this is because of the self-disclosing nature of experiences. Leveraging this, we find many arguments partisans share with each other (e.g., facts) can improve connection and reduce animosity when they are perceived as self-disclosing (tested through manipulating self-disclosure). By highlighting the power of self-disclosure, our findings offer a promising path toward bridging political divides.",

The findings of the review indicated that very few studies have investigated how people of all ages consume music, and what little research has been done on this topic has been methodologically inconsistent and led to findings that are contradictory and inconclusive. Several questionnaire studies found that music consumption decreased with age, whilst an interview study found that music consumption is likely to increase with age. This review also identified a shortlist of possible factors (e.g., life goals, personality, conformity) that might account for any age-related changes in musical consumption. With many people living in ageing societies, and music a ubiquitous part of daily life, the review recommends that future research on this topic should seek to reflect how people of all ages consume music, and to identify the factors responsible for any changes in music consumption as people grow older.",

We highlight common insights across disciplines; key challenges stemming from insular, discipline-specific approaches; and novel potentials enabled by the proposed interdisciplinary approach. Moreover, by allowing comparative analyses across species, groups of individuals, and contexts, our approach promises to uncover the shared and unique nature of individuality in human social behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Almost all parents lie to their children, and recent studies warn that parental lying may negatively impact trust of children in their parents. However, perspectives of children on parental lying and its effect on trust in parents have rarely been studied. In the current manuscript, we (1) report the development and co-creation of an age-appropriate instrument to assess children’s perspectives on parental lying in middle childhood (8- to 12-year-olds), (2) investigate in a pilot sample (n = 62 Dutch 8- to 12-year-olds) whether the instrument is able to capture children’s perspectives on parental lying and truth telling, and (3) explore children’s perspectives on parental lying and trust. Three different lies were distinguished: lies to benefit the parent, lies to benefit the child and prudential lies. The instrument was co-created with a child panel (n = 5 Dutch 8- to 12-year-olds) and a game designer. The instrument was deemed age-appropriate based on the high percentages of correct classifications of parental lies and truths. Our results demonstrated that children evaluated child-benefit and prudential parental lies more positively than liar-benefitting parental lies. Children expected trust to be lower when a parent used a liar-benefitting lie as compared to a child-benefitting lie. Our results demonstrated that 8- to 12-year-olds already have differentiated opinions about different types of parental lies and how they can affect trust, and our open-access instrument provides an engaging and age-appropriate opportunity for future research into children’s view on parental lying and its effect on trust.",

Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, the prevalence, extent and socio-demographic variation of menstrual pain remains understudied at national levels - whether due to a shortage of applicable data at national scales or other factors.\nMethod: We assess the extent and variation of menstrual pain at a national level. To achieve this, we develop a novel proxy measure for menstrual pain, utilising behavioural data extracted from mass supermarket shopping logs. Baskets where pain and menstrual items co-occur are investigated, and normalized against baskets in which pain or menstrual items occur in isolation. Propensity of menstrual pain purchases are aggregated temporally and geographically across England, prior to linkage with socio-demographic indicators regionally. \nResults: Findings indicate high prevalence of menstrual pain across England, with 26.7% of customers I our dataset buying pain relief together with menstrual products. People who menstruate are observed to be four times more likely to purchase pain relief with menstrual items than without. Average regional income provides the strongest predictor of menstrual pain co-purchases, with lower income regions exhibiting a 32% lower menstrual-pain purchase than higher income regions.\nDiscussion: The robust presence of a consistent 28-day cycle in menstrual-pain purchases provides empirical evidence for the use of behavioural proxies for menstrual pain alongside traditional measures. Significant regional differences observed in the prevalence of menstrual-pain transactions across England brings into light existing disparities. Future research into improved understanding of sociodemographic factors associated with menstrual pain could inform strategies to predict and prevent menstrual pain and its adverse impacts.",

Furthermore, we have grouped the existing literature based on the study approach into two groups (i.e., lab and field). For each group, we have discussed the research methodologies followed to attain respective objectives. We have emphasized on the field studies owing to the growing use of digital devices, especially smartphones, and wearables, for understanding SAD.   This template simplifies and summarizes the use of artificial intelligence to predict and detect SAD using digitally captured data. In addition to the existing digital SAD psychotherapy, we have also discussed mHealth interventions that use smartphones and wearables to manage mental disorders. Finally, we have discussed challenges and future directions with possible solutions that can be incorporated into future SAD study designs.",

          "abstract": "Punishment and the threat thereof can enforce social norms by deterring inappropriate behaviours and future misdeeds, but enacting punishment can be costly. As a result, individuals may prefer to outsource costly punishment to others and cultural institutions. We propose that shared beliefs about supernatural punishment, might contribute to minimizing the costs of interpersonal punishment by allowing people to outsource this punishment to supernatural entities. We specifically test in a pre-registered experiment (N = 1603 American and Singaporean adults) whether thinking about karma (a supernatural force that punishes misdeeds) reduces punishment. Results confirm that being prompted to consider karma reduces inclinations to punish selfishness in a Third Party Punishment Game. These findings suggest that karma beliefs may have played a role in the cultural evolution of human cooperation by reducing the costs of human norm enforcement while maintaining incentives for prosocial behaviour through the threat of supernatural punishment.",

          "abstract": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-dit-Bressel et al., 2021, 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.",

Unlike other items’ consumption, where consumers buy a good to satisfy some higher need, collectors acquire products merely to have the item in their possession. Past studies have primarily been qualitative studies employing convenience samples of “extreme” collectors. We investigate the characteristics and motivations of collectors in a representative nation-wide sample (N=5,069) across two waves 10 years apart, while leveraging dozens of other surveys administered to the panel to test a wide range of hypotheses regarding collections. We find that while a third of consumers collect, very few who do so identify strongly as collectors. Those who identify strongly as collectors are significantly different from most collectors, implying that research focusing only on those who strongly identify as collectors will lead to conclusions which do not provide insights in collecting in general. Solutions to the problems documented are discussed in the general discussion.",

          "abstract": "In a social context dominated by the culture of appearance and the spectacle of the self, the ostentation of wealth by middle-class individuals and young people emerges as an adaptive – yet potentially dysfunctional – response to dynamics of identity insecurity, perceived inequality and social pressure. This interdisciplinary contribution explores the psychological and economic motivations that drive individuals without substantial financial resources to engage in symbolic and ostentatious consumption behaviors. Drawing on classical (Veblen, Bourdieu) and contemporary theories (behavioral economics, self-psychology, signaling theory), and integrating reflections on the impact of digital media and popular music trends (especially rap and trap), the article highlights how the search for visibility and social recognition can lead to risky behaviors such as indebtedness, pursuit of \"easy success\" models (e.g., online trading), and the commodification of the body through sexual content platforms. The final reflections offer a critical interpretation of the phenomenon and emphasize the need for education aimed at substance, identity resilience and economic awareness.",

Here, we investigate curriculum learning in a single perceptual decision-making task, examining whether the behavior of a parsimonious network trained on different curricula would be replicated in human participants. Our results show that progressively increasing task difficulty during training facilitates learning compared to training at a fixed level of difficulty or at random. Furthermore, a sequences designed to hamper learning in a parsimonious neural network network impair learning in humans. As such, our findings indicate strong qualitative similarities between neural networks and humans in curriculum learning for perceptual decision-making, suggesting the former can serve as a viable computational model of the latter.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-transcendence—connectedness within and beyond the self—is a complex phenomenon theorized to increase with age, but evidence is mixed. This longitudinal study is the first to investigate changes in self-transcendence across late midlife using life story narratives. \nMethod: We tracked self-reported and narrative identity self-transcendence scores of 163 participants as they aged from M=56.4 (SD=0.95) to M=64.5 (SD=0.94). Participants were 64.4% women, 35.6% men; 55.2% White, 42.9% Black, 1.8% interracial/other; median income was $75,000–$100,000; median education was college graduate. \nResults: Self-transcendence narrative themes of closure and self-actualization increased significantly over time, especially between ages 60–65, but self-reported self-transcendence did not change. These trends were not uniform; race by gender groups exhibited distinct trajectories over time.\nDiscussion: Late midlife is seen as ushering in opportunities for increased self-transcendence, especially acceptance of oneself and one’s life. We found some of the strongest empirical evidence of this phenomenon to date. On average, U.S. Black and White adults narrated their life stories with less regret and more satisfaction with self across late midlife. Findings demonstrate the utility of leveraging first-person narrative identity methods to collect and analyze data about rich, complex personality constructs and highlight positive changes associated with late midlife.",

There is a critical need for a robust, reliable, and contemporary measure to identify populations at risk of avoiding HIV testing, treatment, and prevention, thereby supporting global HIV eradication goals. Method:  Focus groups informed the initial development of the HIV Anxiety Scale (HAS), revised through expert feedback. The factor structure was assessed in two studies. In Study 1, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted with 251 participants. In Study 2, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) with 200 participants was performed alongside validity, internal consistency, and measurement invariance assessments. Findings: Studies 1 and 2 supported a 3-factor model, resulting in a 16-item measure with the following subscales: Psychosocial Implications of HIV, Lifestyle Implications of HIV, and HIV Testing Anxiety. The HAS demonstrated a good factor structure, acceptable validity and excellent internal consistency across diverse groups in Study 2. Conclusions: The HAS provides a contemporary, robust measure of HIV anxiety, addressing limitations of previous tools and contributing to efforts to identify and support populations at risk of HIV avoidance behaviours.",

Two hundred forty-nine licensed psychologists in the United States, rated the quality of AI-generated and human-generated psychological reports across six dimensions: overall quality, readability, writing style, organizational structure, summary quality, and recommendation quality. The study used a counterbalanced design with eight conditions, presenting human or AI-generated reports for ADHD, intellectual disability, depression, and anxiety. Participants then provided ratings of quality through an online survey. Human-generated reports were preferred for their writing style (p = 0.026), organization (p = 0.042), and overall quality (p = 0.036), while the recommendations in AI-generated reports were favored (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found in readability. Participants were more likely to prefer and approve human-generated reports for clinical use (p = 0.042), though the majority expressed discomfort with both types. While AI shows promise in augmenting psychological report writing, particularly in generating recommendations, human expertise remains crucial, especially in summarizing information. These findings highlight the need for professional guidelines on AI use in psychological practice and updated educational curricula to prepare future psychologists for an evolving technological landscape in mental health care.",

Across three experiments, we tested the role of spatial layout and language on pre-crawling 6-month-old infants’ (N = 96) ability to categorize places in a novelty-preference looking-time paradigm. We found that, when places are labeled, young infants are sensitive to their distinct spatial layouts and can learn place categories. When places’ spatial layouts are disrupted or when places are not labeled, by contrast, young infants cannot learn such place categories. Our results shed new light on young infants’ sensitivities to foundational domains of everyday life prior to their capacity for self-guided exploration.",

          "abstract": "Cooperation often relies on people’s ability to discern in whom to invest their limited resources. One solution to this partner choice dilemma entails estimating one’s fitness interdependence with others. Previous studies indicate that estimates of fitness interdependence (i.e., shared fate) motivate cooperation, but the sources of information that contribute to shared fate remain an elusive question. We examine links among ten sources of interdependence (i.e., attributes and experiences that yoke partners’ fitness), shared fate, and cooperation among the Mayangna, a small-scale horticultural society in Nicaragua. While eight sources of interdependence showed positive bivariate associations with shared fate, only relatedness, commensality, and shared subsistence activities were uniquely associated with higher shared fate. Moreover, shared fate (1) was associated with more cooperation across seven fitness-relevant domains, (2) statistically mediated associations between relatedness and cooperation, and (3) had strong effects on cooperation (i.e., forgoing money to buy rice for a partner). Results indicate that shared fate arises from sources of fitness interdependence and cooperation is proximally guided by shared fate. Estimates of fitness interdependence by way of shared fate may therefore offer a simple solution to partner choice dilemmas: Help partners if one has a positive stake in their welfare.",

To address this invisibility, it is important to collect and report data in an inclusive and accurate manner, but STEM researchers are often unsure of how to properly do this for queer people. We have developed a list of Ten Simple rules to aid researchers to perform data collection on queer individuals, focussing on study design and data dissemination. We address several issues in queer data, such as language use, dealing with small populations, and balancing demands. We also discuss how to extend this inclusive practice for studies on animal populations. These rules are aimed at anybody surveying populations which may contain queer individuals, including for example research studies and inclusivity surveys for conferences.

However, concerns have been raised about the potential negative impacts of such policies could have on individuals with eating disorders. This review aimed to summarise the literature on the impact of out-of-home nutrition labels on individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating. Methods: A systematic search across eight databases was conducted up to 11th of October 2023. Studies were included if they assessed the impact of out-of-home nutrition labelling policies on individuals with eating disorders or disordered eating. 538 studies were screened, of which 16 studies met inclusion criteria and were included. Results: The reviewed studies included 5 experimental/quasi-experimental studies, 5 cross-sectional studies, and 6 qualitative/mixed methods studies. Most studies were conducted in Western countries and all study participants were adults. Across studies, eating disorder pathology was associated with noticing labels more frequently, paying more attention to caloric intake, and more frequent behaviour changes due to caloric values. The meta-synthesis identified 5 themes based on the qualitative findings, being drawn to calories, facilitating the eating disorder, reassurance, social eating, and frustration.  Discussion: The current review summarised the existing literature on the impact of out-of-home nutrition label policies on individuals with eating disorders. The evidence suggests that there is cause for concern regarding negative impacts, particularly for those with restrictive eating disorders, which should be explored further by research and considered by policy makers when making decisions on public health policies.",

Despite taking English classes and working in a predominantly English-speaking environment, she still struggles with medical terminology and complex explanations. As she sits in her obstetrician's office, trying to understand the doctor's explanation about amniocentesis, Maria's limited English proficiency becomes a significant barrier. Without an interpreter, she grapples with unfamiliar medical terms and complex risk statistics, leaving her confused and anxious about this critical decision. This scenario, highlighting communication barriers faced by the approximately 25 million limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals in the U.S., is precisely the kind of problem Chipman, Meagher, and Barwise (2023) address in their framework for improving healthcare for LEP populations. However, even if Maria could understand every word perfectly, she would face another, less obvious challenge. Recent research suggests that merely using a foreign language can alter decision-making processes, potentially leading patients to make choices that do not truly reflect their values or risk preferences. While Chipman and colleagues. provide valuable insights on improving access and communication for LEP individuals, here I explore how the cognitive effects of foreign language use might impact patient choices in critical medical decisions, even when linguistic comprehension is not an issue.",

          "authors": "Frank Eckerle; Edward John Roy Clarke; Helen Landmann",
          "abstract": "Climate activists frequently use tactics of direct action, an often disruptive “not asking, just doing” approach where ends and means fall into one. Psychological research often subsumes direct action (e.g., drawing bicycle lanes to establish a bicycle lane) under umbrella terms of radical, non-normative or confrontative collective action (e.g., disrupting traffic to draw attention to a call for a bicycle lane). However, interdisciplinary research on social movements and transition strongly suggests, that witnessing direct action can have different psychological effects than witnessing indirect action. Based on this, we argue that direct actions can increase access to cognitive alternatives when they successfully showcase a concrete mini-utopia (a property of prefigurative politics). Two pre-registered online experiments have been conducted in Germany (N = 645) using a 2(direct/indirect action version) x 3(bicycle, parking or automobility protests) design. We hypothesised and found that direct actions with this prefigurative effect are generally more accepted, elicit more positive emotions, and receive more solidarity compared to similar indirect actions. We also found evidence for a mediated positive effect on evaluations of a traffic-reduced future via identification with the activists and ratings of action efficacy. However, there were no significant effects on policy support. Results support the notion that some direct actions are better than others in communicating a concrete utopia, however the criteria to determine this prefigurative effect require further development. We call for more collective action research to specifically investigate the psychological effects of participation in and witnessing of prefigurative politics.",

          "abstract": "When listening to speech in an unfamiliar language, words and phrases in the native language are frequently activated due to their acoustic similarity with some parts of the speech stream. This study explored this phenomenon, for the first time, from a language processing perspective. Across three studies, English- and Spanish-native adults completed a translation elicitation task, in which they listened to a series of words from an unfamiliar language (Catalan or Spanish for English speakers, Catalan for Spanish speakers). For each presented word, participants had to type their best-guess translation in their native language. Both English and Spanish natives were surprisingly good at translating unfamiliar words, efficiently exploiting the phonological similarity between the presented (unfamiliar) words and their correct translation. When the correct translation belonged to high-density phonological neighbourhood, participants' ability to benefit from phonological similarity decreased. Spanish participants, whose native language was typologically closer to the presented language, benefited more strongly from phonological similarity than English participants. Overall, we show that speech in an unfamiliar language triggers equivalent dynamics of lexical selection than native speech, providing a psycholinguistic account for homophonic translation.",

We document several common patterns of ambiguity and show that in each case, there is a systematic logical relation between the two forms. For example, in English and other languages, two interpretations commonly available to NPIs are each other's logical duals. \nWe explore the hypothesis that these systematic ambiguities arise due to a bias in the learning process.\nSpecifically, when  a given word is restricted to a specific logical environment (such as the scope of negation), multiple equally `correct' analyses are available to a language learner. Learners might find some of these analyses more attractive than others, explaining why an ambiguity arises when the distributional constraint is relaxed.\nWe employ an artificial grammar learning paradigm to test which interpretations of NPIs are preferred by learners when they encounter NPIs in a positive environment. Our results show strong evidence of a `wide-scope dual' interpretation, although specific properties of the training paradigm may influence these preferences.",

While some argue that LLMs represent a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even machine consciousness (inflationary claims), others dismiss them as mere trickster artifacts lacking genuine cognitive abilities (deflationary claims). We argue that both extremes may be shaped or exacerbated by common cognitive biases, including cognitive dissonance, wishful thinking, and the illusion of depth of understanding, which distort reality to our own advantage. By showcasing how these distortions may easily emerge in both scientific and public discourse, we advocate for a measured approach— skeptical open mind - that recognizes the cognitive abilities of LLMs as worthy of scientific investigation while remaining conservative concerning exaggerated claims regarding their cognitive status.",

          "abstract": "This position paper argues that the verity of empirical findings in HCI hinges on rigorous measurement practices of latent psychological constructs — a foundation too often undermined by ad-hoc and unvalidated scale development and modifications. We contend that current practices lead to distorted, only seemingly evidence-based inferences while squandering valuable resources. To mitigate these issues, we propose a 'validity by design' approach that separates measurement validation from substantive hypothesis evaluation. Central to our proposal is the establishment of a collaborative consortium tasked with defining core constructs, systematically validating standardized instruments, and disseminating them through open-access platforms. This coordinated effort — augmented by the active involvement of key thought leaders and targeted funding — will empower the HCI community to foster proactive measurement validation, thereby enhancing both scientific rigor and practical impact.",

          "abstract": "Distributional learning enables listeners to form phonetic categories by extracting statistical regularities from speech input. Younger Cantonese speakers can acquire the Mandarin level-falling (T1–T4) contrast through distributional learning, with bimodal exposure facilitating category formation and unimodal exposure suppressing it, and fine-grained pitch sensitivity predicting success. However, aging is associated with declines in pitch sensitivity and phonetic boundary formation, which may disrupt this process. This study examined whether Cantonese-speaking older adults exhibit distributional learning of Mandarin T1–T4 and whether cognitive factors predict success. Sixty-four participants completed a pretest–training–posttest procedure with bimodal or unimodal exposure. While older adults improved in tone discrimination, no group differences emerged. Further analysis showed those with lower pitch-related auditory memory failed to learn from unimodal input. These results suggest a shift from perceptual encoding to memory-based learning and highlight age-related changes in speech perception and the limits of statistical learning in older adulthood.",

          "abstract": "Fear learning processes are often considered underlying mechanisms in the development and maintenance of various anxiety- and stress-related disorders. However, limited attention has been paid to whether these changes are shared across disorders or certain symptoms. In this context, transdiagnostic research on symptom dimensions is especially relevant, as it addresses the significant symptom overlap and heterogeneity observed in anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In the current study, we investigated attentional processes (late positive potential), defensive responding (fear-potentiated startle), and subjective ratings (US-expectancy) in a transdiagnostic sample of participants with OCD (n=38), social phobia (n=39), specific phobia (n=40), and control participants (n=39). We focused on two transdiagnostic anxiety dimensions: anxious arousal and anxious apprehension. A differential fear learning paradigm using geometrical forms was employed, including a habituation, acquisition, generalization, and extinction phase. We observed successful fear acquisition across all outcomes, which generalized to the stimulus most similar to the CS+. While fear responses to the CS+ decreased during extinction, they remained significantly elevated compared to the CS-. The results revealed no differences between the diagnostic groups for neither phase, stimulus nor outcome measure. On a dimensional level, anxious arousal was associated with an increased shock expectancy to the CS+ during acquisition, while depressive symptoms were associated with a higher shock expectancy for both CS+ and CS- during extinction. The unexpected absence of differences between diagnostic groups, along with the modulating dimensional effects, supports the utility of these transdiagnostic symptom dimensions in unraveling altered fear learning processes in internalizing disorders.",

We conducted three quantitative vignette-based studies (n = 200) in UK general public samples, considering seven disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)). For each disorder, participants rated how much the disorder reflects the vignette character’s true self, along with perceived causes of the disorders (studies 1 and 2), perceived severity, age of onset, duration, probability of recovery (study 2), and stigmatization (study 3). Disorders differed sharply in the extent to which they were judged to be part of the true self: ADHD, ASD, and OCD received higher true self ratings than major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and schizophrenia, with bipolar disorder intermediate. A disorder was rated more ‘true self’ when it was: perceived more “biologically” caused; perceived less “psychologically” caused; perceived less severe; and recovery was perceived as less likely. Although the extent of stigmatization also varied across disorders, true self ratings did not predict stigmatization. Our results show that the public thinks about different mental disorders in quite different ways, suggesting that different disorders should not be lumped together when considering attitudes and their consequences.",

          "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has garnered interest from social and political science researchers alongside its technical dimensions. While technology acceptance has been widely studied, there is a growing need to understand how political ideologies shape public acceptance of AI in an increasingly polarized world. This scoping review synthesizes findings from empirical studies examining ideological differences in the perception and acceptance of AI technologies, with a focus on theoretical explanations for these effects. Using PRISMA guidelines, we applied a systematic search protocol across nine academic databases, identifying 21 relevant articles. We reviewed and mapped the key research themes, constructs, methodologies, results, and theoretical rationales across studies. Our analysis highlights two main explanatory frameworks for the influence of political ideology on AI acceptance: (1) the alignment or conflict between the intended purpose and context of AI technology and the core values of different ideologies, and (2) the heightened sensitivity to threat associated with conservatism, which may reduce acceptance of AI technologies. We integrate perspectives from political and social psychology to expand on these findings, particularly regarding stimulus sampling, threat sensitivity, and ideological orientation. Notably, we observe that study results may be affected by design choices, such as stimulus selection and outcome measures. We advocate for a broader and more diverse array of empirical investigations to rigorously test these two explanations and deepen understanding of ideological influences on AI acceptance.",

Our results show that progressively increasing task difficulty during training facilitates learning compared to training at a fixed level of difficulty or at random. Furthermore, a sequences designed to hamper learning in a parsimonious neural network network impair learning in humans. As such, our findings indicate strong qualitative similarities between neural networks and humans in curriculum learning for perceptual decision-making, suggesting the former can serve as a viable computational model of the latter.",

          "authors": "Alexia Galati; Rick Dale; Camila Alviar; Moreno Coco",
          "abstract": "Collaborative task performance is assumed to benefit from interpersonal coordination of behaviors between interacting individuals. Prominent views of language use and social behavior, including the Interactive Alignment Model (IAM; Pickering &amp; Garrod, 2004), endorse this idea by building on tasks that require partners to monitor each other’s perspective (e.g., route planning) and positing that behavioral alignment enables task partners to converge conceptually. However, the role of alignment in tasks requiring complementarity (e.g., a “divide and conquer” strategy during joint visual search) has yet to be explored. We examine this question directly by manipulating task goals (route planning vs. visual search) as forty dyads work with ten trials involving subway maps while their eye movements and speech were co-registered. In five trials, dyads planned a route from an origin to a destination (route planning); in another five trials, they searched for landmarks sharing some feature (visual search). We used Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to examine the temporal relationships between partners' eye fixations and word sequences, generating measures that reveal both similarity and other dynamic relationships. Dyads exhibited more gaze alignment in route planning than visual search across a range of CRQA metrics. When examining the temporal evolution of gaze alignment, we found it to vary across the trial substantially, and its increase influenced accuracy differently over time across the two tasks. Specifically, in visual search, higher increases in alignment at the end of the trial were associated with accurate performance. When we turned to speech data, we found that dyads exhibited longer and more entropic word sequences in route planning but had lower overall word recurrence in that task. This finding suggests that the two modalities organize in a compensatory fashion to optimize distinct task goals.  We suggest that these results support a theoretical framework that is more general than IAM yet has interactive alignment as an emergent consequence of how participants adapt to tasks. This framework emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of coordination strategies based on task demands. Altogether, task goals constrain how people coordinate their behavior and provide insights into how collaborating partners distribute their distinctive multimodal behavior.",

          "authors": "Ross Watson; Stuart Mackinnon; Andrew Haddon Kemp",
          "abstract": "This article explores the traditional martial art of Wing Chun through the lens of psychology, examining its potential to promote inner development and holistic wellbeing. Originating in Southern China and now practised worldwide, Wing Chun is characterised by its emphasis on fluidity, adaptation, and effectiveness. At its core are five guiding principles—Simplicity, Practicality, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Directness (SPEED)—which shape its practice and reflect its Buddhist and Taoist philosophical roots. We propose that these principles provide a foundation for understanding psychological wellbeing that lay a foundation for developing novel interventions and promoting wellbeing at scale. To articulate this, we introduce a new conceptual framework, REACH, which encompasses five interconnected constructs: Radical nonattachment, Embodied empowerment, (skillful) Adaptation, (self) Control, and (psychological) Hardiness. Radical nonattachment cultivates presence and responsiveness through mindfulness-in-action, facilitating a compassionate awareness of self, others and nature. Embodied empowerment enhances awareness and intuitive decision-making through embodied self-reflexivity, supporting individuals to navigate internal and external cues with greater agency while promoting a deeper sense of groundedness and engagement with the world. Skillful adaptation promotes flexibility and creativity, enabling the experience of psychological flow and supporting practitioners to dynamically engage with their environment. Self-control refines focus and energy management through reflexive, nonconscious regulation, supporting purposeful goal-setting with reduced cognitive effort while cultivating harmony and balance. Psychological hardiness strengthens resilience and fierce compassion, enabling individuals to transform adversity into growth and enhancing capacity for working toward social justice and resisting dominant social narratives. These constructs are presented as power resources, and by bridging martial discipline with mindful awareness and social engagement, we suggest that the REACH model provides a foundation for supporting inner development and holistic wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "Measurement is at the core of research in many fields such as psychology. One way that\nresearchers can test the factorial structure of an instrument is to use confirmatory factor analysis\n(CFA). When using CFA, researchers evaluate how well the hypothesized structure of a measure\nfits the data. Fit indices, which quantify the degree of misfit, are then used to evaluate the\nfactorial model. Traditionally, researchers have used fixed index cutoff values to judge the\nappropriateness of their factorial models. However, many have discussed the limitations of using\nfixed cutoffs, as fixed values do not generalize to all kinds of models. Recently, McNeish &amp;\nWolf (2023) have developed the Dynamic Fit Index approach (DFI) which enables the\ngeneration of fit index values that are tailored to the characteristics of the model being tested. In\nthe following tutorial, we conduct a CFA on the Attainment of School Achievement Goal Scale\n(A-SAGS) using the lavaan package in R. We then generate fit indices using the dynamic\npackage. We conclude that the DFI approach, although very promising and interesting,\nnecessitates further testing. Dynamic fit indices can be overly strict and do not always agree on\nthe appropriateness of factorial models, which stresses the need to further test its algorithm to see\nwhether it is of practical value when evaluating model fit.\nKeywords: Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Fit evaluation, Fit indices, Dynamic fit.

This reframes the alleged superiority of empathic AI in a more mundane and less dehumanizing way. Second, I consider whether people should use AI for empathy.

          "authors": "Massimo Lipari; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Quebec French is reportedly developing rhoticity, with low F3 resulting from a bunched or retroflexed tongue (like English /ɚ/), in some or all of its front mid rounded vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. The source of this rare, understudied sound change is unclear from previous work: contact with English and contrast enhancement have been suggested, and phonologization of coarticulation is typologically plausible. We examine this issue, investigating the apparent time change in the F3 trajectories of the three vowels using generalized additive mixed models on a corpus of parliamentary speech (106 speakers from across Quebec). We observe rhoticity in /ø/ and /œ̃ /: men begin with low F3 in these vowels, and women show change in progress. Conversely, there is less clear evidence of change in /œ/. We suggest these findings are best explained by rhoticity being a two-phased change, originally due to borrowing and subsequently spreading through contrast enhancement. Rhotacization, we argue, is the combined product of intensive exposure to English (which led to frequent non-integration of bunched/retroflex segments in loanwords) and an exceptionally large vowel inventory. It thus results from the unique interplay of social and phonological factors in Quebec French, which is consistent with such changes being cross-linguistically rare.",

          "abstract": "Research has widely examined the motives, strategies, and effectiveness of explicit emotion regulation, yet the reasons for not regulating emotions have not been elucidated. Extant daily life research suggests individuals may choose not to regulate their emotions as often as they are choosing to regulate them. We examined (1) how often people did not regulate their emotions, (2) the reasons why people chose not to regulate emotions, and (3) which contextual factors were relevant to not regulating. Adults in the Midwest (N=179; Mage=35.34, SDage=12.26) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) five times daily for 14 days, reporting on their largest recent emotional shift over the last three hours, contextual factors regarding this shift, and details about emotion regulation. People reported not regulating about half the time, with the most frequent reasons being that emotions were appropriate or helpful (38%) or were not intense enough (31%). The likelihood of not regulating was associated with more positive affect, less negative affect, greater situational pleasantness, and lower situational importance. People were less likely to regulate when they were alone (versus with other people). This research clarifies an aspect of the emotion regulation process that has been largely overlooked despite frequently occurring. Future research should examine whether reasons are more beneficial than others and if the reasons for not regulating differ across culture and the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Jiin Jung; Timothy Gulden",
          "abstract": "The association between cultural tolerance and collective innovation at the macro level has remained unclear, marked by inconsistent findings. Agent-based simulation has established itself as a powerful research method for unraveling complex macro-patterns that emerge from the simple behaviors and interactions of agents. We posit that influence stemming from minorities who have different domain expertise in workers’ collaboration networks can be pivotal micro-mechanisms for organizational innovation in changing market environments, and cultural tolerance is critical for such minority-induced social innovation. The model includes three key micro-mechanisms: (a) direct majority influence, which allows workers to update their focal opinion in their domain of expertise from same-domain colleagues; (b) indirect minority influence, which allows workers to update their opinion on different domains by learning from other-domain colleagues (often minorities within their collaboration network); and (c) cross-domain consistency, which allows workers to align their opinions across domains to be consistent with one another. A tolerance parameter sets the extent of indirect minority influence compared to direct majority influence, and a consistency parameter determines how much agents make their opinions consistent across different domains. Simulation experiments revealed a sweet spot of tolerance and consistency that produced coordinated innovation diffusion across knowledge domains, ultimately aiding collective adaptation to shifting market demands. Actual organizations involve many simultaneous mechanisms, including ones beyond the scope of this simulation, which is designed to isolate and elucidate the link between indirect minority influence and innovation diffusion. This should be considered among the other factors that promote or inhibit organizational innovation.",

          "abstract": "Studies on video games and well-being often rely on self-report measures or data from a single game. Here, we study how 703 US adults’ time spent playing for over 140,000 hours across 150 Nintendo Switch games relates to their life satisfaction, affect, depressive symptoms, and general mental well-being. We replicate previous findings that playtime over the past two weeks does not predict well-being, and extend these findings to a wider range of timescales (one hour to one year). Results suggest that relationships, if present, dissipate within two hours of gameplay. Our non-causal findings suggest substantial confounding would be needed to shift a meaningful true effect to the observed null. Although playtime was not related to well-being, players’ assessments of the value of game time—so called gaming life fit—was. Results emphasise the importance of defining the gaming population of interest, collecting data from more than one game, and focusing on how players integrate gaming into their lives rather than the amount of time spent.",

          "abstract": "The quality of information that informs decisions in expert domains such as law enforcement and national security often requires assessment based on meta-informational cues such as source reliability and information credibility. Across two experiments with intelligence analysts (n = 74) and non-experts (n = 175), participants rated the accuracy, informativeness, trustworthiness and usefulness of information varying in source reliability and information credibility conveyed using the Admiralty Code, an information evaluation system widely used in the defence and security domain since the 1940s. Accuracy, informativeness, and likelihood of use were elicited as repeated measures to examine intra-individual reliability. Across experiments, intra-individual reliability was higher when levels of source reliability and information credibility were the same compared to when opposing (one low, one high). In Experiment 2, unreliability was associated with worse performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. Results also show that trustworthiness ratings were more dependent on source reliability than information credibility. Finally, the likelihood of using information was consistently predicted by accuracy ratings, and not by judged informativeness or trustworthiness.  Where possible, samples were diverse in their demographics. The current findings call into question the ability of experts and novices to use information evaluation systems reliably.",

          "abstract": "What moral values do politicians on the right and left invoke in their rhetoric, and do they emphasize different issues when appealing to these values? We used Structured Topic Models (STM) combined with a word embedding model to examine U.S. politicians’ use of moral language and identify the issues Democrats and Republicans moralize most on Twitter (X). Analyzing 1,578,057 posts from U.S. members of Congress (2019–2023), we found that (1) their overall use of moral language was not influenced by ideology as predicted by Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) and (2) they moralized different issues within each moral foundation. For example, Republicans invoked the care foundation to criticize Democratic economic policies, whereas Democrats used it to highlight the harm caused by Trump’s immigration policies. These findings suggest that politicians’ use of moral language may be driven more by the relevance of the issue to their party than by ideology alone.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the challenges K-12 literacy teachers face in balancing students’ engagement with narrative texts and the Common Core State Standards’ (CCSS) emphasis on informational texts. While narratives naturally capture students’ attention and enhance comprehension through relatable experiences, many struggle with understanding informational texts due to their abstract content, domain-specific vocabulary, and complex structures. Drawing on classroom observations and research, this article identifies three key factors influencing comprehension: (1) world knowledge as a foundation for meaning-making, (2) text features as tools for structural understanding, and (3) decoding skills as essential for processing complex texts. The study highlights the “fourth-grade slump,” where comprehension difficulties arise as students transition to more informational reading, and discusses strategies for integrating informational texts into literacy instruction effectively. By aligning instructional methods with students’ cognitive development, educators can enhance comprehension across genres, bridging the gap between narrative engagement and informational literacy.",

This rich database allowed us to examine not just the effects of various country level characteristics, including linguistic distances, but also their dynamic effects over this time range. We performed this analysis by applying a generalised additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Self-compassion, which refers to compassion directed toward oneself in difficult situations, is being researched in various fields, and the number of studies is increasing. However, few comprehensive scoping reviews on this exist because manually reviewing all the literature is impractical, given the large number of studies. Therefore, this study reviewed the literature on self-compassion using a computer-assisted natural language processing technique called the structural topic model. Methods: We searched for studies on self-compassion from 2003 (the year the concept of self-compassion was first defined in psychology) to July 1, 2024, using the Web of Science Core Collection platform. We applied a structural topic model to the titles and abstracts of 4,395 retrieved papers. Results: In total, 38 nameable topics were identified. Eight clusters were extracted from the network graph, showing the correlation between topics. The clusters included Various Interventions, Distress &amp; Cognition, Eating &amp; Body Image, Mental Health &amp; Well-being, Childhood &amp; Parenting, Caregiving, Sport, and Methodologies. The relationship between topic proportion, year of publication, and academic field of the journal in which it was published was visualized. Conclusions: Using topic modeling, we identified the main topics in previous self-compassion research. Furthermore, connections between topics and transitions in topics from the dawn of research to the present day were revealed. The results provide researchers with an overview of the main topics and history of self-compassion research over the past 20 years.",

          "abstract": "Background. This study examines the decline in average reading literacy among primary school students in European countries between 2016 and 2021, as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) documented. This period is characterized by disruptions due to COVID-19-related school closures and changes in student composition, influenced mainly by societal trends across many European countries.\nAims. We estimated trends in reading literacy adjusted for changes in student composition to assess the relationship between the duration of school closures and school-related learning loess.\nSample. We utilized data from 2016 and 2021 from 18 European countries/regions as part of the PIRLS, involving a representative sample of approximately 5,000 fourth graders per year and country/region (N = 187,386; Mean Age = 10.28, SD = 0.86; 49.50% female).\nMethods. Our analytical approach employed propensity score weighting to balance changes in student composition between the 2016 and 2021 cohorts.\nResults. Our findings revealed changes in student composition across most of the 18 countries/regions. First, the average adjusted decline in reading literacy across all 18 European countries/regions was significantly lower than the observed decline, but it remained substantial. Second, the expected decline was associated with the length of COVID-related school closures, estimated at ‒0.0015 SDs per day.\nConclusions. School closures and changes in the composition of student cohorts played a substantial role in the decline in reading literacy observed between 2016 and 2021. This study enhances our understanding of how student composition and school-related factors influence trends in reading literacy.",

          "abstract": "Traditionally, spatial perspective-taking (sPT) has been investigated as an ability to take the perspective of others when explicitly instructed to do so. However, more recent findings suggest that, even in the absence of explicit instruction, people sometimes take the visual perspective of others when observing a visual scene, that is, they engage in spontaneous sPT. To explain why, research has so far focused on features of the visual scene. Here, we focus on the observer. By developing a novel task, the Do You See What I See (DYSWIS) task, across 4 studies (N = 603; age range: 18-36 years), we find that some people are systematically more likely than others to choose the perspective of others across conditions and when tested 2 weeks apart. These individual differences in spontaneous sPT correlate with the ability to take the perspective of others when explicitly instructed to do so and with self-reported empathy in 3 out of 4 studies, while they are not associated with mental rotation or non-verbal reasoning abilities. These associations are stable across different visual scenes, even if some features of the scenes, such as the presence of humans or their implied movement, substantially enhance spontaneous sPT. Taken together, this work demonstrates that people systematically differ in their spontaneous tendency to take the visual perspective of others, highlighting the importance of investigating sPT not only as an ability, but also as a disposition or choice.",

          "abstract": "Why do capable, intelligent individuals, even when deeply motivated, stall at the threshold of action? Why does effort fail not from lack of desire, but from something deeper, often invisible? Psychology has mapped attention, modeled emotion, and described motivation. But it has not yet defined the internal structure that makes effort possible. Or not.\n\nThis paper introduces Lagunian Dynamics, a first-principles theory of cognitive Drive based not on metaphor or external reward, but on internal mechanics. At its center is Lagun’s Law of Primode and Flexion Dynamics, a formal equation that models Drive as the interaction of six forces: Primode (ignition), CAP (activation voltage), Flexion (mental adaptability), Anchory (focus tether), Grain (resistance), and Slip (entropy). These variables function within three core domains of effort: Ignition, Tension, and Flux. Together they determine whether performance begins, holds, or breaks apart.\n\nPatterns like procrastination, burnout, and inconsistency are reframed here as structural states. Not motivational failures. Not traits. But measurable misalignments within the system of Drive. The paper defines the variables, derives key corollaries, explains familiar failure modes, and outlines early experimental pathways toward empirical validation.\n\nThis work establishes a new psychological field: Cognitive Drive Architecture. A framework for understanding not just how the mind acts, but how it structurally fails to act. It offers a system we can model, test, and eventually design for.",

          "authors": "Shelly Tsang; Adrienne Wood",
          "abstract": "People’s emotional states often become more similar after social interactions, a process known as emotion contagion. Emotion contagion is considered both a by-product of shared goals and a tool for strengthening social bonds. Although cross-sectional evidence suggests emotion contagion is positively related to bond strength, few studies have investigated this relationship longitudinally as people become acquainted. Perhaps emotion contagion increases as people become closer (a within-dyad effect), reflecting relationship closeness. Or perhaps some dyads have a stable mutual liking and a tendency towards emotion contagion that does not change over time (a between-dyad effect). Our study disentangled these two accounts. Pairs of unacquainted participants had conversations weekly for six weeks. Participants reported pre- and post-conversation emotion states and closeness to their partner after each conversation. Emotion contagion, measured in three different ways, declined over time as dyads became interpersonally closer (evidence for a within-dyad effect). This decline may indicate increased comfort with emotional divergence. Notably, dyads that reported greater average interpersonal closeness exhibited larger changes in emotion states during their conversations, aligning with previous between-dyad findings. Thus, the association between emotion contagion and feelings of interpersonal closeness depends on whether we consider change within a dyad or compare between dyads.",

These claims come paired with suggestions that people should use empathic AI to supplement human empathy.

First, I argue that the apparent superiority of AI-generated empathy reflects an analog of the “wisdom of the crowd” effect. This reframes the alleged superiority of empathic AI in a more mundane and less dehumanizing way. Second, I consider whether people should use AI for empathy. Here I draw an analogy to placebo effects, suggesting that even clear utilitarian benefits may not justify the adoption of empathic AI.",

We conducted three quantitative vignette-based studies (n = 200) in UK general public samples, considering seven disorders (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anorexia nervosa, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)). For each disorder, participants rated how much the disorder reflects the vignette character’s true self, along with perceived causes of the disorders (studies 1 and 2), perceived severity, age of onset, duration, probability of recovery (study 2), and stigmatization (study 3). Disorders differed sharply in the extent to which they were judged to be part of the true self: ADHD, ASD, and OCD received higher true self ratings than major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and schizophrenia, with bipolar disorder intermediate. A disorder was rated more ‘true self’ when it was: perceived more “biologically” caused; perceived less “psychologically” caused; perceived less severe; and recovery was perceived as less likely. Although the extent of stigmatization also varied across disorders, true self ratings did not predict stigmatization. Our results show that the public thinks about different mental disorders in quite different ways, suggesting that different disorders should not be lumped together when considering attitudes and their consequences.",

Results: At the within-person goal-level, welcoming accountability and personal responsibility predicted higher subsequent levels of each other. However, satisfaction with goal progress only predicted subsequent welcoming accountability. Exploratory analysis of goal types revealed that participants reported more accountability, responsibility, and progress satisfaction for approach (versus avoidance) goals. Interpersonal (versus intrapersonal) goals involved greater welcoming of accountability and progress satisfaction.

Data were extracted for information about music and SWB variables and for qualities of the studies.\nFindings: A total of 431 sources were included in the final review. The most commonly studied music activity was singing, and the most commonly examined SWB outcome was social connection. Most sources reported qualitative results and indicated music engagement—across several forms of engagement—was beneficial to several SWB outcomes, such as social connection, loneliness, and belonging.\nConclusions: The sources reviewed examined both participatory and receptive music activities and examined a range of SWB outcomes. Most studies reported music engagement was associated with greater SWB; however, limitations of study design show the need for more rigorous research on this topic.",

          "authors": "Anna-Chiara Schaub; Anna-Lena Eckert; Stijn Adriaan Nuiten; Veith Weilnhammer; Philipp Sterzer",
          "abstract": "Background: Serial dependencies in perceptual tasks have been suggested to reflect implicit perceptual priors derived from short-term perceptual history. A reduced weighting of perceptual priors has been proposed as a mechanism underlying psychotic experiences such as delusions and hallucinations. Here, we sought to characterize the effects of implicit and explicit perceptual priors on auditory perceptual decision-making and their modulation by psychosis proneness.\n\nResults: Across two online experiments, 197 healthy participants completed an auditory two-alternative forced-choice task and standard questionnaires assessing psychosis proneness. In experiment 1, we assessed serial dependence by quantifying the influence of previous on current perceptual choices. Participants revealed a tendency to repeat previous choices, suggesting they formed implicit priors based on recent choice history. The weighting of these implicit priors correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In experiment 2, we additionally manipulated explicit perceptual priors by providing probabilistic cues before each trial. We found significant effects of both implicit (i.e., choice history) and explicit (i.e., probabilistic cues) prior information, but only the latter correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In both experiments, reliance on sensory information was increased with higher psychosis proneness. Using hidden Markov models, we found no conclusive evidence for a modulation of temporal dynamics of serial dependencies by psychosis proneness. \n\nConclusions: Our findings support the notion of a shift in perceptual inference away from perceptual priors and towards sensory information as a mechanism facilitating psychosis. However, the degree to which different types of perceptual priors are modulated by psychosis proneness seems to depend on experimental context.",

          "abstract": "The war in Ukraine has been accompanied by disinformation campaigns, especially from Russian sources. Given the opinion-forming power of such content, exploring factors associated with susceptibility to disinformation is essential. Since disinformation and conspiracy beliefs often overlap, we examined predictors commonly linked to conspiratorial thinking: collective narcissism (CN) and political orientation. Across two studies with demographically diverse Polish samples, we found that collective narcissism was positively related to belief in Russian disinformation and both generic and COVID-related conspiracy theories, while a liberal political orientation was negatively associated with these beliefs. Results suggest that CN's influence may vary for disinformation and COVID conspiracies when accounting for political orientation, with collective narcissism showing a stronger association among individuals with liberal views.",

          "abstract": "We had aggregated country TOEFL scores of at least 15 million non-immersion learners coming from 127 countries around the globe with 65 L1s covering a time span of 16 years (2005 – 2020) at our disposal. This rich database allowed us to examine not just the effects of various country level characteristics, including linguistic distances, but also their dynamic effects over this time range. We performed this analysis by applying a generalised additive mixed regression model (GAMM) to reveal intricate, non-linear interaction effects, especially those of the three linguistic distance measures we applied, and, more in particular, to map the changing role of morphological distance in relation to lexical and phonological distance. All three distances contributed in explaining L2 English country scores: the larger the distance is the lower L2 English proficiency. Morphological distance delivers its own, distinctive contribution, next to and in competition with the lexical and phonological distances. All three distances interact with year of testing. These changes seem to reflect the increasing presence and dominance of L2 English worldwide, but it shows at the same time that the impact of distance is dynamic. Morphological and phonological properties become more important the higher the L2 proficiency is, while the importance of lexical distance gradually decreases.",

By drawing from insights in neuroscience, this paper explores how these gamified elements stimulate dopamine release, shaping consumer behavior and promoting sustained brand attachment.

          "authors": "Anahika Salas; Patricio Saavedra",
          "abstract": "Excessive screen use by preschool children has been shown to negatively affect their well-being and physical, cognitive and emotional development. Although there are many interventions aimed at reducing screen time, most of them have focused on adolescents and adults, leaving a significant gap in the study of strategies aimed at early childhood, especially in those carried out in community-based settings. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review through which we analysed 30 studies on interventions implemented in community-based settings such as playgroups, Head Start Centres, kindergartens, universities, schools, infant centres, daycare centres, childcare centres, community centres, and multisetting early childhood education centres. Our findings shed light on the effectiveness of different types of interventions. Thus, those interventions directly addressing screen time reduction might be more effective than those aimed at indirectly reducing the time preschool children spend in front of screens (e.g., fostering physical activities). Moreover, we found that classroom-based, family-based, and multicomponent interventions achieved a success rate of around 50% in reducing screen time. At the same time, interventions that modify preschool children’s physical and social environment, although less common, are fully effective in some contexts, such as childcare centres. The discussion underlines the importance of tailoring screen time reduction interventions adapted to the specific contexts in which preschool children are raised. Also, it highlights the relevance of developing holistic interventions promoting active collaboration between parents, educators, and the broader community in support of preschool children’s well-being.",

We aimed at describing how lived experience is altered in ecological anxiety, how it can be differentiated from general anxiety disorder, and generating hypotheses about potential cognitive mechanisms. We collected interview data from 30 participants. Ecological anxiety manifests through various symptoms, such as fatigue, ruminating, bodily symptoms, and disordered sleep. Participants reported feelings of guilt, shame, and anger. We identified two types of ecological anxiety: informational and experiential. A key characteristic of ecological anxiety is marked attitude towards information. Participants also experienced a distorted sense of time, feeling alienated from the future and rushed in the present. This research suggests that while ecological anxiety does amount to a distinct experiential state, it shares similarities with both generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

          "authors": "Leonard Konstantin Kulisch; Ana Lorena Domínguez Rojas; Silvia Schneider; Babett Voigt",
          "abstract": "Around the globe, cultures seem to be leaning more towards an independent social orientation while turning away from a more interdependent social orientation. This shift also affects the cultural norms regarding the qualities favored in children, known as socialization goals. The cultural fraud hypothesis suggests that this cultural change has negative consequences for population health. An emphasis on individuation and individual achievement may particularly harm children's mental health. This study explored links between cohort changes in socialization goal norms and the incidence of anxiety disorders in children across 70 countries from all world regions. The World Value Survey provided data on socialization goals, while anxiety disorder incidence rates for 0-19-year-olds were estimated through the Global Burden of Disease study. Additionally, societal development indicators were obtained from the Human Development Report. Mixed-effects models were used to predict anxiety disorder incidence in 70 countries over six study waves (1989-2022). Results revealed expected global shifts towards socialization goals linked to an independent social orientation and away from those linked to an interdependent social orientation. The largest association emerged between religious faith as a quality in children (linked to an interdependent social orientation) and anxiety. When religious faith became less important, anxiety disorder incidence increased. Additionally, changes in the importance of tolerance and thrift were weakly related to changes in anxiety incidence among children. The correlation between thrift and anxiety incidence became insignificant when societal development was taken into account. Overall, a decline in religious socialization, rather than a general shift towards independent social orientations, may explain the increase in child anxiety incidences worldwide. Religion may serve as a protective factor by providing a sense of purpose and relatedness. This analysis underscores the relevance of cultural change for children's healthy development and the need for increased support of children in increasingly secular societies.",

          "abstract": "Financial decision-making often involves numerical reasoning. For example, monetary lotteries—a common task in economic psychology—require evaluating payoffs and probabilities. To make decisions consistent with normative standards like Expected Value (EV), individuals must accurately perform calculations. However, many people lack objective numeracy or numeric self-efficacy, which limits their ability to make EV-consistent choices and maximize earnings.\nThis study tested whether brief interventions could enhance financial decision-making and emotional responses during such tasks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Control, Calculation, or Estimation. In the Control condition, participants made choices in ten monetary lotteries. In the Calculation condition, they received instructions on how to compute EV before the task. In the Estimation condition, they were additionally trained in estimation strategies to simplify calculations.\nResults indicated marginal effects of the interventions on both EV-consistent choices and negative emotional reactions. Planned comparisons showed that participants in the Calculation condition made significantly more EV-consistent choices than those in the Control condition. Notably, deliberation time—but not emotional reactions—mediated the relationship between condition and EV-consistent choices. Participants in the Calculation condition spent more time deliberating, which contributed to better decision-making.\nIn summary, the findings provide evidence that teaching EV calculation can improve financial decision-making by promoting deliberation. While the interventions had limited effects, they suggest that even brief educational strategies may support more rational economic choices.",

          "authors": "leif erik langsdorf; Torsten Schubert",
          "abstract": "In dual-task (DT) situations performance typically deteriorates compared to single-tasking situations. These decrements can be explained by the serial scheduling of response selection stages constituting a central bottleneck as with decreasing stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) the reaction time for the second task (task 2; RT2) increases. Prior studies indicated that the reaction time for the first task (task 1; RT1) and RT2, are improved in reward compared to no-reward conditions for a block-wise reward prospect, which reflects reward-related optimization in DT processing. However, it remains unclear whether participants can flexibly utilize reward information in a trial-by-trial manner to achieve reward-related improvements. Additionally, it is unclear whether a potential reward-related optimization reflects optimized task preparation only or whether the prospect of reward can evoke an additional task optimization mechanism that extends beyond preparation-related processing improvements. For Experiment 1, we combined a trial-wise reward prospect for participants' task 1 performance, which was signaled by a cue before task 1 onset, with block-wise presented cue-target-intervals (CTI) of either 200 ms or 700 ms, resulting in precise temporal predictability of task 1 onset by participants. First, we observed a reduced RT1 in the reward compared to the no-reward condition. Furthermore, the reward effects increased on RT2 for short compared to long SOAs, reflecting effect propagation at short SOA from task 1 onto task 2. Second, RTs decreased with increasing CTI, while reward effects increased with increasing CTI. Consequently, preparation-related processing improvements of DT performance were additionally improved by reward utilization. For Experiment 2, the temporal predictability of task 1 onset was reduced compared to Experiment 1 by presenting CTIs randomized within blocks, which allowed replicating the result pattern of Experiment 1.  Across both experiments, the results indicate that participants can flexibly utilize reward information in a trial-by-trial manner and that reward utilization additionally improves preparation-related processing improvements for DT conditions with predictable and less predictable task 1 onset.\nKeywords: dual-tasking, reward utilization, motivation, temporal preparation",

          "abstract": "In a spatial Stroop task, responses to gaze stimuli are faster when the direction and location are incongruent (reversed congruency effect), whereas responses to arrow stimuli are faster when congruent (standard congruency effect). To explain the reversal of gaze, Tanaka et al. (2024) proposed a dual-stage hypothesis comprising target-background segregation and selective inhibition. This hypothesis predicts that the enhancement of selective inhibition reduces and increases the standard and reversed congruency effects, respectively. As selective inhibition varies on a trial-by-trial basis, we tested the dual-stage hypothesis by examining congruency sequence effects (CSE) in the spatial Stroop task. We analysed the data collected from 409 participants previously tested in our laboratory. The results showed a decrease in the standard congruency effect (standard CSE) and an increase in the reversed congruency effect (reversed CSE) after incongruent trials (N − 1 incongruent) relative to congruent trials (N − 1 congruent). Reaction time distribution analysis revealed that these CSEs emerged from faster responses, suggesting that conflict monitoring in preceding trials enhanced inhibition efficiency in the current trials. These results highlighted the role of selective inhibition in the dual-stage hypothesis. Selective inhibition dynamically changes its size and onset depending on the preceding trial type and contributes to these sequential effects.",

Specifically, we synthesized 233 correlation coefficients from 31 studies and 32 samples (N = 16,977) in 24 countries, conducting a multilevel meta-analysis with the assumption of correlated effects. The meta-analytic correlations of the individual, contextual, and technological factors with AI adoption were moderate, positive, and ranged between r ̅s = .50-.56. Within the three broad categories of factors, the correlations exhibited large overall heterogeneity (I^2 above 98%), which could be partly explained by the diversity of constructs and the student samples’ experience with AI. Usage intentions, self-beliefs, and general attitudes towards AI were the strongest individual factors (r ̅s = .60-.64), whereas social norms and influences were the strongest contextual factors (r ̅ = .56). Perceptions of the usefulness, relevance, and impact of AI technologies were driving technological factors (r ̅ = .56). These results point to the importance of considering individual, contextual, and technological factors when examining students’ AI adoption and highlight the need to explore how to leverage social norms and enhance perceived usefulness to encourage AI engagement within student populations in tertiary education.",

At g4r.org, researchers can (1) enable their study participants to interact with GPT (such as ChatGPT), (2) customize GPT Interfaces to guide participants’ interactions with GPT (e.g., set constraints on topics or adjust GPT’s tone or response style), and (3) capture participants’ interactions with GPT by downloading data on messages exchanged between participants and GPT. By facilitating study participants’ interactions with GPT and providing detailed data on these interactions, G4R can support research on topics such as consumer interactions with AI agents or LLMs, AI-assisted decision-making, and linguistic patterns in human-AI communication. With this goal in mind, we provide a step-by-step guide to using G4R at g4r.org.",

          "abstract": "Stereotype Threat (ST) occurs when individuals primed with negative stereotypes underperform relative to a control group. Activating ST increases anxiety and worries about being negatively perceived, also introducing mental distraction that negatively impacts performance. We consider racial/ethnic ST effects on standardized test performance (SDTP) on the verbal and quantitative reasoning sections of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). Across two experiments, Working Memory Capacity (WMC) is investigated as a mediator and/or moderator of ST for race/ethnicity (Experiment 1, final n = 447, 19% Black, 81% White, 59% Female and for Experiment 2, n = 166, 41% Black, 59% White, 73% Female). We find a lack of strong evidence for the classic ST effect of a race by condition interaction. However, we show evidence that for Black students, higher trait WMC moderates racial/ethnic ST such that higher WMC is associated with higher scores on standardized tests under conditions of race related ST. Our findings suggest the importance of higher WMC for racial minority students in remaining mentally resilient and maintaining performance during ST. Future work should address diversity and inclusion concerns regarding research on ST effects for racial/ethnic minorities, include more work examining racial/ethnic ST based on replication issues and statistical power, as well as more examination of the importance of WMC for performance under racial/ethnic ST. Future work should also consider the roles of protective factors, such as mindfulness and self-regulation practices in the context of racial/ethnic ST as WMC and SDTP have been shown to generally improve through implementing these practices.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is essential to conceptualizing, defining, and assessing much of\npsychopathology. Despite this prominence, cognitive abilities are not included in the prevailing\nempirically based classification system: the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology\n(HiTOP). This gap exists because the factor analytic literature HiTOP is based on has solely used\nreporter measures rather than neuropsychological tests needed to measure cognitive ability.\nGiven HiTOP’s influence on research and clinical practice, the omission of cognitive functions\nfrom the model is consequential. This study aimed to determine how cognitive abilities fit into\nthe empirical structure of psychopathology with a meta-analytic joint factor analysis. We pooled\ndata from three published meta-analyses into a single correlation matrix of 8 DSM disorders and\n7 cognitive functions. We then fit a series of models to the meta-analytic correlation matrix using\nexploratory factor analysis, and correlated factors across levels to estimate the hierarchical\nstructure. The highest level of the model included a general factor with strong loadings of all\ndisorders and cognitive functions (median l= |.51|, range = |.30| - |.64|). At the lowest level were\nthree superspectra including 1) psychosis and cognitive dysfunction, 2) externalizing, and 3)\nemotional dysfunction. Our results show cognitive abilities can be integrated into the HiTOP\nmodel and point to actionable next steps in research to accomplish this goal.",

Here, we assessed 4,350 healthy individuals and 235 people with major depressive disorder or on antidepressants. The results demonstrated significant symptom overlap between the three syndromes. However, factor analysis revealed five distinct dimensions: depression, anhedonia and three apathy domains (behavioural, social, emotional). While depression was strongly correlated with behavioural apathy and moderately with social apathy, there was no such relationship with emotional apathy. Using a feature-selection algorithm, we identified ten key symptoms – phenotypic markers – that reliably distinguished each syndrome in isolation, with replication in independent datasets. Crucially, emotional apathy emerged as a key domain differentiating apathy from depression and associated with reduced affective empathy as well as diminished sensitivity to emotional intensity. These findings reveal key relationships between apathy, depression, and anhedonia, but also demonstrate their separability on the basis of distinct phenotypic patterns.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Network theory of psychopathology offers a promising framework for personalizing psychotherapy based on personalized symptom networks. However, the estimation of these networks representing an individual's mental disorder is methodologically challenging. The recently developed method of perceived causal relations (PECAN), in which relations between symptoms are determined on the basis of the individual's perception, represents a promising method of network creation. However, no child- or adolescent-sensitive PECAN version exists.\nMethods: This study adapted PECAN for individuals aged 10 and older (PECAN-CA) and evaluated its reliability and feasibility. A total of N = 75 socially anxious children and adolescents (10–21years) created personalized symptom networks based on PECAN-CA for a past social situation. Retest reliability was tested immediately and after four weeks, comparing results to prior studies applying PECAN to adults and adolescents. Exploratory analyses examined factors influencing reliability and feasibility.\nResults: Participants generally rated PECAN-CA as feasible. Networks generated were comparably reliable to those from PECAN studies with adults and more reliable than those from PECAN studies with adolescents. Centrality measures, critical for clinical decisions, showed high reliability (r = .89–.95). Older age and greater understanding of network theory concepts enhanced feasibility and reliability. Selecting fewer symptoms improved reliability.\nConclusion: Overall, PECAN-CA enables the creation of reliable networks in childhood and adolescence. Psychoeducation on concepts of network theory seems important for effective implementation. For younger individuals, PECAN-CA may not work in some cases or only if the number of symptoms included in the network is reduced to a minimum.",

          "abstract": "Relative to fractions, decimal numbers are thought to be easier for students to learn because they employ the base-10 system as whole numbers. However, unlike whole numbers, larger decimals can have fewer digits, leading to worse performance when comparing Inconsistent decimal pairs, like 0.8 vs. 0.26, than Consistent pairs like 0.86 vs. 0.2. Students may be applying the whole number rule: “more digits = larger number” or they could be ignoring the decimal points and comparing 8 vs. 26. This study used neuroimaging and our specially designed stimulus set to distinguish between these possibilities. We focused on the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), implicated in numerical magnitude processing, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, implicated in inhibitory control. We found no neural differences between Consistent and Inconsistent comparisons, suggesting that the number of digits does not drive brain responses in skilled adults (n=21). Instead, for Consistent comparisons, we found that the IPS was sensitive to the actual distance between the decimals, while the ACC showed this pattern for Inconsistent comparisons. Crucially, we also examined the effect of the distance between the decimal pairs when ignoring the decimal point. Here, we found sensitivity to this distance among Inconsistent comparisons in the IPS and insula, suggesting that whole number referents are automatically processed during decimal comparison and require engagement of cognitive control regions to counteract. More broadly, our results underscore the unique challenges of decimal notation, revealing the need for educational practices that emphasize differences to whole numbers rather than highlighting similarities.",

          "abstract": "Backgrounds: The overlapping symptoms between bipolar disorder (BD) in the depressive period and major depressive disorder (MDD) pose a substantial challenge in diagnosis and treatment. A prevailing hypothesis suggests that mood dysregulation may be linked to impairments in the dopamine reward system in the brain, but the underlying neurocomputational differences between BD and MDD remain elusive. In this study, we investigate whether atypical reward processing affects subjective mood in adolescents with BD and MDD. Our findings aim to elucidate the behavioral and neural differences between the two groups, facilitating more accurate and timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\nMethods: Forty-five adolescents (aged ≤ 19 years) diagnosed with BD (N = 25) or MDD (N = 20) were asked to complete a risky gambling task while their brain responses were recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Several computational models were constructed to uncover the associations between various reward components (e.g., reward prediction errors, RPE) and trial-wise fluctuation in subjective mood during the gambling task.\n\nResults: We found that adolescents with BD exhibited a greater behavioral propensity for uncertain options, as compared to those with MDD. Computational modeling and mediation analysis suggest a triple relationship between RPE-mood association, decision rationality, and symptom severity. Using fMRI, we further observed distinct brain response patterns in a distributed mood regulation network between adolescents with BD and MDD.\n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of RPE in mood regulation and suggest more potential engagement of the model-free control system in BD as compared to MDD. These results provide new insights into the diagnosis and rehabilitation of BD and MDD in adolescents.",

This mechanism could explain the high bruxism-PTSD comorbidity (60-70% vs. 8-15% general population) and offers immediately testable interventions, including botulinum toxin to masseters and occlusal splints to disrupt encoding.

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this brief report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. We provide a set of equations for calculating attenuation effects across these scenarios. This work has important implications for biomarker research and clinical translation, as well as any other area of research that relies on group comparisons to inform policy and real-world applications.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\n\nVisual hallucinations (VH) are a core symptom of both Lewy body diseases (LBDs; e.g., Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies) and serotonergic psychedelics (SPs; e.g., psilocybin and mescaline). While these classes of VH differ in etiology, shared pathways are suggested by overlapping phenomenology and neural mechanisms. This review explores similarities and differences in VH between LBDs and SPs, focusing on phenomenology, cortical function, and serotonergic modulation.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis narrative review synthesizes findings from neurology, cognitive neuroscience, and systems neuroscience to compare VH in LBDs and SPs. The literature includes studies with both human subjects and animal models that examine cortical activity patterns, neuromodulatory mechanisms, and VH phenomenology.\n\nStudy Results\n\nBoth LBDs and SPs exhibit distinct visual aberrations, ranging from minor metamorphopsias to complex hallucinations. Specific classes of VH in LBDs resemble those induced by SPs (e.g., illusory motion and entity encounters), suggesting shared neural mechanisms. Neuroimaging studies indicate a common pattern of hyperactive associative cortex and hypoactive sensory cortex. At the neuromodulator level, SP-induced VH involves serotonin 2A and 1A receptor (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₁AR) modulation, while in LBDs, 5-HT₂AR upregulation correlates with increased VH, and its inhibition (e.g., with pimavanserin) reduces VH. Two shared cortical signatures are highlighted: reduced visual evoked responses and shifts toward visual excitation.\n\nConclusions\n\nExamining cortical and neuromodulatory similarities between LBD- and SP-induced VH may elucidate the link between visual degradation, excitation, and hallucinogenesis. Future research should employ real-time neuroimaging of discrete hallucinatory episodes to identify shared mechanisms and develop targeted interventions for LBD hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process.

When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of curve group such as similarity curve using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using an exponential distribution. We obtained an equation relating the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time he or she is depressed, and described the importance of considering the time when a person becomes depressed. Next, we derived an equation giving the time of being depressed and showed that the time of being depressed has an exponential distribution. We also described the connection to similarity curve and other results in the previously discussed paper. Finally, we stated that placing oneself in an environment or state where one is less likely to become depressed is a way to cope with depression.",

          "abstract": "Food preferences differ among individuals, and these variations reflect underlying personalities or mental tendencies. However, capturing and predicting these individual differences remains challenging. Here, we propose a novel method to predict individual food preferences by using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training), which can capture both visual and semantic features of food images. By applying this method to food image rating data obtained from human subjects, we demonstrated our method's prediction capability, which achieved better scores compared to methods using pixel-based embeddings or label text-based embeddings. Our method can also be used to characterize individual traits as characteristic vectors in the embedding space. By analyzing these individual trait vectors, we captured the tendency of the trait vectors of high picky eater group. In contrast, the group with relatively high levels of general psychopathology did not show any bias in the distribution of trait vectors, but their preferences were significantly less well-represented by a single trait vector for each individual. Our results demonstrate that CLIP embeddings, which integrate both visual and semantic features, not only effectively predict food image preferences but also provide valuable representations of individual trait characteristics, suggesting potential applications for understanding and addressing food preference patterns in both research and clinical contexts.",

Some authors explain the multidimensionality by additional construct-irrelevant factors, such as social desirability, careless responding, or verbal abilities. However, we focus on spurious multidimensionality, caused by imperfections in the measurement model, and provide an unifying account of why it arises. We hypothesized that if the latent factor and at least two groups of items have the same non-linear relationship, it will require modeling an additional, apparent “method” factor to account for the non-linear relationship, even though the items are fundamentally unidimensional. An empirical study (N = 11,979 people, 51% women) supported our expectations. Items sharing a similar pattern of misfit disrupted unidimensionality and tended to form an additional factor, but this factor still contained construct-relevant variance. Our findings pinpoint under which conditions spurious factors arise and underscore how it is essential to check whether the relationship between a latent variable and its indicators is modeled correctly to avoid spurious multidimensionality, interpret spurious factors substantively, or needlessly remove items that seemingly disrupt unidimensionality.",

          "abstract": "To obtain comparability between scores on different forms of tests and exams, one can use test equating or linking methods. Most equating and linking methods require either common (anchor) items or equivalent groups of test takers to link the tests. However, in some circumstances neither of these two situations may occur. In these situations, expert judgment is required to assess the difficulty of the items of the two tests. One method to use expert judgment for linking tests is pairwise linking. This is done by asking experts to compare one item from Test 1 to one item from Test 2, do this for several different item pairs, and rate which of the items of the pair they think is most difficult on the attribute that the tests measure. In this chapter, we introduce an adjusted Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise linking that uses both information from the expert judgments and from the items of the separate tests. We tested the performance of the model in terms of bias and precision of the shift parameters that are used to link the tests. The adjusted BTL model for pairwise linking can be used to link tests without common items or equivalent groups. The model can be used for linking tests with dichotomous items and provides a starting point for model adaptations allowing for more general situations like test with polytomous scored items. We advise to use at least 800 pairwise item comparisons from experts about the relative difficulty of the item for a student with average ability as input to obtain a sufficiently precise link between the two tests.",

          "authors": "Yoann Stussi",
          "abstract": "Pavlovian threat acquisition and extinction are fundamental processes by which individuals\nlearn about threat and safety in their environment. Research has shown that humans learn\nmore rapidly and persistently to associate threatening and—somewhat counterintuitively—\npositive rewarding stimuli with aversive events, supporting predictions derived from\nappraisal theories of emotion (Stussi et al., 2018; Stussi, Pourtois, et al., 2021). Here, the\npresent study aimed to provide a confirmatory analysis of these findings and further\ncharacterize their algorithmic bases. Data from the four original experiments (N = 247) using\na differential Pavlovian threat conditioning paradigm were combined and reanalyzed. In this\nparadigm, threat-relevant (angry faces, snakes), positive-relevant (baby faces, happy faces,\nerotic images), and neutral (neutral faces, colored squares) stimuli were used as conditioned\nstimuli, and skin conductance response was measured as an index of learning. Computational\nmodeling was applied to identify signatures of learning biases in Pavlovian threat acquisition\nand extinction. An expanded model comparison indicated that a reinforcement-learning\nmodel differentiating between excitatory (learning from reinforcement) and inhibitory\n(learning from the absence of reinforcement) learning best explained the observed data.\nAlthough no evidence for differences in excitatory learning rates was found between stimulus\ncategories, both threat- and positive-relevant stimuli exhibited a lower inhibitory learning rate\ncompared to neutral stimuli, contributing to the persistence of the conditioned response\nduring extinction. These results confirm the robustness of the original findings and further\nvalidate the appraisal-based approach, thereby informing the affective and computational\ndeterminants of Pavlovian threat extinction biases and their translational relevance.",

          "abstract": "Despite media portrayals to the contrary, immigrants to the United States tend to commit less crime than U.S.-born citizens. However, the factors underlying this at the individual level are not fully understood. To examine this, we conducted two complementary studies among individuals in the U.S.- México border region who were recently booked into jail. In the first study, we examined the current charges and pretrial risk assessments of 5,175 successive intakes to the jail. Compared to U.S.-born citizens, immigrants had less extensive criminal histories and were less likely to have current drug charges, though they had higher rates of current DWI/DUI charges. In the second study, we interviewed and conducted structured risk assessments with a sample of 273 individuals booked to the jail. We found that immigrants, particularly undocumented immigrants, had lower levels of seven of the Central Eight risk factors for crime, and that higher levels of acculturation towards U.S. culture were associated with higher levels of risk. We also found that undocumented immigrants were less likely than U.S.-born citizens or documented immigrants to be booked on serious charges such as violence or DWI/DUI, and most (58%) were booked on offenses related to illegal immigration (e.g., illegal entry). We conclude that policies limiting immigration (particularly from México) based on the idea that immigrants are prone to crime are misguided given our finding that jailed immigrants have low levels of criminal risk factors. We discuss our findings within the context of informing correctional policy, practice, and research.",

There are only few original research studies on this condition and no study that has meta-analytically synthesized findings to describe the characteristics of persons with emetophobia. To this end, we extracted data from 31 reports and—as we examined different dependent variables—each meta-analysis was based on five to 21 samples. The pooled mean age of persons with emetophobia was 29 years but was reduced to 21–27 years when adjusting for publication bias. The pooled mean age of disorder onset was 10 years. The pooled proportion of females was 91%. The pooled proportions of reporting fear of vomiting oneself, fear of seeing others vomit, or both, were 47%, 11%, and 39%. The most common comorbid mental disorders were social anxiety disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. The pooled point prevalence of emetophobia was 5%. Higher emetophobic symptomatology moderately related to higher disgust propensity and higher anxiety, and weakly related to higher depressive symptomatology. This meta-analysis is the first to quantify that most adults with emetophobia are in early adulthood but the disorder started in childhood, almost all are women, the primary locus of fear is vomiting oneself, the most common comorbid mental disorders are other anxiety and affective disorders, and higher emetophobic symptomatology relates to a more general tendency to be easily disgusted and to be anxious. Studies based on representative samples to obtain reliable estimates on the prevalence of emetophobia are needed.",

          "abstract": "Self-labeling with a mental illness, for example deciding that one “has depression,” has the potential to impact clinical outcomes through multiple cognitive and behavioral pathways. Despite such possibilities, little empirical research has examined these pathways. We propose a conceptual model, which we call the mental illness self-labeling model, that can be used to study the clinical consequences of mental illness self-labeling. We begin by reviewing existing literature on self-labeling, including sociological research on modified labeling theory, and how it can be leveraged to support the conceptual approach we propose. We then outline the proposed model, articulating how self-labeling can cause beliefs about mental illnesses to be internalized, and how subsequent changes in psychological mediators (such as perceived control, self-blame, and others) can have downstream effects on clinical outcomes. Our model provides a conceptual framework and methodological toolkit for researchers interested in investigating the clinical consequences of mental illness self-labeling.",

While excess weight has been associated with difficulties in cognitive and affective processes, their interplay has not been thoroughly explored. This study examines the network structure of anxiety/depression, emotion regulation (ER), cognitive flexibility, and eating pathology with a dimensional approach to body mass index (BMI).\nThe sample consisted of 174 individuals (n = 48 males) with normal weight (n = 48), overweight (n = 26), and obesity (n = 100). The mean BMI was 32.80 (SD = 9.68). We estimated a regularized partial correlation network. Bootstrapping was used to assess network stability with the correlation stability (CS) coefficient. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by comparing the full sample network to participants with overweight/obesity only.\nThe three highest Expected Influence (EI) values were Lack of ER Strategies (EI = 1.19), Eating Concerns (EI = 1.15) and Overvaluation of Weight and Shape (EI = 1.11). The most central bridge node was Depression (BEI = 0.37). Binge Eating was connected to Lack of ER strategies in both networks. Cognitive Rigidity was connected to Overvaluation of Weight and Shape in network 1. BMI was significantly more central in the full sample, compared to the sensitivity network (p &lt; .01).\nOur results point to the importance of incorporating alternative ER strategies in treatment, in addition to weight, shape, and eating concerns. Depressive symptoms bridged ER difficulties, BMI and eating pathology, highlighting the relevance of evaluating and treating depression in routine clinical care.",

Notably, the subject maintained high-order narrative reasoning, metacognitive flexibility, and symbolic visualization—even during a real-time environmental stressor (a 4.9-magnitude earthquake).

          "abstract": "To understand how the brain responds to robots with varying levels of human-likeness, we investigated the electrophysiological neural correlates of the uncanny valley effect while human observers viewed pictures of various robot faces. We examined three event-related potentials (N400, N170, and Late Positive Potential, or LPP) and two oscillatory components (frontal alpha asymmetry and frontal-midline theta) and found characteristic non-linear trajectories of the N400 amplitude when plotted against the self-rated human-likeness of the robot faces, similar to the trajectory found for the self-rated likability score. The frontal alpha asymmetry also showed a similar trajectory but not was statistically significant, while the N170, LPP, and frontal-midline theta showed parabolic trajectories against the human-likeness scores. The N170 appeared to show larger amplitudes for more mechanical robot faces with little change across more human-like faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta produced the highest amplitudes for the middle ranges of the human-likeness scores, with lower amplitudes for more mechanical and near-human-like faces. These results corroborated the proposal that the uncanny valley effect stems from expectation violation for human faces, but they surprisingly provided little evidence for affective reactions to uncanny robot faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta could reflect increased cognitive control for ambiguous faces rather than their uncanniness, whereas the N170 appeared to reflect visual processing of facial configurations irrespective of their emotional contents. These findings suggest that the uncanny valley effect is primarily a cognitive phenomenon, and its emotional impact might be less prominent than commonly believed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Siblings of children with neurodevelopmental conditions experience conflicting emotions and have an increased risk of mental health problems. Several sibling interventions have been developed, but few are readily available, leaving many siblings unsupported. Therefore, the free, online, self-administered sibling serious game ‘Broodles’ was developed. This study assessed its social validity and effectiveness in promoting quality of life, and inter- and intrapersonal factors in siblings (6–9 years) of children with intellectual disabilities and/or visual impairments. Methods: A mixed methods, waitlist control group, randomized controlled trial was conducted. In total, 107 Dutch or Belgian parent-child dyads completed questionnaires at three timepoints (baseline, one-month post-test, two-month follow-up). The intervention group also completed post-test interviews. Effects were assessed using multilevel modelling, and thematic analysis was applied to the evaluations. Results: Significant, weak interaction effects (R² = .03–.06) were found on sibling negative adjustment, but only in those who completed ≥75% of the game and followed the study timeline. Regardless of group, (very) small, significant improvements over time were found on several outcomes (R² = .01–.06). ‘Broodles’ was experienced as fun (80%) and helpful (79%). Perceived learning outcomes included the themes: ‘sibling awareness and validation’, ‘emotions and needs’, ‘coping with emotions and situations’ and ‘family interactions’. Conclusion: Although quantitative data showed small effects, qualitative data revealed a variety of learning outcomes which can contribute to siblings’ resilience, and prevention of mental health problems. To unlock its full potential, future studies should examine if additional family-targeted components can enhance the intervention’s impact.",

The benefits of a candidate control signal are weighed against its costs (e.g., opportunity costs). Recent theorizing has found that, despite promoting the counterintuitive behavior of longer deliberation, which is less rewarding in the short term, it is nevertheless normative to account for the value of learning when determining control allocation. Here, we sought to test this proposal by examining whether people were willing to allocate greater control and thereby expend greater effort (e.g., deliberate for longer) when they perceived a task to be learnable compared to when they did not. We found that participants' proficiency and learning rate in the first block of a simple perceptual dot-motion task were able to predict their willingness to deliberate in a second block. These findings support the hypothesis that agents consider learnability when allocating cognitive control, and comply with a formal model of control allocation that considers the future discounted value of learning on reward.",

Odwołując się do matematycznej topologii – w szczególności do pojęcia wymiarowości i rzutowania – proponuje nową interpretację konstruktów psychologicznych, wykraczającą poza klasyczne reprezentacje dwuwymiarowe. Artykuł podejmuje temat topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym, wskazując, że wiele dotychczasowych modeli – tradycyjnie analizowanych w przestrzeniach dwuwymiarowych – może w rzeczywistości posiadać ukrytą strukturę trójwymiarową. W oparciu o analizy koncepcyjne, metodologiczne i psychometryczne autor(ka) pokazuje, że przejście do modelowania trójwymiarowego pozwala na pełniejsze odwzorowanie badanych konstruktów psychologicznych. Przykład modelu błędów wychowawczych Antoniny Guryckiej służy jako ilustracja sytuacji, w której pojawienie się dodatkowego wymiaru wynika z niespójności interpretacyjnych w centrum modelu kołowego. Artykuł omawia ograniczenia klasycznych metod statystycznych, takich jak analiza czynnikowa, i proponuje alternatywne podejścia analityczne – w tym maszyny wektorów nośnych z jądrem RBF (z obszaru sztucznej inteligencji) oraz topologiczną analizę danych (TDA). Metody te umożliwiają wychwycenie głębi i złożoności strukturalnej modeli psychologicznych, kwestionując tym samym dotychczasowe założenia psychometrii i diagnozy psychologicznej. W zakończeniu wskazano, w jaki sposób topologizacja może wpłynąć na przyszłość teorii psychologicznych, metod pomiaru i interpretacji terapeutycznej.",

          "abstract": "In large-scale educational assessment, students’ academic outcomes can evolve over time, due to various effect modifiers. For instance, parents’  education level, a common modifier, has been found to have time-varying effects on children’s test scores, leading to heterogeneous academic trajectories. To model these varying trajectories, parametric models like hierarchical linear models (HLMs) are commonly deployed. While these highly parametric methods are interpretable, their predictive capacities have not been rigorously compared to those of more flexible nonparametric approaches. We present the results of systematic simulation studies and empirical analyses comparing traditional parametric models to Bayesian nonparametric models based on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). Our findings indicate that BART-based alternatives can (1) achieve comparable out-of-sample prediction as HLMs, after accounting for individual variability over time; (2) provide a reasonable amount of interpretability and uncertainty quantification; and (3) do not incur much more computational burden. This work contributes to the existing social science literature by demonstrating that Bayesian treed regression methods are viable and feasible alternatives to conventional HLMs for predicting heterogeneous trajectories across time.",

          "abstract": "Teaching efficacy plays a crucial role in both teacher and student outcomes. Despite its importance, there are issues with the measurement and statistical representation of teaching efficacy. This study evaluated several measurement models of teaching efficacy, identifying the bifactor exploratory structural equation model (B-ESEM) as the best-fitting solution. We assessed its measurement invariance across five countries (Brazil, Mainland China, Singapore, USA, and Slovenia) and examined its criterion validity with respect to job satisfaction with the environment and the profession. The B- ESEM demonstrated strong measurement invariance, confirming that teaching efficacy, as measured by both general (G) and specific (S) factors, is interpreted similarly across different cultural and linguistic contexts. This contrasts with prior studies which used traditional confirmatory factor analysis that found only weak or partial invariance, highlighting the advantages of using B-ESEM to eliminate country- level biases. Criterion validity results indicated that general (G) teaching efficacy was systematically positively linked with job satisfaction and there was one single S-factor that was linked with job satisfaction: efficacy for student engagement was positively associated with satisfaction with the work environment, but not with satisfaction with the profession. These findings offer implications for theoretical refinement and applied research. Future research should explore longitudinal designs and continue employing advanced statistical methods to reflect the multidimensional nature of teaching efficacy.",

          "abstract": "This retrospective case study features a woman in her mid-50s who spent her childhood in a religious community plagued by sexual abuse of children. She was abused by her father for more than a decade. The church and her mother ignored her reports about it. In her early twenties, she enrolled herself in the Erhard Seminars Training program that destabilized her, inducing a first-onset psychosis, decades later used as the main rationale for diagnosing her with bipolar disorder. For the following decades, she suffered from severe depression and emotional isolation but was functional professionally and became a medical doctor. 35 years of talk therapy helped somewhat but did not resolve trauma ingrained in her body nor her at-times catatonic depression.\n\nIn her early 50s, she experimented with psilocybin, which resulted in somatic improvement but did not resolve her depression. She wanted to attend underground ayahuasca ceremonies but was rejected because of her bipolar diagnosis. Eventually, she decided not to disclose her diagnosis and attended four ceremonies in two different ceremony groups, with excellent outcomes. She considered that the core of her embodied trauma had dissolved.\n\nThe rationale for assigning diagnoses is questioned; a focus on etiology combined with the broad-spectrum nature of psychedelic therapy may mostly eliminate the need to discern between 'psychiatric conditions'. Trauma is considered socially contagious, similar to infectious diseases. The prohibition of psychedelic therapies is interpreted as a society-wide refusal to recognize trauma: a refusal to see what actually happened and happens.",

This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of SWAN, a game-based digital intervention targeting foundational number language skills: counting and transcoding.\n\nAims: (1) To explore rates of recruitment, retention and adherence to SWAN; (2) To assess whether SWAN improves numeracy skills.\n\nMethods &amp; Procedures: Eighteen individuals with aphasia were given SWAN to play at home for 15 minutes per day over three weeks. Outcome measures included assessments of transcoding, counting, calculation and functional numeracy. Linear mixed-effects models evaluated intervention effects, with the Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) calculated to identify individuals who responded to the intervention.\n\nOutcomes &amp; Results: SWAN was feasible to deliver remotely, with high adherence. Significant group-level improvements were observed for transcoding, counting and calculation, although counting was the only outcome where no improvement was observed at baseline. Twelve participants demonstrated meaningful gains in at least one outcome measure, exceeding their individual SDC. Functional numeracy did not improve, though participants reported increased confidence in skills.\n\nConclusions &amp; Implications: The findings suggest that SWAN is effective in motivating users and providing intensive practice for number sequences. However, further research is required which explores individual response to intervention in order to determine those most likely to benefit.",

          "abstract": "Behavioural research indicates that motor learning can be enhanced using combined action observation and motor imagery (AO+MI) in healthy adults. However, notable inconsistencies remain across AO+MI study designs. Our aim was to systematically search all major academic databases to evaluate AO+MI practice effects on motor learning in healthy adults (search completed March 2024). Eligible peer-reviewed studies included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials comparing AO+MI against AO, MI, or controls, written in English. AO+MI was delivered synchronously or asynchronously, with a physical post, retention, or transfer test. Studies involving physical practice during mental practice were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and findings were narratively synthesised. Seventeen studies comprised 34 AO+MI groups across 10 tasks. Positive effects for AO+MI (n=422) were observed, compared to AO (n=99), MI (n=98), and controls (n=227), across tasks, modalities and training durations, and when mentally practised and physically executed actions differed. Limitations included inconsistent terminology, ill-defined interventions, and lack of retention and transfer tests. While AO+MI represents a widely applicable practice augmentation for motor skill development, we recommend designing the right intervention for the right individual. Future research must curb the proliferation of terminology and refine intervention designs to support scientific progress.",

          "abstract": "As psychiatry increasingly embraces precision medicine principles, there has been increasing efforts to characterize the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations (e.g., is biology associated with syndromes or symptoms?). Unfortunately, the vast majority of research selects to test syndromes (e.g., case-control, symptom total/average scores) or individual symptoms a priori based on untested assumptions. Alternatively, most studies that attempt to empirically compare these options test biology as a predictor of a) syndromes and b) symptoms in separate models that are unable to directly falsify the specificity of observed associations because these options are not directly competing for the same variance. In this review, we will (i) discuss the historical tension between symptom- and syndrome-focused psychiatry; (ii) introduce hierarchical phenotyping as an approach to determining the specificity of biology–psychopathology associations; (iii) highlight how hierarchical phenotyping approaches are complementary to leading nosological movements in psychopathology research; (iv) illustrate how a hierarchical phenotyping lens can generate promising future directions for precision psychiatry using immunopsychiatric, genetic, and neurophysiological examples (1); (v) highlight clinical implications of hierarchical phenotyping approaches to psychiatry; (vi) discuss methodological implications of hierarchical phenotyping for best practices in measuring and modeling psychopathology; and (vii) introduce methodological resources for readers interested in investigating hierarchical phenotyping in their own work. In doing so, this review seeks to build the case for hierarchical phenotyping approaches while simultaneously preparing motivated readers to use these methods in their own work to advance precision psychopathology research.",

          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) has been extensively studied in cognitive psychology, with numerous tasks developed to measure its capacity. Among these, binding and updating tasks that assess the ability to build, maintain, and manipulate temporary relational representations have been shown to be particularly suitable for assessing WM capacity (WMC). In the present study, we investigated the specific processes involved in updating during WM encoding by comparing the electrophysiological signals in binding and updating tasks. In addition, we compared specific forms of updating demands by contrasting substitution and transformation processes. Finally, we examined whether individual differences in updating activity are related to WM performance. \nWe recruited a heterogeneous sample of 151 participants (female = 89, Mage = 34.77, SD = 12.78) who completed a binding and two updating tasks while an EEG was recorded. Mass univariate cluster-based permutation analyses of event-related potentials consistently showed a temporally and spatially widespread cluster when comparing updating and binding. This cluster was characterized by an increased positivity associated with updating, appearing predominantly in the frontal regions during early time windows (approximately 130–350 ms after stimulus onset) and later shifting to the parietal regions (from approximately 350 ms onward). Additionally, when comparing transformation and substitution, we found an increase in positivity, peaking within a typical P3 time window (approximately 400 ms). Finally, we found that only individual differences in transformation-related activity were associated with individual differences in WMC. \n\nWe recruited a heterogeneous sample of 151 participants (female = 89, Mage = 34.77, SD = 12.78) who completed a binding and two updating tasks while an EEG was recorded. Mass univariate cluster-based permutation analyses of event-related potentials revealed a temporally and spatially widespread cluster when comparing binding and updating demands. Within this cluster, there was an increase in positivity associated with the processing of updating demands, which was mainly concentrated in frontal regions in the early time window and later shifted towards parietal regions. When comparing transformation and substitution, we also found an increase in positivity, especially within the traditional P3 time window. Our results point to notable differences in the neurophysiological processes underlying the different WM tasks, while indicating greater similarities for the different updating demands. Further exploration of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying WM processing could improve our understanding of the essential functions that underlie WM performance.",

          "abstract": "Backgrounds: The overlapping symptoms between bipolar disorder (BD) in the depressive period and major depressive disorder (MDD) pose a substantial challenge in diagnosis and treatment. A prevailing hypothesis suggests that mood dysregulation may be linked to impairments in the dopamine reward system in the brain, but the underlying neurocomputational differences between BD and MDD remain elusive. In this study, we investigate whether atypical reward processing affects subjective mood in adolescents with BD and MDD. Our findings aim to elucidate the behavioral and neural differences between the two groups, facilitating more accurate and timely diagnosis and intervention.\n\nMethods: Forty-five adolescents (aged ≤ 19 years) diagnosed with BD (N = 25) or MDD (N = 20) were asked to complete a risky gambling task while their brain responses were recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Several computational models were constructed to uncover the associations between various reward components (e.g., reward prediction errors, RPE) and trial-wise fluctuation in subjective mood during the gambling task.\n\nResults: We found that adolescents with BD exhibited a greater behavioral propensity for uncertain options, as compared to those with MDD. Computational modeling and mediation analysis suggest a triple relationship between RPE-mood association, decision rationality, and symptom severity. Using fMRI, we further observed distinct brain response patterns in a distributed mood regulation network between adolescents with BD and MDD.\n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of RPE in mood regulation and suggest more potential engagement of the model-free control system in BD as compared to MDD. These results provide new insights into the diagnosis and rehabilitation of BD and MDD in adolescents.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the varying effects of potential losses compared to gains on mental effort and problem-solving performance. Building on prospect theory and previous studies, we hypothesized that individuals would engage in longer effort when faced with potential losses compared to equivalent potential gains, and that this extended effort would enhance problem-solving performance, particularly in more challenging tasks. Two experimental studies were conducted. Study 1 established that participants persisted longer in tasks designed to avoid monetary losses than to achieve gains, confirming the hypothesis regarding prolonged effort. However, this increased persistence did not translate into better performance across various tasks, suggesting that losses encourage mental effort but do not inherently improve problem-solving efficacy. Study 2, which employed anagrams of varying difficulty, revealed that losses indeed correlated with longer persistence times but only improved performance in tasks deemed more difficult. These findings indicate that the effect of losses on performance is nuanced, highlighting the importance of task difficulty and the sensitivity of performance measures in understanding the interactions between loss aversion and cognitive processing. Overall, the results suggest that while losses prompt greater cognitive engagement, their influence on performance is contingent on task complexity, necessitating further exploration into the conditions under which losses enhance mental effort and problem-solving capabilities.",

          "abstract": "To understand how the brain responds to robots with varying levels of human-likeness, we investigated the electrophysiological neural correlates of the uncanny valley effect while human observers viewed pictures of various robot faces. We examined three event-related potentials (N400, N170, and Late Positive Potential, or LPP) and two oscillatory components (frontal alpha asymmetry and frontal-midline theta) and found characteristic non-linear trajectories of the N400 amplitude when plotted against the self-rated human-likeness of the robot faces, similar to the trajectory found for the self-rated likability score. The frontal alpha asymmetry also showed a similar trajectory but not was statistically significant, while the N170, LPP, and frontal-midline theta showed parabolic trajectories against the human-likeness scores. The N170 appeared to show larger amplitudes for more mechanical robot faces with little change across more human-like faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta produced the highest amplitudes for the middle ranges of the human-likeness scores, with lower amplitudes for more mechanical and near-human-like faces. These results corroborated the proposal that the uncanny valley effect stems from expectation violation for human faces, but they surprisingly provided little evidence for affective reactions to uncanny robot faces. The LPP and frontal-midline theta could reflect increased cognitive control for ambiguous faces rather than their uncanniness, whereas the N170 appeared to reflect visual processing of facial configurations irrespective of their emotional contents. These findings suggest that the uncanny valley effect is primarily a cognitive phenomenon, and its emotional impact might be less prominent than commonly believed.",

They are often constructed using common item, nonequivalent group designs that implicitly rely on the linking items being effectively free from differential item functioning (DIF) or the DIF being symmetric to produce unbiased linking constants. Moderated Nonlinear Factor Analysis (MNLFA) is a measurement model that can be used to understand both the presence of DIF among vertical scale common items and the extent to which the presence of DIF may bias grade-to-grade score distributions. Simulation and real data applications show how models that do and do not account for DIF in vertical scale common items can produce very different answers to the fundamental question of how much students grow from one grade to the next, but that when DIF is not present, MNLFA provides effectively identical growth estimates to traditional concurrent and characteristic curve approaches to vertical linking.",

Latent growth curve modeling (LGM) identified a piecewise decrease in flanker response time: the steepest decline was found from 7 to 9 years old. Boys had lower levels of response time at age 7 than girls. Children showed a linear decrease in behavioral and emotional problems over time. Parallel LGMs revealed that lower levels of initial flanker response time were associated with a stronger decrease in anxiety problems and oppositional defiant problem behavior. A faster decline in response time was associated with a faster decline in depression problems, attention deficit hyperactivity-, and oppositional defiant-related behavior. Results offer insight into the normative development of performance monitoring in childhood and the link between behavioral measures of performance monitoring and behavioral and emotional problems.",

Artykuł podejmuje temat topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym, wskazując, że wiele dotychczasowych modeli – tradycyjnie analizowanych w przestrzeniach dwuwymiarowych – może w rzeczywistości posiadać ukrytą strukturę trójwymiarową.

Metody te umożliwiają wychwycenie głębi i złożoności strukturalnej modeli psychologicznych, kwestionując tym samym dotychczasowe założenia psychometrii i diagnozy psychologicznej.

Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment.

Although initially thought to be quite rare, DP has been estimated to affect between 1.0% and 2.5% of the population, with different estimates reflecting different tools and analytical approaches to categorising DP. Research over the last 25 years has identified several cognitive and neural mechanisms that appear to contribute to face recognition deficits in DP, and both structural and functional neural differences have been found between individuals with DP and neurotypical participants. Nevertheless, clear neurocognitive signatures of this condition remain elusive, likely due to a) the high degree of individual variability observed in the behavioural and cognitive profiles of individuals with DP and b) the focus on group-based analyses rather than on in-depth, individual-level investigations. We recommend that future studies emphasise the latter approach.",

Work in clinical formal theories mainly relies on simulations, which is an intuitive method to evaluate overall model performance but may fall short in establishing a precise link between the mathematical properties of the model and the dynamic property of the model outcome. Moreover, when the model outcome contradicts clinical observations, it is unclear where the discrepancy comes from, and how to improve the model. In this current article, we introduce formal mathematical techniques for graphical model analysis, including phase plane analysis, which allows identifying a system’s stable and unstable equilibria, and bifurcation analysis, a framework to delineate parameter regimes corresponding to qualitatively different dynamical outcomes for a model. Using two formal dynamic models in psychology (one for panic disorder and one for suicidal ideation), we illustrate those methods through an easy-to-use R package, deBif, with a graphical user interface. With these examples, we show the importance of using graphical tools to investigate the hypothesized mechanisms of psychological systems.",

Attraverso l’analisi di teorie classiche (Veblen, Bourdieu) e contemporanee (economia comportamentale, psicologia del sé, teoria dei segnali) e integrando riflessioni sull’impatto dei media digitali e della musica di tendenza (reggaeton, rap, trap) l’articolo mette in luce come la ricerca di visibilità e riconoscimento sociale possa spingere verso condotte rischiose quali l’indebitamento, l’adesione a modelli di “successo facile” (es. trading online) e la mercificazione del corpo attraverso piattaforme sessuali. Le riflessioni conclusive propongono una lettura critica del fenomeno e la necessità di un’educazione alla sostanza, alla resilienza identitaria e alla consapevolezza economica.",

          "authors": "Kenneth McClure; Brooke A Ammerman; Cheng Liu; Miguel Blacutt; Connor O'Brien; Ross Jacobucci",
          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal designs support temporally granular study of social, behavioral, and psychological processes making methods like ecological momentary assessment (EMA) increasingly common. However, the repetitive and intensive measurement strategies associated with these designs increase participant burden which limits the breadth and precision of EMA surveys. This is particularly problematic for complex clinical phenomena, such as suicide risk, which research has shown is multidimensional and fluctuates over narrow time intervals (e.g., hours). To overcome this limitation, we proposed the computerized adaptive test for suicide risk pathways (CAT-SRP) which is the first multidimensional computerized adaptive test (MCAT) designed for intensive longitudinal data. The CAT-SRP leverages multidimensional item response theory to support the simultaneous assessment of multiple empirically informed risk domains and facilitate personalized survey content. Study 1 calibrates the CAT-SRP item bank using a large community sample (N = 1759, 36.33% with a history of suicidal ideation [SI]). Study 2 evaluates the performance, feasibility, and acceptability of the CAT-SRP in an EMA study of participants with a past month SI history (N = 29 across 2,134 observations).  The calibration study suggested twelve risk domains and two SI domains (active and passive). Results from the EMA study suggested that the CAT-SRP 1) administered surveys with low to moderate item overlap, 2) incurred low participant burden, and 3) may improve near-term prediction of suicidal thoughts relative to traditional EMA measurement. Although additional work is needed, the CAT-SRP marks the first MCAT for EMA and represents a significant methodological advancement for ambulatory measurement.",

          "abstract": "The paper aims to present the results of adaptation of the Ukrainian version of Autonomous Career Motivation Scale (Sverko &amp; Babarović, 2024). Methods. At the preparatory stage of adaptation the double translation procedure was carried out for the Ukrainian version of the scale to correspond as closely as possible to the original one. After that, the equivalence between the original scale and its translated version was assessed. The study sample (N=336) included: 1) high school students (14-17 y. o.) – 68.15%; 2) first year university students (17-20 y. o.) – 31.85%. The gender distribution of respondents was following: 1) female – 65.18%; 2) male – 30.36%; 3) unidentified – 4.46%. Results. The results of the study confirm theoretical structure of the Scale, which is consistent with previous conceptual ideas about the measurement construct. Exploratory factor analysis allowed us to identify a clear factor structure that supports the hypotheses about the multidimensionality of the concept and indicates the sociocultural stability of the model. Conformational factor analysis showed high indicators of model compliance, which proves the adequacy of the chosen structure, however, some accuracy indicators demonstrate potential for further improvement of the model. The reliability of the scales is at an acceptable and high level, which confirms their consistency, homogeneity and ability to stably reflect the measured construct. Convergent and discriminant validity of the Scale are also confirmed, which demonstrates the ability of the Scales to correlate with the corresponding items and at the same time distinguish between different constructs. The high discriminantity of the scales indicates the effectiveness of the tool in distinguishing different aspects of career motivation, which is important for further use of the questionnaire in empirical research and for achieving practical goals by psychologists, career counsellors, etc. Conclusions. The Ukrainian version of Autonomous Career Motivation Scale shows a number of high psychometric indicators, which allow to positively assess the factor structure (model), reliability, construct, convergent and discriminant validity and discriminantity of its subscales. Obtained results indicate the effectiveness of using this Scale to measure autonomous career motivation, while indicating directions for further optimization of the model.",

There was substantial variation in symptom networks between ethnic groups. White British individuals showed the most differences compared to other ethnic groups, particularly in anxiety-related symptoms and functional impairment. Fewer differences were observed in symptom co-occurrence across ethnicities (the relationship between symptoms) compared to individual symptom variations (the effect of ethnicity on individual symptoms).

          "abstract": "Reliability Generalization (RG) studies frequently interpret meta-analytic heterogeneity in score reliability as evidence of differences in an instrument’s measurement quality across administrations. However, such interpretations ignore the fact that, under Classical Test Theory (CTT), score reliability depends on two parameters: true score variance and error score variance. True score variance refers to the actual variation in the trait we aim to measure, while error score variance refers to non-systematic variation arising in the observed, manifest variable. If the error score variance remains constant, variations in true score variance can result in heterogeneity in reliability coefficients. While this argument is not new, we argue that current approaches to addressing this issue in the RG-literature are insufficient. Instead, we propose enriching an RG study with Boot-Err: Explicitly modelling the error score variance using bootstrapping and meta-analytic techniques. Through a comprehensive simulation scheme, we demonstrate that score reliability can vary while the measuring quality remains unaffected. The simulation also illustrates how explicitly modelling error score variances may improve inferences concerning random measurement error and under which conditions such enhancements occur. Furthermore, using openly available direct replication data, we show how explicitly modelling error score variance allows for an assessment to what extent measurement quality can be described as identical across administration sites.",

          "abstract": "Managing our natural resources often involves learning about the dynamics of the resource while society simultaneously harvests from the resource. However, little is known about how society’s actions affect our ability to learn about a vulnerable resource. Here, we investigate how experience managing a shared resource impacts one’s ability to learn about the underlying dynamics of a resource. We hypothesised that participants' capacity to learn from experience would depend on the behaviour of other group members. 320 participants played a four-player resource management game with computer partners who acted sustainably, unsustainably, or conditionally cooperatively. Participants’ ability to learn the underlying resource dynamics was then assessed in a subsequent single-player resource management game, where the social dynamics were removed and the participants’ understanding of the resource could be evaluated in isolation. Compared to controls with no prior experience, performance on the single-player game improved after experience with sustainable and unsustainable partners, but not after experience with conditionally cooperative partners. However, experience with a single-player game (rather than a group game) outperformed all other experimental conditions; thus individual experience improved performance more than experience in any group dynamic tested. These findings suggest that the presence of others generally hinders learning in resource management contexts, though how much this learning is hindered depends on the behaviour of others.",

          "abstract": "Secondary students with Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD) often face challenges with academic tasks, particularly with high-stakes examinations. Exam access arrangements (AA) are provided as reasonable adjustments to reduce disadvantage for students with SpLD. However, the application process for AA has become increasingly burdensome, requiring extensive documentation and formal assessment. The number of applications for AA continues to rise, adding pressure to schools and examination bodies, underscoring the need for a comprehensive analysis of the current landscape around AA provision. The present study captured current practices and provisions around identifying the need for AA for students with SpLD, the nature of support offered, and barriers to effective provision. Semi-structured interviews with 35 practitioners (21 Special Educational Needs Coordinators (SENCOs); 14 Specialist Assessors) working in secondary schools in England identified three themes: ‘the importance of equity in identification’, ‘resources impact identification and support’, and ‘lack of consistency and a systematic approach’. Findings highlighted the complexities of identifying and assessing students for AAs, the need for better communication with stakeholders, and the need to provide clearer guidance covering identification, implementation, and training for students on AA use. Findings also uncovered continued inequities, with eligibility for AA as well as access to best practice in arranging accommodations partially influenced by socio-economic status. Structured guidance in effective identification, assessment, and implementation processes with student training programmes, with specifically dedicated resources, could help address disparities and ensure more equitable support.",

Our aim was to systematically review progress in this emerging field. Based on articles selected using systematic and reproducible criteria, we identified five current themes in the computational study of AN: 1) reinforcement learning; 2) value-based decision-making; 3) goal-directed and habitual control over behaviour; 4) cognitive flexibility; and 5) theory-based accounts. In addition to describing and appraising the insights from each of these areas, we highlight methodological considerations for the field and outline promising future directions to establish the clinical relevance of (neuro)computational changes in AN.",

          "abstract": "Background: Approximately 5% of children are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder of their sensorimotor skills. DSM-V and ICD-10, the two most widely used diagnostic systems, define this diagnostically as ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ (DCD) or ‘Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function’ (SDDMF), respectively. A diagnosis of DCD/SDDMF has been found to have a detrimental impact on a range of outcomes (e.g., health and education). It is therefore crucial that these children receive timely intervention. This is reliant, however, on effective assessment and support pathways. Research has shown there is great parental dissatisfaction, but there has been limited research exploring a clinical and education perspective. This study therefore aimed to understand barriers and facilitators for clinical and education practitioners in the pathway in a diverse district in the UK (Bradford). Methods: Semi-structured interviews were completed with stakeholders across the pathway to identify barriers and facilitators to assessing, diagnosing, and supporting children with sensorimotor skill difficulties. Theoretical thematic analysis aligned to the COM-B model were used to analyse the qualitative data. Results: Interviews revealed many barriers in the DCD pathway related to capability (confusing terminology, inconsistent knowledge, inappropriate referrals), opportunity (resource constraints, DCD/SDDMF being considered low priority, and disconnected services), and motivation (overlapping job roles, a desire to consider those with difficulties not eligible for a diagnosis). Conclusion: Families face multiple barriers to obtaining a diagnosis for their child through existing clinical pathways for assessment and support. These findings are unlikely to be unique to Bradford and appear to reflect national and international health service challenges. There is an urgent need for: (i) clear communication across different services (with consistency in terminology), and (ii) a more collaborative and integrated approach to assessment, diagnosis, and support in order to help these children thrive.",

          "abstract": "Background: Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), also termed dissociative convulsions, are paroxysmal events resembling epileptic seizures but without ictal EEG correlates, reflecting complex biopsychosocial etiology. Despite high prevalence and significant functional impairment, limited research has comprehensively examined biological, psychological, and social determinants of PNES in Indian clinical populations.\n\nAim: To examine biopsychosocial factors in patients with dissociative convulsions and evaluate interrelationships among these domains.\n\nMethods: Seventy‑two patients (mean age 26.15±8.87 years; 91.7% female) diagnosed with dissociative convulsions per ICD‑10 criteria at a tertiary psychiatric center in North India were recruited. Participants completed validated self‑report instruments assessing dissociative experiences (DES‑II), cognitive distortions (CD‑Quest), alexithymia (TAS‑20), trauma symptoms (ITQ‑18), emotion dysregulation (DERS‑18), and sleep disturbances (ISDI). Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained via semi‑structured interview. Spearman correlations explored associations among biopsychosocial variables. Principal component analysis and k‑means clustering identified distinct patient subgroups, with discriminant analysis validating cluster membership.\n\nResults: Psychological measures were strongly intercorrelated (rs 0.58–0.94; p&lt;0.01). Sleep disturbances correlated positively with dissociation and emotion dysregulation (rs 0.71–0.88; p&lt;0.01). Lower education, joint family status, and lower socioeconomic status were significantly associated with greater sleep pathology and higher dissociation (p&lt;0.01). Cluster analysis yielded two distinct groups: a high‑trauma cluster (n=23, 32.8%) characterized by greater trauma history, elevated DES‑II, ITQ‑18, DERS‑18, TAS‑20, CD‑Quest scores, and more severe sleep disturbances; and a low‑trauma cluster (n=49, 67.2%) with comparatively lower scores across biopsychosocial domains. Discriminant analysis achieved 99% classification accuracy (Wilks’ λ=1.00).\n\nConclusions: Dissociative convulsions in this sample are associated with pervasive emotion dysregulation, alexithymia, cognitive distortions, trauma exposure, and sleep disturbances, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. Identification of high‑ and low‑trauma phenotypes underscores the importance of tailored, multidisciplinary interventions targeting trauma processing, emotional regulation, and sleep hygiene to optimize outcomes in PNES.\n© 2025 Akhand Pratap Singh.

However, many questions remain unanswered, including how the information is stored and recalled; where the information is stored; how multiple engrams interact. In this article, I propose the model of long-term memory of human brain, as a hypothesis of architecture of memory in human brain. This model can answer the following questions: 1) What is architecture of long-term memory of human brain? 2) Where is the information of memory stored? 3) How is the new information integrated into the network of memory without influencing the old memory? It also can explain some questions about contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, such as why engram cells can retain memory under retrograde amnesia. This model demonstrates the whole framework of neuronal network for long-term memory, and also can be used for computer modeling of neuronal network of long-term memory.

Apathy and fatigue were related to almost all academic measures, yet apathy was more closely linked to academic functioning; in particular autonomous motivation, study engagement, and study satisfaction.

Building upon previous iterations, QCFT 4.0 introduces a topological approach that addresses key challenges in consciousness science: the binding problem, phenomenal unity, and the relationship between consciousness and physical processes. By incorporating empirical findings from quantum interference experiments and neurophysiological data, we demonstrate how consciousness may emerge through field interactions constrained by a specific topological structure. The model's predictions include half-integer harmonic signatures, coherence tunneling effects, and π-phase offset phenomena that match observed experimental data. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous yet ontologically nuanced framework that bridges quantum field theory, neuroscience, and phenomenology while suggesting new experimental directions for consciousness research.",

          "abstract": "Disgust helps humans avoid potentially pathogenic substances such as bodily effluvia. This reduces illness risks, and is difficult to overcome with cognitive strategies or even through simple habituation in the short term (minutes to hours). Whether habituation emerges in the long-term (months to years) is an unsolved question. Regular professional exposure to disgust elicitors is associated with lower disgust sensitivity and avoidance, but this could be due to selection and survivorship bias. Here, we avoid these limitations by testing a sample of parents (N=99) and controls (N=50) on self-report and behavioural avoidance measures. We used parent-specific items in disgust-sensitivity questionnaires, and child-related stimuli (soiled diapers) in a preferential-looking task. While the control group showed the expected behavioural avoidance, parents of children who were past the weaning stage showed almost no avoidance of stimuli depicting child-related or general bodily effluvia. Curiously, parents whose children had not been fully weaned showed similar disgust avoidance to the control group, even if they had older children who were weaned. These results suggest that parents habituate to disgust induced by faeces in diapers, and that this had generalised to other bodily effluvia. Contrary to our expectations, parents did show disgust avoidance while their (youngest) children were fed only milk, which could point to an adaptive response to reduce the risk of illness in young infants. In sum, continuous exposure to their children’s bodily effluvia inoculates parents to disgust for bodily effluvia, but only after the sensitive milk-feeding stage.",

          "abstract": "obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in elderly populations represents a critical yet understudied frontier in mental health, characterized by diagnostic ambiguities, treatment resistance, and dynamic symptom evolution. This review synthesizes current evidence on the epidemiology, neurobiology, and clinical management of late-life OCD, while proposing a novel polymorphic systems framework to reconceptualize its evolving nature. Drawing parallels to adaptive computational algorithms, we posit that OCD symptoms \"mutate\" contextually (e.g., contamination fears → symmetry obsessions) while retaining core anxiety-neutralizing functions, necessitating precision medicine approaches that map real-time symptom trajectories. Key findings include: (1) Genetic (SLC1A1 polymorphisms) and epigenetic (NR3C1 hypermethylation) factors driving late-onset OCD; (2) Neuroimaging biomarkers (orbitofrontal cortex hyperactivity, white matter hyperintensities) predictive of SSRI resistance; (3) Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) correlating with symptom severity; and (4) Pandemic-induced exacerbations (68% increased compulsive handwashing). We critique traditional diagnostic frameworks and advance Bayesian hierarchical models to address cohort heterogeneity, integrating socio-cultural, genetic, and neuroimaging data for personalized interventions. Emerging tools such as virtual reality exposure therapy, AI-driven compulsion tracking, and caregiver-mediated CBT demonstrate promises but require age-specific adaptations. The review underscores the urgency of transcending static diagnostic paradigms in favor of dynamic, computationally inspired models that mirror OCD’s fluid architecture. By aligning geriatric psychiatry with precision medicine innovations, this work charts a roadmap for scalable, cost-effective interventions tailored to the unique needs of aging populations.",

          "abstract": "Love is a quintessential aspect of the human experience. Investigating the literature on love in psychological science is messy and convoluted. A comprehensive overview of the field and its future trajectories is needed to gain insight into how psychological research on love has progressed over time and what needs to be addressed. Previous reviews on love tend to have limited scope or contain subjective inferences about the state of research on the construct of love, resulting in fragmented insights and a lack of a comprehensive scientific view of love. To address this limitation, we used bibliometric methods to map the intellectual structure of the entire field of well-being science and provide a more comprehensive view of the research. We used a database of over 9,000 primary documents downloaded from Web of Science and leveraged two bibliometric methods: historiography and bibliographic coupling. The findings shed light on (1) the evolution of love science over time and (2) the current story and emerging topics in the field.",

          "abstract": "Background: Eating disorders are serious psychiatric disorders associated with high levels of co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, high rates of relapse and poor treatment outcomes. The collection of standardised, routinely collected data within clinical services holds promise to improve patient care. Proposals for standardised variables for collection in eating disorders services have been made, but not implemented, and have included limited biological measures. Given emerging evidence about the importance of metabolism and other biological factors in eating disorders, there is a need for such measures to be integrated into routine data collection. \nObjective: To agree on a set of biopsychosocial variables for routine data collection within eating disorder services in the United Kingdom.\nMethods: Two online workshops were conducted using an adapted nominal group technique to agree priorities for data collection in adult (n= 20) and child/adolescent (n=23) eating disorder services (n = 43 participants, comprised of people with lived experience, carers, clinicians and researchers). Two researchers independently conducted a reflexive thematic analysis of the workshop transcripts to identify qualitative priorities for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the results of online voting. Measures and variables were chosen based on the priority-setting workshops, informed by prior work on psychometric properties of relevant measures. \nFindings: Thematic analysis identified four superordinate themes for data collection in eating disorder services: (1) a mutually valued and beneficial collaboration; (2) a holistic approach; (3) a balance between standardisation and individualisation; (4) doing no harm. Quantitative analysis of voting identified priorities across a range of domains\nConclusions: This project agreed a set of biopsychosocial variables which have been implemented for routine data collection as part of the Eating Disorders Clinical Research Network. Further research should investigate the implementation of these variables for data collection in eating disorder services and identify priorities for data collection in under-represented groups such as people with experience of binge eating disorder.\nClinical implications: Patients, caregivers, and clinicians support routine data collection in eating disorders services so long as the measures used are considered meaningful, not overly burdensome, non-stigmatising and collected as a collaboration between patients and treatment providers.",

          "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is a distributed set of brain regions that is active during task-free, or “resting state,” periods. Various cognitive processes operate autonomously in the absence of external inputs or demands. Spontaneous thoughts—mental experiences that accompany ongoing cognition—are ubiquitous during wakeful rest. Spontaneous memory reactivations—neural events that replay recently learned information—also occur at rest and have a fundamental role in long-term memory consolidation. Here we review recent research on how the DMN may act as a neural workspace to jointly support spontaneous thought and memory consolidation. We identify gaps in the current understanding of the DMN’s function and propose avenues to study how spontaneous thought and memory systems may operate synergistically. Through our review of closely related yet traditionally siloed literatures, we aim to bridge the gap between research on spontaneous thought and memory consolidation to advance understanding of the DMN’s function.",

Since the simpler model can be viewed as a subset of the more complex model it is nested in, Popper has argued that the axioms of probability are violated when the simpler model is nonetheless assigned a higher prior probability. While Popper raised this objection in the context of assigning prior probabilities to models, we argue that Popper's objection does not just concern the priors, but Bayesian model comparisons more generally. We term this `the subset problem'. A variety of solutions have been proposed in the literature. We discuss some of these solutions and combine them into a new Bayesian account, in which both the probability assignments and the algebra over which they are assigned receive a specific interpretation. Finally, we discuss a new non-Bayesian solution, in which nested models are assigned an attractiveness measure that need not be additive.",

          "abstract": "Uncontrollable negative events yield increased stress responses compared to situations over which we have control. Previous studies have assessed the impact of uncontrollability of threat on stress reactivity. Less is known about whether and how acute stress exposure influences how we react to uncontrollable threats. Until now, research has primarily focused on investigating the lack of control despite the idea that losing control may cause greater distress and be more clinically relevant. The current study aims to investigate whether acute stress exposure impacts reactivity to a subsequent loss of control over threat. One hundred twenty-eight participants will be equally and randomly allocated to a stress or a no-stress group. Participants will undergo an acute stress induction or a non-stressful procedure, followed by a behavioral loss-of-control task. The loss-of-control task is designed to effectively induce control followed by a subsequent loss of control over aversive electrical stimulation. We hypothesize that participants exposed to acute stress will show stronger biological and psychological responses to the loss of control over threat than those in the no-stress group, as expressed in salivary cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase assays, blood pressure measurements, and self-report ratings. Additionally, we will assess biological sex, general perceived stress, and childhood adversity as factors that might moderate the relation between acute stress exposure and reactivity to loss of control. Investigating the sensitizing effect of acute stress on the reaction to a loss of control could offer valuable insights into their role in the development and maintenance of anxiety and stress-related disorders.",

          "authors": "Lucy H Eddy; Cara E Staniforth; Megan L Wood; Liam Hill; Mark Mon-Williams",
          "abstract": "Background: Approximately 5% of children are affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder of their sensorimotor skills. DSM-V and ICD-10, the two most widely used classifications systems, define this diagnostically as either ‘Developmental Coordination Disorder’ (DCD) or ‘Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function’ (SDDMF, respectively). Being diagnosed with DCD/SDDMF has been found to have a detrimental impact on long-term health and education outcomes. Research repeatedly highlights parental dissatisfaction with the pathways for assessment and support of DCD/SDDMF, however, there has been a lack of research quantitatively exploring the diagnostic landscape. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the incidence of DCD/SDDMF in a diverse District (Bradford, UK) from 1950 -December 2024. Methods: Clinical codes related to sensorimotor skill assessments and diagnoses were searched for within the Connected Bradford dataset, which houses routinely collected primary and secondary healthcare data for over 800,000 residents. Results: There are 182,978 children currently in the Connected Bradford primary care records, suggesting there should be ~9149 children with a diagnosis (given estimated prevalence rates of 5%). But over 74 years of records available, there were only 152 recorded childhood diagnoses of SDDMF (the ICD-10 used in the UK and Europe for diagnosis). When exploring related diagnoses and findings there were 1037 cases (~14 per year), however this amount over 74 years is still nine times lower than would be expected within current childhood populations in Bradford. Moreover, there were low levels of recorded assessments and a lack of clarity regarding how children are being assessed. Conclusion: Diagnosis is the current pathway to accessing support across UK services, yet the current study highlights that children with DCD/SDDMF are not being diagnosed within Bradford. This likely reflects national and international challenges. Further research is needed to investigate the barriers and facilitators to assessing, diagnosing, and supporting children with DCD/SDDMF.",

A testlet can be used to measure clinical reasoning skills because each scenario is evaluated with two or more items. Unfortunately, testlets are challenging and time consuming to create. The purpose of our study is to address the item writing challenge by describing and illustrating testlet-based automatic item generation. We use this method to create testlets for evaluating clinical reasoning skills across four different scenarios in thoracic surgery. We created a testlet-based item model. The item model contains global and local variables. Global variables can be used to place content in any item across the testlet and hence are unique to testlet-based automatic item generation. Local variables are specific to each item model and can only be used for one specific item in the testlet. We generated 47 unique 3-item testlets. A sample of three, 3-item testlets, one from each clinical scenario, was independently evaluated by four surgical content experts and judged to be of high quality. Directions for future research are also discussed.",

This program requires that criminal evidence be quantified for statistical analysis, but no appropriate indicator variables exist. We discuss the criteria for suitable taxometric indicators and outline characteristics that indexes of criminal evidence should meet. We derive quantitative indexes of four types of criminal evidence: eyewitness identifications, interrogations and confessions, forensic match evidence, and propensity evidence. We sketch how the proposed indexes could be validated within the taxometric program. Further, we illustrate how researchers can empirically probe critical assumptions underlying these indexes, quantify the sizes of departures from these idealizations, and leverage these estimates to modify and improve index calculations. The proposed indexes address an outstanding impediment to the realization of the taxometric program to study guilty-suspect base rates in the criminal justice system.",

          "abstract": "When deciding between action alternatives, we use information about the costs and rewards of each action to choose an appropriate plan. Curioni et al. (2022) recently found that participants had a strong preference for completing a virtual box-clearing task cooperatively with a partner rather than alone, despite it being more motorically and cognitively costly. Participants completed the task standing beside each other in close proximity, which may have created a social pressure to cooperate through a need to manage one’s reputation or a sense of commitment. Here, 50 human pairs—each composed of a “Decision-maker” and “Helper”—completed a box-clearing task modeled after Curioni et al. while seated farther away and out of view of one another. In 50% of trials, Decision-makers were forced to complete the task alone or with the Helper. In the remaining 50% of trials, Decision-makers chose to work alone or cooperatively. When working together, participants were required to synchronize their movements without communication or feedback of their partner’s movements. Decision-makers answered open-ended questions regarding why and when they chose to complete the task alone and together. We found a slight preference for individual action over costly joint action, yet this preference was not significantly different from chance. Inductive thematic analysis revealed two dominant themes: “chose actions with greater instrumental utility” and “chose actions with greater social value”. The identified themes suggest that preferences to cooperate are highly individualized, and that cooperative actions may provide additional social rewards that drive preferences for cooperation even when it is more costly.",

Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment.

During a bike ergometer task, participants’ state VoPE, RPE, feeling, and heart rate at light, moderate, and vigorous cycling intensities were measured. The intensities were individually tailored using a VO2 max measurement. Additionally, trait VoPE was assessed. Higher trait and state VoPE were positively related to feeling better during cycling, independent of intensity, whereas no relation to RPE was found.

Cognitive and computational theories have proposed that decision-makers process information about choice options in order to reduce their uncertainty about their value estimates before choosing an option. One theory specifically proposes that value estimates are refined during deliberation, which results in more certain – and sometimes revised – value estimates after the choice relative to before. Here we examine the idea that choice options hold different levels of familiarity for decision-makers, and that familiarity can influence the degree to which certainty gain or value revision occurs. Our results show that both certainty gain and value revision are decreasing functions of initial certainty – which we classify as a demand effect – and increasing functions of familiarity – which we classify as a supply effect. Together, these results provide support for our supply and demand approach to the processing of information during decision-making.",

Those paninans later became mainly frugivorous woodland-dwelling Pan whose multifemale-multimale troops have social hierarchies where prominent parts are played by promiscuous males whose female offspring have little choice after menarche but to seek sexual partners in other troops, hostility between troops notwithstanding, whilst male promiscuity is incompatible with paternal interest in their offspring, interest being provided mainly by mothers or female alloparents. \nContrary to widespread conjecture that the aforementioned social arrangement was that of primeval homininans, a \"heretical\" proposal is that by 4 Ma the nature of the mosaic landscapes (of grasslands and stands of trees) that were the habitat of australopithecine homininans, had 4 consequences that impinged on homininan evolution, differentiating it from that of woodland-dwelling paninans: \n(1) The diversity of whatever was available to eat was not the same in adjoining habitats each of which may have been constrained by whatever mostly could be scrounged, foraged, scavenged, eaten, or carried away, within perhaps a 2-hour walk; \n(2) Whatever was scroungeable, forageable, scavengeable, and edible within that distance likely was limited at any period of the year, so social units were increasingly omnivorous and necessarily small; \n(3) Smallness demanded cognitive ingenuity and transmissibiity of existential information acquired by active inference generated by self-evidencing through enacted neuroethological behavioural responses, in line with the free energy principle, thanks to the cognitive broadening of homininan zones of bounded surprisal with respect to paninans' zones, both within each homininan small-world social unit and between nearby homininan units spreading out, in space and time, as budding small-world information networks (eventually reaching Australia and America, propagated by H. sapiens during the Upper Pleistocene);\n(4) The existential continuity of small homininan social units depended on cooperation and sporadic collaboration between social units with mixed-sex philopatry (perhaps present ~4 Ma among Australopithecus anamensis), behaviour which, together with (a) the generation of information within each unit that is enhanced by the intimate proximity to toddlers and children of older females and males in small mixed-sex social units, and (b) mixed-sex dispersal of sexually-active partners establishing mixed-sex social units at neolocalities nearby, was behaviour that maintained not only heterozygosity, but also, crucial cognitive awareness of kinship links favouring transmissibility of information and cooperation and collaboration (rather than hostility) between neighbouring social units, and was behaviour that represented evolutionary cognitive and social divergence from paninans. \nThe vulnerability of small fragile social units implies that there were hundreds of false dawns between ~4 Ma (Australopithecus anamensis) and ~40,000 BCE when all other homininan palaeospecies (including Homo neanderthalensis) had become extinct, leaving prehistoric Homo sapiens alone to roam the world, blessed with \"Homo informatio's\" highly-evolved hierarchically mechanistic mind with its unequalled wide cognitive zone of bounded surprisal grounded in active inference in accord with the free energy principle foreshadowed by the nineteenth-century physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.",

The outcomes of such analyses may shape the images (i.e., theories) that we as scientists have of the phenomena that we study. However, key conceptual issues tend to be overlooked in these analyses, which is especially problematic when the items are person descriptions espressed in the natural language. A correlation between judgments on two such items may reflect the influences of (a) a common substantive cause, (b) substantive target characteristics on another, (c) semantic redundancy, (d) the perceivers’ attitudes toward the targets, (e) the perceivers’ formal response styles, or (f) any mixture of these. We present a conceptual framework integrating all of these mechanisms and use it to connect formerly unrelated strands of theorizing with one another. A lack of awareness regarding the complexity involved may compromise the validity of interpretations of psychometric analyses. We also review the effectiveness of a broad range of solutions that have been proposed for dealing with the various influences, and provide recommendations for future research.",

We manipulated meaningfulness using ambiguous Mooney faces (Exp. 1) and objects (Exp. 2) vs. scrambled versions of the same stimuli. Although items were repeated 10x more often in the high interference condition than the low interference condition, we found equivalent objective and subjective effects of meaningfulness at high levels of proactive interference, suggesting that persistent passive long-term memory traces do not play a critical role for the meaningfulness advantage in working memory tasks.",

We analyze 660 players’ logged session histories on Nintendo Switch\nclassic consoles (e.g., Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64), totalling 12k hours. We\nfind that retro gaming increases with age until around 40; that people tend to revisit consoles\npopular when they were 10 years old (personal nostalgia) but that some play games predating\ntheir birth (historical nostalgia); and that there are no stable differences in wellbeing between\nthose that do (not) play retro games.

We tested for differences in global network metrics and nodal centrality between A+ and A-, and between A+T+ and A-T- sub-cohorts.\n\nRESULTS: No effects were found in global network metrics. A significant nodal difference was found in the Category Fluency Test, with increased centrality observed among A+ participants. A similar, yet nonsignificant trend was observed between A+T+ and A-T- participants.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the importance of semantic memory alterations in A+ individuals. The wide set of neural and cognitive resources that sustain semantic memory may play a supportive role in the presence of neuropathology.",

          "abstract": "A wave of criticisms and replication failures is currently challenging claims about the scope of unconscious perception and cognition. Such failures to find unconscious processing effects at the population level may reflect the absence of individual-level effects, or alternatively, the averaging out of individual-level effects with opposing signs. Importantly, only the first suggests that consciousness may be necessary for the tested process to take place. To arbitrate between these two possibilities, we tested previously collected data where unconscious processing effects were not found (26 effects from 470 participants), using five frequentist and Bayesian tests that are robust to individual differences in effect signs. By and large, we found no reliable evidence for unconscious effects being masked by individual differences. In contrast, when we examined 136 non-significant effects from other domains, two novel non-parametric tests did reveal effects that were hidden by opposing individual results, though as we show, some of them might be driven by design-related factors. Taken together, five analysis approaches provide strong evidence for the restricted nature of unconscious processing effects not only across participants, but also across different trials within individuals. We provide analysis code and best-practice recommendations for testing for non-directional effects.",

          "abstract": "Background: Serial dependencies in perceptual tasks have been suggested to reflect implicit perceptual priors derived from short-term perceptual history. A reduced weighting of perceptual priors has been proposed as a mechanism underlying psychotic experiences such as delusions and hallucinations. Here, we sought to characterize the effects of implicit and explicit perceptual priors on auditory perceptual decision-making and their modulation by psychosis proneness.\n\nResults: Across two online experiments, 197 healthy participants completed an auditory two-alternative forced-choice task and standard questionnaires assessing psychosis proneness. In experiment 1, we assessed serial dependence by quantifying the influence of previous on current perceptual choices. Participants revealed a tendency to repeat previous choices, suggesting they formed implicit priors based on recent choice history. The weighting of these implicit priors correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In experiment 2, we additionally manipulated explicit perceptual priors by providing probabilistic cues before each trial. We found significant effects of both implicit (i.e., choice history) and explicit (i.e., probabilistic cues) prior information, but only the latter correlated negatively with psychosis proneness. In both experiments, reliance on sensory information was increased with higher psychosis proneness. Using hidden Markov models, we found no conclusive evidence for a modulation of temporal dynamics of serial dependencies by psychosis proneness. \n\nConclusions: Our findings support the notion of a shift in perceptual inference away from perceptual priors and towards sensory information as a mechanism facilitating psychosis. However, the degree to which different types of perceptual priors are modulated by psychosis proneness seems to depend on experimental context.",

However, no meta-analysis has yet quantified the relative risk of suicide and self-harm, including suicide attempts, within this population. The aim of this project was to bring together and synthesize the research on suicidality among individuals with ID.\n\nMethods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out. Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PsycInfo were searched from inception through May 24, 2024. Observational studies with a quantitative design examining ID as the exposure and reporting relative risk estimates for suicide or self-harm, including suicide attempts, were included. Risk of bias was assessed using a shortened version of the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Exposure (ROBINS-E) checklist. A random effects model was used to synthesize the results.\n\nResults: Eleven primary studies were included in the review (n= 241 438). The level of ID severity was only presented in two articles. Compared to the general population, the pooled relative risk for death by suicide was 0.54 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.89, k = 6, I² = 77%) and the relative risk for self-harm was 3.16, (95% CI 2.3 to 4.35, k = 6, I² = 89%).\n\nConclusion: The findings suggest that individuals with intellectual disabilities have an elevated risk of self-harm but a lower risk of dying by suicide compared to the general population.

Cognitive ability was ascertained in Norwegian military conscript test data (N = 272,351; mean age 17.8 years; males only), whereas mental disorders were ascertained using the Norwegian register of primary care diagnoses received between the age of 36–40. Higher cognitive abilities were associated with a monotonically decreasing risk of developing all the studied mental disorders except bipolar disorder. The association held even when comparing the cognitive abilities of brothers raised in the same family, attesting that cognitive ability and mental disorders are not associated because both arise from the same family background circumstances. Similarly, individuals with higher educational attainment had fewer mental health disorders. The association between low cognitive abilities and the risk of mental disorders was notably stronger in males with low educational attainment, compared to those with high educational attainment.

While substantial progress has been made in unravelling the neural basis of tightly constrained behaviors, a critical gap persists in our comprehension of the circuits that implement algorithms capable of generating the diverse defensive responses observed outside experimental restrictions. Recent advancements in neuroscience technology now allow for an unprecedented examination of naturalistic behaviour. To help provide a theoretical grounding for this nascent experimental programme, we summarise the main computational and statistical challenges of defensive decision making, encapsulated in the concept of critical intelligence. Next, drawing from an extensive literature in biology, machine learning, and decision theory, we explore a range of candidate solutions to these challenges. While the proposed solutions offer insights into potential adaptive strategies, they also present inherent trade-offs and limitations in their applicability across different biological contexts. Ultimately, we propose series of experiments designed to differentiate between these candidate solutions, providing a roadmap for future investigations into the fundamental defensive algorithms utilized by biological agents and their neural implementation. Thus, our work aims to provide a roadmap towards broader understanding of how complex defensive behaviors are orchestrated in the brain, with implications for both neuroscience research and the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.",

Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "abstract": "Advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of natural language processing and have enormous potential for social scientific analysis. We explore the application of LLMs to supervised text classification. As a case study, we consider stance detection and examine variation in predictive accuracy across different architectures, training regimes, and task specifications. We compare ten models ranging in size from tens of millions to hundreds of billions of parameters and four distinct training regimes: prompt-based zero-shot learning and few-shot learning, fine-tuning using more training data, and instruction-tuning that combines prompting and training data. The largest models generally offer the best predictive performance even with little or no training examples, but fine-tuning smaller models is a competitive solution due to their relatively high accuracy and low cost. For complex prediction tasks, instruction-tuned open-weights models can perform well, rivaling state-of-the-art commercial models. We provide recommendations for the use of LLMs for text classification in sociological research and discuss the limitations and challenges related to the use of these technologies.",

          "authors": "Liberty Chee",
          "abstract": "After nearly half a century, domestic workers were again tabled on the agenda of the International Labour Conference in 2008. Three short years later, Conference delegates voted to establish the International Labour Organization's Convention on Domestic Work (C189). This article builds on the insight that the campaign to push for C189 was taken up by a feminist “velvet triangle”. These networks are usually comprised of women in social movements, femocrats, and academics. The informality of these alliances is due, in part, to the gendered marginality of an issue area, allowing for improvisation and agile coalitions. The article traces the origins of this triangle to bottom-up calls to develop measurement methodologies to make women's labour “visible” in the UN Conferences on Women, and later in discussions about informality, and domestic work. It then examines the relations among femocrats in various international institutions, academics, and the global trade unions in the co-production of knowledge about women's activities that were not counted and did not count in the “economy”. The article demonstrates how the demand for the valorisation of cooking, cleaning and caring, expressed itself through calls for the production of statistics. It attends to the under-explored effects of the “power of cognitive resources” in the literature. Finally, the article shows that the explicitly political project of the women's movements yielded not only a normative labour instrument, but advances in different fields of study. This case shows that the production of scientific knowledge, while still an overwhelmingly elite endeavour, need not always cater to elite demands.",

          "authors": "Nora Fink",
          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has long been a challenge in developmental, educational, and cognitive neuroscience, demanding advances in both theoretical understanding and practical diagnostic approaches. In recent years, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive neuroimaging tool for examining children’s cortical hemodynamics during language and literacy tasks. Meanwhile, new machine learning (ML) methodologies have shown promise in extracting clinically relevant patterns from large, heterogeneous neuro-behavioral datasets. However, most applications of ML in clinical child populations have focused on well-known modalities such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or electroencephalography (EEG). Few studies leverage fNIRS data combined with extensive behavioral and demographic information, especially in children from diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere, we present a systematic supervised ML approach to classify ADHD in children aged 5–11. We rely on an openly available fNIRS dataset from University of Michigan’s Deep Blue Data repository, titled: Morphological and phonological processing in English monolingual, Chinese-English bilingual, and Spanish-English bilingual children: An fNIRS neuroimaging dataset. This dataset comprises 343 children, including English monolinguals, Chinese-English bilinguals, and Spanish-English bilinguals (1). It incorporates broad neuroimaging and behavioral measures of morphological and phonological awareness, reading proficiency, and demographic questionnaires. Our ML pipeline employs a range of algorithms—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost—tuned via cross-validation for optimal performance. We highlight a final best model, SVC, which achieved a 0.625 macro F1 score in 5-fold cross-validation and revealed near-perfect performance for the majority class on the final test set. We provide in-depth classification metrics, confusion matrices, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. We also integrate interpretive discussions of bilingualism, ADHD, morphological/phonological awareness, and neural data.\nThis paper is structured in line with guidelines for high-impact research: we begin with an Introduction summarizing ADHD, bilingual language development, and the utility of fNIRS. We then describe our Methods, including participant selection, the dataset’s language/reading tasks, and the full ML pipeline from data preprocessing to hyperparameter tuning. Our Results section documents classification performance and the derived metrics. In the Discussion, we contextualize the findings and outline implications for early screening and interventions, bridging machine learning with children’s neurocognitive profiles. Finally, we draw our Conclusions on future directions for integrated neuroimaging and ML-based classification, especially for clinical subgroups in bilingual child populations.",

We construct a multilayer population-scale social network for Sweden using public register data from 2000 to 2017, covering approximately 8.3 million individuals aged 15 and older. We analyze the structure and connectivity patterns in the network across six layers: close family, extended family, household, neighborhood, school and work.

Recent sociological research drawing on simulation research from the cognitive sciences suggests opportunities for new insights via a richer interdisciplinary engagement. To this end, we provide a thorough review of the literature on grounded simulation theory, building on the nascent work in sociology engaging with grounded simulation theory, and discuss its potential for sociological analysis. We highlight its utility as a cognitively plausible framework for addressing important issues in the analysis of culture and action and culture and thinking, including questions of salience, novelty, implicit cognition, deliberation, and the relation between Type 1 and Type 2 processing.

          "abstract": "The concept of “carbon neutrality,” or “net zero,” is emerging as the central element of the international regime on climate change. How this concept is received by states and their publics will play an important role in the political conflicts surrounding the regime. This paper maps and theorizes the patterns of carbon neutrality emergence in public debates around the world. We analyze close to 3.4 million online news articles in 2018-2021 from 138 countries, jointly accounting for 94 percent of the world’s population. The empirical evidence highlights the importance of the discursive characteristics of the national climate change debates for the reception of the novel concept, but also that the effect of states’ affluence and climate vulnerability on reception of carbon neutrality is strongly non-linear. Our results demonstrate the need to equally study the Global North and South in analyses of the climate regime operation.",

          "abstract": "‘Borderization’ refers to the process of installing fences and other infrastructures of control and surveillance by the Russian security services along the de facto boundary between Georgia and South Ossetia. Georgian political discourse generally focuses on a territorial dimension of borderization and views it primarily as a physical demarcation of an already existing geopolitical condition, understood as the Russian occupation of Georgia’s sovereign territory. Borderization has dramatically curtailed mobility between the two sides of the de facto border. Georgian political discourse describes this aspect of borderization as Russia’s purposeful strategy to estrange Ossetians from Georgians. However, the narrow ethnic frame sidelines various other forms of immobility experienced by local residents. An expanded concept of mobility can offer a more nuanced understanding of borderization and illustrate overlooked geopolitical and geographical complexities. Through interviews with residents of Nikozi, Ergneti, and Ditsi, the article identifies four distinct forms of immobility resulting from borderization that shape how people and goods move inside the villages, across the de facto boundary, between the border strip and Tbilisi, and between the strip and Russia. The mobility perspective offers a complementary lens to understand the effects of the existing geopolitical condition on the local community’s security and welfare.",

          "abstract": "Climate obstruction is a key research approach to help explain why governments do not achieve climate mitigation goals. The article investigates the still underexplored phenomenon of climate obstruction in Europe and outside the familiar realm of science denial and denialist organizations. We analyze a public debate on a key policy in Germany where an accelerated transition to renewables in the heating sector was successfully obstructed. To investigate obstruction, we performed a framing analysis on the articles of two leading newspapers with strong stances against climate policies (n=142). We find that obstruction framing did not emphasize climate references, shifting the issue from the climate towards personal and collective wealth, liberty, and security. It highlighted costs and damages, excessive regulation, and procedural mistakes, attributed these problems mostly to the Green proponents of the policy initiative, and interpreted the policy and their proponents as an imminent threat. We therefore argue that climate obstruction primarily worked through a scare strategy. We identify four major frames and discuss differences to extant frame typologies from denialist contexts. In addition, we identify two distinct strands of obstruction: a more radical approach stressing state coercion, and a more moderate approach highlighting incompetence and neoliberal policy alternatives. We argue that strategic differentiation allows to address and broker different audiences. With these findings, we provide vital insights into how climate obstruction works in Germany and in wider public debates when science denial is not (yet) a viable strategy.",

Among the “technology masters”, we distinguish three families: those who remain at the service of the State and the established order, those who have exploited, consciously or not, the withdrawal of the neoliberal State to offer services and innovations formerly assumed by the public sector, and finally those who have consciously taken advantage of this same withdrawal and the recognition they enjoy in society to propose other models (free software, open source, crypto anarchism, technical alternatives, etc.).",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Exposure to alcohol advertising is a key influence on adolescent alcohol consumption. Zero-alcohol drinks (&lt;0.5% alcohol by volume) resemble and often share brands with alcoholic drinks, so may function as surrogate alcohol marketing. We examined whether exposure to zero-alcohol advertising was associated with adolescents’ attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol.\nMethods: N=382 Australians aged 15 to 17 years completed an online survey where they viewed zero-alcohol advertisements from four parent alcohol brands and reported past exposure and liking of each advertisement, attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol products from the parent brand, general attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol, self-reported location-based exposure to zero-alcohol advertising, prior consumption of alcohol and zero-alcohol, and demographics. Associations between exposure and liking, attitudes, and consumption intentions were examined using linear mixed effect models and linear regression. \nResults: In unadjusted models, attitudes toward and intentions to consume alcohol from the parent brand were associated with advertisment exposure (attitudes: B=0.55, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.37, p&lt;0.001) and liking (attitudes: B=1.45, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.70, p&lt;0.001). Adjusting for prior zero-alcohol and alcohol consumption, gender, and parent presence during survey completion, associations with liking remained significant (attitudes: B=1.42, p&lt;0.001; intentions: B=0.66, p&lt;0.001). No associations were found between self-reported location-based exposure to zero-alcohol advertising and general attitudes and consumption intentions toward alcohol.\nDiscussion and Conclusions: Findings that adolescents who see and like zero-alcohol advertisements have more favourable attitudes toward and stronger intentions to consume parent alcohol brands suggest these advertisements serve as surrogate marketing and should be included within alcohol advertising regulations.",

          "abstract": "How are mothers and fathers with differing lengths of parental leave perceived as workers and parents, and how do these perceptions vary by gender and cultural context? We answer these questions using original preregistered survey experiments conducted in Germany, South Korea, and the United States—three countries with differing gender norms related to work and parenting. Specifically, we examine perceptions of employees who took either “short,” “medium-length” or “long” parental leaves, based on each country’s parental leave laws. Across all three countries, mothers and fathers who took longer leaves are seen as better parents than those who took shorter or no leave. However, for fathers in Germany and South Korea, this positive effect plateaus or declines after medium-length leave. The impact of leave-taking on perceptions of employees as workers is smaller and more complex: Longer leaves lead to declines in perceived work commitment for both genders. For fathers, however, other outcomes remain largely unchanged by the length of leave. For mothers in Germany and South Korea, by contrast, we find medium and long parental leaves lead to more favorable perceptions in terms of work relationships and overall assessment as workers. These findings suggest competing norms around work and parenting influence how individuals are evaluated based on their leave-taking behaviors, creating stronger incentives for mothers than fathers to take longer leaves in countries with stronger gender conservatism.",

However, these claims have not been rigorously tested through large-scale, data-driven, comparative analyses and statistical modelling. This paper fills this gap by applying Gruber and Szołtysek’s (2016) Patriarchy Index to IPUMS-International census microdata from 857 regional populations in historical Europe and 21 Asian/North African countries after 1970 (93 million people). Our descriptive, spatial and multilevel regression approaches challenge the ‘patriarchal East’ vs. ‘liberated West’ dualism. We find that some historical European areas were more patriarchal than the contemporary Asian data, and several regions in both Europe and Asia show less pronounced patriarchal tendencies than predicted by the models. Finally, we show that Asia and historical Europe are remarkably similar in the mechanisms influencing patriarchy. Overall, our work provides ample evidence that the historical patterns of patriarchy in Europe are not unique.",

Many theories assume interpersonal deliberation is a primary mechanism through which people develop positions on such issues, but it is unclear how often the issues captured by such questions become a topic of conversation. Using an original survey of 2,117 American adults, we quantify how often people report discussing the issues tapped by 88 questions in the General Social Survey’s core questionnaire, as well as how often respondents say they individually reflect on these issues, how important they believe them to be, and how sensitive they believe it would be to discuss those issues. We find the majority of respondents report discussing the majority of issues fewer than once or twice a year, with the modal response that respondents have never discussed an issue in the past year. At the same time, some topics—including religious beliefs and generic appraisals of political leaders—come up quite frequently, and a small number of respondents report frequently discussing most items. We consider the implications of these findings for theories of belief formation.",

          "abstract": "China’s 2016 Overseas NGO (ONGO) Law is part of a larger global trend of increased legal restrictions on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). A growing body of research analyzes the broad effects of this crackdown on INGOs, finding a divergence in formal de jure laws and the de facto implementation of those laws. The causes and mechanisms of this divergence remain less explored. Why do authoritarian governments allow—and often collaborate—with some INGOs while harshly regulating or expelling others? What determines the openness of the practical legal operating environment for INGOs? In this paper, we use the case of China to explore how political demands to both restrict and embrace INGOs have shaped the international nonprofit sector in the five years since the ONGO Law came into effect. We argue that in an effort to bolster regime stability, governments use civil society laws as policy tools to influence INGO behavior. We find that INGO issue areas, missions, and pre-existing relationships with local government officials influence the degree of operating space available for INGOs. We test this argument with a mixed methods research design, combining Bayesian analysis of administrative data from all formally registered INGOs with a comparative case study of two environmental INGOs. Our findings offer insights into the practical effects of INGO restrictions and the dynamics of closing civic space worldwide.",

This paper examines the conflict between Neo-Liberal and humanist approaches, and how these lead to conflicting approaches to coercive practices in outdoor programs. The source of the current situation will be shown to be the colonising of humane experiential outdoor practice by some early adventure leadership literature and its enduring beliefs. These beliefs centre on the individual being responsible for their situation and overlook the causes of their behaviour. A more supportive counter-belief is that individuals are doing their best and require a socially supportive environment to regain their developmental trajectory toward functional adulthood. Experiential outdoor practitioners are encouraged to adopt human rights-based approaches and view the temporary group as a lived experience of an ideal society.",

          "abstract": "In present times, gender-based violence (GBV) is a global scourge. It is highly prevalent in South Africa, where the rates of incidents are exorbitant, particularly those of sexual violence against women. The goal of this paper is to explore the implications of factors such as societal norms affected by the country’s unique historical circumstances that promote rising rates of gender-based violence, significant underreporting of these instances, sexual violence and the consequences for the survivors. The paper uses secondary data to study the intersectionality of gender, population group (race), socio-economic status, and geographical location. We further analyze the sociodemographic of GBV (particularly rape) victims and perpetrators to put the focus on better and more gender-responsive prevention strategies. The paper highlights the importance of paying attention to intimate partner violence (IPV) as this constitutes a highly significant percentage of the total cases of rape and femicide. The study shows that non-white women constitute the most vulnerable group to GBV. We conclude that proper mechanisms must be put in place which require the cooperation of the police, judicial, medical, social and other support services to properly tackle this violence which must account for every population group, especially the historically marginalized ones.",

However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks---via edge simplification and node consolidation---resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.",

          "abstract": "Why do citizens endorse the use of excessive force by police? This article investigates the factors that shape public attitudes towards police brutality in Brazil. Employing regression analysis on survey data from 1,806 São Paulo inhabitants, the study assesses whether socio-structural, instrumental, and ideological factors and perceived legitimacy influence these attitudes. Our findings reveal that support for police use of excessive force is associated with demographic, ideological, and attitudinal elements, emphasising the impact of race, gender, authoritarian tendencies, and the view of the police as legitimate and efficient. The study underscores the imperative for a critical examination of the cultural and structural foundations of police violence endorsement.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the relationship between individuals’ satisfaction with their social life and global life satisfaction during periods of economic prosperity and crisis, using data from the Panel of Social Inequalities in Catalonia, Spain (PaD 2001-2012). The study also investigates how this relationship varies across different social origins. Catalonia is a pertinent context due to its significant increase in inequality and unemployment during the 2008 Economic Crisis, positioning it among the most affected regions in Europe. The findings reveal that satisfaction with one’s social life matters for global life satisfaction, even after accounting for individual and macro characteristics. However, contrary to the initial expectations, the study demonstrates that satisfaction with one’s social life becomes less influential for global life satisfaction during the macroeconomic crisis, particularly among individuals from middle and low social origins. Furthermore, while a strong positive relationship exists between satisfaction with one’s social life and global life satisfaction during times of economic prosperity for all social groups, a robust negative relationship emerges in periods of macroeconomic crisis for individuals from high social origins. The article offers several potential explanations for these findings.",

          "abstract": "How did gender inequality in housework change during the COVID-19 pandemic? A growing international work answered this question by comparing parents in 2020 to 2019, showing mixed evidence. We provide new evidence from couples living with and without children and across a longer time frame. Using high-quality, nationally representative time dairy data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we describe average time in total, routine, and non-routine housework among dual-earner couples from 2019 to 2022. We found an overall increase in housework time in 2020. Two new findings emerged. First, from 2019 to 2020, there was an exacerbation in gender housework gap among couples living without children, such that women increased approximately half-an-hour more housework than men daily. The gender housework gap among parents however remained similar. Second, such trends were relatively short-term and reversed in 2021 and 2022. We provide short explanations and call for more studies to use national time diary data to intentionally incorporate family diversity into studying the gendered consequences of disruptive events in the longer term.",

          "abstract": "This study examined lay conceptions of dopamine functions in a Brazilian sample using a quali-quantitative approach. Participants often simplified neurobiological processes, associating dopamine primarily with well-being, motivation, and mood improvement (positive effects), and reward system dysregulation, addiction risk, and health issues like stress and apathy (negative effects). Physical activity and healthy eating were seen as key factors in dopamine increase. Lay conceptions, while differing from expert discourse, may shape a “neurochemical self,” reflecting a neoliberal ideology of self-regulation and productivity. Participants viewed dopamine knowledge as a means to control daily habits for a balanced life. While positive effects were prominent, negative effects were also frequently mentioned, emphasizing productivity and risk management within a capitalist context. Dopamine was both an asset to maximize and a risk to mitigate. This aligns with the view of pleasure as limited and controlled within neoliberal values. The study highlights how media simplification may lead to exaggerated perceptions of dopamine’s role in well-being.",

          "abstract": "Background: The latest military assault on Gaza by Israel, which began after 7 October 2023, has led to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, with tens of thousands killed, nearly two million displaced, and famine officially declared in 2024. The near-total siege cut off food, water, electricity, and medical supplies, while relentless bombardments destroyed critical infrastructure, rendering Gaza unliveable. Many donor nations have simultaneously provided humanitarian aid to Gaza while supplying military assistance to Israel, underscoring the structural hypocrisy in international responses to the catastrophe in Gaza. Methods: In this article, we introduce and develop the concept of justice-oriented counter-stories (JOCS) to critically examine how quantitative datasets on humanitarian aid flows can distort reality and obscure key disparities. Using aid to Gaza in 2023–2024 as a case study, we apply JOCS to identify biases in official reporting and make statistical adjustments to offer an alternative perspective. Results: Our justice-oriented analytical lens shows how the countries humanitarian aid rankings shift significantly when we factor in donor nations’ GDP, and the structural hypocrisy of offering humanitarian aid while simultaneously providing significant military assistance to Israel. Our paper also identifies some of the key methodological challenges in making such adjustments. Conclusion: We conclude by emphasising the broader implications of “justice-oriented counter-stories” for understanding not only aid flows, but social justice and the representation of social and environmental issues.",

          "abstract": "While most adolescents display a steady recovery trajectory following surgery, some develop chronic postsurgical pain (CPP), which can significantly impact their functioning. Psychosocial factors are known to play a role in the recovery from pain following surgery, but positive psychosocial factors have received little attention in the literature. This study aims to address this gap by investigating parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism as predictors of post-surgical pain recovery and positive outcomes in adolescents. \nThis study uses data collected as part of a larger longitudinal project that involved administering questionnaires to adolescents and their parents over multiple timepoints. Adolescent participants aged 12 – 18 years old with a diagnosis of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, and scheduled for spinal fusion surgery, were recruited across four Belgian hospitals along with their parents. Structural Equation Modelling was used to investigate how parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism predicted post-surgical positive outcomes, including mood, quality of life and functional disability in adolescents. \nThe study comprised 94 adolescent-parent dyads. Findings indicate that parental optimism before surgery predicted increased adolescent mood following surgery. Adolescent positive affect before surgery predicted increased mood and decreased pain intensity following surgery, while adolescent optimism predicted increased quality of life. None of the optimism or positive affect variables were significantly related to adolescent functional disability following surgery. \nStudy findings identify parental and adolescent positive affect and optimism as potential predictors of post-surgical recovery and positive outcomes in adolescents. However, the multifaceted and complex nature of these relationships warrants further investigation.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent mental health and wellbeing are of growing concern globally with increased incidence of mental health disorders in young people. BrainWaves provides a framework for relevant and diverse research programmes into adolescent mental health and wellbeing that can translate into practice and policy. The research programme is a partnership with schools centred on establishing a large (n&gt;50,000) cohort and trials platform. Reported here is the BrainWaves cohort pilot study. This was designed as proof-of-concept for our recruitment and data capture pipelines, and for cost-modelling. A network of research schools was recruited and a computer-driven questionnaire administered. The eligible population was 16+ year olds who were attending the research schools. Of 41 research schools, 36 (88%) participated over one three-week and one four-week data collection period. From an eligible population of 33,531 young people, 16,010 (48%) attended the study lesson and created an account. Of the 16,010 (100%) who created an account, 15,444 (96%) consented to participate, 9,321 (60%) consented to linkage of research data with educational records, and 6,069 (39%) consented to linkage of research with school/college attendance data. Participants were aged 16-19 years, 59% female, and 76% White. Higher levels of anxiety and depression were found in girls than boys. Higher levels of media-based social networking were found in girls, whereas higher levels of media-based gaming were found in boys. Girls were more likely to report insufficient sleep whilst boys were more likely to report high levels of exercise. This study confirmed an ability to recruit at pace and scale. Whilst the response-rate does not indicate a representative sample, the demographics describe an inclusive and diverse sample. Data collected confirmed findings from previous studies indicating that the electronic data collection methods did not materially bias the findings. Initial cost-modelling suggests these data were collected for around £20 per participant.",

          "abstract": "An innovative course introduced digital twinning concepts to liberal arts students, aimed at enhancing technological literacy, critical thinking, and ethical awareness in an increasingly digital world. The course designed using Quality Matters rubrics and delivered through a competency-based education (CBE) model in an online, asynchronous format to 24 students in Fall 2024 with 96% student course complete rate. The curriculum offered a comprehensive introduction to key digital twinning concepts, applications, and their societal impacts. The flexible, self-paced structure accommodated diverse student populations with varying responsibilities. Pre-course survey revealed limited familiarity with digital twinning among participants. However, post-course survey responses demonstrated significant improvements, with students developing a nuanced understanding of the technology's complexities, including data privacy, ethical considerations, and accessibility challenges. The course successfully aligned with students' expectations for practical knowledge applicable to their careers, and the emphasis on the transformative potential of digital twinning across various fields, including healthcare, space, urban planning, defense, agriculture, and sustainability was the notable strength of the course.  Post-course surveys revealed strong positive outcomes, with 63% of students extremely likely to recommend the course, 55% expressing high enthusiasm for digital twinning's potential, and 90% reporting confidence in understanding its industrial impacts. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating digital twinning education into broader curricula, emphasizing its relevance to liberal arts and interdisciplinary studies in preparing students for the technological demands of various industries.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the legitimation strategies employed by organizations engaging in criminal activities to influence public opinion about the legitimacy of these criminal activities. These discursive strategies are used to justify criminal actions, such as corruption, fraud, or violence, within broader organizational and cultural contexts. Often involving moral neutralization and moral licensing techniques, these strategies allow organizations engaged in criminal activities to present themselves and their actions as virtuous or justified. Although these strategies can result in societal harm by undermining public support for law enforcement, little is known about what types of legitimation strategies exist, how they differ, and how they influence public opinion. Hence, this scoping review identifies and categorizes the legitimation strategies used by organizations engaged in criminal activities. By conducting a scoping review of 21 empirical studies, a four-dimensional typology of 10 legitimation strategies is developed, clustered by their association with distinct types of legitimacy. The findings propose five mechanisms whereby legitimation strategies impact public opinion. Understanding these strategies and mechanisms is crucial for developing effective counter-strategies to delegitimize criminal actions and enhance societal resilience. This study advances the fragmented discourse on legitimation processes of specifically criminal actions employed by organizations, integrating findings from various disciplines to inform theory and practice.",

Rhetoric from politicians about policies can sway public opinion, but it remains unclear how much political arguments can alter the public perception of an issue's salience. This study investigates the extent to which hypothetical party statements supporting or opposing a ban on exploration of new oil and gas fields influences opinions about this policy, and the salience of climate change. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment of 1650 participants in Australia and New Zealand show that political statements impact policy support and opinions of policy efficacy, but have little discernible effect on participants’ perceptions of climate change salience. These results suggest that the public issue salience of climate change is stable, potentially making it challenging for politicians to pursue transformational climate policies.",

          "authors": "Nicholas J. Klein; Matthew Palm; Stella Connaughton",
          "abstract": "Rising transportation costs have sparked widespread concern, with media headlines questioning whether the era of inexpensive automobility is over. Yet existing analyses often rely on sticker prices and aggregated sales data, failing to account for the full range of ownership costs such as insurance, fuel, and debt payments. This study bridges that gap by examining transportation affordability and “forced car ownership”—low-income households incurring high automobile costs due to limited alternatives. Using data from the U.S. Consumer Expenditure Survey from 1984 to 2023, we analyze trends in transportation expenditures, debt, and affordability using descriptive statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS), and binary logistic regression.\nOur findings reveal that while transportation expenditures have increased in nominal terms, real expenditures have remained relatively stable, and transportation costs as a share of household expenditures have declined since the 1980s. However, significant disparities persist. Low-income households, Black households, and households with multiple vehicles face disproportionate transportation cost burdens, with debt playing a critical role. Households in the bottom income deciles devote significantly higher shares of income to transportation, often driven by auto loans.\nRegional and demographic variations highlight structural inequities, with rural households and Southerners incurring higher absolute debt levels. These results underscore the inadequacy of existing affordability thresholds and the need for more comprehensive metrics that account for debt. By identifying the determinants of forced car ownership and its uneven distribution, this study offers policy-relevant insights into where transportation affordability initiatives should be targeted, and for whom.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces Dissipative Representations (DiRe) as a methodological notion that transcends dualistic thinking in language research, identity studies, and related fields. Drawing from the premise that reality equals information (R=I), DiRe offers an epistemological reorientation that conceptualizes representations as dynamic informational patterns rather than static entities, challenging traditional frameworks that reify conceptual dichotomies. The theoretical foundation integrates Analytic Idealism (ontological dimension), Decolonial Theory (axiological dimension), and the Informational Field Metaphor (methodological dimension), creating a coherent alternative characterized by informational flexibility, provisional utility, relational dynamics, and resistance to objectification. A three-level model of information processing—perception, representation, and meta-representation—provides practical analytical guidance, while validation criteria across ontological, epistemological, methodological, and decolonial dimensions ensure epistemic responsibility. Applications in sign language analysis through deep multimodality, linguistic identity demarcation, and digital identity studies demonstrate DiRe's capacity to resolve persistent theoretical dilemmas without sacrificing analytical rigor. The framework's transformative implications extend to knowledge decolonization, educational practices, and ethical research conduct, addressing what I term \"Technical-Epistemic Gridlock\" in contemporary methodologies. DiRe constitutes the primary analytical tool within the broader framework of Convergences of Lived Open Unfolding Diversity (CLOUD), offering pathways toward more epistemically just and ontologically coherent approaches to understanding human experience.",

Data was collected through five focus groups (31 participants in total) and analyzed using thematic analysis and a novel journey-based approach. Our results highlight key experiential trade-offs between the analog and digital methods focusing on cognitive burden, emotional investment, and practical constraints. Centrally the analog method allowed greater emotional investment, which may or may not be desired. This work showcases the merits of a journey-based analytical approach for better understanding the interview process from respondents’ point of view, and highlights that considering sociogram tools experientially invites greater focus on ethical concerns for respondent care.",

          "abstract": "Seasonal comparison research has highlighted how achievement gaps among students change during school terms versus breaks, providing significant insights into the role of schools in generating inequality. The current study extends the design by examining learning losses across multiple breaks of varying length, not just summer breaks, using digital trace data from a reading app. We tracked weekly reading speed growth in a cohort of 8,921 Danish students from 4th grade (2019) to the end of 6th grade (2022), comparing growth during school and breaks, including Covid-19 closures. By more effectively differentiating between learning progress made during periods of schooling and declines occurring during breaks, this granular approach enhances our understanding of how school attendance influences learning, yielding insights beyond those derived from traditional seasonal comparison studies.\nResults show consistent learning losses or stagnation following short breaks, indicating that traditional seasonal comparison designs may underestimate schools’ impact on learning. Notably, learning stagnation during the Covid-19 closures persisted even after schools reopened. While differential effects by socioeconomic status were limited, indicating schools’ neutral role in this regard in Denmark, results suggested that schools may narrow achievement gaps between students with immigration backgrounds compared to those from the ethnic majority population.",

Overall, baby boomers reported larger close networks than did their adult children. Swedish speakers reported slightly more close relatives than Finnish speakers did in the older (6.9 vs. 6.4) and the younger generations (4.7 vs. 4.4) but the differences were not statistically significant. However, Swedish speakers reported on average significantly larger close friendship networks than Finnish speakers in both the older (7.4 vs. 5.3) and younger (5.6 vs. 4.2) generations. The differences in close friendship networks remained significant after controlling for sex, age, self-rated health, and various other socio-demographic factors.

Scholarship on liability for AI harms highlights the difficulties that doctrines like negligence may encounter in attributing responsibility across complex AI value chains. Drawing on the theory of ‘system safety’, this paper argues that these difficulties can be diminished by conceptualising AI hazards as a set of socio-technical conditions rather than specific aberrant outputs (‘errors’) with discrete technical causes. System affordances, use context, and organisational arrangements are all key risk factors. Animated by case studies of AI harms and near misses, the paper clarifies what is ‘reasonably foreseeable’ about AI harms, and to which value chain participants. It also identifies various kinds of ‘reasonable care’ that different actors can exercise to avert harm. This socio-technical perspectivemakes it easier to apply concepts that are vital to negligence liability,and highlights key priorities for regulating ‘responsible AI’.",

          "abstract": "To minimise confounding bias and facilitate the identification of unwarranted disparities, sentencing researchers have traditionally sought to control for as many legal factors as possible. Over the past decade a growing number of researchers have questioned such approach, pointing at multiple legal factors are themselves subject to judicial discretion, so controlling for them leads to post-treatment bias. Here we use DAGs to provide a more formal and comprehensive assessment of the different types of bias that could be expected under different choice of controls. In addition, we put forward a new modelling framework to: i) facilitate the choice of controls under different definitions of sentencing disparities, and ii) reflect the model uncertainty stemming from the trade-off between confounding and post-treatment bias. We apply this framework to the estimation of race disparities in the US federal courts and gender disparities in the England and Wales magistrates' court. We find substantial model uncertainty for gender disparities and for race disparities affecting Hispanic offenders, rendering estimates of the latter inconclusive. Disparities against black offenders are more consistent, although, they are not strong enough to be seen as definitive evidence of racial discrimination.",

          "authors": "Alex Albright",
          "abstract": "Many jurisdictions in the United States have reduced the use of money bail, which requires people to pay money to leave jail pretrial. This policy reduces the amount of time arrestees spend in jail, at the risk that they will offend or fail to appear in court. This paper estimates the detention-misconduct trade-off by studying a program in Kentucky that automatically released low-level arrestees with no bail. The program reduced total hours in detention by 43%, while it increased court non-appearance by 3.3 percentage points and had a small (0.7 percentage point) and insignificant effect on pretrial rearrest. For each new court non-appearance, the arrested population was spared an additional 26 days in detention. The program’s effects operated through multiple channels: reducing the use of money bail, reducing the use of other bail types, and speeding up the release process. In the second part of the paper, I isolate the effects of eliminating money bail for low-level arrestees. For each new pretrial rearrest, I find that 10 people are spared longer jail stays by money bail elimination.",

They are often used as a tool assess potential impacts from policy and infrastructure changes prior to actual implementation by varying parameters in a controlled (simulated) setting and assessing results. In this study we review several common approaches to stochastic simulation for activity patterns across several different academic disciplines. Building off this literature, we propose another stochastic simulation algorithm, the Hierarchical Activity Simulation Procedure, that is rooted in the survival methods literature and directly models duration and activity selection. This is a highly flexible method and can accommodate joint activity structures (ie household or role-level effects) and is not particularly data intensive. This method produces very realistic time-use patterns, can accommodate a range of activities without too much additional computational complexity, and has implications for practitioners and time use researchers alike.",

          "authors": "Andrew Heiss",
          "abstract": "Research on human rights repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to protect legitimacy and curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw ire from the international community and can be counterproductive at achieving its aims. To avoid this, states employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a \"canary in the coal mine\" and signal future physical repression. This is a significant argument, suggesting that previous research may undercount repression by only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented avenues of repression. The author recalls their experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.",

          "abstract": "This report presents policy priorities for the enhancement of family resilience. It, first, provides a conceptual framework for how we should understand the functions of policy in regard to improving family resilience. Second, it reviews the current national and EU-level policy landscape. Third, it proposes a set of policy principles in three key areas that are considered essential to improve family resilience: better income support for families with children, closing the childcare gap and comprehensive family support services. The report is based on a wide-ranging comparative analysis of relevant data from Eurostat, OECD Family Database, Leave Network and MISSOC, a review of three key intiatives from the EU, the Work-Life Balance Directive, European Child Guarantee and European Care Strategy, and a review of relevant policies in the six rEUsilience countries. It is also informed by a 'road-testing' exercise which was undertaken through the Policy Lab, where family and policy experts developed and reviewed policy proposals. \n\nThe report seeks to provide guidance especially when reforming and introducing policies with respect to family resilience. The report emphasises the need for a holistic and comprehensive approach to empower families especially during the transitions over the lifecourse. Consequently, the report interprets the support from the state as a package consisting of income support, employment-related parenting leaves, childcare and family-oriented services. The policy priorities are informed by the aforementioned analyses which highlighted a range of 'incompletions' in existing policies in, first, recognising the changing needs of families as children grow older and, second, the additional support needs of particular families (especially low-income families, lone-parent families and families coping with illness or disability on the part of a child). The report offers 15 principles as a guide to undertake policy reform. These principles, which are generally similar across the three fields, relate to coverage (endorsing a universal approach), adequacy (in terms of amount and sufficiency of income and other forms of support), inclusion (recognition of additional needs) and the absence of gaps in provision.",

          "abstract": "Gender and socio-economic background are key factors influencing the timing of the transition to adulthood; however, their composite effect is difficult to identify, as gender differences are developed within the family context. Drawing on data from two waves (2009, 2016) of an Italian nationally representative survey, we use information on children of parents aged 50-75 (N= 28,244) to analyse gender differences in home-leaving age among higher- and lower-educated families. We compare estimates from Cox proportional hazards and sibling fixed-effects models. Our findings show that gender differences in higher-educated families are less marked than in lower-educated families; gender differences remain significant when we account for family characteristics shared by siblings. In Italy, parental education is associated with delays in home-leaving among daughters, not among sons. This study illustrates how sibling comparisons can help disentangle heterogeneity in life course transitions, and how families contribute to the reproduction of inequalities in demographic behaviours.",

          "abstract": "There has been a significant increase in both the number of publications and number of citations in the last decade which can be easily accessed through online databases such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, ResearchGate. The large data set of scientific literature and respective authors in these platforms can be utilized to get a broad overview of academic discourse. This project aims to investigate the state of academia in the field of Natural Hazards and Climate Extremes using Google Scholar data. A comprehensive set of relevant tags (such as earthquake, volcano, natural hazards, climate extremes etc.) were used to filter the researchers. A threshold of 500 citations was applied to focus on the most influential academics in this field. We limited the analysis to the period 1990-2023 and subsequently stratified the obtained results by gender (as perceived by the authors) and country of affiliation of the researchers. Data for the number of publications was also collected for each of the researchers.\nAmong 2614 researchers identified, 77.2% are male, 22.6% female, and 0.2% could not be categorized into male or female. Male researchers, on average, received a larger median number of citations compared to women even though the gender citation gap in percentage has been decreasing over the last decade. Notably, regression analysis showed that there is a limited difference in number of citations per publication between the two genders. The data also shows that 78.5% of citations are attributed to researchers in high-income countries, 14.4% for those in middle-income countries, and 7.1% for those in low-income countries despite researchers in low- and middle-income countries publishing more papers per year, on average, than their counter parts in high-income countries. Researchers from high-income countries also get a larger number of citations per author, on average, even when controlling for number of publications. However, the citation gap between high-income and low- and middle-income countries has narrowed in recent years. Interestingly, the observed citation gap between researchers is more pronounced due to income group than gender. In conclusion, even though disasters affect poor countries and women disproportionately, the fact that the field of natural hazards and climate extremes is largely high-income country and male-dominated raises fundamental questions on the ontology and epistemology of the scientific knowledge that has been generated.",

Anecdotal accounts suggest that military service may be tied to radicalization toward political violence. A nationally representative survey of veterans and servicemembers compared to civilians shows that veterans’ and servicemembers’ attitudes toward political violence reflect those of the larger society. However, current and former servicemembers have different patterns of attraction and engagement with extremist ideologies and groups as compared with civilians. Servicemembers and veterans are more likely to be attracted to anti-government groups and causes that have been associated with violent acts, especially those espousing ideologies related to defending against perceived violations of the Constitution and/or Constitutional rights. Their greater willingness to commit violence on behalf of favored causes makes them attractive targets for recruitment to these groups.",

          "abstract": "This chapter examines the relationship between satisfaction with social life and overall subjective well-being in Spain. Despite increasing recognition of social life as a key determinant of well-being, direct empirical research on its influence remains scarce, particularly in Southern Europe, where much of the existing evidence is anecdotal. Unlike concepts such as social capital, social support, and relational support, satisfaction with social life captures the intrinsic value of social interactions rather than their instrumental utility. It reflects an individual's subjective appraisal of their overall social relationships, encompassing not only close ties but also broader interactions with acquaintances, neighbours, and peripheral contacts. Drawing on data from the first wave of the Global Flourishing Study (2020–2022), this chapter investigates how social life satisfaction contributes to both cognitive and affective well-being. Spanish findings are contextualized within a comparative framework, including high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries. The results highlight that subjective evaluations of social life play a crucial role in shaping overall well-being, surpassing the influence of individual characteristics. Furthermore, the significance of social life satisfaction for both cognitive and affective well-being increases with socioeconomic development, positioning Spain alongside upper-middle-income countries with collectivistic and Latin cultural orientations. An analysis of heterogeneity within Spain reveals no substantial variations across gender, social background, or regions. However, significant age-related differences emerge, with the importance of social life satisfaction on overall well-being—particularly affective well-being—increasing with age. The chapter concludes by discussing theoretical and practical implications and outlining directions for future research, including methodological considerations.",

Using linked register data, labor market biographies, and the Swedish Level of Living Survey, we construct a multidimensional measure of peripheral labor market status—including temporary and part-time contracts, excessive job mobility, and unemployment spells. While contemporary labor market theories suggest increasing segmentation and declining job quality for peripheral workers, our findings provide only modest support for this view. Associations between peripheral status and poor job quality — particularly in terms of work autonomy and physical hazards — are generally weak and largely accounted for by  prior job conditions. Evidence for increasing divergence over time is limited, suggesting that labor market polarization in terms of job conditions along contractual divides may be less pronounced than often assumed.",

The amount of history lost to stolen archives, looted archaeological sites, and displaced objects has disrupted empirical evidence of the past, severely impacting the heritage, identity, and education of a country. Increased emphasis on historical literacy during the 21st century has heightened awareness surrounding illicit cultural trade, its environmental and cultural impact, as well as the shifting political dynamics at play. The US, whose museum institutions have largely benefited from the sale and exchange of stolen objects, began raiding private collections and archives holding stolen objects, leaving the world of art trade weary in the face of legal prosecution. In turn, the black market for cultural property has grown massively during the last 50 years, linked to large crime organizations and terrorism. This review examines existing research concerning history and global impact of illicit trade of cultural property, the political motives which both fuel and cease the movement of illicit trade, and highlight the important work of government and independent repatriation organizations. Concluding this review, I will provide new directions to take this research, emphasizing the importance of filling knowledge gaps within illicit cultural trade.",

Here we synthesise international research from the history of nature markets and summarise five ‘golden rules’ which are necessary precursors for achieving their environmental aims. We propose a simple checklist for investors, policymakers, and civil society to assess whether nature markets are likely to be delivering scientifically-credible outcomes. We score the world’s largest nature markets against these rules and show all face integrity risks.

We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. To solve the model factors, we use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.7% of the returns. The models assuming independence of the two returns show similar power in predicting T-bill returns, which can significantly simplify the formulas. We also find that the inclusion of a risk constant over maturity, which has a small value of several basis points, significantly reduces the prediction errors. The risk and the risk-free rate is the gateway to corporate the risk of various assets in the country.",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. To be comparable across assets and firms, our asset risk is a 5-year payment’s risk that approaches zero as the distance approaches zero. We show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option’s price minus its present value reflects the overcharge or transaction cost. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.",

We emphasize the ownership of firms as an important channel through which political connections operate and identify a resulting link between political turnover and turnover in the ownership of firms: Political turnover prompts newly politically connected individuals to take, and newly disconnected individuals to cede, ownership of firms. This pattern should be more pronounced in countries with weaker property rights, among firms with publicly recorded owners, and among firms with more immobile assets. Moreover, firms that experience changes to ownership during periods of political turnover should have elevated political connections and therefore pay less taxes and earn higher profits. Analyses of the ownership structure of firms in 87 countries are consistent with the theory. Because politically connected owners allow firms to compensate for other vulnerabilities, the theory also explains mixed findings in prior work on the consequences of asset immobility.",

Consumers benefit from lower prices. Because governments in democracies are more responsive to voters, they should implement lower tariffs. We develop and evaluate an implication of this line of argument. If lower tariffs are a response to consumer interests, lower tariffs should be concentrated on products most relevant to consumers. Using data on consumption shares across product categories, we report evidence that consumer interests do not account for lower tariffs. Governments place higher tariffs on goods with higher consumption shares, and we find no evidence that this relationship attenuates under more democratic institutions. There may be a variety of reasons why more democratic states are engaged in higher levels of international trade. A larger concern for consumer interests, however, is likely not among them.",

Our 2015 paper introduced Intervention Component Analysis (ICA), a method comprised of three key approaches for examining trials within an effectiveness synthesis:  a) an inductive approach to coding trial features; b) extraction of trialists perspectives about the strengths and limitations of features and experiences of implementation; and c) an assessment of identified features in relation to outcomes to assess which appear to be important. In this paper we reflect on how ICA has since been employed by ourselves and others to demonstrate the variety of ways it has been applied and to support further developments of the method. \nMethods: In March 2025 we searched Google Scholar for papers citing the 2015 ICA paper. We extracted information on: the year of publication; whether ICA was employed as an analysis method or simply cited; which aspects of ICA were employed; whether ICA was employed in combination with other synthesis methods and any innovations to or refinements of the method. We also conducted several in-depth case studies to identify the variation and illustrate the benefits of ICA. \nFindings: We identified 95 papers citing the 2015 paper of which 44 reported using or drawing on ICA in their analysis and a further 4 protocols reported a plan to use ICA; the remainder (n=47) cited but did not use ICA. Of the 48 that used or planned to use ICA, most (n=38) used or planned to use it in combination with another method such as a meta-analysis or qualitative comparative analysis whilst 10 used ICA as the sole method of analysis. We identified several innovative applications of ICA including the use of existing frameworks or logic models alongside the inductive coding method.  \nDiscussion: Use of ICA allows systematic reviewers to better understand ‘how’ interventions work. ICA has been found by ourselves and others to be both useful and flexible – able to be tailored to both large and small reviews, suitable for use as a stand-alone tool or alongside existing theories or taxonomies, useful as a tool for understanding intervention variation only or as a tool for explaining variation in outcomes. Potential future avenues for development include the use of subgroup analysis and meta-regression to test the theories generated by ICA.",

          "authors": "Martin Moland",
          "abstract": "The question of what creates and sustains national political identities has been investigated from many angles. However, the question of how international constraints on national autonomy shape national identities is so far under-investigated. This paper uses the European sovereign debt crisis as a case for investigating whether externally imposed constraints on fiscal political autonomy, typically contested decisions, solidify or weaken national solidarity. Using data from 1983-2021, I find that the imposition of austerity led to a strengthening of national identities immediately after the austerity packages were agreed. This effect was strongest in Southern Europe, where austerity had the largest social impact and constituted the greatest break with pre-existing national policy preferences. I find evidence that the strengthening of exclusively national self-identification after the imposition of austerity was most likely driven by an increased perception of economic threat in the austerity countries, rather than shifting evaluations of EU membership.",

          "title": "Quality vs. Quantity: Evaluating the Impact of Childcare Expansion on Children’s Educational Outcomes in Brazil",
          "authors": "Rita Schmutz; Dana McCoy",
          "abstract": "The early years are crucial for child development, with long-term impacts across various domains. While early childhood education and care (ECEC) policies aim to mitigate social inequalities, ineffective implementation can widen these disparities. This study assesses the impact of the rapid expansion of childcare through public-private partnerships (PPP) for children aged 0 to 3 years in São Paulo, Brazil, on their academic performance at ages 8 to 11. While the PPP model facilitated quicker capacity expansion, centers operating under this scheme were reported to have lower structural quality and received only half the per-child funding compared to public childcare centers. Using administrative datasets and a difference-in-differences approach, we estimated the impact of attending PPP centers (versus better-financed and regulated public centers) in the period immediately following the policy implementation on children's later academic outcomes. The results show that, on average, attending PPP centers in the post-policy period was associated with a small but positive effect on educational outcomes, and that this benefit was primarily observed for children who attend for only one year. Conversely, extended attendance (two to three years) correlated with declining test scores, intensifying concerns about prolonged exposure to substandard conditions. Contrary to expectations, children in disadvantaged areas did not fare worse during the policy expansion than those in wealthier regions, with positive effects concentrated in moderately disadvantaged neighborhoods. These findings underscore the importance of considering variability in ECEC policy outcomes to ensure they do not inadvertently create cumulative disadvantages and to guide policy adjustments for improving these programs.",

          "authors": "Timm Betz; Amy Pond",
          "abstract": "The ability to borrow is important for government survival. Governments routinely resort to policies that privilege their own debt on financial markets, exploiting their dual role as borrowers and regulators. These borrowing privileges nudge investors to hold the government's own debt. They share similarities with prudential regulation, but skew the market in favor of the government's debt; and they share similarities with financial repression, but are less severe and thus consistent with the growth of financial markets. Introducing the first systematic dataset documenting the use of such policies across countries and over time, we demonstrate that governments implement borrowing privileges when their interactions with the global economy heighten fiscal needs: when borrowing costs indicate tightened access to credit, when trade liberalization undercuts revenue, and where fixed exchange rates increase the value of fiscal space. Despite the mobility of financial assets and constraints from global markets, governments retain latitude in regulating domestic markets to their own fiscal benefit.",
