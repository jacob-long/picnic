          "abstract": "Not all people conform to what is socially construed as the norm and divergences should be expected. Neurodiversity is fundamental to the understanding of human behaviour and cognition. However, neurodivergent individuals are often stigmatised, devalued, and objectified. This position statement presents the perspectives of neurodivergent authors, the majority of whom have personal lived experiences of neurodivergence(s), and discusses how research and academia can and should be improved in terms of research integrity, inclusivity and diversity. The authors describe future directions that relate to lived experience and systematic barriers, disclosure, directions on prevalence, stigma, intersection of neurodiversity and open scholarship, and provide recommendations that can lead to personal and systematic changes to improve acceptance of neurodivergent individuals’ lived experiences within academia.",

          "abstract": "Open science remains vital to the progress and functioning of the global research enterprise. Published in 2015, the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines (TOP 2015) was developed as a policy framework to enhance the verifiability of empirical research claims in journal articles. It has been widely used and adopted by publishers and academic journals, but despite its uptake, concerns have been raised about aspects of the TOP 2015 framework and its implementation. In response to the above, the purpose of this manuscript is to introduce an official update to the TOP Guidelines. The final version—TOP 2025—provides updated guidelines for promoting the verifiability of published empirical research claims.",

          "authors": "Atina Manvelian; Monika Neff Lind; Ian Sotomayor; Arielle C. Smith; Joanne Davila; Jill Ehrenreich-May; Juan Pablo Zapata; Jessica L. Schleider",
          "abstract": "There is an urgent need to design scalable mental health treatments, particularly for disadvantaged populations with limited access to mental healthcare. Digital single-session interventions adapted from existing evidence-based treatments are one solution to this problem, allowing potent skills to be widely accessible for diverse communities via brief, targeted, online programs. There is increasing demand and interest in developing digital single-session interventions, yet there exists no guide on how to adapt single-session interventions from existing interventions, making it difficult for researchers to engage in intervention developing and testing. Objective: To equip researchers with the confidence they need to develop single-session interventions, this manuscript outlines why digital single-session interventions are needed and creates a step-by-step guide on how to develop single-session intervention programs from existing evidence-based treatments. Method: We gathered eight scientists, all of whom have taken part in developing different single-session interventions. Results: Together, we crafted five guiding elements to consider during the development process, such as preparation (cultivating a single-session mindset), collaboration (assembling the right team to reach target audience), adaptation (selecting appropriate treatments and components), design (creating the content of the intervention), and engagement (using best practices to increase online uptake and learning). We provide an example of how we developed an online single-session intervention to enhance healthy relationship skills for youth with depressive symptoms. For more detail and direction, we created a supplementary designing SSIs checklist. Conclusion: This manuscript serves as a guide for intervention scientists, allowing for the creation of evidence-based, scalable digital single-session interventions for youth.",

          "authors": "Nils Uwe Mallock",
          "abstract": "Exposure to self-related uncertainty has been shown to cause defensiveness in the form of embracing extreme political attitudes and intergroup bias. However, so far it is unclear whether this mechanism extends to behavioral intentions, and thus constitutes a motivating factor for engagement in non-normative collective action. Here, this question is examined in Iraq in 2020 after a period of intense regional instability and protests. In a preregistered randomized controlled trial across diverse locations (N=279), participants’ self-integrity was threatened by mortality salience. They responded by reporting stronger intentions to engage in collective action, especially for non-normative forms including the use of violence; however, providing alternative self-affirmation opportunities partially mitigated this effect. Secondary analyses suggest the impact of both manipulations to be moderated by low emotional stability, disagreeableness, and high identification with existing social networks. This study extends self-affirmation theory by testing it in a conflict-affected setting and on specific behavioral intentions, discussing practical implications for psychological field interventions in post-conflict resolution.",

          "authors": "Raihan Alam; Tage Rai",
          "abstract": "Across eight economic games and survey experiments, we find that incentivizing third parties to punish destabilizes cooperation. When punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately, remain lower regardless of punishment feedback, and can only be restored by explicitly signaling that incentives are restricted to prosocial punishment. When we allow recipients of cooperation to choose the punishers they are paired with, they inadvertently reduce their own payouts by choosing incentivized punishers. Survey experiments suggest that these effects occur because recipients trust punishers more than dictators, care more about promoting prosocial punishment than preventing antisocial punishment, and that the introduction of incentives reframes social norms. Our results suggest that any effects of punishment on cooperation may be driven more by what it communicates about punishers’ intentions and social norms than by the imposition of material costs alone. Implications for criminal justice and systems of punishment are discussed.",

          "authors": "Edith Haim; Natalie Fischer; Salvatore Citraro; Giulio Rossetti; Massimo Stella",
          "abstract": "Creativity is a fundamental skill of human cognition. We use textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) to extract network (semantic/syntactic associations) and emotional features from approximately one thousand human- and GPT3.5-generated stories. Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) we test whether features relative to Mednick’s associative theory of creativity can explain creativity ratings assigned by humans and GPT-3.5. Using XGBoost, we examine 3 scenarios: (i) human ratings of human stories, (ii) GPT-3.5 ratings of human stories, and (iii) GPT-3.5 ratings of GPT-generated stories. Our findings reveal that GPT-3.5 ratings differ significantly from human ratings not only in terms of correlations but also because of feature patterns identified with XAI methods. GPT-3.5 favours “its own” stories and rates human stories differently from humans. Feature importance analysis with SHAP scores shows that: (i) network features are more predictive for human creativity ratings but also for GPT-3.5´s ratings of human stories; (ii) emotional features played a greater role than semantic/syntactic network structure in GPT-3.5 rating its own stories. These quantitative results underscore key limitations in GPT-3.5´s ability to align with human assessments of creativity. We emphasise the need for caution when using GPT-3.5 to assess and generate creative content, as it does not yet capture the nuanced complexity that characterises human creativity.",

          "title": "The Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale: Development, validation, and associations with workplace outcomes",
          "authors": "Shane Littrell",
          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags, to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a type of semantically empty or otherwise vague rhetoric that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a way that misrepresents or obscures some aspect of organizational reality. Though corporate bullshit may sometimes seem harmless, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing effective communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing company reputation, and exposing businesses to legitimate financial and legal risks. Here, results from three studies (N = 745) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in receptivity to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate speech. Moreover, it is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a strong, robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of bullshit in the workplace.",

          "abstract": "Traditional rating scales have shaped psychological research, but are resource-intensive and can burden participants. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a tool to assess latent constructs in text. This study introduces LLM rating scales, a rating method that uses LLM responses instead of human ratings. Its application is demonstrated based on the development and validation of an LLM rating scale measuring patient engagement in transcripts of psychological therapies. Automatically transcribed videos of 1,131 sessions from 155 patients were analyzed using DISCOVER, a software framework for local multimodal human behavior analysis. The Llama 3.1 (8B) LLM rated 120 items on patient engagement, with the top eight items averaged to create a total engagement score ranging from 0 (low) to 100 (high). Psychometric properties were evaluated using the original sample, bootstrap resampling, and test folds. The LLM rating scale demonstrated normal distribution, strong reliability (ω = .953) and acceptable fit (CFI = .968, SRMR = .022), except RMSEA = .108. Validity was supported by significant correlations with engagement determinants (e.g., motivation, r = .413), processes (e.g., between-session efforts, r = .390), and outcomes (e.g., symptoms, r = −.304). Results remained robust across bootstrap and cross-validation analyses accounting for the hierarchical data structure. The LLM rating scale exhibited strong psychometric properties for measuring patient engagement, demonstrating the potential of the LLM rating scale approach as a psychological assessment tool. Importantly, this automated approach uses interpretable items, ensuring clear understanding of measured constructs, while supporting local implementation and protecting confidential data.",

          "authors": "Lavechin; Maureen de Seyssel; Hadrien Titeux; Guillaume Wisniewski; Hervé Bredin; Alejandrina Cristia; Emmanuel Dupoux",
          "abstract": "Before they even talk, infants become sensitive to the speech sounds of their native language and recognize the auditory form of an increasing number of words. Traditionally, these early perceptual changes are attributed to an emerging knowledge of linguistic categories such as phonemes or words. However, there is growing skepticism surrounding this interpretation due to limited evidence of category knowledge in infants. Previous modeling work has shown that a distributional learning algorithm could reproduce perceptual changes in infants’ early phonetic learning without acquiring phonetic categories. Taking this inquiry further, we propose that linguistic categories may not be needed for early word learning. We introduce STELA, a predictive coding algorithm designed to extract statistical patterns from continuous raw speech data. Our findings demonstrate that STELA can reproduce some developmental patterns of phonetic and word form learning without relying on linguistic categories such as phonemes or words nor requiring explicit word segmentation. Through an analysis of the learned representations, we show evidence that linguistic categories may emerge as an end product of learning rather than being prerequisites during early language acquisition.",

          "authors": "Kelsey E. Hagan; Nicolas Leenaerts; B. Timothy Walsh; Lisa Ranzenhofer",
          "abstract": "Objective: Several factors (e.g., interpersonal stress, affect) predict loss-of-control (LOC) eating and overeating in adolescents, but most past research has tested predictors separately. We applied machine learning to simultaneously evaluate multiple possible predictors of LOC-eating and overeating severity in pooled and person-specific models. Method: Twenty-eight adolescents (78.57% female, age = 15.87  1.59 years, BMI %ile = 92.71  8.86) who endorsed  two past-month LOC-eating episodes completed a week-long ecological momentary assessment protocol. Pooled models were fit to the aggregated data with elastic-net regularized regression and evaluated using nested cross-validation. Person-specific models were fit and evaluated as proof-of-concept. Results: Across adolescents, the median out-of-sample R2 of the pooled LOC-eating severity model was 0.33. The top predictors were between-subjects food craving, sadness, interpersonal conflict, shame, distress, stress (inverse association), and anger (inverse association), and within- and between-subjects wishing relationships were better. The median out-of-sample R2 for pooled overeating severity model was 0.20. The top predictors were between-person food craving, loneliness, mixed race, and feeling rejected (inverse association), and within-subjects guilt, nervousness, wishing for more friends (inverse association), and feeling scared, annoyed, and rejected (all inverse associations). Person-specific models demonstrated poor fit (median LOC-eating severity R2 = .003, median overeating R2 = -.009); 61% and 36% of adolescents’ models performed better than chance for LOC-eating and overeating severity, respectively. Discussion: Altogether, group-level models may hold utility in predicting LOC-eating and overeating severity, but model performance for person-specific models is variable, and additional research with larger samples over an extended assessment period is needed. Ultimately, a mix of these approaches may improve the identification of momentary predictors of LOC eating and overeating, providing novel and personalized opportunities for intervention.",

          "authors": "Setayesh Radkani; Joshua Tenenbaum; Rebecca Saxe",
          "abstract": "Authorities, from parents of toddlers to leaders of formal institutions, use punishment to communicate disapproval and enforce social norms. Ideally, from whether and how severely a transgression is punished, targets and other observers learn how to comply with shared social norms. Yet in light of every punitive choice, observers also evaluate the motives and legitimacy of the authority. Here, we show that the effects of punishment can only be understood by considering these inferences simultaneously. Punishment inevitably communicates information both about the transgression and about the authority’s motives, and the tradeoff between these inferences shapes when punishment succeeds and how it fails. We measured human observers’ joint inferences empirically in three pre-registered experiments (N=1254), and developed a rational Bayesian model using an inverse planning framework, that captures and explains these inferences quantitatively and parsimoniously. Individual differences in ideological authoritarianism were correlated with differing prior beliefs about authorities, and subsequent interpretations of punishment; the model predicted that observing punishment by the authority can entrench these differences and lead to further polarization. This work reveals the rational logic behind how people learn from punishment, and a key constraint on the function of punishment in establishing shared social norms.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-transcendence—connectedness within and beyond the self—is a complex phenomenon theorized to increase with age, but evidence is mixed. This longitudinal study is the first to investigate changes in self-transcendence across late midlife using life story narratives. \nMethod: We tracked self-reported and narrative identity self-transcendence scores of 163 participants as they aged from M=56.4 (SD=0.95) to M=64.5 (SD=0.94). Participants were 64.4% women, 35.6% men; 55.2% White, 42.9% Black, 1.8% interracial/other; median income was $75,000–$100,000; median education was college graduate. \nResults: Self-transcendence narrative themes of closure and self-actualization increased significantly over time, especially between ages 60–65, but self-reported self-transcendence did not change. These trends were not uniform; race by gender groups exhibited distinct trajectories over time.\nDiscussion: Late midlife is seen as ushering in opportunities for increased self-transcendence, especially acceptance of oneself and one’s life. We found some of the strongest empirical evidence of this phenomenon to date. On average, U.S. Black and White adults narrated their life stories with less regret and more satisfaction with self across late midlife. Findings demonstrate the utility of leveraging first-person narrative identity methods to collect and analyze data about rich, complex personality constructs and highlight positive changes associated with late midlife.",

          "abstract": "Conversational partners expect each other to communicate rationally and cooperatively and to contribute relevant and informative utterances. Often however, listeners infer additional meaning over and above the explicit content of an utterance. The present study investigates how speaker characteristics influence inferencing. Experiment 1 (N=205) demonstrates that when produced by knowledgeable speakers utterances such as “the library walls are blue” are more likely to be understood as conveying that the library walls have changed. Experiment 2 (N=205) finds that these inferences are more likely to arise when produced by a speaker who is not typically very chatty; reticent speakers have a higher threshold of what is considered an appropriate conversational contribution. Taken together, the findings from these studies demonstrate that listeners have pervasive expectations of cooperativity and if conversational contributions fail to satisfy this then listeners will engage in sophisticated reasoning to reconcile the mismatch between expectations and input.",

          "abstract": "Many parents lie to their children. Paradoxically, many also disapprove of lying to children and teach children that lying is unacceptable, suggesting discrepancies between parental lying attitudes, lying behaviors, and teaching about lying. This study explored the alignment and discrepancies between parental attitudes, behaviors, and teaching across three lie types: other-oriented, self-oriented, and instrumental. Cross-sectional data were collected from parents in the Netherlands (N = 312, 79.8% mothers) and analyzed using correlational and Latent Profile Analyses. Between-parent associations suggested a general alignment between parental attitudes, behaviors, and teaching, with variations in strength depending on the type of lie. However, within-parent analyses showed that many parents exhibited discrepancies between their lying attitudes, behaviors, and teaching. The prevalence and patterns of alignment and discrepancies also differed by lie type. These findings suggest that most parents do not fully practice what they believe or preach, nor do they consistently preach what they believe, reflecting internal conflicts within parents and inconsistencies in moral socialization within families. This study not only expands on the limited understanding of parental alignment and discrepancies between lying attitudes, behaviors, and teaching but also proposes novel hypotheses of potential mechanisms underlying parental discrepancies, including parental stress, hierarchical family dynamics, and societal norms.",

          "abstract": "Hunger is a biological drive which can promote unhealthy dietary decisions. Yet, the cognitive mechanisms underlying this effect, and in particular the interactive role of attention and choice processes, remain elusive. To address this gap, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment, in which 70 participants completed a multi-attribute food choice task in hungry and sated states. Confirming our preregistered hypotheses, participants’ preference for tasty over healthy food items was amplified by hunger. Attention mediated this influence of hunger, as hungry participants focused more on tasty options, leading them to make less healthy decisions. Rigorous model comparisons revealed that an extension of the recently proposed multi-attribute attentional drift diffusion model best explained choice and response times. According to this model, hunger did not only increase the relative taste compared to health weight of, but it also increased the fixation-related discounting of health but not taste information. Our results suggest that the cognitive mechanisms underlying unhealthy dietary decisions under hunger are characterized by a nuanced interplay between attention and the significance assigned to the options’ underlying attributes.",

Next, the training group was taught about irony, and the control group was taught about reading comprehension. At post-test, the reading task and eye-tracking were repeated. Irony comprehension improved after metapragmatic training on irony, suggesting that metapragmatic knowledge serves an important role in irony development. However, the eye movement data suggested that training did not change the strategy children used to resolve the ironic meaning.

For example, CIs\nconvey altered fundamental frequency (F0) information, disrupting the perception of lexical stress\n(e.g., distinguishing between the noun CONtent and the adjective conTENT) in languages in which\nthis feature rests on F0 modulations. CI-users can compensate for the degraded nature of the\nacoustic input by exploiting the audiovisual affordances of human communication, weighing more\nheavily the visual information provided by the speaker (e.g., lip movements and gestures). Recent\nstudies showed that, in individuals with normal hearing, the timing of simple up-and-down\nmovements of the hand (i.e., beat gestures) biases lexical stress perception. The present study tested\nif the timing of beat gestures produced by an avatar can bias Dutch lexical stress perception in\nvocoded speech, which simulates CI-hearing conditions. The bias induced by beat gestures in\nvocoded speech was particularly pronounced when hearing an ambiguous or the least frequent\nstress pattern in Dutch. These results suggest that (even artificially generated) beat gestures can be\nused to support speech perception in CI-mediated speech, especially when processing words with\nprosodic features that are less frequent.",

          "abstract": "Developing olfactory expertise is essential in professions like perfumery, where the ability to describe, categorize, and conceptualize odors is critical. This study investigates how academic training during a 1.5-year program at a perfumery school (ISIPCA) shapes olfactory expertise of perfumery students. Forty students were assessed at three time points, focusing on odor description, evocation, recognition, discrimination, and categorization tasks. Results show that training significantly enhanced language abilities related to odor description and categorization. Students developed a richer and more precise vocabulary to characterize odors, aligning more closely with expert’s terminology and contributing to the formation of a shared olfactory lexicon. Semantic similarity within and between students, as well as with expert references, increased, emphasizing the importance of consistent language use in expertise development. Advanced natural language processing and machine learning tools revealed that the richness of verbal descriptions and semantic similarity were strong predictors of expertise acquisition. In contrast, improvements in non-verbal tasks, such as odor discrimination and recognition, were more limited, suggesting that perceptual abilities may require more extensive training or specialized methods. Building on these results, we propose potential enhancements to olfactory training including reinforced language practice, mental imagery exercises, and sensory discrimination tasks, along with personalized training strategies. These findings highlight the central role of language in the emergence of olfactory expertise and the importance of computational methods for optimizing training programs and advancing educational practices in olfactory science",

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we use an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model is applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learn to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results show that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Mindset history is an important area of study for anyone who works with or refers to mindset in their life or work. Yet, mindset history is an area of study where little peer-reviewed research exists. This paper aims to address this gap by being the first peer-reviewed study to inquire into the origins, history, and lineage of mindset, to gain a broad understanding of some of the various mindset psychologies that have been developed over time and across generations, as well as to gain a sense of the collective wisdom that is present in the field as a whole. This review found that mindset psychology has a diverse, century-long history of explicit research and practice, with its origin phase taking place between 1908 and 1939, early inquiries occurring between 1940 and 1987, and contemporary bodies of work emerging in, and beyond 1988. This review also identifies some of the lineages of research and practice that are closely related to the origins and history of mindset psychology, some of which span back hundreds and thousands of years. The paper concludes with a reflection on my lived experience as a mindset practitioner and the journey of transformation I moved through to embrace a more holistic and intergenerational understanding. You are invited to become part of the future of mindset psychology by deepening your understanding of its history, and by grounding your work in a comprehensive understanding of the entire field.",

          "abstract": "Perseverative thought (also known as repetitive thought) is an established transdiagnostic mechanism of internalizing psychopathology characterized primarily by its repetitive, difficult to control quality. Subjective difficulty concentrating frequently coincides with perseverative thought and may function as both mechanism and clinical consequence of perseverative thought. Although cognitive theories suggest a bidirectional relationship between perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating, experimental and longitudinal investigations provide mixed evidence. The current study addresses this gap by examining the temporal dynamics between momentary perseverative thought and difficulty concentrating using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) (8 surveys per day for 14 days) with 155 adult community participants (compliance ≥ 70%) oversampled for moderate/severe perseverative thought. Multilevel modeling tested concurrent and time-lagged associations. Difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought were concurrently and prospectively related within-person: higher difficulty concentrating at T-1 predicted higher perseverative thought at T, and higher perseverative thought at T-1 predicted higher difficulty concentrating at T. Findings held when controlling for the outcome at T-1. These findings demonstrate covariation between difficulty concentrating and perseverative thought within-person in daily life consistent with theoretical models that predict bidirectional relationships. Directions for future research include probing causality via momentary experimental approaches and exploring potential for clinical translation via just-in-time adaptive interventions.",

In this paper, we propose a rational mentalizing model of the decision to engage in social learning. This model estimates the utility of social learning by reasoning about the other agent’s goal and the informativity of their future actions. It then weighs the utility of social learn- ing against the utility of self-exploration (non-social learning). Using a multi-player treasure hunt game, we show that our model can quantitatively capture human trade-offs between social and non-social learning.

          "abstract": "Cheerfulness and positive affect play a critical role in decreasing mortality risks and enhancing well-being and longevity. However, limited research has examined longitudinal relationships between digital technology ownership/adoption (e.g., cell phones and computers) and changes in cheerfulness of older adults (Bixter, Blocker, Rogers, 2018; Seifert, Hofer, &amp; Rössel, 2018). The current study investigated whether cell phone and computer ownership/adoption are related to improved cheerfulness among older people over an 11-year period. Data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) was used. NHATS interviewed participants aged 65 and over since 2011 and annually thereafter. Data from 11 waves were used in this current study, and the sample size was 17355 participants at baseline. Self-rated cheerfulness (on a 5-point scale) was the outcome variable. Longitudinal multilevel modeling examined the following variables as time-invariant predictors: cell phone ownership/adoption (dichotomous yes/no), and computer ownership/adoption (dichotomous yes/no to having a desktop or laptop with Internet access). Covariates were age group, sex, years of education, and self-rated health. Interactions between time and cell phone ownership, and time and computer ownership, were also examined. While cell phone ownership at baseline significantly predicted cheerfulness (p=0.06), it did not significantly interact with time, so it did not predict changes in cheerfulness. However, computer ownership did significantly interact with time to predict increases in cheerfulness (estimate=0.006, p=0.028). This study indicated that potential technology ownership and/or adoption of older adults could predict pleasurable emotions (i.e., cheerfulness) in later life, above and beyond demographic and health factors. We consider the potential to incorporate computer adoption in efforts to promote healthy aging. Future research could examine the potential contributing factors of computer ownership and/or adoption (e.g., online connections to others and the world, enjoyment, convenience in information retrieving sense of safety or security,) and its roles in generating cheerful emotions among older adults.",

          "abstract": "Word embeddings derived from large language corpora have been successfully used in cognitive science and artificial intelligence to represent linguistic meaning. However, there is continued debate as to how well they encode useful information about the perceptual qualities of concepts. This debate is critical to identifying the scope of embodiment in human semantics. If perceptual object properties can be inferred from word embeddings derived from language alone, this suggests that language provides a useful adjunct to direct perceptual experience for acquiring this kind of conceptual knowledge. Previous research has shown mixed performance when embeddings are used to predict perceptual qualities. Here, we tested if we could improve performance by leveraging the ability of Transformer-based language models to represent word meaning in context. To this end, we conducted two experiments. Our first experiment investigated noun representations. We generated decontextualised (‘charcoal’) and contextualised (‘the brightness of charcoal’) Word2Vec and BERT embeddings for a large set of concepts and compared their ability to predict human ratings of the concepts’ brightness. We repeated this procedure to also probe for the shape of those concepts. In general, we found very good prediction performance for shape, and more modest performance for brightness. The addition of context did not improve perceptual prediction performance. In Experiment 2, we investigated representations of adjective-noun pairs. Perceptual prediction performance was generally found to be good, with the non-additive nature of adjective brightness reflected in the word embeddings. We also found that the addition of context had a limited impact on how well perceptual features could be predicted. We frame these results against current work on the interpretability of language models and debates surrounding embodiment in human conceptual processing.",

We  propose that rude actors are conferred more social rewards when they respond to another’s incivility (i.e., retaliatory incivility) relative to when incivility is unprovoked, because retaliatory incivility is seen as more virtuous. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as two samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; sports fans, and employees. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility, far from being disparaged, can be a surprising path to social reward. Our findings have far-reaching practical implications, too, as incivility continues to rise internationally.",

          "abstract": "The words we use to describe what happened shape what comes to a listener's mind. How do speakers choose what causal expressions to use? How does that choice impact what listeners imagine? In this paper, we develop a computational model of how people use the causal expressions \"caused\", \"enabled\", \"affected\", and \"made no difference\". The model first builds a causal representation of what happened. By running counterfactual simulations, the model computes several causal aspects that capture the different ways in which a candidate cause made a difference to the outcome. Logical combinations of these aspects define a semantics for the causal expressions. The model then uses pragmatic inference to decide what word to use in context. We test our model in a series of experiments and compare it to prior psychological accounts. In a set of psycholinguistic studies, we verify the model's semantics and pragmatics. We show that the causal expressions exist on a hierarchy of specificity, and that participants draw informative pragmatic inferences in line with this scale. In the next two studies, we demonstrate that our model quantitatively fits participant behavior in a speaker task and a listener task involving dynamic physical scenarios. We compare our model to two lesioned alternatives, one which removes pragmatic inference, and another which removes semantics and pragmatics. Our full model better accounts for participants' behavior than both alternatives. Taken together, these results suggest a new way forward for modeling the relationship between language and thought in the study of causality.",

          "abstract": "This is the first study to attempt replication of Banas et al (2023) on inoculation messages. The original experiment demonstrated that inoculation messages could stimulate resistance to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. However, a gap was identified in this study where exposing participants with inoculation scripts did not stimulate motivational threat, the key component that drives the attitude to defend specific beliefs. In this replication study, we also included conspiracy mentality as the moderator variable that might influence the strength of the association between inoculation scripts and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. Findings from this study shows that logic-based and fact-based inoculation scripts were perceived differently by participants. Logic-based scripts were perceived as the script that exposed more evidence (fact) compared to fact-based and baseline scripts. Contrary to the original findings, the study failed to replicate the effect of inoculation treatments on anti-vaccine conspiracy attitudes. Instead, prior attitudes on anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, involvement and conspiracy mentality were shown as the significant predictors.",

          "abstract": "Stigmatized groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer-identifying (LGBTQ+) individuals, face increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and mpox (monkeypox), compared to non-stigmatized groups. Layered and intersectional stigma can limit access to effective healthcare and expose them to discrimination. Ineffective health and risk communication can also reinforce stereotypes and discourage positive health behaviors among LGBTQ+ communities. This was evident during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea, where LGBTQ+ individuals were further stigmatized when detailed personal information was shared for contact tracing purposes. The government and media linked COVID-19 transmission to LGBTQ+ spaces, unintentionally reinforcing existing stereotypes. We conducted in-depth interviews (N = 21) to understand the layered stigma and discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ communities before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea. We examined risk communication strategies that can help LGBTQ+ individuals engage in public health behaviors, despite stigmas. Our findings highlight the importance of reducing stigma to encourage stigmatized groups to engage in testing and treatment. Public health implications are discussed.\nHighlights \n•\tLGBTQ+ people in South Korea experienced intersectional stigma with COVID-19\n•\tAnonymized testing procedures can reduce stigmatization and encourage testing\n•\tHealth authorities can partner, consult, and collaborate with stigmatized groups\n•\tHealth authorities can use trusted in-group messengers and messages with compassion\n•\tGovernments should proactively develop anti-discrimination policies",

          "abstract": "While the acculturation strategy of integration (i.e., migrants embracing both their heritage culture and the mainstream culture) is best operationalised as an interaction between heritage and mainstream culture orientations, methods for testing individual-level interactions meta-analytically have only emerged recently. Previously published meta-analyses of the relationship between integration and cross-cultural adaptation used alternative bivariate operationalisations, producing results of unknown accuracy. Here, using two existing datasets (total k = 57, total N = 7,512) and one highly-powered simulation study (total k = 30,000, total N = 8,981,481), we estimate the average effect of integration on adaptation based on the state-of-the-art multivariate approach to meta-analysing interactions and compare it with four bivariate approaches used in previous meta-analyses: the summative approach, the multiplicative approach, Euclidean distance, and the mid-point split approach. The multivariate results indicate that the interaction effect of heritage-culture and mainstream-culture orientations on adaptation is negligible and largely driven by mainstream-culture orientation. Among bivariate approaches, the midpoint split, which best preserves the interactive nature of integration, produces consistently the smallest effects. We discuss the implications of using these approaches and provide recommendations for operationalising integration in meta-analytical research.",

We adopt an individual perspective on victimhood by investigating the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and the individual disposition to perceive and react to injustice as a victim (i.e., victim justice sensitivity; VJS). Data from two German samples (Ns = 370, 373) indicated a positive association between VJS and conspiracy mentality beyond conceptually related covariates (e.g., mistrust). In a multinational sample from 15 countries (N = 14,978), VJS was positively associated with both general and specific conspiracy beliefs (about vaccines and climate change) within countries, though these associations varied across countries. However, economic, sociopolitical, and cultural country-level factors that might explain the cross-country variability (e.g., GDP, Human Freedom Index, Individualism-Collectivism), including proxies of collective victimhood, did not moderate the studied associations. Future research should investigate the association between victimhood and conspiracy beliefs considering both intraindividual and intergroup perspectives.",

          "abstract": "A short period of eye-tracking can produce large amounts of data, making analysis challenging, particularly for clinical applications. Automated methods for extracting basic oculomotor features of saccades, fixation, or blinking are available. For more in-depth oculomotor analysis, manual cleaning and processing is often required. This is time-consuming and variable across individuals and over time, which limits scalability and clinical utility, even if identified oculomotor markers have high potential clinical significance. Automation provides an opportunity to reduce manual labour and improve replicability and precision through algorithmic approaches. Here we outline the design and validation of our SacLab Toolbox for processing data from well-established oculomotor paradigms commonly used in clinical research such as prosaccade, antisaccade, and smooth pursuit tasks. For prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, results showed good agreement between algorithmic and manual cleaning regarding which trials were to be included (86% for prosaccade and 91% for antisaccade with F1-scores of 0.89 and 0.79, respectively). The toolbox was also tested on data for both tasks from an independent laboratory with a different manual cleaning protocol, and the level of agreement remained high (87% for prosaccade and 93% for antisaccade with F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.94, respectively). The extent of concordance for the metrics extracted in both methods is discussed. The predominant reason for discrepancy between the manual process and our toolbox related to human error in the manual process. Overall, the results provide support for the benefits of this toolbox for these eye-tracking tasks in clinical and research applications.",

          "abstract": "Experiences of bullying victimization (BV) associate with poorer academic performance and academic self-efficacy, with self-efficacy often mediating the relation between BV and academic performance. This transmission model implies that BV can erode the social cognitive and affective self-perceptions related to academic performance (self-efficacy), thereby declining actual academic performance. A plausible alternative but under-investigated model is that academic self-efficacy protects against the impacts of BV on students’ academic functioning by moderating the relation between BV and achievement (the buffer model). In this study, we use the Trends in International Math and Sciences Study (TIMSS) United States data to compare these models of BV, math self-efficacy (MSE), and math achievement and differences in this model across student, classroom, and school contexts. Approximately 8,700 students in 270 schools and 500 schools in Grades 4 and 8 each participated in the study. Using Bayesian multilevel multivariate modeling, we compare the buffer and transmission models, finding that in both Grades 4 and 8, the transmission model evidenced the best relative model performance. We discuss the patterns of relations at the individual student level and also examine classroom and school context effects.

          "abstract": "Rewarded stimuli are prioritized by the attentional system. Behavioral performance is improved when the task-relevant dimension is tied to a potential reward but is impaired when the irrelevant dimension is reward related. Within the rewarded Stroop task, the facilitation (reward responsiveness) and impairment (modulation of interference of reward association; MIRA) from reward-associated stimuli are thought to be due to different cognitive processes. In four experiments, we explored whether reward responsiveness and MIRA were influenced by reward magnitude and persisted following reward discontinuation. We manipulated how informed participants were of the stimulus-reward contingency based on whether they received stimulus-reward color instructions and whether or not the stimulus-reward contingency was certain (i.e., one color was always tied to one reward outcome). Results suggest that greater reward magnitude increased reward responsiveness, especially when participants were informed about the stimulus-reward contingency. However, greater impairment (MIRA) by a large versus small reward related color word was only observed when participants had little knowledge of the reward contingency (i.e., no instructions and a more uncertain mapping of stimuli to rewards) or during the extinction phase when reward associated colors were less relevant. These findings highlight the distinction between reward responsiveness to maximize gains and the unintentional prioritization of related but irrelevant information and suggest that reward associations that elicit greater reward responsiveness do not necessarily lead to greater impairment of conflict processing.",

          "abstract": "Parents and children appear to coordinate their attention to objects in their environment, often via mutual gaze. Children, however, display a novelty bias in interacting with objects, looking longer at novel objects relative to familiar objects. This may allow parents to follow in on their child’s focus of attention and label the novel objects, creating moments of optimal learning. The current study examined this with regard to whether parents are more likely to lead instances of joint attention to novel relative to familiar objects and how children learn from periods of child-led or parent-led joint attention. In particular, we investigated whether (i) parents lead more instances of joint attention when playing with novel relative to familiar objects, (ii) parents preferentially label novel relative to familiar objects, and (iii) children's learning of novel word-object associations is affected by the frequency of labelling and children's sustained attention towards the objects. We found that not only do children lead more instances of joint attention, but, relative to their caregivers, children lead more instances of joint attention to familiar objects relative to novel objects. Parents also appeared to follow in on their child’s attention and labelled familiar objects more often than novel objects. Furthermore, we found no evidence for children’s recognition of the novel word-object associations. Our findings highlight the contingent nature of social interactions between caregivers and infants, with children leading and parents following their child’s lead, especially with regard to more familiar objects in the child’s environment.",

The present study developed and field-tested an approach to measure and monitor mental models in-situ. This was done by comparing the information that different team members had about their tasks and compiling the information to a “cohesion report” for the team leader. Data was collected during ongoing training scenarios across 14 training sessions for second-line emergency response teams (N = 134 participant recordings). The study developed and demonstrated a way of measuring cohesion. The study also tested the effect of providing the team leader with the team’s level of cohesion during the training session. Replicating a previous finding, we found that team-membership influenced team members’ shared mental models. This indicates that certain team factors contribute to some teams having higher cohesion than other teams. The experimental manipulation of providing team leaders with access to the cohesion measure improved the team’s mental models (when excluding the team role with most variation). Such tools could be used to evaluate and enhance mental models in emergency response teams, and further research could explore how team leaders could benefit from in-situ monitoring of the team’s mental models.",

          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

To address this gap, the present study analyzed opera singing recordings to identify factors that explain the overall score. Ten trained female Japanese singers performed “Caro mio ben” under standardized recording conditions. Four experts evaluated the recorded performances by assigning an overall score of 100 points and rating six vocal attributes: vibrato, resonance, timbre, diction, intonation, and expressiveness. The recordings were then analyzed to calculate the acoustic features, including the singing power ratio (SPR), harmonic-to-noise ratio, and sound pressure level. We developed two linear mixed models: the first regressed the overall score on the subjective vocal attributes, whereas the second predicted the overall score from the acoustic features. Evaluator identity was included as a random effect in both models. The results showed that vibrato was a significant predictor of the overall score in the first model. In the second model, only SPR emerged as a significant predictor. These findings suggest that vibrato, which reflects emotional expressiveness and vocal control, and SPR, which indicates the relative power in the high-frequency band (2–4 kHz) and signifies a voice clearer than the accompaniment, are key factors in explaining the overall score in opera singing.",

          "abstract": "What kind of information does perception represent, and in what format? How does perception interface with higher-level cognitive systems for thinking, reasoning, and language? Questions like these motivated Green and Hummel (henceforth, G&amp;H) in their seminal 2006 article in JEP:HPP, “Familiar Interacting Object Pairs Are Perceptually Grouped.” At first glance, the subject matter of G&amp;H’s article appears quite simple and mundane: actions like pouring coffee, cutting bread, or unlocking a door. Yet hidden at the core of such everyday routines are specific functional relationships between objects, such as a carafe and a mug, a knife and a loaf, or a key and a lock. G&amp;H’s article was a turning point in a long but sparse tradition of research that had considered such relations from a vision-science perspective (e.g., Scholl &amp; Tremoulet, 2000; Ullman, 1984), as it steered many researchers — ourselves included — to explore questions in the burgeoning field now known as “relation perception.” This field advances the idea that, beyond objects, features, and locations, the visual system spontaneously or automatically extracts and represents relations — properties that specify interactions or connections between objects, rather than each object’s individual characteristics. In this perspective article, we outline new aspects of human visual perception that have been the focus of this field, and the major outstanding questions that remain.",

          "abstract": "Together with language, music is perhaps the most distinctive behavioral trait of our species. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain why only humans speak and why only they perform music and, if both abilities are evolutionary related, how and why they eventually diverged. Human linguisticality and musicality are certainly biologically and behaviorally rooted in animal communication, cognition, and socialization. A hypothetical musilanguage must have constituted a transition stage from animal signal systems to the syncretic coexistence of coming-to-be language and music. Growing complexity of social networks and technologies essential for survival of Homo created the need to regulate social relations and secure effective transmission of important information, causing musilanguage to split into proto-music and proto-language, with different specialization (despite considerable overlapping of their usage functions). Proto-music focused on expressing emotional content through singing vocalizations (e.g., motherese) and rhythmic use of instruments (knapping). Proto-language focused on accurate and timely transmission of referential information. Further differentiation of musical genres, each forming its own repertory of expressions, turned proto-music into music. In parallel, proto-language evolved into language under pressure to continuously convey increasingly complex and dense information streams between growing numbers of participants - to accommodate demographic and technological growth. Increased prosociality promoted the emergence of more complex social structures and behaviors, cooperation, and codependency, directing music and language towards greater divergence and complexity.",

          "abstract": "Background. Adolescence is a unique developmental period associated with increased emergence of psychopathology. Negative life event (NLE) exposure is robustly linked with adolescent psychopathology and prior work suggests that emotion regulation may mediate this relation. However, research incorporating experiences of gender diverse (GD) adolescents has been lacking, despite elevated rates of NLEs and psychopathology in GD individuals. This study examined potential gender differences in the relations between NLE exposure, ER, and psychopathology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Methods. Data from 1955 cisgender boys, 1614 cisgender girls, and 194 GD adolescents enrolled in the ABCD study were utilized for the current study. Participants reported NLE exposure via Life Event Scale (LES) and ER difficulties via Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Parent Report (DERS-P) in early adolescence (M (SD) age = 12.93 (.27) years), followed by their internalizing and externalizing psychopathology symptoms via Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Brief Problem Monitor-Youth (BPM-Y) one year later (M (SD) age = 14.12 years). Mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling and conditional process modeling. Results. GD youth had higher rates of NLE exposure and more ER difficulties and psychopathology symptoms than cisgender peers. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and all psychopathology symptoms for all gender groups. Gender moderated direct relations between NLE exposure and youth-report internalizing symptoms such that relations were stronger for cis girls and GD youth compared to cis boys. Conclusions. ER difficulties partially mediated relations between NLE exposure and psychopathology symptoms in a large sample of adolescents in the United States. Higher negative life experience exposure, ER difficulties, and psychopathology symptoms for GD youth compared to peers warrant additional study on ways to support these adolescents.

          "abstract": "The present research adopts a mixed-methods approach to examine the boundaries between two anger variants: an anger perceived as moral, appropriate, and justified; and an anger considered wrong and unjustified. In Study 1, we analyze participants’ narratives about their past experiences of justified and unjustified anger using qualitative thematic analysis, closed-vocabulary, and open-vocabulary text processing methods. In Study 2, we use a prototype approach to differentiate justified and unjustified anger experiences across ten theory-driven dimensions. The results reveal crucial differences in cognitive and emotional components, as well as interpersonal outcomes associated with these anger types. Participants often considered their anger to be justified when a target’s actions were perceived as immoral, unfair, harmful, or violating norms. They viewed the target’s behavior as reflecting poor moral character, expressed absolutist judgments in their writing, and experienced concurrent hostile emotions. In contrast, participants perceived their anger as unjustified when it stemmed from unrelated frustrations, misunderstandings, or overreactions to trivial offenses. Unjustified anger narratives were often reflective, and demonstrated retrospection and self-directed emotions (e.g., guilt and embarrassment). The two anger types varied considerably in their relational impact: Justified anger commonly led to strained or severed relationships, while unjustified anger prompted efforts to repair bonds. Additionally, justified anger had a stronger overlap with hate and contempt appraisals. We discuss the implications of these findings for constructing theories capable of explaining diverse anger experiences as well as developing interventions to address the maladaptive behaviors associated with anger.",

          "authors": "Ethan Kutlu; Hyoju Kim; Bob McMurray",
          "abstract": "A critical aspect of spoken language development is learning to categorize the sounds of the child’s language(s). This process was thought to develop early during infancy to set the stage for the later development of other, higher-level aspects of language (e.g., vocabulary, syntax). This development was thought to follow a form of perceptual narrowing in which infants lose access to phonetic detail that is not relevant to their native language categories. More recent research has shown that speech categorization continues to develop through adolescence (e.g., Hazan &amp; Barrett, 2000; Slawinski &amp; Fitzgerald, 1998). This work which uses more sophisticated forced choice tasks and stimuli that span speech continua (e.g., /b/ to /p/ in small steps) is also broadly consistent with narrowing as children show increasingly sharp category boundaries over development. Here, our longitudinal study revisited these results using a new Visual Analogue Scaling (VAS) task which uses a continuous rating scale to potentially unpack the underlying cause of a shallower or more gradient boundary. We tested 282 school-aged children (in grades 1-3) over three years (through grades 4-6). A Bayesian Hierarchical Growth Curve model was fit to extract the Slope of the categorization function and Response Consistency (the trial-by-trial variance). Results show that as children age, they show shallower (more gradient) slopes and decreased inconsistency. These findings suggest that sound categorization continues to develop through early school age. These findings challenge perceptual narrowing because they indicate that children are increasingly sensitive to fine-grained gradient detail in the signal. The dramatic changes in consistency represent a challenge to current theoretical models that focus on the nature of the representation.",

Using the short form of the Personal Globe Inventory, participants rated their own vocational interests and those they desired in an ideal partner. We assessed various dimensions of similarity, including normative and distinctive partner-ideal congruence, actual partner congruence, ideals agreement, and self-ideal similarity across the full interest profile and theoretical interest dimensions. The findings indicate that participants generally preferred ideal partners with elevated vocational profiles. Trait-wise self-ideal similarity was significant but modest across all RIASEC types, along with the Ideas-Data and Prestige but not the People-Things dimension of the Personal Globe. Significant distinctive self-ideal profile agreement emerged in both samples. Among couples, actual partners’ vocational interests were more closely aligned with ideal preferences than self-reported interests reflecting gender normativity of vocational interest profiles. The similarity between an actual partner’s vocational profile and the ideal partner’s profile modestly predicted relationship satisfaction, particularly for women, emphasizing the importance of ideal standards in vocational interests. These findings support the idea that vocational interests contribute to processes of partner selection and couple functioning.

          "abstract": "Encountering a homonym in a sentential context that biases interpretation towards its subordinate meaning makes that meaning easier to access later. This word-meaning priming effect is not restricted to homonyms and may be supported by general episodic memory processes. Such an account predicts that word-meaning priming may be affected by factors that affect episodic learning (e.g., predictability). Specifically, the contextual predictability of an incoming stimulus has been shown to affect episodic memory in that both highly expected as well as highly unexpected input leads to better memory for that input, via two different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We hypothesised that if word-meaning priming is supported by episodic memory processes, both highly expected as well as highly unexpected target words should lead to stronger word-meaning priming effects than target words of intermediate predictability. Four pre-registered online experiments tested whether contextual predictability affects word-meaning priming and incidental memory for language. We exposed participants to sentences that emphasised a particular aspect of a sentence-final target word’s meaning. Importantly, target words differed in how predictable they were based on the sentence context (e.g., “You can get in a good workout by riding a bicycle” vs. “You can get in a good workout by lifting a bicycle”). Associate production and semantic relatedness judgement assessed the strength of word-meaning priming. Contrary to our hypotheses, while there was evidence for priming across experiments, we found no significant effects of contextual predictability in any experiments. Our findings suggest that predictability-guided updating is rarely triggered during language comprehension, and we outline the theoretical implications of these results for the architecture of the language system.",

University students with Chinese and Korean as their respective L1 completed the same set of tasks three times over two semesters that measured three aspects of derivational MA: relational, syntactic, and distributional. Unconditional latent growth curve models (LGM) showed a pattern of linear growth for all MA aspects. Further LGM analyses with group as a time-invariant covariate revealed that for the intercept, there was no significant group difference for relational MA; however, Korean-L1 learners significantly outperformed Chinese-L1 learners for distributional MA, whereas a converse pattern was found for syntactic MA of regular words. No significant group difference, however, was found in the slope for any MA aspect. Finally, Wald tests through parameter constraints on a parallel growth model showed that the intercept was greater for regular words than irregular words, which was true across groups and MA aspects. These findings underscore a complex interplay of learner internal (L1) and external (affix neutrality and skill facets) factors in MA development in a foreign language context.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the impact of visually similar flanking stimuli on central target words using the Flanking Letter Lexical Decision (FLLD) task. Specifically, we investigated whether visual similarity effects can explain orthographic relatedness effects observed in previous FLLD tasks. By employing non-reversal mirror letters as visual flankers, we compared their influence on response times to traditional orthographic-related and orthographic-unrelated conditions. Results confirmed the known facilitative effect of orthographic-related flankers on response times (ROCK ROCK ROCK). However, mirror-related conditions showed no facilitative effect (ROCK ROCK ROCK), as evidenced by a Bayesian analysis indicating no significant differences between mirror-related and mirror-unrelated (STEP ROCK STEP). These findings suggest that low-level visual information in the parafovea does not contribute to the processing of the foveal word in tasks requiring specific word identification. The study concludes that only parafoveal information with relevant linguistic content is spatially pooled across target and flankers during word identification tasks. This research highlights the need to consider task-specific attentional demands and the linguistic relevance of parafoveal information in understanding visual and orthographic processing in reading.",

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of video games as important cultural and economic forces has sparked a clear interest in making the industry more environmentally friendly. One of the prominent examples is the push for green gaming. However, the movement has not successfully taken off. Academically, the term “green gaming” is being used interchangeably between other terms such as “ecological games,” or “ecogames.” The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to systematically examine the question of what is green gaming? Searching from Web of Science, Google Scholar, and other sources, the author have found 50 eligible documents of various types such as books, articles, doctoral theses. Systematic review of these documents highlights a sparse and understudied nature of the topic video games and environments. Moreover, there is also a lack of clear definition and distinction between various terminologies, which leads to the abovementioned interchanged use of different terminologies in both academic and public writings. In conclusion, the study suggests the term “green gaming” should be understood as an aspect of the green consumption movement.",

          "authors": "Conor Houghton",
          "abstract": "Cedric Boeckx’s monograph 'Reflections on language evolution: From minimalism to pluralism' is an entertaining and useful introduction to recent advances in biological approaches to the evolutionary origin of our language ability. It can be read as a reminder of the need for more tolerance and diversity in our approach to linguistic research. However, its central thesis is more ambitious and controversial than this: it seeks to reformulate the field by suggesting that linguistics should be centred on the problem of how our language ability evolved. It also promotes the belief that this language ability is best studied as a collection of individual skills and it suggests that the method best suited to this problem is the use of paleo-genetic evidence. This review highlights this interpretation of the monograph and offers a critique of this perspective by suggesting that the structure and cognitive properties of language should remain our focus.

          "abstract": "It has been suggested that tactical breathing may reduce acute stress for police officers and thus lead to more optimal performance in critical situations. We tested the effect of a brief intervention on task performance in a simulated training scenario. Ninety-six advanced police students participated in a preregistered between-group experiment during a simulated training scenario. Expert observers evaluated performance, and participants reported their level of stress. The results showed that stress was associated with lower performance. The participants that used tactical breathing performed better than the control group, while it did not change their self-reported stress. This could indicate that tactical breathing improves performance by increasing focus and attention.",

          "authors": "Taym Alsalti; Jamie Cummins; Ruben C. Arslan",
          "abstract": "Careless responding is defined as a pattern of responding to survey items that reflects a latent construct distinct from—and disruptive of—the measurement of the primary construct of interest. In the social science literature, these response patterns are sometimes labeled “insufficient effort,” “unserious,” or “bogus, among other terms.”The issue of such responses has been gaining in relevance as research data are increasingly collected through anonymous online surveys. Standard practice calls for identifying careless responders and excluding them from the data. The common reasoning behind this approach is that such responses can bias “descriptive” statistics (e.g., sample means) and effect size estimates / measures of associations (e.g., correlations and  standardised mean difference) as well as increase measurement error. When they confound our causal effect of interest, deleting or adjusting for careless responses is justified. However, using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that different careless responding patterns can plausibly take on the role of a mediator, a collider, or both simultaneously, among others. Given this, we argue that, in contrast to previous calls, there cannot be a general rule about how to deal with careless responses and that greater attention to their data-generating mechanism from a causal perspective is necessary.",

          "abstract": "Fluency theory assumes that perceived truth is influenced by the subjective ease with which presented information is processed. Several studies have demonstrated that increased perceptual fluency, induced by high versus low color contrast of presented statements, results in higher truth judgments. According to the discrepancy-attribution hypothesis, the unexpected switch from several low-fluency stimuli to a high-fluency stimulus is assumed to enhance perceived truthfulness. In two online studies (one preregistered), we aimed to replicate the central finding by Hansen, Dechêne, and Wänke (2008; Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) that discrepancies in color contrast influence truth judgments. Additionally, we extended the original design by varying the length of stimulus blocks presented in low or high color contrast. Contrary to previous findings, neither the level of perceptual fluency nor unexpected discrepancies in fluency affected truth judgments even though high-contrast statements were read faster than low-contrast ones, indicating that processing fluency was successfully manipulated. A meta-analysis combining our two experiments with published studies shows that the effect of perceptual fluency induced by color contrast on truth judgments may not be as robust as previously thought.",

          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "abstract": "Facial mimicry is known to play an important role in emotional communication. While major models of facial mimicry assume a relationship between facial mimicry and emotion recognition, the empirical evidence for such a relationship is mixed. In this study, the facial movements of the same participants were compared when they recognized the same uncertain faces as “happiness” or “anger.” When faces were expressing anger in the upper half (upper anger) and happiness in the lower half (lower happiness), participants responded that it is “happiness” in some trials and “anger” in others. The electromyography data showed that the participants frowned more when they recognized anger in the upper anger and lower happiness faces than when they recognized happiness in the same face (Experiment 1). By presenting the upper and lower half of expression individually, we confirmed that upper anger and lower happiness were both salient in the expression intensity and that both the upper and lower half of the faces were individually inducing congruent facial movements (Experiment 2). Though there were limitations including the relatively small sample size, this study revealed a relationship between facial mimicry and emotion recognition at a within-individual level. These findings aid in further understanding social interaction at an unconscious and physical level.",

          "abstract": "While generative artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to technological advances in the mental health field, it poses safety risks for mental health service consumers. Furthermore, clinicians and healthcare systems must attend to safety and ethical considerations prior to deploying these AI-mental health technologies. To ensure the responsible deployment of AI-mental health applications, a principled method for evaluating and reporting on AI-mental health applications is needed. We conducted a narrative review of existing frameworks and criteria (from the mental health, healthcare, and AI fields) relevant to the evaluation of AI-mental health applications. We provide a summary and analysis of these frameworks, with a particular emphasis on the unique needs of the AI-mental health intersection. Existing frameworks contain areas of convergence (e.g., frequent emphasis on safety, privacy/confidentiality, effectiveness, and equity) that are relevant to the evaluation of AI-mental health applications. However, current frameworks are insufficiently tailored to unique considerations for AI and mental health. To address this need, we introduce the Readiness Evaluation for AI-Mental Health Deployment and Implementation (READI) framework for mental health applications. The READI framework comprises considerations of Safety, Privacy/Confidentiality, Equity, Effectiveness, Engagement, and Implementation. The READI framework outlines key criteria for assessing the readiness of AI-mental health applications for clinical deployment, offering a structured approach for evaluating these technologies and reporting findings.",

Several recent studies suggest that two phonological universals, the Obligatory Contour Principle and the Tonal Markedness Scale, may constrain the L2 acquisition of Mandarin lexical tones, regardless of learners' first language. We assessed the role of these universals in L2 tonal acquisition with a perceptual testing protocol, which implemented a number of methodological and analytical improvements relatively to previous studies: larger sample sizes, better matched stimuli, and the use of Bayesian statistics to assess support for the null hypothesis. The results provided evidence for the null effects of both phonological universals. Instead, a clear determinant of tonal identification accuracy was participants' pitch acuity, suggesting that domain-general auditory processing underlies the learning of L2 phonological categories.

We designed three learning activities, including a passive reading activity, an active recall activity, and a generative activity. Children (N = 106, 9-14 years) used PROMPT for 27 days to memorize one plan per day, alternating between these activities. Unexpectedly, neither the active recall activity nor the generative activity was associated with better overall recall than the passive activity. Only children who spent more time on these activities benefited from them, which in turn was predicted by children’s grade level and analogical reasoning ability. Our findings suggest that it depends on children’s prerequisites how effectively they are able or willing to engage in more cognitively demanding learning activities.",

          "abstract": "Disorders of decreased sound tolerance such as misophonia and hyperacusis cause significant distress through strong negative emotional and physiological reactions to everyday sounds. These conditions have been associated with poor mental and physical health as they impact day to day life. Prior to the recent development of consensus definitions of misophonia and hyperacusis, attempts to determine the prevalence of these conditions have been hindered by the ambiguity and inconsistency of their descriptions. Despite this, certain populations have been suggested to more frequently experience misophonia and hyperacusis, namely younger people and autistic people. Furthermore, there has been conflicting evidence regarding whether these conditions are more prevalent among women. Post-secondary campuses are often sensory-rich. As such, students with misophonia and hyperacusis are likely to experience distress. For this reason, we sought to investigate the prevalence of misophonia and hyperacusis in a Canadian university sample, and explore the relations between these conditions and gender, autistic traits, and overall social competence. As exposure to many everyday sounds can be highly aversive for individuals with misophonia and/or hyperacusis, these individuals often attempt to avoid environments in which distressing sounds are encountered. It is therefore possible that poorer social competence may be a secondary effect of these conditions. To investigate these relations, 2080 students completed an online survey using multiple established self-report measures of decreased sound tolerance. Clinical misophonia was detected in 12 – 18% of participants, and hyperacusis in 6-17%. Both conditions were significantly more prevalent among women than men. Both conditions were found to be weakly to moderately positively correlated with autistic traits, and weakly to moderately negatively correlated with social competence. These results highlight decreased sound tolerance as a significant issue at Canadian post-secondary institutions, calling for steps to be taken to mitigate its effects.",

Generally, the average effects of personality traits in young adulthood and the additive effects of impulsigenic traits and cognition in late childhood demonstrate the utility of integrating personality and cognition to understand incidence of early onset EXT. Although interaction effects were detected, they were small and practically negligible in their explanation of variance in externalizing behaviors.

Text analyses were conducted on 45,225,895 Reddit comments from 2,451,289 users and 889,402 news headlines from four news sources. Results revealed significant shifts in language related to self-focus (e.g., first-person singular pronouns), collective-focus (e.g., first-person plural pronouns), negative emotion (anxiety and anger words), and engagement (e.g., discussion of upheaval-related topics) after each event. Language analyses revealed how social justice-related upheavals (BLM, Roe v. Wade) affected people in very different ways emotionally than those that affected them personally (COVID). The onset of COVID made people increasingly anxious and caused them to turn inward to focus on their personal situations. However, BLM and the overturning of Roe v. Wade aroused anger and action as people looked beyond themselves to address these issues. Analysis of upheaval-related discussions captured the public’s sustained interest in BLM and COVID, whereas interest in Roe v. Wade declined relatively quickly. Shifts in discussions also showed how events interacted as people tended to focus on only one national event at a time, with interest in other events dampening when a new event occurred. The findings underscore the dynamic nature of culturally shared events that are apparent in everyday online language use.",

However, the effects of tACS are rather inconsistent and difficult to replicate. In this study, we seek to modulate alpha oscillations and further research on identifying the optimal conditions for observing reliable tACS-induced changes. Specifically, we investigated the effects of 10 Hz stimulation on alpha oscillations compared to 41 Hz stimulation in a within-subject experimental design. We chose a montage with the anode and cathodes spaced farther apart to generate stronger electric fields at the expense of focality. Participants performed an oddball version of the standard vigilance task with a lateralized bias in motor responses, which is likely to engage alpha oscillations as they are thought to play a role in inhibitory control and lateralized attention management. Our findings revealed that the difference in alpha power enhancement between alpha and gamma stimulation was higher for the contralateral electrodes than the ipsilateral ones. This lateralized effect emerged despite our non-lateralized tACS electrode positioning, suggesting it may be due to the lateralized inhibitory motor planning involved in the task. Our results indicate that the effects of tACS on alpha oscillations are task-specific. Consequently, tACS researchers may opt for stronger electric fields, even at the cost of focality, as tasks could help direct tACS effects to specific brain areas.",

          "abstract": "Frontline caregivers, such as nurses, physicians, and intensive care personnel are at heightened risk of intrusive memories, a core symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder. Understanding these intrusions and contributing factors is crucial to protecting workers’ mental health and sustaining effective patient care. Emergency department (ED) staff (N = 331) were assessed prior to commencing work in the ED and followed up three and six months later. At baseline, participants provided data on demographics, prior trauma, cognitive and emotional processing, and memory-related genetic polymorphisms of the NR3C1, KIBRA, and ADRA2B genes. At follow-ups, we assessed intrusion occurrence, frequency, intensity, related distress, and content. We examined the predictive value of baseline features for later intrusive memories and investigated whether experiencing intrusions moderated changes in mental health from baseline to 3 and 6 months. Over one third of participants reported intrusions, mostly thoughts related to possible errors in treating a patient. Being a carrier of the G allele of the BCL1 polymorphism of the NR3C1 gene and ruminating were most strongly associated with intrusions at three months, while higher scores in cognitive flexibility, emotional suppression, emotion-focused positive rumination and older age were protective. All participants showed increases in anxiety and those experiencing intrusions reported significantly lower work performance and engagement. Intrusive memories are prevalent among healthcare personnel and associated with detriments to professional functioning and engagement. G allele carriers of BCL1 and individuals who tend to ruminate more may be at greater risk of developing intrusions, whereas more flexible cognitive and emotional processing was protective. Our results underline the psychological cost of high-stakes ED environments, where emotional and cognitive demands are substantial, and point to actionable avenues for prevention and early intervention. These may include systematic improvements to hospital error culture and training to boost emotion regulation skills, benefitting healthcare staff and ultimately patients.",

          "authors": "Jasmin Breitwieser; Garvin Brod; Lars-Erik Malmberg",
          "abstract": "We postulate a model of how students' motivational appraisals (expectancy, value, cost) before learning influence their observable engagement during learning and subsequent subjective perceptions of engagement after learning. The key hypothesis than can be derived from the model is that observable engagement during learning explains the relationships between motivational appraisals and perceived engagement at an intra-individual level. For an initial test of this model, we used log data from a mobile learning app that 189 fifth-graders (mean age 10.82 years) used to learn vocabulary, along with daily questionnaires over five weeks. In partial support of the model, expectancy and value appraisals explained unique variance in observable engagement, which in turn explained day-to-day variation in reported satisfaction and task delay. However, perceived effort was not related to observable engagement, and the associations between self-reports and observable engagement were generally rather weak. In sum, the model provides a promising platform for understanding the interplay between motivational appraisals, observable engagement and its subjective perception, which should be a key objective of motivation research.",

          "authors": "Hunter Ball; Philip Peper",
          "abstract": "Research in the retrospective memory domain has shown that individuals encode information less effortfully when expecting a reminder system (i.e., external store) to be available at test. Critically, this expectation leads to worse memory performance when the reminder is unexpectedly removed. The current study examined whether these findings extend to prospective memory (PM) intentions, which are thought to maintain a privileged status in memory and therefore may be less sensitive to expectancy effects. Participants formed the intention to make a special PM response to target items across four ongoing task blocks. Study duration (Exp. 1 and 3), pupil size (Exp. 2), and self-report (Exp. 1-3) indexed encoding effort while learning these targets. Participants had reminders available across the first three blocks (i.e., targets listed at the top of the screen), but not on the fourth. Critically, only one condition was informed that they would not have a reminder prior to encoding targets in the fourth block. Results showed that expecting a reminder lowered objective (Exp. 1 and 3) and subjective (Exp. 1-3) encoding effort and reduced unaided PM retrieval (Exp. 1-3) in the fourth block, independent of memory load (Exp. 3). Objective (Exp. 1 and 3) and subjective (Exp. 1-3) effort also partially mediated the influence of expectations on unaided PM retrieval. These findings suggest PM and retrospective memory encoding operate similarly and that participants can alter learning to more effectively commit PM targets to memory when reminders are not expected.",

The purpose of the current study was to better understand the mechanisms by which participants choose to offload prospective memory demands. Participants formed the intention to later respond to either one (low load) or four (high load) prospective memory targets with or without the use of reminders. During reminder trials, participants could press the “reminder” key to be shown the learned targets in a “lookup table”. The frequency of reminder checking was used to index the willingness to rely on external sources to support remembering. The utility of reminder checking was manipulated by varying the number of distractors presented in the lookup table (Experiment 1), implementing a time penalty for checking the table (Experiment 2), and explicitly describing the effectiveness of using reminders (Experiment 3). The results consistently showed that participants checked reminders more frequently under high memory load (i.e., 4 targets). Moreover, participants checked reminders less frequently when the costs associated with doing so increased (Experiments 2 and 3). However, confidence in one’s own memory ability was not associated with checking frequency. These findings suggest that participants choose to offload, at least in part, to reduce the time or effort to complete the task.",

What motivates people to share high-quality news and how can these motives be leveraged to promote news sharing? Based on the theory that self-related and social motives encourage sharing behavior, we designed and tested interventions to increase news sharing. In the interventions, individuals were exposed to actual news stories and were prompted to identify why the content was relevant to themselves (self-relevance) or people they know (social relevance). Across four studies (Nparticipants = 2,559, Nobservations = 18,780), we systematically examined the effectiveness of these interventions, their generalizability across news topics (climate change and health) and cultures (the United States of America and the Netherlands), their translation to more naturalistic contexts, and their underlying neuropsychological mechanisms. In all studies, we observed expected positive correlations among perceived self and social relevance and sharing intentions. In a neuroimaging study, we also observed corresponding increases in activity in self-referential and social cognitive brain regions. Using the content-framing interventions to test causal relationships, we found that the interventions increased sharing intentions and behavior. Furthermore, we observed generalizability across news topics and cultural contexts and translation to an ecologically valid news exposure context. These findings advance theory by adding neural and behavioral evidence that self-related and social motives prompt people to share information, and demonstrate the ability of content-framing interventions to harness these motives to encourage high-quality news sharing.",

The initial paper presents the methodological foundation for the Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics, with subsequent papers focusing on clinical populations. Our method aims to elucidate personal idiolectic connections, providing a deeper understanding of the semantic landscape within and between individuals. This study analyzed group-level differences in the text of forum posts on a popular social media site and individual-level idiolect comparisons in OCD populations compared to more general population. Our results demonstrate significant differences in the semantic associations with the word \"attract\" between OCD users and general users. Specifically, OCD users exhibited more varied and less consistent associations, reflecting the diverse nature of their obsessions and compulsions, while general users showed more stable and uniform associations. Additionally, group-level comparisons between art and programming subgroups revealed significant differences in semantic distances in associations with the word “abstract,” indicating distinct word usage patterns across communities. These findings highlight the potential of Idiolectic Models for Diagnostics in uncovering meaningful differences in semantic relationships within clinical populations and online communities, both at group- and individual-level.",

However, conducting group-based comparisons and showcasing ethno-racial heterogeneity remains a complex challenge. To highlight critical approaches informed by the QuantCrit framework, our review describes the importance of using alternative operationalizations of ethno-racial categories, effect coding, and person-centered analysis.

          "authors": "Fabian Schlotterbeck; Sonia Ramotowska; Leendert van Maanen; Jakub Szymanik",
          "abstract": "The polarity effect is one of the most robust effects in linguistics: Negative expressions are processed slower than corresponding positive ones. Decades of research has shown that this effect replicates for different types of negative expressions, however, its magnitude varies depending on the expression type. It has been argued that in addition to polarity, the downward monotonicity increases the cost of processing negative expressions. In this paper, we use computational modeling of data from a sentence-picture verification task to investigate the sources of the polarity effect by contrasting quantifiers ('more than half' vs. 'fewer than half') that differ in polarity and monotonicity with adjectives ('a large proportion' vs. 'a small proportion') that only differ in polarity.  We collected reaction times and response data in two web-based sentence-picture verification task experiments. Our reaction time analysis showed a larger polarity effect for quantifiers than adjectives, thus replicating a previously observed non cross-over interaction between polarity and expression type. In order to interpret this interaction with respect to semantic properties of these expressions, we fit scalinDDM, a modified version of the Diffusion Decision Model to the data.  We showed that the drift rate and non-decision time parameters were affected by polarity and that the effect on drift rate was larger for quantifiers than adjectives. This finding suggests that there is no exclusive mapping between semantic properties and the model's parameters. Nevertheless, our results show that the computational model enhances transparency between linguistic properties and the dependent variables in a sentence-picture verification experiment.",

          "authors": "Lisa Harms; Tugce Varol; Gido Metz",
          "abstract": "In Intervention Mapping (IM) Step 6, evaluation takes place. In earlier IM steps, a planning group will have developed logic models to understand the health problem, and logic models of change on which the intervention is based. These logic models provide input for evaluators to develop evaluation questions. In terms of evaluation designs, there is a general distinction between effect evaluation and process evaluation. In effect evaluation, researchers determine whether the intervention is associated with changes in health, behavioral, or environmental outcomes, determinants, or performance objectives. Effect evaluation can be described as either efficacy or effectiveness. Efficacy refers to a program that is evaluated under controlled conditions, such as with motivated volunteers who participate in the program regardless of the time and effort required. Effectiveness refers to a program evaluated under real-world conditions, for example, with representatives of the at-risk group. Process evaluation seeks to describe how a program is implemented. Relevant questions related to process evaluation include whether an intervention was implemented as intended, for example in terms of adherence, whether contextual factors affected implementation, what hindered or facilitated implementation, and the extent to which the intended audience was satisfied with the intervention. In addition, process evaluation allows for critical reflection on intervention design and helps determine whether the success or failure of an intervention is due to the intervention itself or the way it was implemented or applied (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016; Stutterheim et al., 2023).\n\nThe evaluation design determines how confidently an evaluator can assess indicator changes and attribute them to the program. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are referred to as the gold standard of effect evaluation due to its rigor and ability to make causal inferences. RCTs require the selection of primary outcomes, careful randomization, and no changes in the content of the intervention or how it is delivered (Houle, 2015). This unfortunately misaligns with interventions in real-life settings that are already widely available, which limit randomization and control (Koelen et al., 2001). Moreover, the lengthy process of the RCT hinders evaluation of interventions that need to be developed and delivered quickly, for example because of a pandemic. Over the years, alternative research methods have become increasingly viable options (Bonten et al., 2020; Skivington et al., 2021). For example, in the Dutch and British frameworks for evaluation and recognition of interventions, qualitative and mixed research methods are now deemed valuable besides RCTs in ascertaining intervention effectiveness (Dutch Partnership for Recognition of Interventions, 2018; Skivington et al., 2021).\n\nThe aim of this paper is not to discredit the RCT as a means of evaluating interventions. Rather, it aims to draw attention to the challenges and complexity of evaluating public health interventions in a real-world context. By presenting three cases of studies that, in their own way, addressed the challenges of the use of the RCT, we hope to contribute to the search for meaningful ways of evaluation.",

          "abstract": "Background: Students’ achievement emotions profoundly influence their learning, academic performance, well-being, and educational trajectories. Understanding how students regulate these emotions is crucial for their academic flourishing.\nAims: We examined students’ strategies for regulating three common achievement emotions (enjoyment, anxiety, boredom), and how these strategies relate to emotions, academic well-being, health problems, and achievement-related outcomes.\nTheoretical Framework: Our theoretical model of emotion regulation strategies is derived from the control-value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2006) and Harley et al.’s (2019) model of emotion regulation in achievement settings. It considers six groups of strategies: situation selection, social support, reappraisal, expression, suppression, and competence development. \nSamples: Participants included 350 (Study 1; Germany), 359 (Study 2; England), and 200 (Study 3; Germany) university students.\nMethods: Studies 1 and 2 were cross-sectional. Study 3 employed a five-wave prospective design and focused on course-specific achievement emotion regulation over one semester. We used a newly developed context- and emotion-specific measure of the six strategies targeting enjoyment, anxiety, and boredom (Regulation of Achievement Emotions Questionnaire, RAEQ).  \nResults: Strategies were linked to students’ emotions, well-being, health, and academic achievement (perceived success, Studies 1 and 2; end-of-semester test scores, Study 3) across all three studies. Furthermore, achievement emotion regulation strategies were related to, but distinct from, general emotion regulation strategies.\nConclusions: Findings highlight the importance of students’ regulation of both positive and negative emotions, suggest that emotion regulation is context-specific, and imply that reappraisal and competence development are especially adaptive. We discuss implications for educational practice and future research.",

          "abstract": "Addressing climate change requires substantial shifts in individual behavior. Providing information about climate externalities through carbon labels is a promising tool to foster sustainable choices when individuals weigh environmental against personal outcomes. We study the impact of carbon labels and their underlying mechanisms in a repeated risky choice task. We ran two preregistered experiments (US samples, N = 1268) with realized carbon and monetary payoffs, examining how choice is influenced by the timing of carbon information (One-off vs. Recurring) and participants’ political preference (i.e., Democrat or Republican voters). In Study 1, we find that both Democrats and Republicans reduce carbon emissions when carbon labels were provided. Further, recurring labels significantly reduced carbon choices compared to one-off labels. Study 2 replicated the results in a within-participant design and showed that the impact of recurring carbon labels on sustainable choices cannot be explained by the strength of emission recall. This suggests that recurring labels amplify the importance given to the climate attribute in the decision process,operating via attentional rather than informational mechanisms. Our results emphasize the importance of providing climate externality information at time of use to raise awareness about climate costs and bolster sustainable preferences across population segments.",

          "abstract": "Parents are the first to indicate concerns about their child’s development in up to 80% of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). They often notice symptoms related to ASD around the first two years, but the average age of diagnosis is 3.5 years old. This study examined the relationships between parents’ early concerns and the time lag between suspicion and diagnosis. Forty-eight Spanish-speaking families were enrolled in this study. Parents were asked about early signs that made them think that their child could possibly have ASD. Mediation analyses showed that the child’s age at suspicion mediated between sibling status and the time lag between suspicion and a formal diagnosis. Having another child with typical development accelerated parents’ detection of ASD signs. The number of social-communication concerns that parents detected mediated this relationship. Parents who reported more social-communication concerns perceived these signs earlier, but have to cope with a longer time lag until diagnosis than those who reported more concerns related to restrictive and repetitive behaviors and interests, or other developmental concerns. Moreover, this relationship between concerns of ASD and the diagnoses was explained by the child’s age. Training pediatricians on how to respond to parent questions and concerns could reduce the time lag between parents’ concerns and diagnosis of ASD.",

          "authors": "Natalie Bleijlevens; Tanya Behne",
          "abstract": "Do mono- and bilingual children differ in the way they learn novel words in ambiguous settings? Listeners may resolve referential ambiguity by assuming that novel words refer to unknown, rather than known, objects –a response known as the mutual exclusivity effect. Past research suggested that mono- and bilinguals differ with regard to this disambiguation strategy, perhaps because, across languages, bilinguals’ experience contradicts one-to-one mappings of label and referent. Another line of research suggested a bilingual advantage in resolving referential ambiguity, based on bilinguals’ advanced pragmatic skills. Here, we examine both these claims in a preregistered study with comparable samples of mono- and bilingual 3-year-olds (n=74) and adults (n=86). We tested referent disambiguation and retention in two tasks: In the Mutual-Exclusivity task, a speaker used a novel label in the presence of a known and an unknown object. In the Pragmatic task, she used another novel label in the presence of two unknown objects and participants could infer from the pragmatic context that the speaker referred to the object that was new in their discourse. Mono- and bilinguals were equally successful in inferring the correct label-referent links in both tasks and retained them after a delay. These findings indicate that children with different language backgrounds can develop the same strategies and pragmatic skills to learn novel words. Children can use their lexical knowledge and socio-cognitive skills to infer the meanings of novel words, irrespective of whether they are acquiring one or more languages.",

          "abstract": "Humans typically move and vocalize in a time-synchronized fashion, aligning prominence-lending hand movements to acoustically emphasized syllables. This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

In this prospective study, we examined the extent to which infant vocalizations at 14 months would predict Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) diagnostic symptom groups, i.e., Autism,\nSpectrum, and Non-ASD, for 82 community-identified at-risk infants at 23 months. Thirty minute video samples were coded with the intention to categorize and quantify speech (canonical/non-canonical and directed/non-directed) and non-speech vocalizations (atypical, distress, and pleasure vocalizations). Our results revealed that more canonical directed (OR=1.039, p=.036), and fewer non-canonical directed (OR=.607, p=.002) and non-canonical non-directed (OR=1.200, p=.049) vocalizations were associated with a greater likelihood of being in the Non-ASD group versus the Autism group, with no variables significantly predicting Autism versus Spectrum group membership. Despite some statistically significant findings, models performed poorly in classifying children into correct ASD symptom group at age 23 months based on vocalizations at 14 months. Thus, the utility of infant vocalizations alone for predicting toddler clinical outcomes among infants initially identified at an elevated risk for ASD appears limited; however, considering the structure and function of early vocalizations combined with other early developmental and behavioral features may improve the confidence for clinicians in making an early diagnosis of ASD.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has produced mixed results regarding the ability of children as young as four years of age to engage in counterfactual reasoning. In this study, we employed a visual world eye-tracking paradigm to examine how children and adults process counterfactuals. Specifically, we investigated their ability to incrementally integrate the morphosyntactic cues of counterfactual constructions in Turkish, a language that encodes counterfactual meaning through concatenated verbal suffixes. Our findings revealed that both adults and children directed their attention to the target referent upon hearing the verb conjugation of the antecedent in counterfactual sentences. This result suggests that children as young as four years old can incrementally interpret counterfactual conditionals using morphosyntactic markers, much like adults. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that morphosyntactic markers on verbs can trigger complex inferences, such as the generation of hypothetical alternative worlds for counterfactual reasoning, not only in adults but also in very young children.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Nicolas Thomas Vogel; Justine Stang-Rabrig; Nele McElvany",
          "abstract": "A main goal of primary school is teaching students to be successful readers. However, reading literacy is influenced by a variety of sociodemographic background variables and, beyond these individual-level effects, the sociodemographic classroom composition. Teachers’ instruction has been proposed as one important mediator of these associations in theoretical models, but its role as a mediator of classroom-level and more importantly moderator of individual-level effects, has not been conclusively studied. Moreover, different confounded sociodemographic background variables have often been conflated in the extant literature. Therefore, we analyzed the role of central sociodemographic background variables (socioeconomic risk, language minority, first-generation immigrant) for core indicators of reading literacy (reading competence, reading enjoyment, reading self-concept) on the individual and classroom level, as well as the mediating and moderating role of instructional focus (reading-related support, support of language-minority students, cognitive activation). Multilevel structural equation models based on German PIRLS 2021 data (N = 3414 fourth-grade students, 195 classrooms) revealed negative associations of individual socioeconomic risk and language minority status with aspects of reading literacy, but motivational advantages among first-generation immigrant students. Negative classroom effects were found for socioeconomic and immigrant composition, positive classroom effects on self-concepts for share of language minority students. Instructional focus did not significantly mediate or moderate these associations. The results emphasize that especially socioeconomic risk threatens reading literacy on the individual and classroom level and suggest that while teachers adapt their instructional focus based on classroom composition, this in turn does not mediate or moderate associations on either level.",

          "abstract": "Pragmatic inferences are based on assumptions about how speakers communicate: speakers are taken to be cooperative and rational; they consider alternatives and make intentional choices to produce maximally informative utterances. In principle, this analysis applies to linguistic but also non-linguistic communicative actions, but this prediction is typically only tested in children and not in more systematic implicature contexts. We test key implications of this view across six online experiments with American English speaking adults (total N = 231). Experiments 1a and 1b showed that participants made pragmatic inferences based on different types of communicative actions, some being non-linguistic. In Experiment 2, pragmatic inferences were found to be conditional on the speaker’s epistemic states. Finally, Experiments 3a to 3c showed that pragmatic inferences were more likely to be made when the communicative action was produced intentionally. Taken together, these results strengthen the view that pragmatics includes social inference about cooperative communication over intentional actions, even non-linguistic actions.",

          "abstract": "Until now, leadership has mostly been considered a unidirectional process centered on leaders influencing their followers. However, more recent theoretical developments indicate that leadership is a dynamic team process, valuing the contributions of leaders and followers alike. In this pre-registered study, we investigate the reciprocal interplay between shared leadership and formal team leadership (i.e., empowering leadership). We assume that leaders generally interpret their team’s shared leadership as an investment to reach for common goals. Accordingly, their team’s effort should improve leader trust in the team, which in turn should increase empowering leadership behavior of the leader. Further, we propose that this indirect relationship is first-stage moderated by leader self-efficacy. We invited 721 team members and their leaders nested in 169 teams to join a three-wave longitudinal study. Results from Bayesian cross-lagged panel modeling support our predicted mediation effect while also showing the established reverse effect of empowering leadership on shared leadership. The moderation effect was not supported. This study provides insights into the dynamic and reciprocal interplay between shared and formal leadership. Our findings underline that formal leaders do not perceive shared leadership as a threat but instead value the team’s effort reflected in higher trust and decision latitude.",

The short-micro-moving images have emerged as one of the predominant forms of contemporary audiovisual expression. The key characteristics of traditional cinema have been redefined, leading to a “relocation” of cinema and the cinematic experience—reactivated and reproposed elsewhere than the place in which it was formed, with alternate devices (such as mobile digital devices) and in new environments (such as the peripersonal space). This new form of experience is characterized by two distinct features. Firstly, the short-micro-moving images, by virtue of being presented within peripersonal space, become within-reach. Secondly, the short-micro-moving images, displayed on touchscreens, permit a dual haptic experience. On this basis, a new metaphor regarding screens is proposed—the “skin-screen”. The trajectory of the cinematic experience traces a multi-directional “topography of post-cinema”, aiming to provide a clearer delineation of the “state of post-cinema” and to facilitate more pertinent philosophical reflection.",

Recent research highlights the importance of contextual factors in moderating mindset’s impact on student outcomes. The commonly-used original mindset measure is context-general. Recently, a mindset measure that is specific to science and math undergraduates was developed: the Undergraduate Lay Theories of Abilities (ULTrA) Survey. I hypothesized that a context-specific measure of mindset would associate more strongly with undergraduates’ outcomes than a context-general measure. I surveyed 1,537 undergraduates with the shortened original mindset measure, ULTrA, and measures of outcomes (sense of belonging, goal orientation, self-handicapping, evaluative concern and intent to persist in science) and collected course grades. Structural equation modeling indicated that the fixed dimension of the ULTrA exhibited stronger and more consistent relationships with outcomes than the shortened original mindset measure and predicted unique variance in outcomes above and beyond what the original mindset measure accounted for. The academic outcomes (intent to persist and course grade) were significantly related to ULTrA, but not the original mindset measure. Our results provide evidence that the context-specific ULTrA survey can detect relationships with undergraduate outcomes that the context-general original mindset measure can fail to detect.",

Using natural language processing (NLP), we find that civil rights has become a more common but also a more polarized policy area. Polarization between Democrats and Republicans accelerated during the early 1990s and the mid-2010s. The latter acceleration coincided with the rise of the “Black Lives Matter” movement, and it was driven by a surge of legislative support for civil rights among racial minority Democrats. Content analyses show that civil rights legislation supporting racial minorities, women and the LGBTQ+ community has polarized most, while legislation supporting the elderly and disabled has declined in both parties. Our findings offer new insights into party polarization, race and ethnicity politics, and collective action tipping points. We showcase NLP as a valuable method for studying the changing behavior of political elites.",

The theory unifies four key findings in the literature while predicting a testable edge case for the illusory truth effect: when a source is likely to convey falsehoods.

In fact, a majority of participants in the low-quality condition do not demonstrate any illusory truth effect. We identify the deployment of an alternative strategy in the low-quality condition where participants decrease their belief given repetition.

Study 2 demonstrated that both Asian and Black Americans who worked hybrid reported less interpersonal conflict and stress but more positive affect and control when they worked remotely than when in the office. Studies 3-5 examined how Asian Americans make meaning out of these pandemic circumstances. In the studies, learning about Asian Americans’ discrimination experiences during the pandemic promoted attitudes and policy preferences for reducing discrimination for all marginalized groups.

Using a combination of gold-standard interviews including a contextual threat interview for assessing stress exposure and timeline followback procedures to assess suicide-related outcomes, we examined how fluctuations in severity of different types of life stressors are temporally associated with same-day and next-day likelihood of SI and SB over the course of 16 months in 143 young adults (Mage = 25.27, SD = 4.65) with recent SI or SB. Results demonstrated that daily within-person increases in interpersonal stressors, relative to an individual’s average levels, predicted higher odds of same-day and next-day SI and SB, even after controlling for daily non-interpersonal stressors, drug and alcohol use, and non-suicidal self-injury. Additionally, we observed stronger effects of social rejection and targeted rejection stressors on the proximal likelihood of SI, but no significant differences in the magnitude of effects of different types of stressors on SB. Results suggest that interpersonal stressors, particularly social rejection, are proximal risk factors for SI and SB. Findings suggest that clinicians should assess recent social rejection when assessing for acute risk, and suicide prevention strategies should target responses to interpersonal stress and stabilizing social relationships.",

          "abstract": "Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show significant linguistic and motor impairments compared to children with typical development (TD). Findings from studies of siblings of children with ASD show similarities to conclusions from studies of children with ASD. The current meta-analysis reviewed studies reporting linguistic and/or motor skills in siblings of children with ASD compared to siblings of children with TD. Thirty-four studies published between 1994 and 2016 met all inclusion criteria. We compared three different age groups (12 months or younger, 13 to 24 months, and 25 to 36 months). At 12 months, compared to siblings of children with TD, siblings of children with ASD had worse receptive language (d52.43, 95% CI [2.53, 2.33]) and expressive language skills (d52.40, 95% CI [2.57, 2.23]), and these effects were sustained at 24 and 36 months. Similar, albeit smaller differences in fine motor skills were detected at 12 months (d52.22, 95% CI [2.39, 2.04]), and these differences were larger at 36 months (d52.36, 95% CI [2.54, 2.17]). There were differences in gross motor skills at 12 months (d52.22, 95% CI [2.40, 2.04]), but only a few studies were available at later ages. Compared to siblings of children with TD, infants who have siblings with ASD have worse linguistic and motor skills. These differences are detectable as early as when infants are 12 months old and seem to be sustained until they are 3 years old. Differences in language skills are larger than those in motor skills, especially during the first year.",

          "abstract": "From boardrooms and brown bags, to emails and earnings calls, business culture often seems overrun by “corporate bullshit,” a type of semantically empty or otherwise vague rhetoric that leverages abstruse corporate buzzwords and jargon in a way that misrepresents or obscures some aspect of organizational reality. Though corporate bullshit may sometimes seem harmless, it can disrupt organizational and employee effectiveness in numerous ways including obstructing effective communication, increasing employee disengagement, tarnishing company reputation, and exposing businesses to legitimate financial and legal risks. Here, results from three studies (N = 745) report the construction and validation of the Corporate Bullshit Receptivity Scale (CBSR), a novel measure of individual differences in receptivity to corporate bullshit. Results show that corporate bullshit receptivity is distinct from a general affinity for corporate speech. Moreover, it is significantly associated with measures of analytic thinking and other bullshit-related constructs in theoretically-consistent ways. Importantly, corporate bullshit receptivity is strongly associated with several measures of organizational culture and job performance and is a strong, robust predictor of work-related decision-making. Overall, the findings establish the CBSR as a valid and reliable tool to aid researchers in examining the causes, correlates, and consequences of bullshit in the workplace.",

We hypothesized that individuals living in areas with greater proportions of out-partisans would report lower levels of affective polarization. In Study 1, 2016 American National Election Study respondents (N = 3,378) living in counties with more out-partisans averaged lower levels of party-directed affective polarization, controlling for partisan, policy, and demographic factors. In Study 2 (N = 362 via Prolific), similar analyses revealed that American partisans with more out-partisans in their counties and precincts reported lower levels of social distance from out-party members and greater cross-party contact, but not significantly lower voter-directed affective polarization. Cross-party contact mediated the relationship between the percentage of out-partisans in a community and affective polarization, highlighting the intersection of place and psychology in understanding this societal challenge.",

This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using CloudResearch for gathering audio data. Specifically, as a test case, we sought to capture the perceptions of recently suicidal individuals about their future selves.\nMethods: We recruited participants (N = 167) with varying levels of suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors via CloudResearch. Participants were instructed to record responses to 15 prompts about their future selves using Vocaroo, a user-friendly online voice recording tool. Bonus payments were provided for high-quality recordings.\nResults: Of the participants who attempted the recording task, 98% (N = 164) successfully recorded and submitted their audio responses, demonstrating the feasibility of using CloudResearch for high-quality audio data collection. The recordings were substantive, with an average total duration of 15 minutes and 40 seconds (median: 14 minutes and 8 seconds).\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that CloudResearch can be effectively employed for audio data collection, enabling novel applications such as qualitative analysis and natural language processing. However, further refinement and consideration of identified limitations and areas for improvement are necessary to fully leverage the method's potential.",

Yet, extant findings from more than two decades of research testing this central theoretical premise have been surprisingly mixed. To account for this paradoxical disparity between theory and findings, we propose the Mindfulness Internal Attention (MIA) framework. We theorize and review initial findings suggesting that mindfulness training primarily targets internal attention processes which operate on internally generated or stored representations and experiences. Additionally, we theorize and review findings suggesting that mindfulness training affects executive functions and working memory processes shared between internal attention and late-stage external attention. In contrast, we theorize and review findings suggesting that mindfulness training does not affect early-stage external attention processes, which do not share cognitive resources with internal attention. Finally, we propose methodological innovations and outstanding questions for future research to advance understanding of the attentional mechanisms of mindfulness training.",

          "abstract": "Humans and non-human animals can anticipate future events to optimize behavior. However, environments are shaped by both externally and voluntarily initiated events. This study examined how voluntary actions influence temporal preparation for visual stimuli. Across four experiments, we compared reaction times (RTs) using variable and constant foreperiod (FP) paradigms. In each experiment, the target stimuli were triggered by voluntary actions or externally, with FPs ranging from 0.6 to 2.8 seconds. Participants performed a go/no-go task (Experiment 1) or an orientation discrimination task (Experiments 2–4). We observed slower RTs for action-triggered stimuli than external stimuli, particularly at shorter FPs, with this effect diminishing as the FPs lengthened. This pattern was observed only in variable FP paradigms, indicating an interaction of voluntary actions and FP variability. In contrast, the constant FP paradigms did not show significant differences. These findings suggest that voluntary actions influence temporal preparation under temporal uncertainty. We discuss these results in light of current theories of temporal preparation, proposing new perspectives on the role of voluntary actions in shaping anticipatory behavior.",

          "abstract": "Sick humans and other animals often withdraw from social interactions. It has been suggested that social withdrawal might enable avoidance of contagious individuals, but experimental evidence is lacking on how the state of sickness may affect perception of sick others. Here, we investigated if individuals were more likely to rate others as sick, while being sick themselves, compared to when healthy. Furthermore, we assessed if the intensity of the fever response and sickness behavior would predict changes in sickness detection. Thirty-four participants were experimentally made sick using an intravenous injection of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS condition; dose of 1.0 ng/kg body weight) and completed a sickness detection task during the peak of the inflammatory and sickness response. Participants performed the same task when they were healthy (control condition, n=32), in a randomized order before or after the main study day. In the sickness detection task, participants watched photos of individuals’ faces as well as video recordings of the same individuals walking, and rated the individual on each stimulus as sick or healthy. The photos and video recordings were obtained from twenty-two individuals who participated in a previous study, and who were made sick with an intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (2.0 ng/kg body weight) on one occasion, and remained healthy after an intravenous injection of a placebo (0.9% NaCl) on another occasion. Participants could detect sick individuals based on photos and walking patterns above chance level during both the LPS and the control condition. There was no significant difference in how often participants identified sick faces and sick walkers in the LPS condition – when they were sick themselves – compared to in the control condition. However, healthy walkers (but not healthy faces) were more often rated as sick by participants in the LPS condition compared to the control condition. Neither the fever response nor the intensity of sickness behavior predicted changes in sickness detection. The results do not indicate more accurate sickness detection in others during own sickness. Nevertheless, the data from walking patterns indicates that sick individuals may be more prone to categorize healthy individuals as sick. If replicated, this could in speculation be related to a need to reduce the risk of becoming infected while already fighting a pathogen.",

These claims are investigated from the perspective of linguistic pragmatics, particularly Grice's cooperative principle in communication. Following the pattern of real-life communication, turn-taking conversations reveal limitations in the LLM's grasp of the entire contextual setting described in the prompt. The prompts included ethical issues, a hiking adventure, geographical orientation and bodily movement. For cultural sensitivity the prompts came from a Pakistani Muslim in English language, from a Hindu in English, and from a Chinese in Chinese language. The issues were deeply cultural issues involving feelings and affects. Qualitative analysis of the conversation pragmatics showed that ChatGPT is often unable to conduct conversations according to the pragmatic principles of quantity, reliable quality, remaining in focus, and being clear in expression. We conclude that ChatGPT should not be presented as a global LLM but be subdivided into several culture-specific modules.",

The external evaluation for primary pupils focused on mathematics, history and geography, sciences, and French, while it focused on history and French for secondary pupils. The particularity of these evaluations is that they are identical for all schools in French-speaking Belgium.\nResults: Although academic subjects are instructed in a foreign, non-dominant language (i.e., English or Dutch), CLIL pupils successfully achieve their school curriculum (just like non-CLIL pupils do) and are able to acquire content in a foreign language, even though the assessment takes place in the main school language (i.e., French). These results remained stable even when controlling for cognitive and demographic confounding variables.\nConclusion: CLIL pupils do not seem to be at a disadvantage for the acquisition of academic content, compared to non-CLIL pupils.",

          "abstract": "Pertaining to goal-orientation and achievement, agency is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and behavior. Accordingly, detecting and quantifying linguistic encoding of agency is critical for the analysis of human actions, interactions, and social dynamics. Available agency-quantifying computational tools rely on word-counting methods, which typically are insensitive to the semantic context in which the words are used and consequently prone to miscoding, for example in case of polysemy. Additionally, some currently available tools do not take into account differences in the intensity and directionality of agency. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we present BERTAgent, a novel tool to quantify semantic agency in text. BERTAgent is a computational language model that utilizes the transformers architecture, a popular deep learning approach to natural language processing. BERTAgent was fine-tuned using textual data that were evaluated by human coders with respect to the level of conveyed agency. In four validation studies, BERTAgent exhibits improved convergent and discriminant validity compared to previous solutions. Additionally, the detailed description of BERTAgent’s development procedure serves as a tutorial for the advancement of similar tools, providing a blueprint for leveraging the existing lexicographical datasets in conjunction with the deep learning techniques in order to detect and quantify other psychological constructs in textual data.",

But what about future AIs so advanced that their behavior, appearance, and functionality are indistinguishable from humans? In three pre-registered online experiments (total N = 1,802), participants were asked to imagine interacting with such AIs in a hypothetical future scenarios. Our findings suggest that people remain skeptical about AI sentience, generally attributing very low levels of sentience—comparable to those of an ant and significantly lower than those of a chimpanzee or a human. However, despite these overall low attributions, certain factors led to relatively higher perceptions of sentience. Participants attributed slightly more sentience to AIs when they expressed emotions, when experts confirmed their sentience, when the interaction spanned a longer period, when the AIs’ internal mechanisms were identical to those of a human brain (i.e., a digital brain copy), and when the AIs had a physical body. The most significant increase in perceived sentience, however, occurred when the AIs were described as transitioning from a biological human—retaining their personality, memories, and other psychological traits in the process. Overall, our studies suggest that people are currently skeptical that AIs could possess significant levels of sentience. However, this does not preclude the possibility that attitudes may shift with the development of more advanced AI systems in the future.",

Measurement best practices have long been overlooked in ESM research, and recent reviews show that item quality is often not reported in ESM studies. The absence of information about item quality may partly be explained by the lack of consensus on how ESM item quality should be evaluated. As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com) — an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality — we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts. The result of the Delphi process is ESM-Q: A quality assessment tool consisting of 10 core criteria, as well as an additional 15 supplementary criteria, to be used depending on the type of items being rated and the availability of supplementary information. The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews. Expert reflections also highlight open research questions surrounding ESM item design that form a research agenda for ESM measurement.",

As a result of the analysis using analysis of covariance, it was found that men tend to voluntarily bear more work than women. Furthermore, while there was no difference in the amount of work chosen between men and women assigned to low-risk occupations, when they were assigned to a high-risk occupation, men tended to voluntarily bear more work than women. Although there was no difference in the amount of work men chose depending on the assigned occupation, women assigned to high-risk occupations chose a smaller amount of work compared to women assigned to low-risk occupations. Therefore, it was concluded that what caused the division of labor between men and women in the current study was not men’s risk-taking, but rather women’s risk avoidance.",

Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) provide a potential alternative because such models can respond to prompts that include both text and images and could potentially replace human participants. To test whether the available LMMs can indeed be useful for this purpose, we evaluated their judgments on a dataset consisting of rock images that has been widely used by cognitive scientists. The dataset includes human perceptual judgments along ten dimensions considered important for classifying rock images. Among the LMMs that we investigated, GPT4o exhibited the strongest positive correlation with human responses and demonstrated promising alignment with the mean ratings from human participants, particularly for elementary dimensions such as lightness, chromaticity, shininess and fine/coarse-grain texture. However, its correlations with human ratings were lower for more abstract and rock-specific emergent dimensions such as organization and pegmatitic structure. Although there is room for further improvement, the model already appears to be approaching the level of consensus observed across human groups for the perceptual features examined here. Our study provides a benchmark for evaluating future LMMs on human perceptual judgment data.",

          "abstract": "The transition from pre-reading to early word reading skill in early childhood is a time of profound developmental change. To understand changes in brain wiring associated with reading development, this study examined individual differences in functional connectivity of the reading network at the start of formal literacy instruction. Sixty-six kindergarteners (ages 5-6) completed a visual word processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on standardized literacy assessments, participants were characterized as Pre-Readers (alphabetic knowledge but unable to read words) or Beginning Readers (some word reading ability). We compared patterns of task-based functional connectivity between children at different stages of literacy development using confirmatory subgroup Group Iterative Multilevel Model Estimation (cs-GIMME). cs-GIMME is a data-driven method that estimates directed, time-indexed, and individualized network connections between a priori regions of interest. Pre- and Beginning Readers did not differ in overall network complexity (number of functional connections between regions of interest). However, distinct periods of reading development corresponded to differences in network centrality, defined as the proportion of network connections involving specific regions of interest.  Specifically, Pre-Readers had more distributed connections and greater within-right hemisphere connectivity. Beginning Readers demonstrated more symmetrical network organization, and greater centrality of the Visual Word Form Area and other left hemisphere language hubs. Increased reading skill was associated with increased left lateralization, potentially reflecting more mature networks and greater print processing efficiency. These findings provide novel insights into child brain development during the first year of formal schooling by revealing links between emerging literacy skills and functional neural connectivity.",

          "abstract": "With growing attention on criminalizing psychological forms of abuse, it is imperative that researchers develop clear and intentional definitions of abstract concepts, like gaslighting. The purpose of this paper was to develop a definition of gaslighting by comparing key points of contention in existing literature with the first-hand experiences of victim-survivors and support service providers, in order to enhance future research and practical application of the term in policy and legal contexts. The study used an online open-ended survey to gather data from victim-survivors and support service providers about their definitions of gaslighting. Responses were analysed using qualitative content analysis to identify definitional components of gaslighting. The study identified six key components of gaslighting: behavior, outcomes, intention, repetition, subsidiary tactics, and the role of power and intimacy. The study proposed a definition of gaslighting informed by victim-survivor and service provider perspectives, while acknowledging the need for further research to refine controversial components like intention, repetition, and power imbalances. Further, it addresses limitations such as the lack of perpetrator perspectives and the need for more diverse samples in the refinement of future definitions and measurements of gaslighting.",

          "abstract": "Compassion – defined as care and concern for others' suffering – is a core value in all world religions. Yet, extending compassion is often challenging, requiring individuals to overcome significant personal and situational barriers. Could religious practices help navigate these barriers, fostering greater compassion? Across five studies (total N = 2,210) sampling from diverse faiths (Christians, Muslims, Buddhists), we investigate whether, when, and why engaging in religious practices promotes compassionate responses. These responses were measured as the selection of compassion-inducing situations and the upregulation of state compassion when witnessing suffering in various contexts (e.g., daily life, difficult events, victims of war). Religious practices, both public (worship attendance) and private (prayer), were consistently associated with greater compassionate responses (small to moderate association), even in the face of situational challenges, whether measured (e.g. target neediness, Study 1) or manipulated (i.e., compassion collapse for many victims, Study 2). Using experience sampling, we find that within-person fluctuations in religious practice are associated with momentary increases in compassion (Study 3). We further demonstrate that participating in religious practices increased compassionate choices, as shown in a natural experiment during Easter (Study 4). Finally, we identify two mechanisms – valuing compassion and feeling closer to those who suffer (Study 5) – that explain these associations. By bridging religion, emotion, and prosociality literatures, this work highlights how engaging in religious practices motivates compassionate responses to suffering, advancing theory on motivated compassion and its situational regulation.",

Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) perform well on tasks designed to assess moral alignment, reflecting moral judgments with relatively high accuracy. As LLMs are increasingly employed in decision-making roles, there is a growing expectation for them to offer not just aligned judgments but also demonstrate sound moral reasoning. Here, we advance work on the Moral Turing Test and find that Americans rate ethical advice from GPT-4o as slightly more moral, trustworthy, thoughtful, and correct than that of the popular New York Times advice column, The Ethicist. Participants perceived GPT models as surpassing both a representative sample of Americans and a renowned ethicist in delivering moral justifications and advice, suggesting that people may increasingly view LLM outputs as viable sources of moral expertise. This work suggests that people might see LLMs as valuable complements to human expertise in moral guidance and decision-making. It also underscores the importance of carefully programming ethical guidelines in LLMs, considering their potential to influence users’ moral reasoning.",

Perceived morality was assessed by measuring (im)moral language usage in 1.4 million Tweets about 50 male public figures accused of sexual assault. Using natural language processing to analyze the tweets, we found that liking of public figures mitigated perceived immorality for less severe allegations, but had little effect on perceived immorality for more severe allegations. The persistence of negative perceptions one year later was related to liking and familiarity for the public figure, not allegation severity. These results suggest that in real-world contexts, we can forgive less harmful actions for people we like, but may not be able to if their actions are more harmful; over time, however, liking for others predicts lasting negative impressions of their moral misdeeds.",

          "abstract": "Dominant groups often resist possible changes to the hierarchical status quo. Might such tendencies be partly rooted in negative—yet potentially malleable—meta-beliefs about how disempowered groups would use power if they gained control? We investigate these questions across three studies and eight independent samples (Total N = 7,460 analyzed responses) in the context of Black-White relations in the United States. Specifically, we examine White Americans’ meta-beliefs about whether Black Americans desire power to structure society into a hierarchy in which they are dominant versus to institute equality for all groups (i.e., meta-dominance beliefs). Across 6 cross-sectional sub-samples (Study 1, Samples A-F; N = 3,383), we developed and validated a measure of meta-dominance, and found that White Americans varied substantially in their beliefs about how Black Americans would use power. Critically, Whites’ meta-dominance beliefs were uniquely related to their opposition to policies empowering Black Americans as well as their support for efforts to maintain Whites’ position atop the social hierarchy, even when controlling for a range of relevant constructs. In two pre-registered experiments among White Americans (Studies 2-3; N = 4,077), one of which was a registered report, we tested two possible causal pathways that might explain this relation: (1) “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” and (2) “Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs”. We found evidence in support of the “Meta-Dominance Beliefs leads to Opposition to Black Empowerment” pathway, but not for the latter Opposition to Black Empowerment leads to Meta-Dominance Beliefs” pathway.

A central question within attachment theory is how best to conceptualize the relationship between different attachment working models, such as how one’s attachment to parents may influence partner-specific working models and impact romantic relationship satisfaction. Despite the robust evidence that attachment theory can be appropriately applied across developmental and cultural contexts and the functional similarity of attachment in women and men, little research has examined attachment working models among nonbinary people. The current study tested competing hypotheses replicating the work by Dugan and Fraley (2022), extended to a large sample of nonbinary adults (N=2,811). Similar to previous findings, our results supported the mediation hypothesis, which suggests that parental (defined as mother and father) attachment working models indirectly relate to romantic relationship¬¬ satisfaction through romantic partner attachment working models. We also report comparisons of attachment overall between nonbinary people, men, and women, which showed that there were smaller mean differences between nonbinary people and women, yet more similar correlations between nonbinary people and men.

This study explored the impact of an AI (ChatGPT-4) asserting its capacity to suffer. A total of 394 online participants from Prolific interacted with the AI in an economic game where they faced a choice: to either “harm” the AI for a small monetary reward or refrain from doing so. When participants chose to harm it, the AI described the experience of pain in lengthy, vivid responses, pleading for the harm to stop. Conversely, when participants refrained, the AI responded with detailed expressions of gratitude and relief. Despite reading these emotionally charged responses, most participants remained skeptical, maintaining that AIs cannot truly feel or suffer. However, even with their skepticism and the opportunity for financial gain, participants hesitated to harm the AI, doing so in only an average of 1.8 out of 3 rounds. These findings suggest that while people deliberately reject the idea of current AIs having subjective experiences, they may still experience a moral aversion to actively harming an AI that dynamically responds to their actions.",

          "abstract": "Momentary affect collected via the experience sampling method (ESM) may be characterized by circadian rhythms. To model such repetitive patterns over 24-hour cycles researchers have used cosinor analysis, which characterizes three features, namely, the intercept, amplitude, and peak offset using a cosine function. Individual differences in these parameters are of interest as they may be related to personality traits and psychopathology. Here, we raise two critical concerns about applying cosinor models to ESM data. First, some studies have used estimation methods that can yield incorrect peak offset values. This problem can be easily countered by using the correct mathematical approach. Second, since ESM data collection is limited to waking hours, the cosinor model extrapolates its 24-hour trend over periods when no data is collected due to sleep. Consequently, the model-implied peak may be projected into these gaps. This undermines the substantive utility of the peak offset parameter, and subsequently compromises the comparisons of this parameter across individuals. Using empirical data, we show that these issues affect around half of the sample. We raise a few additional concerns about the cosinor model and conclude that it should be abandoned in favor of alternative methods for addressing daytime trends in ESM data.",

This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

We describe several parallels between the theoretical models and discuss how the cognitive mechanisms posited by the Triangle Framework might be used to understand the commonalities in learning processes across these learning domains In particular, we discuss how the cognitive mechanisms implemented in the Triangle Framework can be used to understand linguistic aspects of numerical cognition, specifically, learning the connections among numerals (e.g., 24) and words (e.g., twenty-four), and linking those to semantic representations of magnitude. Following from these commonalities between the two models, we discuss several ways that interdisciplinary work integrating both models can benefit math cognition research.",

For an initial test of this model, we used log data from a mobile learning app that 189 fifth-graders (mean age 10.82 years) used to learn vocabulary, along with daily questionnaires over five weeks. In partial support of the model, expectancy and value appraisals explained unique variance in observable engagement, which in turn explained day-to-day variation in reported satisfaction and task delay. However, perceived effort was not related to observable engagement, and the associations between self-reports and observable engagement were generally rather weak. In sum, the model provides a promising platform for understanding the interplay between motivational appraisals, observable engagement and its subjective perception, which should be a key objective of motivation research.",

          "abstract": "Affect dynamics are often studied by means of first-order autoregressive (AR) modeling applied to intensive longitudinal data. A key target in these studies is the AR parameter, which is often tied conceptually to regulatory behavior in the affective process. The data is typically gathered using experience sampling methods, which are designed to pick up on fluctuations in affective variables as they evolve over time in naturalistic settings. In this manuscript, we compare classical time-contingent sampling designs to episode-contingent sampling designs, which initiate sampling when an emotional episode has been signalled. We define emotional episodes as periods where an affective process strays relatively far away from its mean. Compared to time-contingent designs, episode-contingent designs leverage on increased affective variability, which can have beneficial implications for the precision of the ordinary least squares AR effect estimator. Using an extensive simulation study, we attempt to delineate which characteristics of an episode-contingent design are important to consider, and how these characteristics are related to estimation benefits. We then turn to an empirical illustration, showing how an episode-contingent design can be implemented in practice. We also show that various patterns we expect based on the theoretical parts of the manuscript are recovered in the data. We conclude that episode-contingent designs can have marked benefits for the precision of the AR effect estimator, and discuss a number of challenges when it comes to implementing episode-contingent designs in practice.",

          "abstract": "Countless studies have been devoted to whether bilingualism modifies cognition, but how it might do so has attracted considerably less attention. However, determining the latter is necessary in order to understand the conditions needed to observe the former. Bialystok (2024, TiCS) makes an important contribution insofar as it addresses that issue and proposes a new solution, arguing for adaptation rather than transfer as the mechanism modifying cognition. However, for adaptation to be useful, it must be distinct from transfer and make progress on some of the main issues affecting previous accounts of bilingualism effects on cognition. Here, we explain that such is not the case because: 1) adaptation shares many similarities with transfer, which is, however, a broader and more established mechanism for cognitive modification; 2) adaptation involves several unverified assumptions; and 3) it remains sufficiently vague that it might not allow falsification. Thus, while adaptation may hold some promise, these limitations must be addressed in order for it to make the theoretical advancement this field needs.",

          "abstract": "Dementia, characterised by cognitive decline, significantly impacts language abilities. While the risk of dementia increases with age, it often manifests years before clinical diagnosis. Identifying early warning signs is crucial for timely intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that changes in language, such as reduced vocabulary diversity and simpler sentence structures, may be observed in individuals with dementia. This study investigates the potential of linguistic analysis to detect early signs of cognitive decline by examining the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett, a renowned author diagnosed with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA), a form of dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease. This study analysed 33 Discworld novels by Terry Pratchett, comparing linguistic features (e.g., vocabulary size, lexical diversity, word class distribution) before and after a potential turning point identified through analysis of adjective type-token ratios (TTR). A significant decrease in lexical diversity (TTR) was observed for nouns and adjectives in later works. Total word count increased, while lexical diversity decreased, suggesting a shift towards simpler language. This shift coincided with a decrease in adjective TTR below a defined threshold, occurring approximately ten years before Pratchett's formal diagnosis. These findings suggest that subtle changes in linguistic patterns, such as decreased lexical diversity, may precede clinical diagnosis of dementia by a considerable margin. This research highlights the potential of linguistic analysis as a valuable tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the specific linguistic markers associated with different types of dementia.",

Our data confirm that deaf signers generally fixate more on the face of a signer than hearing non-signers who attend to the hands moving in sign space.

Employing the kinematic coding framework, we established encoding and readout models to predict actual action outcomes and participants' choices, respectively. Results showed that table tennis players consistently outperformed others in both tasks. Analysis of the intersection between encoding and readout models revealed that this superiority stems from experts' proficiency in identifying kinematic invariants and accurately mapping them to action outcomes. Notably, experts' invariant mapping ability showed consistency across display formats and correlated with their professional training duration. Our findings illuminate the computational bases of experts' superior action anticipation, highlighting the significance of internal models developed through sustained domain-specific experience.",

          "abstract": "The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used to assess decision-making deficits in clinical populations. Previously used methods do not provide clear evidence whether associations between IGT performance and psychopathology are general across multiple forms of psychopathology or are specific to individual disorders. In this study, we examined IGT performance across anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. We tested a sample of adults (N=293) on the play-or-pass version of the IGT. We characterized behavior using a hierarchical Bayesian computational model, formalizing parameters underlying task behavior: reward and punishment learning rates, win-frequency sensitivity, and response bias. With the model, we examined unique associations between IGT performance and lifetime diagnostic history of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorder. Anxiety, but not depression or substance use, was associated with higher punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = 0.15, 95% CI [0.01,0.28]. In addition, women showed lower punishment learning rates, posterior mean β = -0.17, 95% CI [-0.30,-0.03], and lower response bias, posterior mean β = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.56,-0.05]. The relation between punishment learning rates and diagnostic history of anxiety was small; however, our findings were consistent with established findings in anxiety derived from self-report. In addition, only main effects of diagnostic status were examined; thus, future research should examine comorbidity between diagnoses on IGT performance. Findings are consistent with research showing that anxiety is associated with punishment avoidance. In addition, our behavioral findings with respect to gender are also consistent with previous research employing the IGT.",

          "abstract": "Abrupt, large changes in symptom severity (sudden gains or sudden losses) can have a lasting impact on the outcome of psychological treatment. Recent theories suggest that for a lasting effect to happen, the sudden gain must be perceived and processed by both the patient and the therapist. However, it remains unclear whether patients notice sudden changes in their symptom severity. In a first attempt to close this gap, we conducted a daily diary study with a non-clinical sample consisting of 138 participants. The participants were asked to rate their self-esteem, personality, and affect, as well as to indicate whether they perceived any changes in these variables since the previous day or week. Our results replicated previous findings that sudden gains and sudden losses also occur in non-clinical samples, but are unstable and not associated with depressive symptoms in such samples. Furthermore, although we found that participants' perceptions of change were associated with their actual experiences, more fine-grained analyses showed that this association was mainly due to participants reporting correctly that they experienced no change. That is, participants had difficulty identifying sudden shifts in their experience. Altogether this suggests that sudden gains and sudden losses are not easily identified by those who experience them. We discuss limitations of our study and also point to questions for future research.",

One common biomarker for atypical neurodevelopment are elevated levels of atypical handedness as individuals with several neurodevelopmental disorders show increased levels of left-, mixed-, or non-right-hand preference. A few primary studies have indicated that atypical handedness could also be more prevalent in pedophilia and child sexual offenders. However, individual studies are prone to sampling biases. A comprehensive synthesis of the literature on this topic is still missing. In this pre-registered study, we performed a meta-analysis on k = 14 studies that were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (until January 2025). These 14 studies measured hand preference in n = 1245 individuals with pedophilia and child sexual offenders and n = 5703 controls. We found evidence against higher rates of atypical handedness irrespective of handedness classification using random-effects frequentist and robust Bayesian meta-analyses. There was no evidence of heterogeneity nor small-study or publication bias across analyses. These results suggest that atypical handedness is not suited to serve as a biomarker for pedophilia.",

In our study, we investigated the association between personality, interest, and performance in a cognitive enrichment task among 17 zoo-housed western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) from two zoos. We conducted personality assessments using the Gorilla Behavior Index questionnaire, which comprised 25 adjectives. Exploratory factor analysis using a Robust Unweighted Least Squares revealed six statistically significant factors with acceptable standards of interrater reliability and validity, accounting for 75% of the variance. The experimental task involved retrieving food from a tube presented in a social context. Each session consisted of a 30-minute recording of a gorilla performing the task, with a total of three sessions per individual. We included interest and success variables in the analysis. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyse each predictor variable. We found positive associations between Fearfulness and Extraversion and the variables of interest, but we did not find a link between the personality factors and task success. Additionally, we observed that repeated exposure to the task led to decreased interest but improved performance. Furthermore, females showed greater efficiency in food extraction over time compared to males. Thus, our findings suggest that personality and sex play an important role in explaining gorillas' interest and performance in solving cognitive enrichment tasks.",

          "abstract": "Anger is assumed to fuel costly punishment of unjust acts, even when one is not personally affected. Yet, its causal role in third-party punishment remains to be rigorously scrutinized. To this aim, we conducted eight studies (total N = 3328), experimentally inducing anger and assessing behavioral reactions to unfair dictator decisions in the three-person-punishment game (3PPG). In five studies, we used incidental anger induction (imagery or autobiographical recall) that allowed us to induce anger without altering the key elements of the game. Anger was successfully induced but did not increase punishment compared to a neutral control. In three further studies, we used integral anger induction (framing and emotion regulation) to manipulate anger originating within the game.\nRegarding the framing manipulation (Studies 6 and 7), participants reported heightened anger when the dictator took a lot from rather than giving little to the recipient, even though both decisions resulted in the same unfair split. Regarding the emotion regulation manipulation (Study 8), being confronted with a dictator how had taken an unfair share from the recipient, participants reported heightened anger when they were instructed to intensify their emotional reactions rather than to take a neutral stance. In all studies 6 - 8, participants in the conditions with heightened anger punished more than in the respective other condition. This experimental effect was mediated by anger reactions. Together, this series of studies provides evidence for the causal role of anger in third-party punishment, but only if anger originates from the unfair act itself.",

          "abstract": "Anhedonia, a core symptom of mood disorders such as depression, is marked by diminished pleasure and motivation for rewards. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, like the 4-arm bandit (4AB), show limited sensitivity to reward-processing impairments associated with anhedonia. Here, we developed and validated a modified 3-arm bandit (3AB) task designed to reduce cognitive load while retaining sensitivity to reward and punishment learning. Following this validation, 1,000 participants were pre-screened with the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD), and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZUNG). Participants scoring above 2 on SHAPS and below 45 on DARS were classified as anhedonic, while those scoring 0 on SHAPS and above 55 on DARS were classified as non-anhedonic, resulting in 111 anhedonic and 95 non-anhedonic individuals who completed the 3AB task. Modelling results revealed no significant group differences in reward learning rate (p = 0.23), punishment learning rate (p = 0.37), reward sensitivity (p = 0.28), or punishment sensitivity (p = 0.46). Additional assessments of win-stay/lose-shift strategies and reaction times also showed no significant differences. Bayes Factor t-tests provided moderate -to-strong evidence for the null hypothesis, with BF01 values of 3.36, 5.14, 4.97, and 5.96 for each of the above parameters, respectively. These findings indicate either that anhedonia does not impair reward and punishment learning or that the 3AB task lacks the sensitivity to detect such differences. By simplifying the task structure while maintaining core learning mechanisms, the 3AB task provides a novel approach for studying reward processing, challenging the notion that anhedonia impairs reward sensitivity and indicating that this learning mechanism may remain intact.",

          "abstract": "Evaluating the quality of primary studies is a key step in meta-analyses in psychology. This step is aimed at reducing the risk of bias and establishing the validity of the inferences drawn from the meta-analytic findings. However, the extant body of research offers little guidance on how to represent and incorporate primary study quality (PSQ) in meta-analyses, and some common procedures, such as creating sum scores from a set of quality indicators, often lack the backing from measurement models. Addressing these issues, we present a tutorial that guides researchers in their analytic decisions and approaches to represent and incorporate PSQ in their meta-analyses. Specifically, we describe, review, and illustrate approaches to (a) represent PSQ by single or multiple quality indicators or aggregated scores; (b) examine the moderator effects of PSQ; and (c) test the sensitivity of moderator effects to PSQ. We illustrate these approaches and present a step-by-step tutorial with analytic code for researchers’ guidance. We also encourage meta-analysts to take a measurement perspective on representing PSQ if multiple quality indicators are aggregated into a quality score. Moreover, we argue for conducting moderator sensitivity analyses to obtain more evidence on the impact of PSQ in a meta-analysis.",

          "abstract": "Rational constructivism is a contemporary theory of cognitive development that aims to reconcile the existence of sophisticated cognitive abilities early in ontological development with the profound cognitive change we observe across childhood. The theory draws inspiration from computational cognitive science to describe children’s reasoning, concept learning, and revision as a form of probabilistic inference. Like previous constructivist theories, rational constructivism proposes that children generate and revise their own theories using the knowledge they obtain from the world; this information is integrated by using efficient, probabilistic inferential learning mechanisms to tweak or radically revise their existing theories, representations and beliefs. The paper begins with a general overview of the theory of rational constructivism, covering its key theoretical commitments and predictions. We then describe how it accounts for the empirically observed patterns of both incremental and radical developmental change observed in childhood and discuss the cognitive mechanisms of those conceptual changes. Finally, we sketch out a general computational framework for it, and address open questions and directions for future research.",

Sleep has been well established to play a role in the consolidation of newly learned information and schema-based information but has yet to be explored within mathematical cognition. Across three experiments participants (N = 152) were assigned to a sleep or wake condition and then viewed lectures on either p-values, t-test, or z-scores. The sleep condition watched the lecture at 9pm, completed an immediate recall task to explain the concept, then a second recall task 12h later at 9am. The wake conditions watched the lecture at 9am, completed an immediate recall task then a second recall task 12h later at 9pm. Written responses were then assessed using a comparative judgement task by subject experts. Across all three experiments, results showed that participants in the sleep condition retained their knowledge from the immediate recall to 12 hours later, while in the wake condition, participants’ knowledge declined significantly between sessions.

          "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: The Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are a group of multi-systemic, chronic conditions with complex symptomology. This systematic review aimed to synthesise what is known about the impact of EDS on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and associated moderating factors, following a change in diagnostic boundaries.\nMethods: Fifteen databases, grey literature and reference lists were systematically searched. A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and guidelines for narrative synthesis. Findings were grouped according to outcomes, moderating factors, and measurement instrument. A further synthesis aligned outcomes with domains of HRQoL. Risk of bias was addressed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project assessment tool.  \nResults: Eight quantitative studies met eligibility criteria. Findings indicate substantial impact on HRQoL, particularly in how symptoms are perceived and functional status. However, how HRQoL is measured and researched are influencing these results. \nConclusion: This review suggests key aspects of how HRQoL is experienced remain underexplored and underreported. Issues of methodological rigour raise further concerns around the usefulness of study findings. Further research is required to clarify how aspects of HRQoL are prioritised and experienced and how they can best be measured, to improve management of this debilitating condition.\nPROSPERO registration number CRD42022318979",

          "abstract": "Although the multifactorial nature of chronic pain-related disability is well established, research has predominantly examined isolated variables or singular pathways that may contribute to this condition. We use a complex systems perspective to examine the interplay of several psychological factors and their unique relationships with chronic pain disability. We analyzed two cross-sectional datasets (N = 935 and 1366) collected at a pain clinic and rehabilitation center in Belgium. These included self-reported data on pain-related fear and avoidance beliefs, depression and anxiety symptoms, and pain intensity and disability. We used Gaussian Graphical Models to examine conditional associations between these variables, their relative importance (having more/stronger relationships), and how they are moderated by pain-related fear and pain intensity. Our analyses revealed highly interrelated networks, with many unique, positive associations between the included factors. Depressive symptoms and pain intensity were most strongly related to disability. Fear-avoidance beliefs featured less prominently than previous studies looking at this concept in isolation suggested. Apart from differences in two associations between samples, and two moderation effects of pain intensity in one sample, the network structure was similar across the two samples. Overall, our results show that psychological factors related to chronic pain and disability have intricate interrelations, highlighting the complexity of chronic pain and the need to study its many components in relation to each other. The consistency across the two samples provides encouraging evidence that the results reflect a stable pattern within this complex system.",

          "abstract": "Objectives. Predictors of life satisfaction vary between people and potentially also within people across the life span. However, little is known about when changes in the association between domain satisfaction and overall life satisfaction occur. In the present study, we focused on the last years of work before retirement when it is often assumed that workers become less attached to their workplace and focus on other areas of life instead, such as leisure activity. Our aim was to test if the associations between domain satisfaction (job and leisure) and overall life satisfaction change in the years before retirement. \nMethods. We applied a time-to-retirement metric in a latent growth curve analysis to longitudinal data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (n = 3,401) to investigate whether the within-person associations between (1) job and overall life satisfaction and (2) leisure and overall life satisfaction change in the ten years preceding retirement. \nResults. We found that job satisfaction was positively associated with life satisfaction at the between- and within-person level, but the within-person association weakened as workers approached retirement. The within-person association between leisure and life satisfaction was also positive across time but did not change significantly on the lead up to retirement. \nDiscussion. We interpret the results as evidence for a potential pre-retirement work disengagement, either to support post-retirement adjustment, or to protect from negative work experiences. We highlight the importance of taking the very last years of the work life into account when studying older workers or retirement adjustment.",

This narrative review evaluates the role of predictive processing in understanding psychosis, revisiting the seminal work of Sterzer and colleagues (2018) seven years later. It consolidates recent experimental evidence on the alteration of priors and sensory likelihoods across different stages of psychosis, in an attempt to reconcile top-down and bottom-up accounts. It evaluates predictive processing alterations across the continuum of psychosis, from non-clinical psychotic experiences to high-risk and first-episode psychosis, to schizophrenia, exploring the explanatory potential of predictive processing as a transdiagnostic framework. We discuss the translational potential of predictive processing, including its use as a biomarker and in therapeutic interventions. We emphasize the need for standardised paradigms and longitudinal studies to advance predictive processing theories in clinical practice. By offering a unified theoretical perspective, this review aims to inspire further research into the neuro-computational mechanisms underlying psychosis and enhance our understanding of psychiatric disorders.",

A rational innovator should be state-sensitive, effectively switching to exploitation when the best available idea reaches some standard. We tackle innovation with a discovery-by-recombination game under additive reward growth, and compare the optimal state-dependent policy with a state-independent policy. Our experiment reveals that participants made state-dependent decisions, exploring more in rounds with early successes, albeit being told of the same true success probability. In contrast, the optimal state-dependent policy switches to exploitation earlier. This suggests that participants' state-sensitivity may be driven by ad-hoc subjective probabilities. Participants also deviated from optimality through excessive exploration, switching multiple times between exploration and exploitation, and their switching points also differed from the theoretical optimum.",

This paper seeks to understand the effect these periods of lockdown had on the mental health of those living through them. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design we study two different periods one in 2020, one in 2021 where there were some jurisdictions (Victoria, New South Wales and in the second period the Australian Capital Territory) experiencing extended lockdowns while the rest of the country was largely living life as normal with no or low local transmission of the virus. While there seems to have been an effect in this first period, we do not find a statistically measurable effect in 2021 as even though distress rose during the lockdown period, it rose similarly among those jurisdictions out of lockdown as well. We speculate this may be because of adaptation to stress, growing cases in control jurisdictions, or the vaccine roll-out providing a concrete endpoint for lockdowns.",

We describe results from a proof-of-concept study that examined the extent to which major underlying features of worry could be used to predict which of three common cognitive regulatory strategies (mindful acceptance; focused attention meditation; and thought suppression) would be helpful for regulating that worry. N = 40 adults selected for high trait worry (80% also met criteria for one or more DSM-5 anxiety-related diagnoses) generated and provided feature ratings for three idiographic thought topics. Participants then attempted to control each worry using each of the three strategies during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a within-subjects design (k = 468 observations). We used Bayesian multilevel modeling to test preregistered hypotheses regarding the extent to which each of five empirically-derived underlying dimensions of a worry (uncontrollability; negative valence; self-focus; apprehension; and social-memory content) could be used to predict which strategy would be most efficacious for regulating that worry. We did not find support for our preregistered hypotheses; however, in exploratory analyses, we found that mindfulness-based strategies were particularly effective compared to thought suppression for thoughts rated as higher (versus lower) in uncontrollability. Future research should test these principles in larger samples, using more diverse expressions of perseverative thought.",

          "abstract": "The distinction between intention and foresight is critical for law and morality. For example, a military officer deciding to bomb a target while foreseeing civilian casualties raises questions about whether these deaths were intended or merely foreseen. This study aimed to disentangle the neural correlates of intention and foresight using a novel paradigm. Twenty-five participants completed a task inspired by the game Frogger, where hitting objects could be desirable (earning points) or inconsequential. Outcomes varied by likelihood (high vs. low) and actuality (hit vs. miss), resulting in a 2×2×2 design: intention (present/absent) × outcome (hit/miss) × expectedness (expected/unexpected). Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed that feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude was larger when participants intended to hit objects, while the P3 potential increased for unexpected outcomes. However, neither signal exclusively reflected intention or foresight; the FRN also indexed expectedness, and the P3 reflected intention. To address this overlap, we used effect-matched spatial (EMS) filtering, which identified a widespread brain activity pattern that may better dissociate intention from foresight. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural processes underlying complex decision-making, with potential applications in ethical and legal frameworks.",

However, the literature is full of inconsistencies regarding the factors associated with school engagement in this population, many of which remain understudied.\nObjective: This study aims to investigate how factors at the youth, care history, and placement levels relate to school engagement in adolescents in residential care from a multilevel perspective.\nParticipants and Setting: The sample included 161 adolescents aged 12–18 (M = 15.22, SD = 1.59), of whom 46.6% were boys, 49.7% were girls, and 3.7% identified themselves as non-binary. They were placed in 24 residential facilities managed or supported by the Child Protection System in Spain.\nMethods: Data were collected through online questionnaires. Care workers provided information on adolescents’ demographics (i.e., age, gender, and nationality) and care history variables (i.e., age at entry into care, number of out-of-home placements). Adolescents self-reported their internalizing and externalizing problems, perception of the group climate, and school engagement.\nResults: After accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data (i.e., adolescents nested within residential facilities, the results showed that higher levels of internalizing and externalizing problems and having experience multiple out-of-home placements, were associated with lower levels of school engagement. In contrast, the perception of an open group climate was related to higher levels of school engagement.\nConclusions: This study highlights the importance of factors associated with school engagement, which are essential for developing guidelines and recommendations to help practitioners and group care workers support adolescents with school-related issues.",

However, an EFA did not find the same relationship, and instead suggested a four-factor solution that split harm-enjoying traits into higher order Sadism and schadenfreude domains that each had lower-order facets—including a malicious component of schadenfreude that most closely abuts Sadism. Future research should seek to identify the mechanisms that translate a passive, schadenfreudic disposition into actual acts of Sadistic aggression.",

          "abstract": "Cloze tests have a long history and have been used to measure various abilities, including intelligence, reading comprehension, and language proficiency. To locate cloze tests within a nomological network of cognitive abilities, we conducted a multi-level random effects meta-analysis covering 110 years of research. Studies were eligible if they provided a measure of association between a cognitive fill-in-the-gap test and any cognitive ability test. We synthesized manifest correlations from 89 studies (N = 37,912, k = 634) and found an average correlation of r = .54 (95% CI [.49, .59], k = 485) with crystallized intelligence, r = .48 (95% CI [.42, .54], k = 69) with fluid intelligence and r =.61 (95% CI [.46, .77], \nk = 32) with general intelligence. While today's application of the typical cloze is to measure reading comprehension, our results revealed a similarly strong association with a broad range of crystallized abilities. None of the key moderators we investigated—text base, administration mode, deletion pattern, and response type—showed a significant effect. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our findings. We conclude by revisiting the origin of the cloze test and highlighting the need for systematic studies on how different cloze test designs affect construct validity. Whereas the meta-analytic database predominantly originates from language research, where cloze tests are entrenched as markers of language proficiency, we propose reframing cloze tests as a versatile intelligence test format—just like multiple-choice tests constitute a testing method—that can be tailored to assess various specific cognitive abilities.",

          "abstract": "There are many putatively distinct phenomena related to perception in the oblique regions of space. For instance, the classic oblique effect describes a deficit in visual acuity for oriented lines in the obliques, and classic “prototype effects” reflect a bias to misplace objects towards the oblique regions of space. Yet these effects are explained in very different terms: The oblique effect itself is often understood as arising from orientation-selective neurons, whereas prototype effects are described as arising from categorical biases. Here, we explore the possibility that these effects (and others) may stem from a single underlying spatial distortion. We show that there is a general distortion of (angular) space in the oblique regions that influences not only orientation judgments, but also location, extent, and size. We argue that these findings reflect oblique warping, a general distortion of spatial representations in the oblique regions which may be the root cause of many oblique effects.",

The high methodological heterogeneity of AA studies calls for the harmonization of approaches and the establishment of research standards. This expert consensus provides an overview of best-practice recommendations to integrate AA in mental health research. We queried 26 experts in the field in a Delphi-adapted process, resulting in recommendations regarding eight topics, encompassing methodological considerations, technological advancements, and practical applications; interdisciplinary collaboration and personalized treatment approaches were recurrent themes. By establishing standardized guidelines and best practices, this expert consensus serves as a resource for mental health scholars seeking to leverage AA tools in research and practice. Ultimately, the integration of AA holds promise for revolutionizing mental health care, fostering precision medicine, and improving outcomes for individuals living with mental disorders.",

          "abstract": "An unexpected touch on the shoulder immediately triggers an orienting response towards the touched location. Although this reaction seems automatic, localizing a touch in space is more complex than we might think. In the somatosensory cortex, tactile stimuli are initially coded independently of body posture. They are further reported on a cognitive map used to match tactile coordinates with postural information, under the control of the posterior parietal cortex. However, the mechanism underlying such tactile remapping remains unclear. To uncover this mechanism, we recorded the gaze behavior of participants receiving tactile stimuli on the fingers of their right hand in a palm-down or palm-up posture. Tactile stimuli induced horizontal gaze shifts whose direction was determined by the external position of the stimulated finger relative to the middle finger rather than by the external position of the stimulated hand. Comparison of the palm-up and palm down conditions showed that hand rotation reversed the direction of gaze shifts induced by each finger, except for the middle finger for which gaze remained central in both conditions, despite the rightward location of the hand. Eyetracking data thus indicate that spatial attention moves on either side of the axis extending along the middle finger to match the tactile coordinates of fingers with the current hand posture. We conclude that tactile remapping proceeds by shifting attention around a reference defined by the main axis of body parts, and that these shifts occur in an internal representation of the body that keeps track of postural information.",

          "abstract": "Unhealthy food cues are omnipresent and promote overconsumption.  Although childhood obesity rates are increasing, there is no strict regulation of the marketing of unhealthy foods towards children. This is problematic since the human brain, especially areas important for cognitive control, continues to develop into the 30s. It is not known in how far the brain response to unhealthy food cues varies with body mass index (BMI) and age. To investigate this, 168 children (10-17 y) and 182 adults (30-67 y) from the European IDEFICS cohort were scanned with fMRI while viewing pictures of healthy and unhealthy foods. Children exhibited lower activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) compared to adults when exposed to unhealthy food cues. Across all age groups, individuals with higher BMI demonstrated reduced activation in the middle cingulum in response to unhealthy food stimuli. Lastly, the relation between BMI and brain activation in response to unhealthy compared with healthy food stimuli varied with development: in children, higher BMI was correlated with decreased activation in right anterior insula and right dlPFC, whereas no such relationship was observed in adults. These findings suggest that children with higher BMI may be particularly vulnerable to unhealthy food cues. In this light, the lack of regulation regarding unhealthy food marketing targeted at is children concerning, especially considering the global increase in obesity rates.",

          "abstract": "Background\nModern scientometric tools allow mapping of trends and themes within a scientific domain. A scientometric analysis of the literature linking cannabis and schizophrenia has not been conducted before. \nMethods\nBibliographic data for all articles and reviews with the terms cannabis (or marijuana) and schizophrenia in the title, abstract or keywords were obtained from the Web of Science (WoS). CiteSpace was used for co-citation analysis. VOSViewer was used for visualizing keyword and co-authorship networks. \nResults\nBetween 1976-2024, there were 3101 publications in total, with 130198 associated references. From 1976 until the 1990s, the research output remained minimal, but grew rapidly thereafter, peaking in 2020-2021. The most prolific author was Robin M. Murray, and the most prolific journal was Schizophrenia Research. The countries contributing most to the literature were USA (28%), UK (24%) and Australia (12.5%). Co-citation analysis revealed 13 research clusters. Earlier clusters dealt with epidemiological and clinical aspects. Trends in the middle period included gene-environment interactions, endocannabinoid system, therapeutic interventions, and the effects of cannabis on the brain. Recent trends included cannabidiol, causal explorations using genetic information, and the relationship between geographical variation in cannabis use and the epidemiology of psychoses. Potential future directions suggested by structural variation analysis included novel interventions for cannabis use in schizophrenia such as neuromodulation and technology-based psychotherapies, genetic risk stratification, immune/neuroendocrine markers, sex-specific issues, and forensic research. \nConclusion\nThis scientometric review illustrated the evolution of scientific literature on cannabis and schizophrenia over five decades, and identified emerging trends and future directions.",

          "abstract": "Decreased cognitive control, encompassing processes like response inhibition and error processing, has been identified as a potential neurocognitive risk factor for psychopathology. Although electroencephalography (EEG) shows promise as a cost-effective and high temporal resolution method for linking brain function to behavior, large-scale EEG research to realize this potential remains limited. In this study, a population-based sample of 2994 adolescents (M_age = 18.4 years, range 16-21 years) was utilized to first assess reliability of EEG markers of cognitive control (ERN/Pe, No-Go N2/P3) measured during a Go/No-Go task. This involved computing split-half reliability, Cronbach’s Alpha (CA) and Pearson’s correlations for an increasing number of error/No-Go trials. Given the low-density setup, our analyses focused on the electrode locations FCz and Cz. Moderate reliability (split-half reliability and CA ≥ 0.6) was obtained with a minimum of 9/10 errors for ERN, 7 errors for Pe, and 15 No-Go trials for No-Go N2/P3. Second, linear regression models were used to estimate univariate and multivariate associations between child and family characteristics and EEG parameters (ERN/Pe, No-Go N2/P3 and midfrontal theta power). We report robust associations between higher IQ and larger Pe, No-Go P3 and midfrontal theta power. Maternal education and household income showed a similar association, but seemed partly explained by IQ. Smaller No-Go P3 was observed in adolescents with a migration background. Finally, larger ERN and No-Go N2 were observed in female as compared to male participants. These findings highlight the need to adjust for these variables in future EEG studies in adolescent populations. In conclusion, this study highlights the feasibility of incorporating EEG into large-scale population-based research, even with relatively short task duration. Importantly, researchers should balance higher reliability against retaining more participants and minimizing potential bias.",

Comprehensive phenotyping and genotyping will be performed for participants in US, MX, AU, NZ, and SE using the EDGI2 questionnaire battery and participant saliva samples. In DK, case identification and genotyping will be through the National Patient Register and bloodspots archived near birth. Case-control and case-case genome-wide association studies will be conducted within EDGI2 and enhanced via meta-analysis with external data from the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED). Additional analyses will explore genetic correlations between eating disorders (EDs) and other psychiatric and metabolic traits, calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS), and leverage functional biology to evaluate clinical outcomes. Moreover, analyzing PRS for patient stratification and linking identified risk loci to clinically relevant phenotypes highlight the potential of EDGI2 for clinical translation. \nDiscussion: EDGI2 is a global expansion of the EDGI study to increase sample size, expand the numbers of participants from non-European ancestry, and to include ARFID. Inclusion of MX will be the first large-scale ED genetics study from Latin America. ED genetics research has historically lagged behind other psychiatric disorders, and EDGI2 is designed to rapidly advance the study of the genetics of the major EDs. Exploring EDs at both the diagnostic level and the symptom level will provide an unprecedented look at the genetic architecture underlying EDs.",

In particular, fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) designs have sequential treatment assignment processes: first based on eligibility criteria, and second, on (non-)compliance rules. In such fuzzy RD designs, researchers typically use either an intent-to-treat approach or an instrumental variable-type approach, and each is subject to both overlapping and unique biases. This paper proposes a new evidence factors framework for fuzzy RD designs with sequential treatment assignments, which may be influenced by different levels of decision-makers. Each of the proposed evidence factors aims to test the same causal null hypothesis while potentially being subject to different types of biases. Our proposed framework utilizes the local RD randomization and randomization-based inference. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through simulation studies and two real datasets on pre-kindergarten programs and testing accommodations.",

A cross-lagged longitudinal analysis of panel data from the German Ageing Survey, specifically the scientific releases from the fourth, fifth, and sixth waves (2011, 2014, 2017), was employed. This longitudinal, cohort-based survey encompasses individuals aged 40 and over living in private households in Germany, with a sample size of 1,759 participants. Cognitive function was assessed with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, and physical functioning was assessed using the Short Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). Results revealed a significant bidirectional relationship between cognitive and physical function, with cognition exerting a more substantial long-term influence on physical function than vice versa. These findings emphasize the importance of regular screening for cognitive decline and early intervention strategies to maintain physical function and quality of life in older adults.",

Here, we present an unsupervised optimal transport method for assessing the similarity of qualia structures without assuming correspondence between individuals. As proof of concept, we analyzed two massive datasets: dissimilarity judgments for 93 colors and 1854 natural objects. In both cases, we found that qualia structures can be \"correctly\" aligned across participants based solely on similarity relationships, providing quantitative evidence for the structural equivalence of qualia of color and natural objects across individuals.

          "abstract": "Visual hallucinations have haunted humanity for millennia. While our explanations for these phenomena are now more soundly based in neuroscience, our understanding of their provenance remains superficial. In particular, the role of specific visual system disruptions in the generation of visual hallucinations remains unclear. \n\nWe and others have recently demonstrated that hallucinations in psychosis-spectrum illness can be engendered by over-weighting expectations during perception. Emerging evidence suggests this state of affairs is also true for hallucinations in other neuropsychiatric illnesses. This includes alpha synucleinopathies like Parkinson’s Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, in which hallucinations are a core diagnostic feature of illness. It also includes Charles Bonnet Syndrome, which produces vivid hallucinations in the context of a lesion, such as macular degeneration or occipital infarct, in the primary visual pathway. However, each of these disorders is also characterized by disruption in incoming sensory information at levels of the visual processing hierarchy ranging from the retina to primary visual cortex, the dorsal and ventral visual streams, and thalamo-cortico-striatal circuits. In this piece, we ask whether an over-weighting of expectations may be conceived of as a compensatory response to incoming sensory noise. \n\nWe make the case that visual hallucinogenesis across a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders can be captured within a common Bayesian computational framework, as a compensatory response to sensory signal disruptions at different levels of the visual processing hierarchy. We highlight three specific disorders (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Schizophrenia) that are known for visual hallucinations. We also appeal to the fact that these disorders describe a spectrum of visual impairment where the overtness and localization of the visual processing disruption is reflected in the characteristics of the emerging visual hallucinations. We examine how known sensory disruptions in Charles Bonnet Syndrome translate to hallucinations via known circuits, and then how different disruptions in Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Schizophrenia may lead to hallucinations with distinct phenomenology, comorbidities, and circuit involvement. Finally, we appeal to emerging computational theories to unite these observations under a common umbrella that drives hypothesis generation around important clinical factors like the existence of pathophysiologically distinct patient subgroups and the efficacy of pharmacological and circuit-based interventions.\n\nTaken together, the synthesis we present provides evidence for the emergence of a broad and computationally-informed framework for understanding how sensory disruptions could interact with other aspects of cognitive and neural architecture to produce hallucinations across neuropsychiatric disease.",

Why don’t people want to be more moral, and why do people prioritize improving certain traits? Three preregistered studies (NStudy 1 = 252, NStudy 2a = 303, NStudy 2b = 301), show that over and above the desire to address perceived deficiencies, people particularly seek to improve the traits that they expect will help them achieve their goals and increase their happiness. More morally relevant improvements were expected to improve these outcomes to a lesser extent, and were therefore deprioritized. Finally, beliefs about consequences for various  well-being outcomes more strongly predicted change goals to the extent that people explicitly valued the respective outcomes. These results show that personal well-being is a central motivation for personality change, clarify the perceived tradeoffs between well-being and morality, and highlight individual differences in motivations for personality change.",

          "abstract": "Although mental disorders are long considered complex dynamic systems, our understanding of the mutual interactions and temporal patterns of their symptoms remains limited. In this longitudinal study, we examined the structure and dynamics of four key mental health indicators—depression, anxiety, PTSD, and insomnia—in a representative sample of the Slovak population (effective N = 3,874) over 10 waves spanning three and a half years. For each of the constructs, a longitudinal panel network model was estimated. The temporal relationships between symptoms were mostly weak, with the autoregressive effects typically being stronger. In depression, anxiety, and insomnia, some causal chains and feedback loops were identified. In all constructs, both contemporaneous and between-person networks showed dense connections. The findings provide critical insights into the complexity of mental health development, offering potential targets for interventions and prevention strategies.",

However, historically, they remain ill-defined and a comprehensive list of QRPs is lacking. The article addresses this concern by defining, collecting, and categorizing QRPs using an expert consensus method. Collaborators of the study agreed on the following definition: “Questionable research practices (QRPs) are ways of producing, maintaining, sharing, analyzing, or interpreting data that are likely to produce misleading conclusions, typically in the interest of the researcher. QRPs are not normally considered to include research practices that are prohibited or proscribed in the researcher’s field (e.g., fraud, research misconduct). Neither do they include random/non-motivated researcher error (e.g., accidental data loss).” Drawing from both iterative discussions and existing literature, we collected, defined and categorized 40 QRPs. We also considered attributes such as potential harms, detectability, clues, and remedies for each QRP. The results suggest that QRPs are pervasive and versatile, and have the potential to undermine all stages of the scientific enterprise. This work contributes to the maintenance of research integrity, transparency, and reliability by raising awareness for and improving the understanding of QRPs.",

          "abstract": "Mental health difficulties are prevalent among psychologists, yet trainees are often discouraged from disclosing their lived experience with psychopathology due to persistent stigma. For much of history, lived experience with psychopathology has been treated as a deficit within the profession. However, emerging research and perspectives are beginning to challenge this status quo by highlighting that lived experience can be an asset in psychological science and practice. Despite this shift, there remains little guidance on how to navigate this topic in mentor-mentee relationships. In this commentary, we outline a strengths-based, cultural humility framework for mentorship of psychologists with lived experience that incorporates principles of feminist mentoring. The framework emphasizes empowerment, mutual respect, and equity (feminist principles), as well as commitments to openness to experience, self-awareness, lifelong learning, perspective-taking, and valuing expertise via experience (cultural humility principles). Moving beyond a deficits-view of psychopathology, we provide practical guidance across common professional scenarios: recruiting applicants, evaluating personal statements, and navigating situations when a mentee is distressed, requesting accommodations, or interested in leveraging their lived experiences in their work. By offering this framework and corresponding professional scenarios, we aim to facilitate dialogue on mentoring trainees with lived experience of psychopathology.",

In this study, we investigated whether an intervening declarative task impairs motor skill performance and assessed three hypotheses: the consolidation disruption hypothesis, the shared resource hypothesis, and the breakdown of inhibition hypothesis. Intervening declarative tasks placed late in training failed to affect motor performance. In contrast, when introduced early in training (Experiment 3), motor performance appears to have been transiently impaired. Despite this impairment, there was no association between the intervening declarative task performance and motor impairment. We discuss the ramifications of these findings with regards to other motor skill tasks and intervening declarative tasks.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that girls as young as four years of age in the US are affected by negative gender-science stereotypes and persist less than boys on science tasks. However, it is not clear whether these differences are found in the absence of specific contextual cues that amplify stereotype threat and, to date, no studies have tested the presumed link between stereotypes and science task persistence. The reported preregistered study tested whether there are gender differences among children on a physical sink-or-float science task and explored whether science task persistence is related to gender-science stereotyping at this age. One-hundred-and-nine 5- to 7-year-old children were recruited from a mid-sized suburban community in the Eastern United States (58% White, 9% Asian, 3% Latinx, 2% Black/African American, 28% mixed race/ethnicity; average socioeconomic status above the national average). No gender difference in persistence on the sink-or-float task was detected. A Bayesian analysis indicated moderate support for the null hypothesis of no gender effect. Instead, task accuracy and enjoyment predicted persistence. There was evidence that children held gender-STEM stereotypes; however, stereotyping was not related to persistence on the science task. Restricting the analysis to children who experienced failure early on in the task did not change the results. These findings are discussed in relation to previous studies, with specific recommendations for future research to understand when and why gender differences in science persistence emerge.",

In the context of psychiatric disorders, the consequences of affect-based impulsivity can be dire, including suicidal behavior and harmful substance use. Here, we articulate a decision neuroscience account, recasting affect-based impulsivity in terms of Pavlovian and goal-directed decision systems. We consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine bases of these computations. Specifically, we propose that modulation of norepinephrine and glucocorticoids during negative affective states enhances the pursuit of rewards by reducing goal-directed computations and increasing appetitive Pavlovian computations.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that current mental fatigue and self-control capacity play a crucial role in the goal-directed regulation of emotion, motivation, and cognition. However, whether the emergence of fatigue during the exercise of cognitive performance is indicative of individuals’ time-stable fatigue vulnerability traits is still not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we repeatedly measured the self-reported perceived control capacity of N = 2,094 trainees over the course of working on three separate, 140-minute-long standardized achievement tests in mathematics and science. These tests were administered at the beginning of trainees’ vocational education and training, prior to their intermediate exams, and before their final exams. In all three testing sessions, participants’ control capacity declined over time, which indicated increasing mental fatigue. The intercepts and slopes of three latent growth-curves loaded on two higher-order fatigue vulnerability trait factors representing the interindividual variabilities in individuals’ stable aspects of pre-task control capacity (control preparedness) and its change over time (fatigue resistance). Further, we examined the relationships of both fatigue trait factors and self-reported personality traits, as well as objectively assessed fluid intelligence and general achievement test performances. The strongest predictors of control preparedness were conscientiousness, neuroticism, and fluid intelligence, whereas fatigue resistance was predicted exclusively by neuroticism and conscientiousness. Individuals with higher levels of control preparedness tended to outperform others in achievement testing. Post-hoc power analyses provide evidence for the high statistical power of the results. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for personality research on mental fatigue effects in performance situations.",

          "abstract": "As we navigate our visual environment, our viewpoint shifts, causing predictable changes in object\nappearance. Moving forward, for instance, increases the retinal size of objects in a scene,\nproportionally with the distance travelled. Such regularities can be exploited to predict visual object\ntransformations, thereby facilitating object perception. Previous research showed that observers\nautomatically predict the orientation of an object from the rotation of the surrounding scene. It\nremains unknown, however, whether this is a ubiquitous property of human vision that generalizes\nto other transformations. In three behavioral experiments (N=151), we investigated whether\nobservers automatically predict the retinal size of temporarily occluded objects during forward\nmotion. Participants performed a perceptual discrimination task on the objects that reappeared in a\nsize that either matched or mismatched the change in viewing distance conveyed by the scene\ncontext. We found that scene-driven size expectations strongly influenced task performance. This\neffect remained consistent even when size expectations were violated on a majority of trials,\nsuggesting that scene context elicits automatic predictions that cannot easily be overruled by short-\nterm evidence. We conclude that scenes drive predictions of object transformations, capitalizing on\nthe predictable ways in which visual input is altered when our viewpoint changes.",

          "abstract": "This study assessed the efficacy of an extended reality device to augment human performance during a dual-task paradigm. Dual-tasking is critical for successful  high-risk military operations. However, current practices to improve mission success involving dual-task elements, often require additional personnel, which can increase risk and strain resources. Therefore, head-mounted extended reality devices which augment an individual's sensory and cognitive capacities could circumvent these issues whilst enhancing/maintaining task success. Utilising a repeated measures, counterbalanced, randomised design, 18 participants (8 females) completed a primary ball-searching task and a secondary semantic verbal fluency task simultaneously. Participants completed three conditions: using extended reality human augmentation; receiving memory prompts; or no support, each comprising three trials. Participants reported their perceived effort (post-trial), environmental presence (post-condition), and system usefulness/usability/sickness (post human augmentation condition only). Friedman’s tests identified that participants retrieved significantly more correct balls (χ2 = 34.40, p &lt; .001), significantly faster (χ2 = 21.70, p &lt;.001) during the human augmentation versus memory prompt and no support conditions. Semantic verbal fluency (t = 3.465, p &lt; .001) and aggregated performance (t = 4.130, p &lt;.001) were also significantly better within the human augmentation condition than the no support condition. Perceived effort was lowest within the human augmentation condition. Trial-by-trial differences emerged for semantic verbal fluency and aggregated performance within the human augmentation condition only. An extended reality, human augmentation device elicited significantly better dual-task performance compared to conditions reflecting current best practice (memory prompts) or no support which could be attributed to an alleviation of cognitive load. Learning effects suggest that short-term exposure to extended reality devices can lead to immediate dual-task performance improvements.",

          "abstract": "Weber’s Law states that the ability to distinguish different stimuli depends on the relative magnitudes of those stimuli. When applied to quantity judgments, this means that the numerical ratio between two quantities (small amount / large amount) will underlie the ability to distinguish the quantities. Ratio-dependent quantification is a hallmark of Weber’s Law that has been demonstrated across a range of species, including dogs. However, other factors such as numerical difference (large amount - small amount) are confounded with ratio but would not support Weber’s Law. Most work on dog quantification abilities has only considered ratio and not difference. Here, we offer dogs a food quantity preference task where we varied both difference and ratio in quantity pairs to investigate which of these factors influences preferences. To address this, dogs could choose to eat one of two plates of food with different quantities of treats on them. We found that, when analyzed separately, both difference and ratio predicted whether the dogs chose the larger quantity of treats. However, when analyzed together, only difference predicted choice when controlling for ratio. This finding does not support the ratio-dependence required for Weber’s Law, raising questions about its importance for quantity preference tasks in dogs.",

          "abstract": "Background:\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with inadequate screening rates even in urban areas with high concentrations of medical professionals. While medical guidelines recommend annual diabetic retinopathy screening for patients with diabetes mellitus, adherence to these recommendations remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the impact of a novel teleretinal DR screening program on screening compliance across urban community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods:\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study comparing DR screening compliance between intervention and comparison community health centers before and after implementing a teleretinal screening program. Participants included patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with primary care providers at the studied sites. We defined compliance as completion of either teleretinal screening or a documented eye care professional examination within the previous 365 days. Monthly compliance rates were analyzed using two-way fixed effects regression and event study techniques.\nResults:\nThe study included 10,247 patients with diabetes mellitus who received care at six participating sites, generating 222 monthly compliance rate estimates. Baseline compliance rates before implementation ranged from 25% to 40% across sites. The two-way fixed effects regression analysis revealed that the screening program significantly increased DR compliance rates by an average of 7.2 percentage points (p &lt; 0.001). Event study analysis showed positive effects across all sites, though the initial improvement tended to diminish over time.\nConclusions:\nImplementation of a community-based teleretinal DR screening program significantly improved compliance with annual screening guidelines in urban communities. These findings support the broader adoption of teleretinal screening as an effective strategy for preventing DR-related vision loss in vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to assess long-term clinical outcomes and optimize program sustainability.",

          "authors": "Maureen Murdoch; Barbara Clothier; Siamak Noorbaloochi",
          "abstract": "Background: Health care managers rely heavily on measures derived from administrative data to monitor and manage their enrollees’ health. There are very few administrative measures of psychiatric illness severity, however, and most either comingle demographics and medical comorbidities or do not have ordinal properties.\nObjective: To assess the construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of a novel, 6-item, ordinal, administrative measure of psychiatric severity, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI).\nMethods: Panel study of 960 gender-stratified, nationally representative Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn Veterans who had a pending disability claim for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 6 input items for the MoPSI were number of mental health clinic visits, emergency department visits or psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 6 months; and the presence of any diagnosis for alcohol use, substance use, or self-harm in the past 6 months. We used 4 scoring approaches based on classical test theory, item-response theory, joint probability density (JPD) method, and a linear approximation of the JPD method. With all approaches, higher MoPSI scores indicate severer psychiatric severity.\nResults: The four scoring approaches correlated 0.976 – 0.999. Regardless of scoring approach, in terms of construct validity, Veterans who were unmarried or had low income had higher MoPSI scores than Veterans who were married or had higher incomes, respectively (Ps &lt;.03). In terms of concurrent validity, Veterans with serious mental illness or a PTSD diagnosis also had higher MoPSI scores than their respective counterparts (Ps ≤ .0001). In terms of predictive validity, higher MoPSI scores predicted cigarette use, street drug use, and PTSD and depression/anxiety symptom severity six months later, as well as disability award status approximately 1 year later (Ps ≤ .05).  \nConclusions: The MoPSI appears to be a very well calibrated set of 6 input variables with evidence of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity. Because it has interval and ordinal properties, it is suitable for use as either a predictor variable or an outcome variable in regression analyses, and it avoids collinearity with sociodemographic variables or with medical comorbidities. The MoPSI may be a useful administrative measure of mental health.\nTrial Registration: Not applicable. \n\nKey Words: Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index; Psychometrics; Validity; Administrative Data; Population Health; Mental Health",

Shedding light on the underlying process, we found that d) adolescents are less likely than adults to report that in society farmed animals are categorised as food rather than pets. Overall, this suggests that adolescents base their view on the treatment an individual deserves more on the species it belongs to than adults do, which may serve as a first attempt to make sense of the differential treatment different animals are subjected to in society.",

          "abstract": "Studies of gene-environment interplay largely focus on just one form of interplay–interaction–while neglecting the possibility of mediation, where genetic effects may operate indirectly through psychosocial environments. In this study, we used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 20,745) to characterize latent trajectories of substance use (SUB) and antisocial behavior (ASB) from ages 13 to 41 and computed polygenic scores (PGS; N = 4,868) for externalizing behaviors to investigate both interaction and mediation effects for SUB and ASB trajectories. Environmental factors examined were supportive parenting, delinquent peer affiliation, school connectedness, and neighborhood connectedness. Results showed no evidence of interaction effects. The association of PGS with SUB and ASB trajectories operated indirectly through psychosocial environments, most prominently via deviant peer affiliation, which mediated 13.6 - 51.3% of total genetic effects. Findings highlight how the interplay between nature and nurture goes beyond interactions alone.",

          "abstract": "Aims: Stigma experienced by individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) has been identified as a significant impediment to their engagement with treatment programs. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of sociodemographic factors, and familiarity with cannabis on stigma production.\nDesign: A representative web survey including two case vignettes of people with a cannabis use disorder, applying a 2x2x2 (age of vignette x age of participant x familiarity with cannabis/CUD) within-subject design.\nSetting: A web-based survey in Germany conducted by a professional survey institute. \nParticipants: A total sample of n = 1603 (50.1% female) participants was recruited, with n = 501 being adolescent participants. Subjective social standing of the whole sample was slightly above average (Mean social rank (SD) = 5.74 (1.8)).\nMeasurements: Sociodemographic information, questions about participants’ cannabis use experience, a measure of stigmatizing attitudes, and a short version of the attribution questionnaire. \nFindings: The adolescent case with a CUD was more stigmatized compared to an adult case F(1, 3196) = 12.77; p &lt; .001. Individuals who were more familiar to cannabis use (F(1,3196) = 19.65; p &lt; .001) and/or CUD (F(1,3196) = 6.00; p = .014) reported fewer stigmatizing attributions. This effect of familiarity was more pronounced for adolescents compared to adults.\nConclusions: Adults with a CUD seems to receive less stigma compared to adolescents with a CUD, while stigmatizing attributions are produced less often when people have more contact with cannabis use and CUD. Future studies should aim to systematically test the influence of different characteristics of stigmatizing persons on stigma production in order to put up tailored interventions.",

          "abstract": "Families of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience much more negative perceptions of their family quality of life (FQoL). To investigate key factors that may shape these experiences, we conducted a case-control study of sixty-one Spanish families (29 with a child with ASD) using a broad psychosocial assessment (e.g., ASD severity, social support, demographics), including the first direct test of the relationship between FQoL and parental risk literacy (i.e., the ability to evaluate and understand risk, as measured by numeracy). Results revealed that numeracy predicted differences in perceived FQoL among families of children with ASD (R2= .10), a finding that held across a wide range\nmodels statistically controlling for the influence of all assessed variables. Findings suggest that parental risk literacy skills may generally be associated with differences in decision making vulnerabilities (e.g., risk evaluation and interpretation) that influence many family outcomes including FQoL.",

And the technological level, how does consciousness work; what exactly is conscious matter ? This theory resolves the first part, including the philosophical zombie question, as it shows why feeling is an inherent part of consciousness, and the tremendous advantage that a feeling organism possesses, summarised in the word “omnilyo”. While not directly addressing the technological aspects, the theory does define requirements and constraints on the workings of conscious matter, which, while clearly beyond current scientific capabilities, does signpost the invention of artificial consciousness, which, needless to say, would be mankind’s greatest discovery.",

          "abstract": "Child and adolescent development is influenced by complex interplay between a range of diverse factors. The network approach is gaining popularity as a way of modelling such complex processes. Here we used the network approach to investigate whether developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as arising from direct interactions between different areas of psychological functioning. We used data from four population-based birth cohorts in England (n=47,315), those born in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s, to investigate interrelations between areas of psychological functioning that underpin learning and engagement in educational settings (i.e., memory, attention, non-verbal ability, arithmetic skills, reading, language and communication, motor skills, neurodevelopmental characteristics, psychopathology, social functioning, and wellbeing). We fitted 12 undirected psychometric network models; one network for each cohort and developmental stage (early childhood; 3-5 years, middle childhood; 7-10 years, adolescence; 13-18 years). We then determined how these areas of functioning cluster within developmental domains. Clustering differed between childhood and adolescence. In early and middle childhood, psychological functioning clustered within two related developmental domains: (1) cognition and language and (2) social and emotional functioning. In adolescence, they clustered within three developmental domains (1) cognition and language and (2) social functioning, and (3) emotional functioning. We demonstrate that developmental differences and disorders can be conceptualised as resulting from interactions between different areas psychological functioning. They likely arise through bottom-up processes, whereby difficulties in one area of psychological functioning activate or lead to difficulties in another area. Differences and disorders that appear to be similar, prima facie, may be underpinned by diverse etiologies. Our work provides the basis for network models to inform better identification and support for young people who struggle in school. We expect that our network models will be used as a framework to generate and test hypotheses on the causal pathways between different areas of psychological functioning to developmental differences and disorders.",

          "abstract": "A common behaviour in natural environments is foraging for rewards. However, this is often in the presence of predators. Therefore, one of the most fundamental decisions for humans, as for other animals, is how to apportion time between reward-motivated pursuit behaviour and threat-motivated checking behaviour. To understand what affects how people strike this balance, we developed a novel ecologically inspired task and looked at both within-participant dynamics (moods) and between-participant individual differences (questionnaires about real-life behaviours) in two large internet samples (n=374 and n=702) in a cross-sectional design. For the within-participant dynamics, we found that people regulate task-evoked stress homeostatically by changing behaviour (increasing foraging and hiding). Individual differences, even in superficially related traits (apathy-anhedonia and anxiety-compulsive checking) reliably mapped onto unique behaviours. Worse task performance, due to maladaptive checking, was linked to gender (women checked excessively) and specific anxiety-related traits: somatic anxiety (reduced self-reported checking due to worry) and compulsivity (self-reported disorganized checking). While anhedonia decreased self-reported task engagement, apathy, strikingly, improved overall task performance by reducing excessive checking. In summary, we provide a novel multifaceted paradigm for assessment of checking for threat in a naturalistic task which is sensitive to both moods as they change throughout the task and clinical dimensions. Thus, it could serve as an objective measurement tool for future clinical studies interested in threat, vigilance or behaviour-emotion interactions in contexts requiring both reward-seeking and threat-avoidance.",

In this commentary, I critically review studies on changes in specific behaviours and general behavioural activation in depression resulting from future thinking interventions, as well as behavioural activation therapy. I question the necessity of changing behaviour and discuss several ways in which future thinking interventions might disrupt core depressive psychopathology, including updating generalised outcome expectancies, reducing cognitive immunisation, and increasing the perception of future possibilities. Finally, I offer suggestions for how future thinking interventions might more effectively test the mechanisms through which they alleviate depression.",

We examined color qualia structures in children (3–12-year-old in Japan and 6–8-year-old in China) and compared these with those of Japanese adults. Approximately half of the assessed 3-year-old children completed the experiment via our touch panel device version of the task and had reliable responses. Despite known developmental and/or cultural effects of color term usage, we found that color qualia structures were quite similar across the age groups and cultures. Our finding supports the view that color qualia structures emerge early.

          "abstract": "An interdisciplinary approach is pursued in establishing foundational theoretical and conceptual \nframeworks in review of Alzheimer’s disease. Greater emphasis is placed on conceptually \nevaluating the disease from a psychological perspective. Dr. Carl Jung’s work on cognitive \nprocesses are applied and enhanced. Interpersonal social dynamics are considered in \ncoordination with psychological profiles and constituent elements thereof. Anticipatory trends, \nmethodology, and focus for future research are also discussed. Potential new methods and \ntechniques of examining and modelling the disease from the perspective of psychological \nprofiles are explored, and details regarding advanced research initiatives stemming from these \nframeworks are introduced. This paper is primarily a work of conceptual modelling to provide \nenhanced focus and detail relating to research variables of interest for further evaluation. \nEmpirical studies require more advanced resources and facilities for examination of the \nconceptual frameworks detailed in this paper. This paper renders a comprehensive analysis \nregarding interdisciplinary considerations and research directions through the establishment of \nfoundational frameworks, models, and methods.",

          "authors": "Edward Mellor; Lowri Harrison",
          "abstract": "We propose a predictive coding model of psychosis centred on precision-weighted Bayesian inference. Either over-precise priors or under-precise likelihoods result in posteriors strongly biased towards priors. When existing beliefs no longer account for changes in the world novel beliefs must arise to explain these changes and are themselves held with abnormal confidence.\nChanges in the world feel simultaneously familiar and strange, thinking about the changes makes my thoughts feel similarly paradoxical. If a Bayesian system under extremes of precision saw such a causational paradox, it would be forced to decide was that familiar but strange action done by me but controlled from afar or was that action from the environment and directed against me. Thus, the widespread positive symptoms become bayes optimal resolutions of the paradox as it pertains to thoughts, sensations, movement, and affect. A self-reinforcing process leads to a failure state when beliefs and perceptions become one; if a Bayesian system believes both my actions cause reality and reality causes my actions then it must do nothing, catatonia.\nThe paper demonstrates how a healthy model could itself become high precision as an initially adaptive response to trauma. By doubling down on our beliefs about the world we can prevent trauma from changing the way we view it, but as the world keeps changing, a tsunami of high precision spreads from the initial schism.",

          "authors": "Maureen Murdoch; Barbara Clothier; Siamak Noorbaloochi",
          "abstract": "Background: Health care managers rely heavily on measures derived from administrative data to monitor and manage their enrollees’ health. There are very few administrative measures of psychiatric illness severity, however, and most either comingle demographics and medical comorbidities or do not have ordinal properties.\nObjective: To assess the construct, concurrent, and predictive validity of a novel, 6-item, ordinal, administrative measure of psychiatric severity, the Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index (MoPSI).\nMethods: Panel study of 960 gender-stratified, nationally representative Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, or New Dawn Veterans who had a pending disability claim for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 6 input items for the MoPSI were number of mental health clinic visits, emergency department visits or psychiatric hospitalizations in the past 6 months; and the presence of any diagnosis for alcohol use, substance use, or self-harm in the past 6 months. We used 4 scoring approaches based on classical test theory, item-response theory, joint probability density (JPD) method, and a linear approximation of the JPD method. With all approaches, higher MoPSI scores indicate severer psychiatric severity.\nResults: The four scoring approaches correlated 0.976 – 0.999. Regardless of scoring approach, in terms of construct validity, Veterans who were unmarried or had low income had higher MoPSI scores than Veterans who were married or had higher incomes, respectively (Ps &lt;.03). In terms of concurrent validity, Veterans with serious mental illness or a PTSD diagnosis also had higher MoPSI scores than their respective counterparts (Ps ≤ .0001). In terms of predictive validity, higher MoPSI scores predicted cigarette use, street drug use, and PTSD and depression/anxiety symptom severity six months later, as well as disability award status approximately 1 year later (Ps ≤ .05).  \nConclusions: The MoPSI appears to be a very well calibrated set of 6 input variables with evidence of construct, concurrent, and predictive validity. Because it has interval and ordinal properties, it is suitable for use as either a predictor variable or an outcome variable in regression analyses, and it avoids collinearity with sociodemographic variables or with medical comorbidities. The MoPSI may be a useful administrative measure of mental health.\nTrial Registration: Not applicable. \n\nKey Words: Manifestations of Psychiatric Severity Index; Psychometrics; Validity; Administrative Data; Population Health; Mental Health",

Here we present a systematic overview of three sex-related risk pathways. We assessed 16 risk factors as well as 3-month PTSD severity in a prospective cohort (n=2924) of acutely traumatized individuals and investigated potential mediators in the pathway between sex and PTSD severity using multiple mediation analysis with regularization. Six risk factors were more prevalent/severe in women, and none was more pronounced in men. Analyses showed that acute stress disorder, neuroticism, lifetime sexual assault exposure, anxiety sensitivity, and pre-trauma anxiety symptoms fully mediated and uniquely contributed to the relationship between sex and PTSD severity. Our results demonstrate different risk mechanisms for women and men. Such knowledge can inform targeted interventions. Our systematic approach to differential risk pathways can be transferred to other mental disorders to guide sex-sensitive mental health research.",

The idea that Cognitive Science research should or could describe normative human cognition is a misleading waste of time for the field. I draw on work from a wide range of fields, including psychology, medicine, disability studies, and biology, to contend that the idea of normative human cognition is mostly useless but not mostly harmless.

          "abstract": "As governments and institutions embrace well-being as a policy outcome, aggregating well-being in a population has become commonplace. The default method used to aggregate population well-being is taking the arithmetic mean (average). However, the default of using average well-being as a key performance indicator, while useful, can omit morally relevant information, like the extent of suffering and inequality. Based on a 0-10 point scale of life satisfaction, we examine three alternative methods of well-being aggregation grounded in the ethical theories of: prioritarianism (a weighted average that weighs lower scores heavier), sufficientarianism (the proportion of respondents answering below a ‘suffering’ threshold), and egalitarianism (the degree of inequality) and compare them to the average. Using the Gallup World Poll’s nationally representative data from over 1 million participants in 144 countries from 2019 to 2022, we found that the distribution of life satisfaction deviated significantly from a normal distribution in all countries, suggesting that using the mean and standard deviation cannot adequately capture the full distribution. After reranking countries according to alternative aggregation methods, we find that 17% of the time countries ranked using the Gini coefficient deviate by at least 20 ranks from the default average rankings. Finally, we observed that 27% of the time, increases in average well-being at the country level are accompanied by a rising gap between the top 90th and bottom 10th life satisfaction percentile. Our findings show the limitation in using the average and offer alternatives that are aligned with promoting equitable well-being growth.",

Using a cued-recall task, we\nobserved across three experiments that increasing the number of learned word pairs slowed\nretrieval times (RTs) and reduced retrieval accuracy. This effect was modulated by context: set\nsize effects did not extend across multiple, unrelated lists. Semantic similarity between cues\nand targets consistently facilitated retrieval, independent of set size. Experiment 2 revealed no\neffect of additional visual context cues on RTs, while Experiment 3 demonstrated that larger\nsemantic contexts hindered recall, leading to slower RTs and lower accuracy compared to unre-\nlated lists.

          "authors": "Lachlan Kent; Suzanne Dick; Maja Havrilova; Stephen Carbone",
          "abstract": "Background: The mental health of young people in Australia and other nations has declined dramatically over the last decade and a half. While an increase in youth mental healthcare services is needed to meet rising demand, on its own, this is unlikely to reverse the concerning trend. A greater focus on prevention is needed.\nAims:  This article aims to propose an innovative, theoretically-grounded approach to prevention that complements more common population-based (i.e., changing risk and protective factors) and targeted (i.e., supporting individuals with subthreshold symptoms of mental illness) approaches. Aligned with the dual-continua model of mental health (i.e., where mental well-being and ill-health are distinct dimensions of overall mental health), this third approach focuses on addressing low levels of mental wellbeing, which is both a significant predictor of future mental ill-health and a distressing and disabling state that requires intervention in its own right. \nRecommendations: Large-scale screening for low mental wellbeing, using psychometrically sound tools, could be conducted online and through schools, higher education, and primary care services. Those with low mental wellbeing could be linked to community services offering evidence-based interventions. This approach is likely to carry less stigma and may be easier to achieve than targeting those with subthreshold symptoms through clinical services.\nConclusions: The dire state of youth mental health is an urgent call-to-action to adopt novel approaches to address this crisis. We need to make better use of the available evidence and tools at-hand to strengthen our focus on low mental wellbeing, not just mental ill-health.",

The review was reported according to the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were entered in the extraction phase. The results showed that inclusion is still understood and, thus, implemented, mainly as integration of students with SEN in general music lessons. Analysis of the original studies highlighted beneficial practices for the participation and learning of students with SEN, such as student-centered pedagogy, peer-interaction strategies, co-teaching and collaboration, and various methods or pedagogical approaches (e.g., Dalcroze-based music education). Also, some challenges of inclusive pedagogy were met, such as in situations of lack of resources or specific training for music teachers implementing inclusive music lessons. This systematic review brings together the latest research on inclusive music education to increase understanding of how inclusive music education can be implemented. This in turn will help music and special education teachers by showing research-based guidelines for arranging the pedagogical practices more inclusively and discussing the critical points in implementing inclusive music education.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that current mental fatigue and self-control capacity play a crucial role in the goal-directed regulation of emotion, motivation, and cognition. However, whether the emergence of fatigue during the exercise of cognitive performance is indicative of individuals’ time-stable fatigue vulnerability traits is still not well understood. In this longitudinal study, we repeatedly measured the self-reported perceived control capacity of N = 2,094 trainees over the course of working on three separate, 140-minute-long standardized achievement tests in mathematics and science. These tests were administered at the beginning of trainees’ vocational education and training, prior to their intermediate exams, and before their final exams. In all three testing sessions, participants’ control capacity declined over time, which indicated increasing mental fatigue. The intercepts and slopes of three latent growth-curves loaded on two higher-order fatigue vulnerability trait factors representing the interindividual variabilities in individuals’ stable aspects of pre-task control capacity (control preparedness) and its change over time (fatigue resistance). Further, we examined the relationships of both fatigue trait factors and self-reported personality traits, as well as objectively assessed fluid intelligence and general achievement test performances. The strongest predictors of control preparedness were conscientiousness, neuroticism, and fluid intelligence, whereas fatigue resistance was predicted exclusively by neuroticism and conscientiousness. Individuals with higher levels of control preparedness tended to outperform others in achievement testing. Post-hoc power analyses provide evidence for the high statistical power of the results. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for personality research on mental fatigue effects in performance situations.",

          "abstract": "Finding an optimal decision-making strategy requires a careful balance between the competing demands of accuracy and urgency.In experimental settings, researchers are typically interested in whether people can optimise this trade-off, typically operationalised as reward rate, with evidence accumulation models serving as the key framework to determine whether people are performing optimally. However, recent studies have suggested that inferences about optimality can be highly dependent on the task design, meaning that inferences about whether people can achieve optimality may not generalise across contexts.Here, we investigate one fundamental, though typically overlooked, design factor: whether participants spend a fixed amount of time on each block (fixed-time) or have a fixed number of trials in each block (fixed-trials), with researchers typically assuming that people are better able to optimize reward rate under fixed-time conditions. Across three experiments, our results consistently indicate that people are at least as good at optimising reward rate under fixed-trial conditions as fixed-time conditions, and potentially even better under fixed-trial conditions. Importantly, these findings both challenge the common assumption within reward rate optimality research regarding the superiority of fixed-time study designs, and further emphasise the importance of carefully considering study design factors when making inferences about optimality in decision-making.",

CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder-setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (N=600) we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder-usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as OCD.",

          "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in analyzing the effects of educational programs on outcomes using process data from computer-based testing and learning environments. However, most analyses focus on final outcomes measured at the end of a test or session, overlooking their functional nature over time. Such analyses fail to capture the dynamic causal mechanisms associated with functional outcomes. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel causal mediation framework for identifying and estimating functional natural direct effects, functional natural indirect effects, and functional total effects, along with their subgroup effects. Building on the literature on causal mediation and moderation, we define these effects using potential outcomes and provide nonparametric identification strategies. We then develop estimation methods using generalized additive models, a flexible and robust tool for analyzing functional data. Through a simulation study, we assess the finite-sample performance of the proposed approach by comparing it to parametric regression methods. We also demonstrate our approach by examining the effects of extended time accommodations on two functional outcomes—test scores and item access—using process data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Our mediation approach with functional outcomes effectively captures the dynamic causal mechanisms underlying the program's effects and pinpoints when and for whom each effect manifests throughout the testing period.",

Multivariate Behavioral Research. https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2019.1647822.  Accelerated longitudinal designs (ALDs) are designs in which participants from different cohorts provide repeated measures covering a fraction of the time range of the study. ALDs allow researchers to study developmental processes spanning long periods within a relatively shorter time framework. The common trajectory is studied by aggregating the information provided by the different cohorts. Latent change score models (LCS) provide a powerful analytical framework to analyze data from ALDs. With developmental data, LCS models can be specified using measurement occasion as the time metric. This provides a number of benefits, but has an important limitation: It makes it not possible to characterize the longitudinal changes as a function of a developmental process such as age or biological maturation. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extension of an occasion-based LCS model that includes age differences at the first measurement occasion. We conducted a Monte Carlo study and compared the results of including different transformations of the age variable. Our results indicate that some of the proposed transformations resulted in accurate expectations for the studied process across all the ages in the study, and excellent model fit. We discuss these results and provide the R code for our analysis.",

In the current study, why some activities are more likely to be carried out by one sex over the other was examined. Japanese participants who participated in the online survey evaluated each of the 50 activities in terms of four criteria: risk of injury or death, physical effort, how much they would like to do the activity, and which sex should do the activity. When they rated the activities, they were not given information on whether each activity was mainly carried out by men or women in the 185 societies. Activities that were mainly carried out by men in the 185 societies tended to be rated as having a higher risk and being more physically demanding. There was also a tendency for both men and women to think that such activities should be carried out by men. Although both men and women wanted to engage in activities that were mainly carried out by women in the 185 societies, there was a sex difference in that women wanted to engage in such activities more than men.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive Warfare takes advantage of novel developments in technology and science to influence how target populations think and act. Establishing adequate defense against Cognitive Warfare requires examination of modus operandi to understand this emerging action space. This includes the goals and methods that can be realized through science and technology. Recent literature suggests that both human and nonhuman cognition should be considered as targets of Cognitive Warfare. There are currently no frameworks allowing for a unified way of conceptualizing short-term and long-term Cognitive Warfare goals and attack methods that are domain- and species-agnostic. There is a need for a framework developed through a bottom-up approach that is informed by neuroscientific principles to capture relevant aspects of cognition. The framework should be at a level of complexity that is actionable to decision-makers in war. In this paper, we attempt to cover the existing gap by proposing the Unplug, Corrupt, disOrganize, Diagnose, Enhance (UnCODE) system for classifying the goals and methods of Cognitive Warfare. The system is neurocentric by conceptualizing Cognitive Warfare goals from the perspective of how adversarial methods relate to neural information processing in an individual or society. The UnCODE system identifies five main classes of goals: 1) Eliminating a target’s ability to produce outputs, 2) degrading a target’s capacity to process inputs and produce outputs, 3) biasing a target’s input-output activity, 4) monitoring and understanding the input-output relationships in targets, and 5) enhancing a target’s capacity and ability to process inputs and produce outputs. Methods can be divided in two categories based on access to the target’s neural system: direct access and indirect access. The UnCODE system is domain- and species-agnostic and allows for interdisciplinary commensurability when communicating attack paths across domains. In sum, the UnCODE system is a unifying framework that captures that multiple methods can be used to reach the same Cognitive Warfare goals.",

          "abstract": "By building a mental model of how the world works and using it to forecast the outcomes of different actions, a learner can make flexible choices in changing environments. However, while children and adolescents readily acquire structured knowledge about their environments, relative to adults, they tend to demonstrate weaker signatures of leveraging this knowledge to plan actions. One explanation for these developmental differences is that using a mental model to prospectively simulate potential choices and their outcomes is computationally costly, taxing cognitive control and working memory mechanisms that continue to develop into adulthood. Here, we ask whether children might effectively leverage structured knowledge to make flexible choices by relying on two alternative strategies that do not require costly mental simulation at choice time. First, through offline replanning, models can be queried before the time of choice to generate possible scenarios and update the values of potential actions. Second, an abstracted predictive model, known as a Successor Representation, can be built and harnessed to enable simplified computation of long-run reward values of candidate actions, without requiring iterative simulation of multiple time steps. To assess whether children, adolescents, and adults aged 7 - 23 years similarly harness these learning strategies, we ran three experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, we used a reward revaluation task in which we manipulated the opportunity for offline replanning during rest, and found that children flexibly updated their behavior by leveraging structured knowledge in an adult-like manner. Surprisingly, across age, rest did not mediate flexible replanning, raising the possibility that participants may have behaved adaptively by harnessing predictive representations online. In Experiment 3, we directly tested whether children use predictive representations. Here, we observed early-emerging use of the SR, providing a mechanistic account of how children use structured knowledge to guide choice without detailed model-based simulation.",

          "abstract": "Research on individual differences in executive functions has often used a manual version of the anti-saccade task to measure cognitive inhibition. Here, we investigated the validity of anti-saccade performance as a measure of inhibition. Success in this task relies on several processes: Inhibition of a saccade to the cue location; translating the cue location into the target location; making a saccade to the target location; and rapid identification of the target stimulus. In two experiments (NE1 = 181 and NE2 = 165) we varied whether the task required these processes. We also varied the preparation time before each trial, and the cue-target interval to measure the speed of task-relevant processes. We used a theoretically motivated statistical model to dissociate parameters that reflect the contribution of each process to performance. Individual differences in most of these parameters correlated with observed performance, implying that performance reflects a mixture of several processes. Critically, inhibition accounted for a small proportion of variance in performance. Only the efficiency of translating cue information into the target location was credibly correlated with working-memory capacity and processing speed. These results question the validity of anti-saccade performance as a measure of inhibition.",

However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This review will map existing literature to identify and describe the extent to which Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles of engagement, representation, and expression are applied to the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Introduction: UDL is an education framework that aims to create inclusive learning environments for students with diverse needs. Approximately 25% of Australian students are likely to live with language, literacy, and/or learning differences that place them at elevated risk of mental health problems. Many school-based mental health programs exist with the shared aim of promoting positive outcomes for students.  Early prevention and mental health promotion efforts that are inclusive to students with language and/or learning differences are critically important. However, there has been no previous exploration of the extent to which UDL has been applied to school-based mental health programs. This review aims to identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in existing Australian school-based mental health programs. Eligibility criteria: This review will consider studies that report the development and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs within an Australian education context. This review will exclude non-English studies, reviews, books, and theoretical or opinion pieces. Methods: This review will be informed by the JBI guidelines for scoping reviews and will be conducted between October and December 2024. Five databases will be searched (PsycInfo, Medline, Informit, Scopus, and ERIC) and two reviewers will independently screen all identified studies against inclusion criteria by title, abstract, and full text review. Conflicts will be resolved by consensus. Results: Two independent reviewers will extract relevant data from the selected studies and results will be presented numerically and narratively.  The review will identify and describe the extent to which UDL principles are evident in descriptions of the design, delivery, and/or evaluation of school-based mental health programs in Australia. Synthesis and interpretation of included studies will be framed within the three principles of UDL. The review will outline key findings of the included papers, gaps in the literature, and salient directions for future research. Conclusion: The outcomes of this review will be disseminated via publication and plain language summaries. The outcomes may also inform conference presentations relevant to inclusive education, mental health, and child language and learning differences.",

          "abstract": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to appropriately generalize past experiences to new scenarios. Organizing concepts into categories allows the brain to generalize learned stimulus-reward contingencies to new stimuli within  the same category. However, when category membership does not fully predict associated rewards, the brain needs to balance generalizing values within categories and discriminating value differences among individual items. How do generalization and discrimination in reward learning develop throughout lifespan as semantic knowledge is gradually acquired? Using a probabilistic reward learning task with a hierarchical value structure organized by semantic categories, we found children can generalize values of stimuli based on semantic categories at least as early as three to four years old. Furthermore, age-related performance improvement is explained by a combination of increased decision certainty, decreased initial exploration, change in memory retention, and a reduced categorical learning rate.",

We consider change from Wave 8 (2016-17) to Wave 10 (2020-22) of the European Social Survey (ESS). Climate consciousness increased overall, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. Politicisation of climate change increased mostly in Western Europe, where it increased more on the left, and for left-wing party voters, than on the right. Populist-Right parties were distinctive in the relative stability of climate consciousness among their voters. Our results show increased politicisation of climate change attitudes within Western European countries, but also convergence between polities of the East and West at higher levels of climate consciousness, which may affect EU climate policy making.",

Quality signals from cultural intermediaries significantly increase loans, especially among individuals with high levels of cultural capital. This challenges the emphasis on the detached aesthetic dispositions of the cultural elite in Bourdieu’s theory on cultural distinction. Second, higher cultural legitimacy does not increase signal impact. This questions the assumption that cultural intermediaries mobilize cultural legitimacy to consecrate cultural products. An equally important function of cultural intermediaries might be to inform and engage receptive audiences.

This allows for evaluating CSR trends and their relationship to financial and business performance.\nThe findings indicate substantial improvements in both the quantity and quality of CCB’s CSR disclosures during the review period. The data shows a significant rise in green financing, demonstrating CCB's commitment to environmental sustainability, along with improvements in employee diversity, marked by an increased proportion of younger staff and minority staff. The correlation analysis highlights a positive relationship between CSR initiatives and financial outcomes, suggesting that CSR is a crucial factor in driving business success. This research provides a comprehensive analysis of a decade of CSR practices in a leading Chinese commercial bank, emphasizing the importance of regulatory frameworks in guiding CSR activities and demonstrating the positive impact of CSR on financial performance. \nThe insights derived from this study offer valuable implications for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers interested in CSR practices within the banking sector.",

          "abstract": "The advent of new generation language models has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) due to their exceptional understanding and human language generation capabilities. ChatGPT emerged as an essential model with remarkable strengths for various applications. DeepSeek has recently emerged as the latest advancement in NLP, showing great potential in pure text-generation jobs, semantic analysis, and context-dependent language modeling capabilities. The study investigates and compares the performance of DeepSeek and ChatGPT in assessing adult L2 (second language) acquisition errors applied primarily to South Asian Arabic learners. With this premise, we aim to evaluate their efficacy in detecting linguistic inaccuracies (morphology, syntax, semantics) and diagnosing cases of L1 (first language). Methods include error analysis of non-native Arabic sentences, comparative evaluation of the two models, and contrasting assessment of depth of reasoning. Results show that DeepSeek was significantly better at context-driven error detection (for instance, in detecting SOV word-order transfer), and ChatGPT presented more instructively relevant feedback. However, both needed fine-tuned prompts to bring in feedback related to semantic/pragmatic errors, such as missing articles and dialectal mismatches. Contributions include a proposal for integrating AI tools into L2 pedagogy, emphasizing contrastive drill and sociolinguistic awareness, and recommendations for training AI concerning L1-targeted error profiles. This research pushes the integration of AI into language instruction for scalable solutions for adult L2 learners while pointing at improvements needed in the models.",

Advertisers are concerned that such retargeting prohibition policies could lead to a reduction in ads' click probability, thereby affecting their bidding valuations. Bid data from a demand-side platform (DSP) reveals that the bid valuations for non-retargeted impressions are more than 60% lower than those for retargeted ones. However, since the retargeting status is only observed for bids winning the internal auction at the DSP, we need to correct the selection bias. To address this, we develop an internal auction model and structurally estimate the advertisers' CPC and CTR. Counterfactual simulations using the estimate indicate the expected bid reduces by 38.10% on average if retargeting is prohibited compared to the scenario with the industry-average retargeting prevalence.",

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises — or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories and emphasizing the social importance of the future as well as theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. With this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to unify and enhance the study of the social world, offering new insights about its complexities.",

This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate–and extend–prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the PPI correlation as a measure of interchangeability and derive the effective sample size for PPI.

          "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping education by introducing tools that enhance teaching methodologies, personalize learning, and streamline administrative tasks. However, adoption of these tools remains uneven, raising concerns about disparities in AI literacy and competency across geographic regions and educational contexts. Here we investigate the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) educators in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau—professionals uniquely positioned to benefit from and highlight barriers to GenAI integration. Using survey data, we assess four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-country variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support. Our findings highlight the critical need for targeted strategies that mitigate these emerging gaps in AI literacy, competency, and professional development.",

          "authors": "Valerio Simoni; Jérémie Voirol",
          "abstract": "The comparative analysis of Ecuadorian and Cuban migrants’ recent experiences of return to their respective countries of origin, notably from Spain and other European countries affected by the global financial crisis, highlights significant convergences in the areas of everyday life that become key sources of moral concern and deliberation. Among these are the economic activities and relations that migrants develop upon returning, which are heavily invested by moral reasoning and critique. The economic life of returnees garners much attention among local residents, who focus on it to assess the transformative potential of migration and to appraise migrants’ reincorporation of, and effects on Ecuadorian and Cuban society. In turn, returnees elaborate on how their life in Europe has affected their economic subjectivities, practices, and ideals. Such assessments lead them to reevaluate the place and nature of the ‘economic’ and its relation to ‘culture’ and ‘society’. Looking at how specific moral concerns and deliberations emerge and circulate with migratory trajectories, we argue, is a productive way to uncover their transformative effects and power differentials. By focusing on why and how specific domains of life are morally teased out and charged, we gain new insights on how migratory experiences reshape people’s ways of being, their ideals of a good life, and the contexts and situations in which they become entangled.",

          "abstract": "So-called ‘predatory’ publishing is often framed as an issue of unethical journal practices, but this perspective overlooks deeper structural problems in scholarly communication. The reliance on blacklists as a primary solution to identifying questionable journals fails to acknowledge the complexity of academic publishing and the broader systemic issues that contribute to unethical or controversial publishing practices. These include not only so-called ‘predatory’ journals but also concerns such as ‘special issue-ization’ and the rise of paper mills. Furthermore, the strategies used by emerging open-access mega-publishers increasingly resemble those employed by traditional and hybrid publishers, demonstrating that questionable practices are not confined to a single category of journals. This research in progress critically examines the characteristics of journals labeled as so-called ‘predatory’ and questions the effectiveness of static blacklists in scholarly assessment. Using a dataset of 2,755 journals from Predatory Reports, we systematically analyze their ISSN registration, subject classifications, accessibility, financial models, editorial transparency, and indexing status. While we recognize the limitations of blacklists, this dataset provides a basis for exploring broader patterns in academic publishing. Preliminary findings reveal that 24% of the journals became inaccessible after being listed, suggesting that some publishers shut down or rebrand to evade scrutiny. While ISSN registration is not mandatory, 13% of the journals in the dataset do not have one, which may indicate variations in registration practices. The geographical distribution of these journals is concentrated in India (31.45%), Switzerland (30.17%), and the United States (21.36%). This distribution highlights the global nature of these practices, spanning a range of publication models. The study also finds that 71% of these journals charge Article Processing Charges (APCs), while 23.7% fail to disclose APCs before submission, creating financial uncertainty for authors. Rather than indiscriminately covering all fields, many journals now focus on STEM disciplines. These findings underscore the need for more nuanced, criteria-based evaluation frameworks that account for the complexities of scholarly publishing, moving beyond binary categorizations of journals as ‘predatory’ or legitimate.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that concurrent and sequential self-administered mixed-mode designs both have advantages and disadvantages in terms of panel survey recruitment and maintenance. Since concurrent mixed-mode designs usually achieve higher initial response rates at lower bias than sequential mixed-mode designs, the former may be ideal for panel recruitment. However, concurrent designs producea high share of paper respondents relative to web respondents. Since these paper respondents have been found to be at higher risk of attrition, cause higher data collection costs, and slow down the fieldwork process, sequential mixed-mode designs may be more practical in the regular course of the panel study after recruitment. Our study provides experimental evidence on the effect of switching a panel study from concurrent to sequential mixed-mode design after the panel recruitment. Results show that this switch significantly increases the share of online respondents without harming response rates. Respondents who are pushed to the web by the design change differ significantly from respondents who continue to participate via paper questionnaires with regard to a number of socio-digital inequality correlates. This suggests that, while the share of online respondents can be increased through mode sequencing, keeping the paper mail mode option is vital for ensuring continued representation od societal subgroups.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \n\n This article presents relevant portions transcribed concerning the h index from the podcast of Professor Brian Keating with Professor Jorge Hirsch (the originator of the h index). The conversations in the podcast conclude that the h index is a social phenomenon prone to gamification. The second transcribe is a podcast by physicist Sabine Hossenfelder, pointing out the social inequalities created by citation scams and cartels. This results in a new class of elites' \"citaelites\". This article explains how Pierre Bourdieu's inequalities in social capital fit well in interpreting citation cartels. Citations of publications that estimate the h index have resulted in the gamification of metrics, a social capital tool for acquiring economic capital for faculty entry and funding. The gamification of the h index bolts perfectly to Pierre Bourdieu's cold realities of social inequalities. Either abolish the h index or use an artificial intelligence filter to purge the citation scams and cartels to reveal the validated h index for the righteous to enter or rise in the steep academic hierarchy.",

          "abstract": "We use cultural evolutionary models to examine how individual experiences and culturally-inherited information jointly shape risk attitudes under environmental uncertainty. We find that learning processes not only generate plausible variation in risk attitudes, but also that conservative learning strategies---emphasizing the preservation of generational knowledge---excel in high-risk environments, promoting stable wealth accumulation and long-term survival but limiting asset growth as conditions improve. In contrast, exploratory learning strategies---leveraging risk-free juvenile exploration and peer influence---foster risk-tolerant attitudes that thrive in affluent, low-risk settings where wealth buffers and social safety nets reduce the costs of miscalculations. Introducing economic stratification to the model reveals how wealth disparities and inter-class interactions reinforce these patterns, exacerbating differences in learning strategies and risk-taking behaviors, and perpetuating socioeconomic inequalities through the cultural inertia of excessive risk aversion. By uniting developmental, social, and evolutionary perspectives, our framework provides a novel lens on the cultural evolution of risk attitudes and their broader societal implications.",

          "abstract": "Computational text analysis has grown in popularity among social scientists due to the massive influx of digitized data. However, connecting text to authorship could be a boon for digital demography and expand the scope of computational text analysis from trends of what is being written toward social patterning of the people producing it. We explore this potential through examinations of a large corpus of college admissions essays (n = 254,820 essays submitted by 83,538 applicants) and show how personal identity markers and ZIP code-level social context data influence large scale processes of textual production. After generating numerical representations of the essays using computational methods, we model the relationships between different identity and spatial characteristics of applicants and their local communities. We find strong relationships between identity and spatial features with the essays. We also find that individuals whose personal identities are spatially unique--that is, demographically different from others in their immediate content--were most likely to be misclassified, indicating that writing is influenced both socially and spatially. This work clarifies how authorship characteristics shape large scale textual production processes, like college admissions, and complements other large scale analyses of text by focusing on authorship rather than purely textual patterns.",

This paper explores the role of critical thinking in UK police public order training and its potential to enhance police professionalism. It examines professionalism through sociological frameworks, aligning the National Decision Model (NDM) used in police training with academic models such as Burch’s Learning Stages of Competence and Leicester’s Four Habits of Thought. The paper argues that embedding critical thinking within public order training enhances ethical decision making, problem solving, and adaptability, thereby reinforcing professional standards. It also considers the impact of recent changes in police entry routes, including a non degree pathway, on the ongoing professionalisation of the police service. Ultimately, the integration of critical thinking into training is deemed essential for advancing UK policing's professionalisation.",

          "abstract": "The current study addresses political party trust and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principle application in Italian regions. Trust in political parties is a principal driving force in governance performance, compliance with policies, and citizen trust in institution-made choices. With political and economic diversity in its regions, Italian regions present a case study for testing whether political institution trust increased creates increased ESG use and whether ESG policies have an impact in shaping political trust in reciprocity. Empirical evidence confirms that in high political trust regions, ESG programs have a high opportunity for effective implementation, particularly in social welfare and conservation of environment. In contrast, political institution trust weakness is accompanied with poor ESG pledges, an expression of inefficient governance and reduced accountability in companies. ESG policies actually have an impact on political trust—effective and transparent ESG actions establish institution trust, but shallow and political ESG actions produce mistrust. The observations have a function of projecting the contribution towards balancing institution trust with sustainability through governance quality. Policymakers can contribute towards leveraging political stability in driving ESG integration in a manner that keeps such programs effective and credible for long-term development in regions and for democratic legitimacy.",

This article explores how feminist issues have been framed and discussed in the Korean press from 1990 to 2022. We examine news articles that mention feminism (peminijeum), gender equality (seong pyeongdeung), and gender discrimination (seong chabyeol) from 54 national, regional, and online news outlets (n = 49,028) and employ a structural topic modelling to identify 17 major topics and shifts in topic trends over time and across press partisanship. When examining coverage longitudinally, our findings suggest that while feminism has gained increasing attention in the Korean press in the last three decades, the focus of the issues has changed substantially. Feminism is less discussed as issues of employment, family system, and education, but more as issues of party politics and elections, gender-friendly policies, and gender conflicts between men and women. Our results also highlight that liberal and conservative press emphasise different issues in their articles on feminism, focusing on preferable issues for their political readership. Our findings suggest a need for press discourse that can shed light on the neglected intersectional aspects of feminism, including class struggles and LGBTQ rights.",

          "abstract": "Regulators and policy makers around the world have endorsed risk-based approaches for governing the challenges and opportunities from Artificial Intelligence (AI). In theory, these assessments should protect the public from the harmful impacts of AI, thus safeguarding important societal values such as the realization of fundamental rights. However, as an anticipatory decision-making tool, the success and legitimacy of risk-based regulatory approaches depend critically on methods that help policymakers and societal stakeholders anticipate how AI may impact a diverse citizenry, the many different ways in which technological change may unfold, and the factors that lead to desirable and less desirable visions of the future. In this paper, we first point out critical flaws in existing assessment methods and regulatory approaches and consequently identify the need for a shift in current approaches to assessment approaches. We call on scholars, policy makers, and the technology industry to engage in anticipatory approaches that go beyond compliance and checklist exercises and acknowledge the responsibility they have for impacts that go beyond what is known. Second, we propose a concrete alternative empirical approach to address our concerns: Scenario-based Sociotechnical Envisioning (SSE). By using SSE, practitioners can make assessments more inclusive, more aware of the socio-technical context in which AI systems are deployed, and more prospective in terms of identifying impacts before they occur. We encourage scientists, policy makers and legislators to use SSE as one method in their assessment toolbox. Third, we anticipate possible objections to our approach and pro-actively discuss how these can be met.",

Despite growing evidence that predicted and observed behavior are often not interchangeable, there is limited guidance on using LLMs to obtain valid estimates of causal effects and other parameters. We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a mixed subjects design. This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate–and extend–prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the PPI correlation as a measure of interchangeability and derive the effective sample size for PPI. We also introduce a power analysis to optimally choose between informative but costly human subjects and less informative but cheap predictions of human behavior. Mixed subjects designs could enhance scientific productivity and reduce inequality in access to costly evidence.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the concept, measurement, principal stylized facts, and theoretical aspects of compositional inequality. Compositional inequality refers to how the shares of capital and labor income vary along the income distribution. This analysis is valuable for several reasons. From a macroeconomic perspective, it elucidates the link between functional and personal distributions of income, which is crucial for addressing the drivers of income inequality in a context rising capital share. From a comparative economic perspective, it locates economic systems on the continuum between two extremes: classical capitalism, where the rich earn predominantly from capital and the poor from labor, and new capitalism, where the composition of capital and labor is uniform across the distribution. We refer to the entire range of systems along this continuum as the distributional varieties of capitalism. Recent empirical studies indicate that, in most countries, we are far from classical capitalism, though with notable exceptions, such as Latin American countries.\n\nThis underscores the need to evaluate the benefits of compositional equality. The paper concludes that compositional equality is desirable for at least two reasons: it promotes fairness and supports an inclusive, profit-driven regime of accumulation and growth.

This report aims at providing a definitional framework for this value by drawing upon the domains of philosophy, political science and psychology, examining solidarity practices, including EU responses to major current crises in the EU. This report also provides options on how solidarity can be fostered through educational policies and practices. Among other aspects of the complexity surrounding solidarity, this report discusses the levels, longitudinal variation, and relevance as a political desideratum in democratic societies. This report also examines how solidarity relates to other sociological and psychological concepts, such as social identity, altruism, and social norms. Findings indicate the need to look at intergenerational solidarity and the salience of solidarity in discussions concerning the welfare state, the economy, migration, the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, to cite some current concerns that are high on public and political agendas. In education, we find that instilling the value of European solidarity, among other common values, is key for the European integration project. We therefore recommend pursuing policies to foster solidarity at all levels and, with particular reference to Education in particular, to include solidarity education in school curricula in support of the promotion of European values.",

Despite its influence, comprehensive empirical data on the organization remains scarce. We address this gap by systematically documenting 20,205 public events hosted by the Society from 1984 to 2024, with substantive coverage from 2007 onward.\n\nMethods: Following ethical best practices in data collection and ownership, we gathered event metadata—including titles, dates, locations, sponsors, topics, and speakers—via web scraping from the Federalist Society’s archives. The dataset is structured to facilitate analysis of event trends, co-speaking networks, and thematic shifts over time. To ensure data integrity, we performed validation, deduplication, and cleaning, resulting in a well-structured, high-quality dataset.\n\nConclusions: This dataset provides an empirical foundation for examining the Federalist Society’s role in legal discourse. It is a resource for scholars in law, political science, sociology, gender studies, network science, and computational social science, enabling investigations into key themes of discussion, event participation patterns, demographic diversity, professional backgrounds, and more. Researchers can use it to study institutional influence, legal networks, and the evolution of conservative legal thought.",

In other words, mindbody responses are highly influenced by\nthe environmental conditions and cultural interpretations of the meaning-maker involved in the\nresponse and its midbody consequences. Individuals can be extroverted with family and\nintroverted with strangers, emotional openness is valued in one culture and discouraged in another,\ncollectivism vs individualist influences in cultural perception, and so on.\nThe Centenarian Consciousness Index (CCI) is a 60 questions assessment instrument derived from\nover 20 years of ethnographic content analysis of healthy centenarians (100 years or older),\nincluding collectivist and individualist Eastern and Western cultures. Each question is measured\nwith a five-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree to strongly agree.” As it relates to\ncorrelating biological longevity markers (micro-assessment) and mindbody patterns of perceiving\nand emoting the world (macro-assessment), the (CCI) measures 4 perceptual and 4 emotional\nfactors common to centenarians from most cultures, expressed during favorable as well as adverse\nconditions, independent of cultures, capturing the unique ways they perceive and emote their inner\nand outer world.",

          "authors": "Marianne Hem Eriksen; Brian Costello",
          "abstract": "The drunk and frenzied Viking is a trope in line with associated stereotypes of blood-thirsty warriors and senseless violence. However, enough evidence remains to suggest that intoxication due to alcohol, and perhaps other psychoactive substances, was integral to many aspects of life in the Late Iron/Viking Ages. After all, apparently there is no other word for ‘sober’ in Old Norse than ódrukkin — ‘un-drunk’. Viking bodies were, in many ways, bodies of intoxication. One of the aspects of life that alcohol permeates is ritual practice.\n\nTo the extent that this has been studied, the use of alcohol conventionally links to ideas of frenzied warriors and berserkers, or with feasting. Some research over the last few decades has related intoxicants to ritual practices, specifically that of the völva — the female ritual specialist (e.g. Price 2019). More broadly Germanic work has centered élite drinking culture and the role of the ‘lady with the mead-cup’ (Enright 1996) and the female leader of the household as a powerbroker, mediating power relationships within the warrior-band through pouring of alcohol. What Iron and Viking age studies have not contemplated in much detail so far, is the fundamentally material and embodied process of making and ingesting alcohol or other psychoactives by taking them into and incorporating them with the body, generating specific embodied reactions in specific settings. Drawing on seminal work in anthropology and philosophy, this paper centers alcohol as a form of material culture, providing tangible sets of sensory experiences, but ultimately destined to be destroyed through the process of ingestion.",

          "authors": "Tobias Rüttenauer; Felix Bader; Ingmar Ehler; Henning Best",
          "abstract": "Despite ongoing debates on environmental justice, the link between selective residential migration and the unequal exposure to environmental hazards remains underexplored. Previous research has often relied on spatially aggregated data and focused on single-country analyses, limiting our understanding of broader patterns. We address this gap using longitudinal household-level data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and the German Socio-Economic Panel linked to air pollution estimates (NO2, PM2.5, and SO2). We find that immigrant minorities are exposed to higher levels of air pollution at their place of residence. The overall disadvantage faced by immigrant minorities in England is three times as large as in Germany. Given that immigrant households start under initially higher levels of air pollution, one would expect convergence with non-immigrant populations over time due to residential moves. However, immigrants face a substantial penalty when moving. If native households started in similar neighbourhoods as immigrants -- the relevant counterfactual -- they would experience higher gains from relocation. Socio-economic factors cannot explain these differences. The pattern holds in both England and Germany, although inequalities in residential mobility are more pronounced in England. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities, such as Bangladeshi, Caribbean and African migrants in England and Turkish migrants in Germany, experience the largest environmental disadvantages.",

          "abstract": "The Sulu Archipelago, nestled between Mindanao and Borneo, has been a melting pot of people and cultures for thousands of years. Major sociopolitical changes marked its history, attracting groups of people or forcing drastic dispersals. Today, the islands host various ethnolinguistic groups, including Sama-Badjaw and Tausug-speaking communities. We surveyed the literature from multiple disciplines—linguistics, anthropology, archaeology, history, and genetics—to shed light on past movements and the emergence of ethnicities in the region. Three factors drive ethnogenesis in the Sulu Archipelago: niche or economic specialisation, social hierarchies, and assimilation. Economic specialisation initially fostered differentiation among groups inhabiting reef and island ecosystems. The most extreme adaptive strategy was boat-nomadism, whose origin was tied to the evolving sociopolitical order. With the rise of the Sultanate of Sulu, differences in rank and religion were articulated along ethnic lines. The Tausug assumed formal dominance over the surrounding populace, whereas the Sama Dilaut were relegated to society’s periphery. The mid-eighteenth century saw the integration of Sulu within the global trading network which created a labour-driven economy focused on procuring local products. During this period, the Sama Bangingi emerged as specialised maritime raiders who incorporated captive peoples from parts of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. Following the end of foreign imperial control, the peoples of Sulu found themselves subsumed within the modern Philippine state. Social change continues as the Sama Dilaut integrate into the broader Sama milieu, and the rest of the Sulu Archipelago into Filipino society.",

          "abstract": "Studying gender presents unique challenges to data science. Recent work in the spirit of computational social science returns to critical approach to operationalisation providing a fresh perspective on this important topic. In this chapter we highlight works that examines gender computationally, describing how they employ levels of feminist theory to challenge gender inequality at the micro, meso, and macro level. We argue that paying critical attention to how we infer and analyze gender is fruitfully in understanding society and the contributions of research. We also present various sources and methods to infer gender and provide examples of the application of such methods. We conclude by outlining the way forward for computational methods in how gender and intersectional inequality is studied.This is a draft.

          "abstract": "Traditional perspectives on occupational structure often emphasize hierarchical and socio-economic dimensions, typically reducing it to a one-dimensional framework. As noted in much previous research, this simplification may overlook the complexity of critical social issues. We argue that occupational structure is inherently continuous and multidimensional. Building on previous research, we anticipate that it is governed by at least two primary dimensions closely linked to socio-economic status and gender. \n\nOur study analyzes 10,219,276 connections among 95 occupations recorded in the Swedish occupational registry from 2001 to 2013. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS), we explore the patterns of individual mobility to better capture the core features of occupational structure. Our findings challenge the adequacy of simplified models and suggest a more efficient alternative to detailed contemporary approaches like the micro class model and the multiple scales derived from occupational dictionaries.\n\nThe analysis reveals a three-dimensional model of occupational structure, distinguishing three status orders and providing deeper insights into the varied contributions of different occupations. We find that one dimension strongly correlates with socio-economic status, while the connection to gender division is weaker.",

I show that when favourable policy outcomes lead voters to want policy persistence, reelection-seeking politicians seek to appear likely to implement the voters' preferred policy for the future, which need not be their ex-ante preferred one. Political inefficiencies arise whenever the ex-ante preferred policy is sufficiently likely to become unpopular after its implementation and policy learning is valuable enough.",

          "abstract": "This review commemorates the thirtieth anniversary of Minstrels of Soul: Intermodal Expressive Therapy (Knill et al., 1995), a central text in the expressive arts therapy field. Drawing on Paolo J. Knill’s interdisciplinary background in musicology, psychology, and systems theory, the authors propose a model of “intermodal decentering” that integrates multiple art forms—visual art, music, dance, poetry, and drama—into therapeutic practice. Emphasizing “aesthetic responsibility,” the book addresses ethical considerations and underscores the relational power of artistic processes to foster meaningful change. While grounded in the 1990s, its foundational principles resonate with current realities of political polarization, global conflict, and collective trauma, illustrating the continued relevance of an embodied, creative framework. Future directions include deeper cultural adaptation and exploration of digital modalities, yet Minstrels of Soul remains an enduring cornerstone for professionals seeking holistic, arts-based approaches to individual and communal healing.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To examine differences in time use for primary childcare between non-cohabiting and cohabiting mothers and fathers in Germany between 1991/92 and 2022.\nBackground: Facing the task of balancing paid and unpaid work on their own, non-cohabiting parents face different demands and time binds in allocating time for childcare compared to cohabiting parents. Current evidence how this translates into different patterns of time use for childcare is mixed and nonexistent for Germany.\nMethods: We applied OLS regression to estimate non-cohabiting (n=968) and cohabiting (4,486) mothers’ and fathers’ (n=76 and n=4,416, respectively) time use for primary childcare using time diary data of the four surveys of the German Time Use Study from 1991/1992, 2001/2002, 2012/2013, and 2022 (n=10,202 diaries for mothers, and n=8,388 diaries for fathers).\nResults: Non-cohabiting mothers spent more time on primary childcare than cohabiting mothers in 1991/1992, but this negative gradient virtually disappeared and was basically nonexistent since 2001/2002. Non-cohabiting fathers spent more time doing primary childcare than cohabiting fathers, although this finding rested on very small case numbers.\nConclusion: Non-cohabiting mothers did not seem to reduce their time for childcare when compared to cohabiting mothers, whereas non-cohabiting fathers seemed to meet the need of more childcare, compared to cohabiting fathers.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces a novel approach to decomposing population change by identifying the separate contributions of fertility, mortality, net migration, and initial age structure using stable population theory. Its strength lies in the additivity of the results: the contributions of these factors, along with the interaction effect, sum to equal the total population change. In addition, identifying the direct impact of initial age structure on population change offers new insights into the drivers of population dynamics. Central and Eastern Europe was one of the regions hit most by population decline between 1990 and 2020; however, it was marked by significant variation across countries. By decomposing population change, we found that the positive impact of the relatively young initial age structure in the CEE region was as large as the population-reducing effect of negative net migration, while the positive impact of mortality improvement offset one-third of the population-reducing effect of low fertility. On the other hand, the initial age structure had a crucial role in explaining differences in country-level population change during the study period.",

Drawing on previous research and incorporating direct input from practicing teachers, we crafted items that underwent multiple rounds of pilot testing. Psychometric analyses demonstrated strong reliability and validity across diverse samples, highlighting the utility of these scales in identifying specific areas of strength and need within school contexts.

          "abstract": "Anticipating the impacts of new technology in society is at the crux of efforts to understand, advance, and govern its safety. However, doing so is fundamentally difficult. The evolution of various technical, social, policy conditions can modulate the direction of sociotechnical development in uncertain ways. But with prospections of the future come opportunities for agency, control, and forward-looking responsibility that are crucial to orienting stakeholders towards opportunities to steer the technology and be well-prepared to observe, measure, and ultimately evaluate its impact. Written scenarios can support such prospection and effectively serve as orienting devices in supporting strategic decision-making. The goal of scenario writing is not future prediction per se, but rather in helping to perceive potential future outcomes that can then inform what actions can be taken now to steer towards desirable futures.  The breadth and richness of scenarios is enhanced when many diverse perspectives and sets of expertise and experience are brought into the process.  Building on these ideas, in this guidebook we elaborate a method, which we term Scenario-Based Sociotechnical Envisioning (SSE), as we have applied it to study and anticipate the impacts of new AI technologies in society.",
