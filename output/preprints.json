          "title": "The ontological reality of communication: beyond field identity",
          "authors": "Manuel Martín Algarra",
          "abstract": "The ongoing debate over communication’s identity may appear excessive, yet it plays a crucial role by enabling exploration beyond the field, including its core object of study. In communication research, this debate serves as self-reflection, and this article argues that perceived incoherence arises less from a lack of common ground and more from an incomplete grasp of communication’s ontological reality. Drawing on Craig’s constitutive metamodel, Einstein’s reflections on scientific fundamentals, and Cooren’s concepts of materiality and sociality, this article explores the necessity for communication to address its essential nature, similar to other sciences. It concludes that an ontological turn in communication theory is essential to advance beyond current definitional debates and better comprehend how communication constitutes the social world.",

          "title": "Meta-regression to explain shrinkage and heterogeneity in large-scale replication projects",
          "authors": "Rachel Heyard; Leonhard Held",
          "abstract": "Recent large-scale replication projects (RPs) have estimated concerningly low reproducibility rates. Further, they reported substantial degrees of shrinkage of effect size, where the replication effect size was found to be, on average, much smaller than the original effect size. Within these RPs, the included original-replication study-pairs can vary with respect to aspects of study design, outcome measures, and descriptive features of both original and replication study population and study team. This often results in between-study-pair heterogeneity, i.e., variation in effect size differences across study-pairs that goes beyond expected statistical variation. When broader claims about the reproducibility of an entire field are based on such heterogeneous data, it becomes imperative to conduct a rigorous analysis of the amount and sources of shrinkage and heterogeneity within\nand between included study-pairs. Methodology from the meta-analysis literature provides an approach for quantifying the heterogeneity present in RPs with an additive or multiplicative parameter. Meta-regression methodology further allows for an investigation into the sources of shrinkage and heterogeneity. We propose the use of location-scale meta-regressions as a means to directly relate the identified characteristics with shrinkage (represented by the location) and heterogeneity (represented by the scale). This provides valuable insights into drivers and factors associated with high or low reproducibility rates and therefore contextualises results of PRs. The proposed methodology is illustrated using publicly available data from the Replication Project Psychology and the Replication Project Experimental Economics. All analysis scripts and data are available online.",

          "authors": "Tamarinde Laura Haven; John P.A. Ioannidis",
          "abstract": "Reproducibility concerns in biomedical research have persisted for over a decade, with large-scale assessments revealing significant challenges in replicating findings. Despite widespread acknowledgement of these issues, responses remain inconsistent, and proposed solutions often lack rigorous evaluation. This review examines the factors that contribute to irreproducibility in conducting, reporting, and reviewing research and assesses the effectiveness and desirability of interventions aimed at improving reproducibility. It highlights the need for balanced scientific reforms that strengthen reproducibility without stifling innovation or introducing unintended consequences. A critical appraisal of the role of meta-research is essential to ensure sustainable improvements in research quality.",

          "abstract": "Meta-analyses in social science fields face multiple methodological challenges arising from how primary research studies are designed and reported. One challenge is that many primary studies report multiple relevant effect size estimates. Another is selective reporting bias, which arises when the availability of study findings is influenced by the statistical significance of results. Although many selective reporting diagnostics and bias-correction methods have been proposed, few are suitable for meta-analyses involving dependent effect sizes. Among available methods, step-function selection models are conceptually appealing and have shown promise in previous simulations. We study methods for estimating step-function models from data involving dependent effect sizes, focusing specifically on estimating parameters of the marginal distribution of effect sizes and accounting for dependence using cluster-robust variance estimation or bootstrap resampling. We describe two estimation strategies, demonstrate them by re-analyzing data from a synthesis on ego depletion effects, and evaluate their performance through an extensive simulation study under single-step selection. Simulation findings indicate that selection models provide low-bias estimates of average effect size and that clustered bootstrap confidence intervals provide acceptable coverage levels. However, adjusting for selective reporting bias using step-function models involves a bias-variance trade-off, and unadjusted estimates of average effect sizes may be preferable if the strength of selective reporting is mild.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Ewelu; Paul Onyekachi Onyekwelu",
          "abstract": "This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the adoption and user satisfaction of diabetes mobile health apps. This work evaluates six (6) machine learning regressors and employs ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression, including a polynomial regression extension, for hypothesis testing. It is important to note that this research is novel in its use of various machine learning regression models to explore the determinants influencing the adoption of diabetes mobile apps while also considering the user experience journey.\nBy employing machine learning algorithms, particularly a stacked model with ridge regression, the study identifies developer reputation, usability, update frequency, and cost as significant determinants of app downloads, a proxy for adoption rates. The stacked model’s superior predictive accuracy is evidenced by its result of achieving the lowest RMSE (0.4212) and highest adjusted R2 (0.9586), outperforming other models such as Random Forest and XG-Boost. Additionally, user feedback analysis sheds light on the varying levels of user dissatisfaction across different UX stages, with the highest discontent observed during the Churn stage, despite fewer reported pain points.\nThe study’s findings are supported by permutation feature importance analysis, F-statistics, and p-values. Key insights reveal that while update frequency may not greatly influence downloads, ease of use and developer reputation significantly impact user adoption rates. Furthermore, the research delves into business models, revealing that free and premium models are particularly effective in the app market, while regional factors, such as those about Taiwan, also play a crucial role in adoption.\nRecommendations from the study stress the importance of addressing technical glitches, enhancing connectivity and integration with health devices, providing educational content, and focusing on user-centric design. Finally, the paper underlines the need for such a complex approach in app design that puts users' requirements first and proposes to improve the predictive modelling for real-time solutions.",

          "authors": "Mark L. Ruffalo",
          "abstract": "Clinical social workers have long played a foundational role in American mental health care, engaging in psychotherapy and helping shape psychiatric theory and practice. Despite this, the field has grown increasingly skeptical of psychiatric diagnosis, often influenced by concerns about biological reductionism, stigma, and sociopolitical critiques. This paper defends the importance of psychiatric diagnosis in clinical social work, arguing that mental disorders are not mere social constructs but real, empirically demonstrable conditions. Drawing on historical trends in psychiatric diagnosis, particularly through the neo-Kraepelinian movement and the work of Robins and Guze, the paper emphasizes the necessity of accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. It critiques the overuse of comorbid diagnoses and calls for a return to scientifically validated diagnostic practices. Ultimately, clinical social workers must adopt a more balanced perspective—one that integrates scientific realism with critical social awareness—to better serve patients and uphold the integrity of the profession.",

          "title": "Moving Beyond the Biopsychosocial Model in Clinical Social Work",
          "authors": "Mark L. Ruffalo",
          "abstract": "The biopsychosocial model has long served as a foundational framework in clinical social work education and practice, often presented as a comprehensive and integrative approach to understanding mental illness. However, this paper argues that the model, while historically useful in resisting biomedical reductionism, has become conceptually incoherent and clinically misleading. By conflating etiology with treatment and encouraging unprincipled eclecticism, the biopsychosocial model undermines diagnostic clarity and therapeutic specificity. Two clinical examples illustrate how reliance on this framework can lead to ineffective or even harmful interventions. In its place, the paper advocates for methods-based pluralism, a model rooted in accurate diagnosis and treatment selection guided by the nature of the specific disorder. Drawing on the work of Jaspers, Havens, McHugh, Slavney, and Ghaemi, this paper outlines a disciplined alternative to the biopsychosocial model—one that avoids dogmatism without succumbing to conceptual chaos. Particular attention is given to the role of clinical social workers, who are often at the front lines of mental health care and must be equipped to make sound, theory-informed decisions. Methods-based pluralism is proposed as a more coherent, responsible, and sustainable framework for contemporary psychotherapeutic practice.",

          "abstract": "Psychoanalytic interpretation can be viewed through a critical realist lens as a provisional but meaningful approximation of unconscious processes. Critical realism asserts that psychological phenomena exist independently of theory, while acknowledging that our understanding is mediated by clinical and conceptual frameworks. Illustrated by a case of borderline personality disorder, we see how intense idealization–devaluation and abandonment rage reflect reactivated internal object relations, offering testable hypotheses rather than fixed truths. Unlike postmodern models that reduce diagnoses to social narratives, critical realism upholds psychopathology as real and valid yet insists on ongoing refinement of interpretations based on clinical data, theoretical scrutiny, and therapeutic outcomes. This stance preserves psychoanalysis’s interpretive depth and bridges it with broader psychiatric and psychological science, fostering a discipline committed to both meaning and empirical integrity.",

          "abstract": "Dozens of dispositional aggressiveness questionnaires and their idiosyncratic factor structures have been distilled into six factors: Relational, Angry, Violent, Retaliatory, Intimate, and Alcohol Aggression. Do sub-populations exist that fail to replicate these six factors? Factor mixture modeling of these aggressiveness items (N = 1,447 diverse undergraduates) identified three latent profiles characterized by medium (41.12% of sample), high (13.75%), or low (45.13%) levels of all six factors. Like the ‘Big Bang’ the six factors began strongly-correlated in the low aggressiveness profile and then rapidly drifted apart in nomological space among more aggressive profiles. All original factors re-emerged in profile-specific factor analyses, excepting Violent Aggression. Thus, the six-factor model of aggressiveness appears largely robust to population heterogeneity.",

          "authors": "Junqing Huang; Benjamin Straube; Yifei He",
          "abstract": "Gestures convey information at multiple representational layers from raw kinematics to rich social meaning, yet most extant research treats them as a single, binary or categorical cue. Here, we used a novel multilevel priming task combined with drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to test whether gesture comprehension unfolds hierarchically and how prime-gesture congruency is resolved at different levels. Here, participants judged the congruency of static thumbs-up/down targets preceded by one of four prime types that successively increase in abstraction: contour outlines, directional arrows, valence words, and social-scene photographs. Reaction times and accuracy were analysed with repeated-measures ANOVAs; latent decision-making parameters were estimated with DDM. Behaviorally, response times lengthened step-wise from contour to social primes. DDM showed a parallel decline in drift rate indicating progressively slower evidence accumulation, while decision boundary remained stable. Congruency effects were level-specific: incongruent contours decreased drift rate, whereas incongruent word and social primes increased it, suggesting qualitatively different conflict-resolution mechanisms. Our results thus provide the first behavioral-computational evidence that gesture processing is genuinely hierarchical and that conflict monitoring adapts to the representational level at which a mismatch occurs, bridging evolutionary, psycholinguistic, and cognitive-control accounts of multimodal communication. Methodologically, pairing a multilevel gesture paradigm with hierarchical DDM offers a scalable tool for investigating multimodal interaction in both basic research and applied settings.",

          "abstract": "Inspiring statements about creativity from eminent figures circulate on social media and beyond but their psychological impact is unexplored. This research identifies the most popular quotes on creativity, investigates how they relate to individual beliefs about the creative process (role of spontaneous and deliberate ideation) and person (fixed and malleable mindset), and explores their specificity with respect to beliefs beyond creativity. First, through data mining of social media content, study 1 identified 445 unique creativity-tagged quotes attributed to 318 eminent creators like Albert Einstein, Maya Angelou, or Pablo Picasso. Second, study 2 (N = 304) revealed that laypeople show little discrimination between nuanced creativity concepts within quotes but demonstrate general endorsement tendencies, especially when viewing creativity as central to the self, believing that creativity is a malleable skill that can be learned, and preferring flexible thinking in creativity. Finally, study 3 (N = 304) established that creativity quote agreement demonstrates domain-specificity between broad conceptual domains (creativity versus spirituality), reflecting creative self-beliefs more than spirituality-beliefs alongside a domain-general tendency to endorse profound-seeming statements. Findings suggest that creativity quotes may not distinguish specialized creativity beliefs but rather represent the broader perceived value of creativity and thereby serve to reinforce positive beliefs about creativity.",

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Somatic symptoms, including fatigue, unexplained body aches, and weakness, are common in psychiatric populations but may be experienced and reported differently across demographic groups. This study examined race and gender differences in somatic symptom presentation among individuals with major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and healthy controls. Analyses controlled for chronic medical burden to better isolate psychological symptom patterns. Women reported significantly more fatigue and physical symptoms than men. However, no gender differences emerged when assessing anxiety-related somatic symptoms. This suggests that gender disparities in reporting may depend on the type and framing of symptoms assessed. For race, Black participants reported significantly higher fatigue and were rated by clinicians as having higher somatic concern, though only after controlling for chronic illness. Importantly, no race or gender differences were found on a cognitive fatigue subscale, suggesting these effects were specific to physical manifestations of distress. These findings underscore how somatic symptoms are measured, both in terms of item content and symptom domain, may shape whose distress is recognized and how it is interpreted in psychiatric settings.",

          "abstract": "The theory of mental symmetry models the mind as seven high-level interacting cognitive modules that can function together in three different ways: rigorous technical thought, analogical normal thought, and the emotional schema of mental networks. This paper suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be explained cognitively as a mind that emphasizes mental networks and technical thought while being impaired in normal thought. Minimizing normal thought causes mental networks and technical thought to develop and function abnormally, generating the symptoms of autism. Minimizing normal thought relates to the executive dysfunction theory of autism, while abnormal mental networks correspond to the empathizing-systemizing theory. Excessive technical thought leads to the hyper-systemizing of Asperger’s syndrome (AS). Autism is a spectrum because the severity of autistic symptoms depends upon the extent to which normal thought is dysfunctional.",

          "authors": "Russell Dougherty; Eric Thrailkill; Sarah Van Horn; Auny Kussad; Donna Toufexis",
          "abstract": "When making decisions under stress, organisms tend to deliberate less and rely on automatic habits. Prior investigation into the influence of stress on decision-making has primarily viewed goal-direction and habit as independent and competitive sources of control in static environments. The effects of acute stress on the integration of goal-direction and habit in hierarchical planning to solve dynamic tasks remain unclear. Here, our aim was to assess whether stress prompted the usage of habitual action sequences over the selection of discrete goal-directed actions in a serial decision task. We trained 16 female Long Evans rats in a two-stage binary choice task and performed two probe tests, one following acute restraint stress and one under control conditions, to identify how stress affected higher-level planning of behavior and intermediate action structures. We found that under both stressed and control conditions, rats exhibited goal-directed planning of habitual action sequences. However, following stress, rats showed a greater tendency to reiterate action sequences independent of reinforcement, indicating that stress may induce an aversion to exploration in action planning. Stress also increased the latency between responses – degrading action sequence integrity despite conserving their overall structure and performance. Taken together, these findings suggest that although acute stress does not disrupt the overall macrostructure of behavior in two-stage decision-making, it does alter the microstructure of goal-directed and habitual control individually. Further, these results imply that the extent to which stress impairs goal-direction in female rats may depend on the incentive structure and attentional demands of the decision environment.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies reported positive associations between higher emetophobic symptomatology (fear of vomiting) and both disgust propensity (individual differences in how easily disgust is elicited) and disgust sensitivity (individual differences in how negative the experience of disgust is evaluated). In the current study, 233 participants (76% female) completed the Specific Phobia of Vomiting Inventory, the Questionnaire for the Assessment of Disgust Propensity–Brief, and the Scale for the Assessment of Disgust Sensitivity. Higher emetophobic symptomatology related to higher disgust sensitivity (rrb = 0.37, p &lt; .001) but not to disgust propensity (rrb = 0.06, p = .368). Findings imply that exposure therapy in persons with emetophobia should primarily target reducing disgust sensitivity, that is, how the experience of disgust is evaluated, not reducing the experience of disgust itself.",

          "authors": "Sirke Seppänen; Benjamin Ultan Cowley; Andrei Rodionov",
          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The Hyper-Impro project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

Across datasets, at least 25% of participants reported valuing nature more than humans, while about 35% prioritized humans over nature. National characteristics explained 5%–7% of the variance in moral worth attributions, with preference for nature associated with higher country-level environmental performance and human development. Valuing nature over humans predicted stronger pro-environmental attitudes and, to a lesser extent, outgroup bias.

          "authors": "Ean Huddleston",
          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

          "abstract": "Models of consciousness need to explain both the objective correlates of conscious experience as well as its subjective structure. However, such an explanation would not need to entail a reduction exclusively in terms of physical or neural systems. A model that intends to avoid such reduction is integrated information theory (IIT). In this article, we discuss the explanatory rationale of IIT, its potential inconsistencies and its consequences for the neuroscience of consciousness more broadly. In particular, we identify ambiguities regarding the directionality of the explanation, i.e., important tensions between IIT's purported ontological and epistemological primacy of experience, and its explanatory aim of accounting for consciousness in physical, operational terms. Across the text, we propose several ways to avoid these issues and eventually complement, enhance or replace the model. The main goal is to motivate clarification among IIT-proponents and inform IIT-opponents on accurate points of contention, without thereby misrepresenting the model. In our final section, we introduce alternative explanatory paths: mathematical, processual, and autonomy-based types of explanations. These novel and sound explanatory strategies may better inspire the next generation of models of consciousness.",

          "abstract": "The most effective treatments for autism spectrum disorder have generally focused on single-subject data to personalize behavior-analytic intervention at the individual level. Though interventions based on applied behavior analysis have been effective for treating the core deficits of autism, the lack of large-scale data analysis has prohibited the use of precision medicine for identifying subtypes of responders within this population. Language deficits are characteristic of an autism diagnosis, particularly for those more profoundly affected by the disorder, who may not develop functional communication despite early intervention. Yet language development is often described as a progression through stages that may not accurately describe the manner in which individuals with autism acquire language skills. In the current study, we use binomial logistic regression to examine the statistically significant predictors of exteroceptive control over verbal behavior. Using a common curriculum-based assessment of verbal behavior, we examined the intake scores of 118 children with autism who received early intensive behavioral intervention. Results show that an individual’s ability to mand reliability predicts their ability to tact, but no statistically significant variables were related to mand control. We discuss our findings within the context of intervention for individuals with autism whose verbal behavior is under differentiated sources of control.",

          "abstract": "Path integration (PI) allows organisms to navigate home by updating their location in reference to the route’s starting point. We previously demonstrated a PI-like process in eye movements using an eyetracking version of commonly used PI tasks. As the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and specifically, the entorhinal cortex (ERC), is implicated in updating self-position via whole-body PI, we investigated its role in updating gaze position. Two individuals with hippocampal lesions, DA and BL, were tested on our eyetracking PI-analog task in which participants followed routes with their eyes guided by visual onsets and, when subsequently cued, returned to the starting point or mid-route location. As DA’s MTL damage was extensive, encompassing the ERC and hippocampus, we expected DA’s performance to be impaired compared to that of his controls. However, DA’s accuracy was comparable to that of control participants, and he showed little to no gaze revisits to enroute locations when returning to the start location. BL’s performance was expected to be impaired due to hippocampal dysfunction affecting mnemonic and perceptual discrimination (involving the dentate gyrus), with additional signs of visuospatial compromise, possibly in relation to volume loss in the parietal cortex that may otherwise support PI. Indeed, BL’s accuracy was reduced relative to that of the control participants, and he demonstrated an increased reliance on overt, enroute, revisits. These findings suggest that processes underlying spatial updating of gaze position overlap with those supporting whole-body movement that may depend on contributions from the MTL and/or parietal cortex. In the case of DA, residual executive function abilities and/or visuospatial strategies supported by frontal or parietal cortices may support eye movement-based spatial updating and compensate for MTL damage.",

Longitudinal cohort data provides opportunities to understand how and why ADHD symptoms co-develop. \nMethod: Data were drawn from the Twins Early Development Study, which included 13945 twin pairs. Emotional problems and ADHD symptoms were parent-reported using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Conners’ Parent Rating scales. We modelled the co-development of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems from ages 4 to 21 using joint trajectory analysis.\nResults: The four-class joint trajectory model of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems provided the best fit to the data. This included patterns such as both traits remaining consistently low, both traits steadily increasing, and one trait being high while the other remained low. ADHD and externalizing problems polygenic scores, as well as maternal depression, socioeconomic status and home chaos were significant predictors of the joint trajectory of ADHD and emotional problems. The group with consistently low symptoms reported higher educational attainment, fewer emotional problems, and fewer ADHD symptoms at age 26 than the other groups. Individuals with high initial ADHD symptoms in childhood or increasing symptoms from childhood to adulthood reported lowest educational attainment and socioeconomic status in adulthood among all the groups.\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of ADHD symptoms and emotional problems can follow various developmental trajectories, and these trajectories have distinct early-life predictors and adult outcomes.

The present study investigated whether a spatial updating process analogous to PI applies to hand movements, similar to what has been observed in whole-body movements and eye movements. Younger and older adult participants followed a route of multiple locations, as indexed by audio cues, using a stylus on the surface of a tablet while their eyes were closed. At the end of the route, participants were cued to either the starting- or a mid-route location. Analysis of error and revisits suggest that participants relied more on continuous updating when only memory for the starting location was required, and relied more on configural updating when mid-route locations had to be maintained, consistent with literature on whole-body movements. Revisits were associated with more accurate performance. Older adults were less likely to revisit enroute locations, which may indicate increased reliance on continuous updating or an inability to use information extracted during configural updating to support revisits. When considered alongside literature on the contributions of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to PI and of hippocampally-mediated representations to hand gestures, the present findings suggest that the MTL supports general spatial updating mechanisms that can be expressed across multiple effector systems.",

During the events, they wore mBient accelerometers on headbands while taking part in whole-group games, team games, paired conversations, and informal chats over food. Afterwards, participants rated how well they connected with each other. We synchronised the accelerometer data across participants and used wavelet coherence to quantify synchrony between each pair in each activity. Our findings revealed that people more similar in personality (as indicated by a homophily measure) exhibited greater synchrony throughout the event. Furthermore, synchrony predicted subsequent liking and mediated the effect of homophily on liking. These results demonstrate the feasibility and value of using wearable sensors to capture social interaction patterns in large groups, providing real-world evidence that synchrony drives social bonding among strangers.",

Judgment under uncertainty is often studied with reference to a normative ideal according to which people should make guesses that have a high probability of being correct. According to this normative ideal, you should say that Germany will win the world cup if you think that Germany is in fact likely to win. We argue that in many cases, judgment under uncertainty is instead best conceived of as an act of lossy compression, where the goal is to efficiently encode a probability distribution, rather than express the probability of a single outcome. We test formal computational models derived from our theory, showing in four experiments that they accurately predict how people make and interpret guesses. Our account naturally explains why people dislike vacuously-correct guesses (like 'Some country will win the world cup'), and sheds light on apparently sub-optimal patterns of judgment such as the conjunction fallacy.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies involving birds and humans have identified spatial proximity as a source of overshadowing between landmarks in navigation. In Herrera et al. (2024), subjects were trained in an open environment to find a hidden goal with reference to a cross-shaped array of four landmarks placed at various distances from it. Critically, two of the four landmarks (i.e., target landmarks) were placed at distances that were common among groups whereas the remaining two were either proximal or distal from them. Landmarks near to the goal overshadowed (i.e., competed with) learning about the further ones, and this effect disappeared in the groups trained with distal landmarks. However, neither of these studies included a control group providing a base line performance to assess the extent of competition; were the data indicative of overshadowing or facilitation of learning? Thus, we assessed whether spatial proximity determines overshadowing or facilitation between landmarks, including a control group trained with the target landmarks only. We conducted three experiments with varied training length: 6 training trials in Experiment 1 and 16 in Experiments 2 and 3. We also extended the distance of the landmarks to the goal in Experiment 3. In all experiments, we observed overshadowing in the groups trained with closer nontarget landmarks (relative to the target) but no overshadowing when the nontarget landmarks were distal from the target landmarks. Overall, these experiments reveal spatial distance is a critical determinant of overshadowing between landmarks, a finding that is consistent with domain-general theories of learning, such as a modification of Pearce’s configural model.",

We argue that this hyperspace, characterized by its inherent geometry and resonant dynamics, offers a framework for understanding phenomena ranging from the placebo effect to mystical illumination, the therapeutic potential of altered states of consciousness, and even the structured experiences of ceremonial and modern chaos magick. Furthermore, we explore the role of entheogens as magnifying glasses, enhancing the experiential access to the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace and its fluid, individually emerging contents, which are perceived beyond conventional time and space. This model provides a scientific lens for exploring \"Mankind 2.0,\" where navigating the Ultrasubjective Hyperspace becomes central to human well-being and evolution.

It remains unclear, however, if and to what extent VWM is employed strategically in natural behavior, partly because VWM is typically studied through paradigms that enforce one particular behavior, eliminating the possibility of strategic VWM use. Here we employ an unrestricted task which naturally engages VWM: participants reproduce a model (i.e., six colored polygons in a four-by-four grid), in an adjacent ‘workspace’ area, by dragging items from a pool of stimuli (akin to a jigsaw puzzle). While this tasks draws upon VWM (to keep the example image available when not in view), it does not enforce any specific approach to accomplish the overarching goal. Items can be inspected multiple times, memorized simultaneously or consecutively, and in any order. We asked to what extent observers employ specific strategies in unrestricted VWM tasks, and whether strategy use benefits performance. We observed substantial use of two distinct strategies (working systematically and exploiting similarities), and found that strategy use was linked to better performance. Moreover, we found a striking consistency in strategy use between individuals and between settings. We further hypothesized that systematicity may be particularly beneficial when the task demands approach individuals’ memory limits. Reanalysis of copying task data of 24 patients with severe memory impairments (Korsakoff syndrome), revealed strategy use was indeed related to better performance. To obtain a richer understanding of VWM, and to provide applications both for the clinic and for everyday life, we should consider the task-context in which VWM is engaged.",

          "abstract": "Influential perspectives on polarization in the United States imply that partisans will be more willing to degrade democracy when they are ideologically aligned with their own party and feel negatively about the opposing party. But psychological accounts of political ideology suggest that conservatives will be especially anti-democratic regardless of partisanship.  Integrating insights from these areas, we argue that there are reasons to expect paradoxical partisan asymmetries in the ideological correlates of democratic attitudes. Across numerous surveys we find consistent evidence that cultural conservatism and out-party favorability are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Democrats (but not Republicans), while left-leaning economic attitudes are reliably associated with anti-democratic orientation among Republicans (but not Democrats). These findings provide context for understanding how polarization might impact American democracy. They also suggest that increased centrality of sociocultural conflict and Republican cultivation of a right-wing populist reputation might sort anti-democratic Americans into the Republican Party.",

          "abstract": "Digital media profoundly shape modern life, offering benefits while also prompting concerns that lead many to seek disconnection. This study investigates r/NoSurf, a large online community paradoxically dedicated to digital disengagement. Through computational and qualitative analysis of discussions from over 26,000 active members, we study users’ complex and often ambivalent relationships with technology and their pursuit of digital well-being. The findings show that people see digital technology as both an escape and a source of distress. Motivated by desires to mitigate perceived negative impacts like distraction and eroded well-being, and faced with the difficulty of full withdrawal, members actively develop and share a sophisticated repertoire of strategies to manage their digital technology use. This research characterizes digital disconnection not as mere avoidance, but as a dynamic, skillful, and individually negotiated practice, or literacy, aimed at fostering well-being and intentionality in the face of pervasive connectivity.",

          "abstract": "Objective\nIn a previous study (Iha, 2023), men voluntarily tended to choose a higher-cost option compared to women when a division of labor occurred between the opposite sexes. However, it is still unknown whether this pattern can be replicated using continuous measures when costs are not included in the choice. Therefore, the current study aimed to replicate and extend the previous study. \nMethods\nParticipants from 4 countries (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) engaged in an online scenario experiment. A binomial logistic regression analysis and internal meta-analyses were used to examine whether the percentage of workload that participants voluntarily selected differed depending on the participant's own sex, and the combination of the participant's own sex and the sex of the participant's hypothetical partner.\nResults\nOverall, men tended to voluntarily choose more workload than women, and men paired with a hypothetical opposite sex partner voluntarily chose more workload than women paired with a hypothetical opposite sex partner. These effects were consistent across different countries.\nConclusion\nAs a conclusion, the current study successfully replicated and expanded the previous study. In detail, it was shown that the presence of the opposite sex itself creates a division of labor, even if the participant's choice does not include the cost. Furthermore, SODOL (Spontaneous Occurrence of Division of Labor) was found to be robust regardless of the measurement method.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. A fundamental resource people do not want to waste is time. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "abstract": "Most people condemn animal suffering, but at the same time harm animals by consuming them. The cognitive dissonance experienced as a result of this inconsistency can be alleviated by common misconceptions that animals have limited cognitive abilities and are less capable of experiencing emotions and pain. Addressing these misconceptions may be crucial in reducing the unsustainable consumption of animal products. In two studies (Nstudy1 = 266; NStudy2 = 625), we investigated whether a mini documentary educating viewers about animal minds would influence speciesist behaviours. Participants either received this educational intervention or did not. The results revealed that participants who received the education expressed a stronger intention to reduce harmful behaviours towards animals compared with participants in the control condition (Studies 1 &amp; 2). Participants’ beliefs about animal minds played a mediating role in this effect (Study 1). Moreover, the education led to a greater reduction in participants’ actual animal product consumption (Study 2). As the problems of climate change, emerging pandemics, lifestyle-related diseases, and the pervasive mistreatment of non-human animals are linked to current practices of producing and consuming animals and their products (e.g., Kwasny et al., 2022), our findings provide valuable insights into how educating people about animal minds can contribute to a more sustainable and compassionate future.",

Its teachings extend beyond the spiritual domain, offering practical philosophical, psychological, and spiritual insights that promote well-being. The objective of this research was to explore Samatvam (equanimity) as a pathway to holistic well-being (HWB). Thematic analysis of the principle of Samatvam, as advocated in the Bhagavad Gita, was carried out to conceptualize holistic well-being through the lens of equanimity. The study illustrates key principles of Samatvam and how they foster HWB through its psychological, philosophical, and spiritual dimensions. Future empirical research is recommended to validate and operationalize these insights across diverse populations and cultural contexts.\nKeywords: Samatvam, equanimity and well-being, holistic well-being, cultivation of equanimity, equanimity and mental health, spirituality and well being",

They were asked what questions they would ask their doctor in a consultation. In Study 2, we included n=1127 people over the age of 60. The participants received information about the novel Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine and then, they were asked the same open-ended question as in Study 1. \nResults: An inductively developed categorization system from Study 1 proved effective for coding responses in both studies. Participants frequently raised concerns about vaccine safety, side effects, and contraindications—especially in the context of preexisting medical conditions. Questions also focused on efficacy, booster timing, immunization schedules, vaccine types, and disease incidence. Trust in physicians was important, with participants seeking clarity on both medical recommendations and official guidelines.\nConclusions: Healthcare providers should adapt communication strategies, focusing on shared decision-making and personalized vaccination decisions including novel and well-known determinants of vaccination decisions.",

          "abstract": "Multilingual children seem to lag behind their monolingual peers in early mathematical skills. To examine the current state of research on supporting multilingual children’s early mathematical skills, a meta-analytic review was conducted. A systematic review of 24 articles on early mathematical interventions for 3-5-year-old multilingual participants found numeracy to be the primary focus followed by geometry, measurement and patterns. In examining specific instructional features related to multilingual participants, the most commonly employed approach was the use of mathematical language. However, there is an opportunity to implement more interventions utilizing children’s home language and culturally responsive instructional approach. A meta-analysis was conducted on a subset of 17 studies that provided enough data for calculating effect size. The average weighted effect size was small (g = 0.46, 95% CI 0.32, 0.59). The effect was smaller compared to previous meta-analyses with monolingual participants. Our findings suggest that there is a need for better support for multilingual children's early mathematical skills. Shifting from a monolingual perspective to a multilingual could help better address the needs of the learners from diverse language backgrounds.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The term “conspirituality” has been used to describe the fusion of conspiracy beliefs and alternative spirituality. We aimed to delineate the relationship between these two types of beliefs and to investigate the cognitive correlates of conspiritual beliefs, as well as their associations with well-being. \nMethod: Study 1 (N = 207) was conducted on a sample of social media spiritual groups to examine conspirituality and its cognitive correlates. Study 2 (N = 1066) extended this investigation using a large, nationwide representative sample of Polish adults and additionally employed latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify distinct subgroups of believers. Study 3 (N = 250) explored the links between conspiritual beliefs and well-being indicators. \nResults: Study 1 found a strong positive correlation between conspiracy beliefs and New Age spirituality and revealed that individuals who hold these beliefs tend to perceive connections between seemingly unrelated events and believe that everything happens for a reason. Study 2 reproduced similar findings and further established the connection between conspirituality and the tendency to attribute human traits to non-human entities. In addition, LPA provided a more nuanced understanding of the different patterns of conspiritual beliefs and their associated psychological characteristics. Study 3 revealed that conspiritual believers show a tendency to search for meaning in life but do not report higher or lower life satisfaction.\nConclusions: Overall, these findings point to a potential psychological convergence between conspiracy beliefs and New Age spirituality, although further research is needed to clarify the nature and coherence of this relationship.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical period for social-emotional development, characterized by increased risk for psychopathology and disruptive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. Biased and inflexible interpretations of social situations have been linked to psychopathology and adaptive social functioning, but these associations are rarely studied in adolescence. Addressing this gap, this study examined the connection between parents’ and adolescents’ bias and inflexibility, and how parents' and adolescents' biases and inflexibility relate to their perceptions of each other in real-life interactions. The present study examined whether parents' and adolescents' interpretation bias and inflexibility are associated, and whether they are related to depressive symptoms and relational perceptions. A sample of 112 parents and adolescents completed at baseline the Emotional Bias Against Disconfirmatory Evidence task and measures of perceived partner responsiveness and insensitivity, followed by a 28-day diary. Parents' and adolescents' negative biases were positively correlated, but not their positive bias or inflexibility. As predicted, negative bias and inflexible negative and positive interpretations predicted depressive symptoms in the daily-diary. Regarding relational perceptions, an interesting picture emerged: positive bias was related to perceived responsiveness, negative bias was related to perceived insensitivity, and inflexibility in revising interpretations was associated with both, particularly for revising positive (vs. negative) interpretations. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that interpretation biases and inflexibility may play an important role in the maintenance of close relationships in addition to their known role in psychopathology. These findings have important implications for relationship and clinical research, and for treatment approaches involving adolescents and parents.",

While the most common presentations include schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, symptoms of social anxiety and depression are common amongst this cohort. Given the drop-out rates associated with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, there is a growing interest in using therapeutically applied role-playing games (TA-RPGs) as an alternative. Given the current evidence for this treatment is in its infancy, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of TA-RPGS. \n\nObjective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural therapy-infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game (Dungeons and Dragons) for consumers of two community mental health services in Sydney, Australia. \n\nMethods: In total, 33 consumers of community mental health services were quasi-randomised to either the TA-RPG 8-week intervention group or a waitlist control group receiving treatment-as-usual. The TA-RPG consisted of a specially designed game of Dungeons and Dragons that was infused with elements of cognitive behavioural therapy. All participants received treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures were changes in self-reported social anxiety and PTSD symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were changes in self-reported depression and self-esteem. \n\nResults: After 8 weeks, participants in the TA-RPG group experienced a significant reduction in self-reported symptoms of social anxiety and depression, relative to baseline. A significant increase in global self-esteem was also reported. These changes were not experienced by participants in the waitlist control group. No change in either group was observed for PTSD symptoms. Dropout rates were 17% for the intervention group. \n\nConclusion: A CBT infused, therapeutically applied role-playing game group intervention was effective at reducing self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression for consumers of adult community mental health services in Sydney, Australia.",

          "abstract": "Aims This study examined the joint structure of psychopathology and cognition in older adulthood. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the latent structure of psychopathology and cognition in participants aged 55-78 years old from the UK Biobank (N = 112,712; 44.6% male; M = 65.05 years). We tested four commonly studied CFA models, including: one-factor, correlated-factors, bi-factor, and higher-order models. The best-fitting model was selected based on traditional model-fit indices, model-based reliability estimates, and evaluation of model parameters. After determining the best-fitting model, multigroup CFA was used to examine measurement invariance across four age groups (i.e., 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and 70-78 years old). Results A joint higher-order model of psychopathology and cognition was selected as the best-fitting model, including a general higher-order factor and lower-order factors of internalizing, addictions and substance use, thought disorder, and cognitive dysfunction. This model demonstrated acceptable fit to the data (CFI = 0.936; TLI = 0.933; RMSEA = 0.042) and superior reliability of the lower-order factors (H = 0.850-0.974) compared to specific factors of the bi-factor model (H = 0.676-0.924). This model also demonstrated configural, lower-order metric/scalar, and higher-order metric/scalar invariance across age groups (change in CFI values ≤ 0.002). Conclusions Our results suggest that cognition can be incorporated into the higher-order structure of psychopathology in older adulthood and that the joint structure of psychopathology and cognition is age-invariant from 55 to 78 years old.",

          "abstract": "本文旨在探讨心灵哲学中关于感质（qualia）的核心难题，特别是围绕哲学僵尸（philosophical zombie）思想实验所引发的本体论争议。传统观点认为感质是独立于大脑物理过程的、额外的非物理存在，本文认为此观点可能部分源于对“心理图像”或“心理照片”这一隐喻的误用和实体化。当哲学家论证哲学僵尸“缺少”感质时，其认知过程可能涉及在正常人的心智模型中“叠加”一个基于特定神经活动的心理图像，而在哲学僵尸的模型中则“移除”此图像，这种操作差异被误读为某种非物理“缺失物”的存在。本文进一步引入元分析视角，指出即使是进行此类哲学思辨的哲学家（作为一个物理系统，甚至可设想其为哲学僵尸），其产生感质相关概念和语言表达的能力，也可能仅源于其大脑操作和投射“心理照片”的物理功能，而无需预设其自身必然拥有主观体验。这一分析表明，关于感质的自我报告或哲学阐述并不能绝对证明报告者大脑中感质的非物理存在。本文最终主张，对感质的更合理解释应将其置于物理主义框架内，视为复杂神经活动的一种特性、功能或直接产物，而非独立的本体论实体。",

          "abstract": "Do people experience emotions in the same way? How can we characterize the sameness of emotional quality? Qualitative aspects of emotional experience are usually communicated through words. However, words can be ambiguous and can mean different things to different people. Here, we introduce a relational approach that characterizes emotional experiences as structure based on similarity judgments among emotion-evoking videos. This registered report will apply this method to characterize a psychological condition of “alexithymia”, which is described as “no words for emotions”. Do people with alexithymia experience the same emotions with altered expressivity? Or do they not experience them to begin with? Our structural approach will determine if individuals with high and low alexithymia have the same emotional experiences. Our findings will open the door to the study of emotional experiences by offering a relational approach that bypasses verbal reports and will help to clarify the nature of alexithymia.",

          "abstract": "Dopamine plays a central role in human motivation, acting as a neurochemical bridge between reward, learning, and action. This review explores the dopaminergic basis of goal-directed behavior, from adaptive survival mechanisms to maladaptive addiction. We examine dopamine’s synthesis, receptor systems, and activity across key brain regions such as the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, striatum, and prefrontal cortex. The mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways are discussed as core components of the brain’s reward system. Central theories, including reward prediction error and incentive salience, are used to explain how dopamine supports natural behaviors like eating, bonding, and effortful learning. The review also highlights how drugs and behavioral addictions hijack these circuits, leading to neuroplastic changes and motivational collapse. Mental health disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and ADHD are examined through the lens of dopaminergic dysregulation. Emerging treatments including neuromodulation, exercise, mindfulness, and cognitive interventions are discussed, alongside future directions and ethical concerns about enhancing motivation in healthy individuals. Gaps in measurement, individual differences, and translational application are identified as key research priorities. Understanding dopamine’s role in both survival and dysfunction is essential for advancing brain-based therapies and improving lives.",

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 5,690), we found that the association between genetic risk for depressive symptoms and increases in depressive symptoms across 14 years from early adolescence to adulthood was partially mediated by four socioeconomic resource variables assessed in adulthood: educational attainment, total assets, debt, and access to health insurance. In a preregistered and confirmatory replication using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS; N = 8,964), we found evidence that the genetic risk for depression symptoms change across late mid-life was partially mediated by the four socioeconomic resource variables. Across a series of within-family sibling-difference analyses, however, we found no evidence in support of direct genetic effects on the putative environmental mediators.

          "abstract": "Background Functional impairment in daily activities, such as work and socialising, is part of the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) and most anxiety disorders. Despite evidence that symptom severity and functional impairment are partially distinct, functional impairment is often overlooked. To assess whether functional impairment captures diagnostically relevant genetic liability beyond that of symptoms, we aimed to estimate the heritability of, and genetic correlations between, key measures of current depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms and functional impairment. Methods In 17,130 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety from the Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study, we analysed total scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; depression symptoms), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7; anxiety symptoms), and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS; functional impairment). Genome-wide association analyses were performed with REGENIE. Heritability was estimated using GCTA-GREML and genetic correlations with bivariate-GREML. Results Phenotypic correlations were moderate across the three measures (Pearson’s r = 0.50 - 0.69). All three scales were found to be under low but significant genetic influence (h2SNP = 0.11 - 0.19) with high genetic correlations between them (rg = 0.79 - 0.87). Conclusions Among individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, the genetic variants that underlie symptom severity largely overlap with those influencing functional impairment. This suggests that self-reported functional impairment, while clinically relevant for diagnosis and treatment outcomes, does not reflect substantial additional genetic liability beyond that captured by symptom-based measures of depression or anxiety.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence indicates that perception is shaped not only by external stimuli but also by rhythmic signals originating from the heart, lungs, and stomach. These ongoing internal bodily rhythms can modulate sensory processing, influencing both low-level detection and higher-order functions such as emotion recognition and social decision-making. The first part of this review outlines the physiology of each organ–brain axis and synthesizes current findings on how cardiac, respiratory, and gastric rhythms modulate perceptual experience. Altogether, current findings highlight the role of interoceptive rhythms in shaping moment-to-moment perceptual outcomes. Although these effects can differ based on specific task demands, a pattern emerges in the literature: in certain instances, perception may vary based on the dynamic distribution of signal processing resources between internal bodily states and external environmental stimuli. Acknowledging the limitations of existing experimental paradigms, the second part of this review seeks to build on these empirical findings by proposing strategies to improve the ecological validity and generalizability of interoception-perception research. Our analysis of participant demographics across the reviewed studies highlights the necessity for more diverse demographic representation. We also propose the integration of multimodal physiological recordings and wearable technologies, alongside the creation of more dynamic paradigms that can capture behaviors in real-world contexts. These recommendations are intended to enhance both the representativeness and ecological validity of interoception-perception research. By linking traditional laboratory paradigms with more naturalistic settings, this review and framework may pave the way for a deeper understanding of how interoceptive signals influence perception in everyday life. Last, we briefly explore emerging theoretical models that, when integrated with ecologically relevant designs, could provide a more comprehensive understanding of embodied cognition.",

          "abstract": "Previous research has shown that attractiveness perceptions of male body parts and modalities correlate with each other. These findings support the one ornament hypothesis, according to which individual body parts and modalities have a common underlying latent cause and vicariously function as an indicator of genetic quality during mate choice. In contrast, the multiple messages hypothesis suggests that different body parts and modalities signal distinct and non-redundant information about mate quality. This preregistered study sought to replicate and extend findings on correlated perceptions of men’s and women’s facial, bodily, and vocal attractiveness, health, and physical dominance. Also, moderating effects by sex hormone levels (testosterone, estradiol) were analysed as purported mechanisms involved in the development of sexually dimorphic characteristics influencing perceptions. Facial photos, voice recordings, and 3D body scans of 165 men and 155 women were judged separately for attractiveness, health, and physical dominance by overall 400 raters. Results showed medium-sized positive correlations for faces and bodies for all three attributes, but only few significant associations of vocal with facial or bodily judgments. Correlated perceptions showed some variation by target sex. Thus, our results are mostly in line with the one ornament hypothesis, and less so with the multiple messages hypothesis. However, no moderation effects by hormone levels aligning with hypotheses were found. Future studies should include further stimuli and examine additional hormonal variables to elucidate endocrine mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Background: Theatre improvisation provides a psychologically safe environment for practicing adaptive interpersonal behaviour, which can enhance interpersonal competence and reduce psychosocial stress. Interpersonal synchrony (IPS)—the temporal alignment of neural, cardiac, and behavioural activity during joint task performance—may represent a putative physiological mechanism underlying these beneficial effects. The Hyper-Impro project aims to investigate whether IPS mediates the effects of improvisation training and to examine how IPS varies across age and levels of improvisation expertise. By combining neural, cardiac, behavioural, and self-report measures, the study aims to uncover the mechanisms through which improvisation training supports social functioning across the lifespan. \n\n\nMethods and analysis: The study is a 12-week controlled intervention study with a 12-month follow-up, designed to investigate the effects of improvisation training on IPS and social interaction competence across age groups (n = 200, ages 18–80). Prior to the intervention, differences in IPS will be examined by comparing groups of improvisation experts and novices. IPS will be assessed using electrophysiological measures (electroencephalography, EEG and electrocardiography, ECG), behavioural data (video recordings), self-reports, and qualitative data from learning diaries. These multimodal data will be collected at pretest, posttest, and follow-up to evaluate both immediate and long-term effects of the intervention. \n\n\nDiscussion: The expected findings will clarify how improvisation training influences physiological and behavioural synchrony and social interaction quality. By including older adults, the study addresses a significant gap in improvisation research, with implications for enhancing social connectedness and mental health in ageing populations. The results will contribute to understanding how improvisation fosters empathy, cooperation, and effective interaction, offering practical insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners.",

          "abstract": "Increasingly, people use language models for emotional support, and understanding the quality of that support is crucial. This project (N = 3,740) focused on one of the pillars of emotional support and the most researched emotion regulation strategies, called cognitive reappraisal, which is the ability to extract multiple meanings from an emotional situation and to choose a framing that reduces its emotional intensity. In a first conservative test, we compared trained humans and GPT-4's ability for reappraisal using made-up vignettes and third-party human raters (Study 1), showing that GPT-4 outperformed humans. In Study 2 we then investigated whether the gap was driven by effort or skill by incentivizing participants to produce better reappraisals, which led to increased time spent on reappraisals but did not decrease the gap between humans and GPT-4. To examine how the perception that support came from AI affected evaluations, in Study 3 we provided participants with an AI label of the source of reappraisal, which reduced their evaluation of the effectiveness of reappraisal, but GPT-4 was still considered more effective. In Study 4, to ensure that differences were sustained in real-time interactions, we had participants share negative emotional situations with either a human or GPT-4 and receive reappraisal, replicating GPT-4's superior performance compared to humans. We conducted language analysis to identify differences between humans and GPT’s reappraisals, finding differences in language complexity, which explain some differences in evaluation. These results help us understand the nature of emotional support by LLMs and how it compares to humans.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the paradoxical dynamics of survival attachment in the context of narcissistic abuse and trauma bonding. It argues that trauma bonding is not a failure of emotion or cognition, but a neurobiological survival imperative that bypasses logic and emotional processing altogether. The paper begins by examining how survival states override conscious thought and reorganize behavior at the level of reflex, grounding trauma bonding in neurological necessity rather than emotional immaturity or cognitive error.\nBuilding on this foundation, the paper introduces the concept of the psychic schism—a clinically significant internal rupture that emerges from this survival override. While dissociation has been widely studied, the psychic schism describes a specific intrapsychic tension between the drive for connection and the imperative for safety under threat. This psychic fragmentation becomes most visible in the aftermath of discard and in the destabilizing silence of “no contact,” where the survival structure collapses and leaves the survivor exposed to internal contradiction and pain.\nThis framework challenges linear trauma models by emphasizing the strategic internal alignment survivors enact to survive, often at the cost of coherence. It calls for more nuanced therapeutic approaches that account for the dissociative and neurobiological complexity of trauma bonding. Understanding survival attachment as a preconscious override rather than emotional dysfunction opens new pathways for compassion and intervention in abuse recovery.",

While event segmentation is a well-explored topic, its underlying mechanisms have remained a subject of debate. In this study, we address this debate by comparing the two contrasting theories of event segmentation: prediction error and contextual stability. In two experiments, we manipulated contextual stability while keeping prediction error constant. Event segmentation was more prominent when there were stable contexts (Experiment 2) compared to prediction errors among unstable contexts (Experiment 1). This stronger segmentation took place despite signs of a smaller prediction error in Experiment 2. We conclude that contextual stability plays a pivotal role in driving event \nsegmentation, highlighting its dominance over the role of prediction errors.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Predictive processing models perception as an interplay between top-down predictions, \nshaped by prior experiences, and bottom-up sensory inputs. When signals are ambiguous, the brain \nfurther relies on prior expectations. In emotional contexts, mood and affective primes may act as \nendogenous and exogenous predictions, respectively, biasing emotional perception. This might be \nparticularly relevant in mood disorders, where top-down predictions may become overly rigid or \nunstable. \n\nMethods: Fifty-three healthy participants (HC), 14 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), and 17 with \ndepression (DEP) completed an online affective priming task on unambiguous (happy/sad) and \nambiguous (morphs, i.e., both happy and sad) facial expressions. Targets were preceded by masked \nor unmasked happy, sad, morph primes, or none. Participants rated each target’s emotion and \ncompleted two mood questionnaires, from which latent dimensions were extracted with a Principal \nComponent Analysis. Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM) was used to estimate cognitive processes \nunderlying ambiguous face perception. \n\nResults: In HC, mood congruently biased ambiguous face categorization, and masked primes \naccelerated responses. In BD, mood did not influence categorization, but both masked and unmasked \nprimes induced faster responses. In DEP, mood congruently biased perception, with no effect of \nprimes. DDM confirmed valence-congruent shifts in starting points – indicating pre-decisional \naffective predictions – for masked primes in HC, both masked and unmasked primes in BD, and no \neffect in DEP. Mood did not affect DDM parameters, suggesting that it biased the categorization of \nemotionally ambiguous stimuli after affective decision processes. \n\nConclusions: Findings reveal group-specific predictive biases in emotional perception. HC used mood \nand affective cues, BD patients only relied on external cues (unstable mood priors), while DEP \npatients showed reduced sensitivity to primes (rigid mood priors). These prediction biases may \nunderlie core clinical features of mood disorders and highlight new targets for interventions aiming \nto restore adaptive emotional inference.",

This relationship with overconfidence was robust to controlling for analytic thinking, need for uniqueness, and narcissism, and was strongest for the most fringe conspiracies. We also found that conspiracy believers – particularly overconfident ones –  massively overestimated (&gt;4x) how much others agree with them: Although conspiratorial claims were believed by a majority of participants only 12% of the time, believers thought themselves to be in the majority 93% of the time.

We outline the conceptual requirements for measuring general morality and argue that it would be difficult to operationalize morality in a way that satisfies these requirements. Self-report, informant report, behavioral, and biological measurement approaches also have substantial methodological limitations. These conceptual and methodological challenges limit the validity of measures of general morality more than they do for most other psychological traits. This exercise yields general lessons about the challenges that also confront the design of narrower, less ambitious morality measures (e.g., of specific moral virtues). Some—but not all—of these challenges can be mitigated when the measurement aims are more modest. It is therefore important to be transparent and intellectually humble about what we can and cannot conclude based on various moral assessments.",

In addition to computing descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and cluster analyses, we implemented a 5-fold cross-validation procedure to ensure that the observed relationships are robust and generalizable.The findings of earlier studies regarding the correlation between the dichotomies and traits were replicated.

          "abstract": "Objective: We examined whether environmental risk (e.g., prenatal substance exposure, poverty, trauma, discrimination) moderates the association between genetic liability and developmental trajectories of externalizing problems (e.g., aggression, rule-breaking) during early adolescence. \n \nMethod: The analytic sample (N=10,634) was drawn from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used latent growth curve modeling to examine the development of externalizing problems from ages 9 to 14, based on longitudinal parent (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]) and youth-reported (Brief Problem Monitor [BPM]) measures. We evaluated associations with polygenic risk associated with externalizing (EXT PGS), exposure to environmental risk, and tested whether environmental risk moderated the relationship between EXT PGS and externalizing trajectories.\n\nResults: The EXT PGS was significantly associated with externalizing problems at baseline and with change in youth-report of externalizing problems over time. General environmental risk was significantly associated with both the intercept and slope factors. The association between the EXT PGS and the intercept (parent and youth-report) was significantly moderated by the general environmental risk factor. Also, the association between the EXT PGS and the development of externalizing behavior (parent-report slope) was significantly moderated by state-level risk factors.\n\nConclusions: These results demonstrate that exposure to environmental risk amplified the association between genetic liability toward externalizing and externalizing behavior at age 9. In addition, state-level risk factors, which largely reflect the legality of medicinal and recreational cannabis where the youth reside, may amplify the association between the EXT PGS and the development of externalizing behavior.",

          "authors": "Sam Hawkins; Sean P. Mackinnon",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Self-critical perfectionism and stress have been implicated as risk factors for maladaptive academic outcomes (i.e., decreased academic self-efficacy, decreased academic self-concept, and increased academic burnout). The present study investigated a vulnerability-stress model, testing whether self-critical perfectionism moderates the relationship between stressor severity (academic and interpersonal) and academic outcomes. Exploratory analyses replaced self-critical perfectionism with rigid perfectionism in the model. Method: A sample of 384 post-secondary students (76.8% women, average age: 20.06) completed a cross-sectional survey involving questionnaires assessing the constructs of interest. Results: Stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) was negatively associated with academic self-efficacy and academic self-concept, and positively associated with academic burnout, when controlling for perfectionism. Self-critical perfectionism was positively associated with academic burnout, and rigid perfectionism was positively associated with academic self-concept, when controlling for stressor severity. None of the interaction effects were statistically significant, failing to support a vulnerability-stress model. Discussion: Findings suggest that stressor severity (both academic and interpersonal) and self-critical perfectionism are strongly associated with maladaptive academic outcomes and may serve as risk factors for poor academic functioning. The lack of interaction effects suggests a vulnerability-stress model may not explain why perfectionism is associated with maladaptive academic outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Within complex information environments, persuasive messages are often viewed in close proximity to other relevant and possibly contradictory content. While persuasion research focuses on optimizing individual message types (e.g. anti- or pro-alcohol messages), scarce knowledge about competition between message types hinders the prediction of message effects in real-world settings. We directly compared effects of competing message types to understand relative effects and underlying mechanisms. Methods: Across three studies, English-speaking convenience samples from online panels and our University’s student pool (N=468) viewed a large sample of alcohol-related messages (N=190) of different types (pro-, anti-, and\nnon-alcoholic messages from professional and peer sources). Using within-subject designs, we measured the relative impact of message types on alcohol craving and mechanisms driving these effects. Results: Pro-alcohol messages were more impactful than anti-alcohol messages, especially among frequent binge drinkers. Although emotional responses and familiarity with the alcohol-related content were relevant mechanisms for both pro- and anti-alcohol message effects, both mechanisms were more strongly coupled to craving in response to pro- (vs. anti-alcohol) messages. Conclusions: Accounting for a large variety of messages, our results suggest that restricting pro-alcohol content may be more effective in reducing consumption than producing anti-alcohol content within populations represented by our English-speaking convenience samples. The findings further raise specific concerns about the effectiveness of anti-alcohol messages that target familiarity and emotional processes, especially when viewed in direct competition with pro-alcohol information. Further research on the competition between related message types is crucial to support understanding and prediction of message effectiveness.\nSIGNIFICANCE: We examined how health promotion (professional anti-alcohol) messages perform relative to other relevant confirmatory (peer-produced anti-alcohol messages) and contradictory (professional/peer-produced pro-alcohol) information by comparing alcohol craving across message types. Understanding competition between message types will help improve predictions of message effects in modern, diverse information environments.",

To address these challenges, we developed an engaging, tablet-based assessment and applied item response theory for scoring. Data from three studies (N = 977) supported a multidimensional structure with conceptually meaningful, psychometrically sound subtests. Reliability estimates were sufficiently high to support differentiated feedback at the subtest level.

          "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground\nAdolescent mental health problems often follow varied courses, including persistence or remission. Early identification of these trajectories is essential for targeted intervention. \n\nMethods\nUsing data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we identified participants (ages 9–10) with clinically relevant symptoms of six mental health problems (ADHD, anxiety, conduct, depressive, oppositional defiant, and somatic) based on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). At 2-year follow-up, individuals were classified as persisters and remitters. We trained random forest models using CBCL scores to predict individual symptom persistence. In addition, structural MRI (sMRI), resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed to identify baseline and developmental brain differences between persisters and remitters.\n\nResults\nPersistence rates ranged from 36% to 50% across problems at 2 year follow up. Models with CBCL scores showed acceptable prediction for anxiety (AUC = 0.72), while other disorders showed lower accuracy (AUC = 0.55–0.65). Higher CBCL total scores at baseline were consistently observed in persisters (p &lt; .05). Imaging analyses revealed significant baseline brain differences for anxiety, somatic, and oppositional defiant problems. Longitudinal neurodevelopmental differences were only found for oppositional defiant problems.\n\nConclusions\nMental health problems in adolescents often persist over two years. Persistence of anxiety symptoms can be predicted using CBCL items, whereas predictions for other problems remain limited. Neuroimaging results indicate that symptom persistence is partly linked to preexistent brain differences. Predictive models may help guide early identification and personalized intervention for youth at risk of chronic mental health problems, in particular for anxiety.",

          "abstract": "The intricate interplay between visual art, aesthetic appreciation, and human cognition has long captivated artists and scientists. One difficulty of this line of research is that artworks differ on many dimensions that influence aesthetic appreciation. While trying to keep the out-of-scope dimensions constant is a typical strategy, using a stimulus set with balanced dimensions avoids noise and bias. Although several visual art datasets exist, none have been specifically designed to control many dimensions simultaneously. In response to the need of a well-controlled and balanced stimulus set, the Leuven Orthogonalized Art Dataset (LOAD) controls and balances dimensions related to aesthetic appreciation, including style, content, emotional valence, and liking/beauty. Each artwork in the image set was first carefully selected to fit a balanced design, then annotated by 50 participants on measures of pleasure, fluency, interest, liking, emotional valence, and familiarity for further validation. This careful annotation process also aims to disentangle the often- ambiguous interrelations among several aesthetic appraisals such as pleasure, interest, and liking. By providing balanced designs across multiple dimensions, LOAD serves as a valuable and highly flexible tool for exploring the complexities of aesthetic appreciation.",

          "abstract": "Receiving affirmation, whether from ourselves or others, is crucial for interpersonal relationships and goes awry in mental disorders. Meaningful evaluations emerge during interactions, where people can support or let each other down. However, such dynamics are difficult to understand comprehensively without quantitative theory and modeling. Here, we implemented an interactive decision-making game wherein two real-life participants evaluated, i.e. graded their approval, for themselves and their play partner. Young adult participants interacted in a multi-level version of the iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Crucially, each participant did not interact with the other directly, but instructed an avatar to do so on their behalf. This allowed increased experimental control while preserving considerable ecological validity. We tested computational models of participants’ evaluations of self and other, based on their beliefs about the quality of their decisions. However such models were less successful than a novel class of models, where self- and other- evaluations depended directly on the combination of self- and other- outcomes. The winning models suggested that for a given participant, evaluation of the self is proportional to how much one’s partner benefits, and vice versa. We found marked self-positivity bias, especially in dyads where neither partner cooperated. This was consistent with attributional theory, negatively evaluating others rather than the self for adverse outcomes. Between participants, self-positivity bias was explained by a reduced weight of one’s partner’s benefits for self-evaluation, hinting that the negative outcome subject to external attribution was the partner’s, rather than one’s own, poor returns. Preliminary analysis also suggested that a reduced sensitivity to others’ outcomes was associated, in this context when participants may have both cooperative and competitive motives, with reduced earnings for the self.  The proposed computational model provides a concise and novel account of self-serving bias in evaluations, clearly observed during interactions.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores the phenomenology of phosphene meditation as a gateway to mystical perception, reframing visionary consciousness through the lens of structured inner experience. Drawing on decades of inner light meditation, we examine how phosphenes, spontaneous visual phenomena occurring in the absence of external light, unfold in 6 discernible stages, culminating in a nondual luminous field in which consciousness recognizes itself as multidimensional light in the absence of Ego. Our method follows Husserlian-style eidetic reduction and draws on classical mystical literature (including Christian and Tibetan sources) alongside insights from contemporary neuroscience. We argue that phosphene meditation offers a repeatable phenomenological entry into the dynamics of illumination and the unfolding process of enlightenment. Enlightenment as a state in which ego dissolves, perception becomes centerless, and the archetypal “One Light” emerges as both origin and structure of experience. We conclude proposing that phosphene-based vision serves as a bridge between first-person contemplative inquiry and emerging paradigms in neurophenomenology. Phosphene meditations can lead directly into the recognition of a non-dual state and could be the next step in meditation after mindfulness.",

Drawing on the theory of motivated cognition, we investigated how personal immigration attitudes, gender, and age shape beliefs about asylum authorities and their decisions. Using data from 255 respondents, we found that individuals with more lenient immigration attitudes view the asylum system as overly restrictive, believe that rejected claims are often incorrect, and tend to see asylum applicants as truthful. Conversely, those with more restrictive immigration attitudes perceive the system as too lenient, question the accuracy of accepted claims, and are more skeptical of asylum applicants. Gender and age also moderate these views, with men and older individuals typically expressing more skepticism. These findings highlight how ideology shapes public beliefs about asylum processes.",

However, understanding how genetic and environmental factors\ninteract to influence reading outcomes remains largely unknown. By evaluating the interplay\nbetween genetic and environmental influences on reading performance, this study aims to\nprovide insights into the complex mechanisms underlying reading abilities. To this aim, we\nleveraged the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset, considering socioeconomic\nindicators including household income and parental education, along with linguistic\ncharacteristics such as bilingualism and the child’s first language (L1). We operationalized\ngenetic influences as polygenic scores (PGS), which aggregate genetic risk across multiple\nloci associated with reading-relevant traits (word reading, dyslexia, cognitive performance,\nand educational attainment). First, we establish the individual associations between selected\nenvironmental and genetic predictors for reading, observing that all except L1 are significant\npredictors of reading, with a similar range of variance explained by the two types of\npredictors. Next, we confirm an additive effect, as the PGS remain significant after\nadjustment for the environmental effects, although the effects of PGSEducationalAttainment and\nPGSCognitivePerformance are attenuated, confirming a partial gene-environment correlation. This is\nfurther supported by analyzing direct and genetic effects in a subset of siblings.

The model formalizes how deviations of a stimulus S from a dynamic reference point S_0 evoke an immediate perceptual/emotional response p(t) that scales with the logarithm of the stimulus ratio and then exponentially decays as adaptation occurs. Crucially, it incorporates asymmetric sensitivity for gains versus losses k1, k2and distinct adaptation rates τ1 , τ2  capturing the empirical phenomena of loss aversion and slower adjustment to negative changes.

          "abstract": "Social evaluation, i.e., people’s views of self, others, and groups, is ubiquitous and embedded in our language. In turn, social evaluative words are used intensively in studies of human social evaluation. However, standardized Chinese word lists for social evaluation are under-developed; the only available word lists are based on the big-two model of social evaluation (i.e., agency and warmth) and cover small numbers of words. To fill the gap, we conducted a survey with a relatively large sample (n = 1270, 50% female) and a large number of words (1908) that might describe extended social evaluative dimensions: appearance, socioeconomic status, sociability, competence, and morality. The participants rated the extent to which each word described a certain social evaluation dimension and how positive/negative each word was. Based on this dataset, we selected words that dominantly describe one of the five above-mentioned dimensions. The final word list has 1040 words, including 245 appearance words (143 positive, 11 neutral, 91 negative), 108 socioeconomic status words (36 positive, 2 neutral, 70 negative), 93 sociability words (53 positive, 5 neutral, 35 negative), 261 competence words (185 positive, 4 neutral, 72 negative), and 333 morality words (149 positive, 1 neutral, 183 negative). This word list provides an extended Chinese social evaluative word list and will serve as a useful resource for researchers in social psychology, linguistics, sociology, and computational social science.",

          "authors": "Daniel Ehrlich; Anne Collins",
          "abstract": "Rapid adaptation in dynamic and shifting environments is crucial, and working memory’s (WM) capacity to swiftly integrate information is widely considered fundamental to humans’ ability to flexibly respond to unpredictable change. The distinct contribution of WM to learn- ing under fluctuating reward contingencies extends beyond mere information maintenance, to encompass strategic control mechanisms. The specific control processes humans utilize in this context and how those mechanisms impact memory contents, and thereby learning, remain unclear. Although WM is recognized to play a role in reward-based learning problems, the implementation-level details of these processes are often left ambiguous, typically character- ized by qualitative rather than information processing models of WM influence on learning and choice. This study implements a mechanistic process model of WM involving discrete information storage to identify behavioral signatures of complex ’write’ and ’clearance’ op- erations. We use this model to disentangle the relationship between these mechanisms and behavior, as well as to predict internal WM representations, in a novel task designed to high- light WM contributions to reward-based learning. Our results indicate that human behavior is best captured by models integrating strategic WM control processes, revealing complex in- teractions between individual mechanisms and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we find that the influence of these mechanisms on task performance is mediated by their impact on WM contents, which affect accuracy in a context-specific manner. These findings clarify the role of WM during reward learning tasks and demonstrate the capacity of specific WM processes to actively mediate complex learning strategies.",

          "abstract": "With more opportunities for diverse interactions, little is known about how social interactions involving people of different socioeconomic status (SES) may unfold. We investigated social attunement patterns in dyadic interactions involving SES. Unacquainted individuals recruited from the community interacted with similar-or-different-SES partners in the lab (N-dyads = 130). Attunement was assessed throughout the interaction by examining physiological linkage—how much a person’s physiological change is predicted by another’s physiological change, over time. Overall, low-SES participants showed stronger physiological linkage—indicating greater attunement—to partners across SES. Participants also appeared more comfortable when interacting with low-SES partners. There were no SES differences in dominance during the conversation. Post-interaction, participants reported liking similar-SES partners more than different-SES partners. These patterns suggest that during interactions, lower-SES individuals are more “other-focused” than high-SES individuals, and ingroup preference prevails. We note limitations in the racial representation of our sample.",

          "authors": "Patrick Laing; Augustin C. Hennings; Samuel Emerson Cooper; Joseph E. Dunsmoor",
          "abstract": "Episodic memory allows us to remember when an event occurred by situating it within a coherent temporal context. Pavlovian fear conditioning, a widely studied form of associative emotional learning, creates implicit memories for neutral stimuli paired with aversive outcomes. However, conditioning’s influence on the temporal organization of episodic memory remains poorly understood. We addressed this by analyzing data from 17 multi-session hybrid conditioning-memory experiments (N=474). Participants encoded non-repeating category items, with items from one category (CS+) being aversively reinforced (shocks) during threat conditioning but presented without shock before and after conditioning. The next day, recognition memory (‘did you see this image yesterday?’) and temporal source memory (‘when did you see this image?’) were tested for each category item. We had two aims; (1) examine the robustness of temporal memory distortion across different experiment groups, and (2) test whether these temporal effects were associated with recognition memory performance. CS+ category exemplars were disproportionately (mis)attributed to the conditioning phase, even if they were encoded before or afterwards, and this effect strongly predicted selective recognition memory (CS+&gt;CS-). Overall temporal source bias effects and source-item memory associations were largely resistant to between-experiment variations, including month-long encoding-retrieval intervals, varying shock intensities, and enhanced extinction. Paradoxically, salient emotional experiences may enhance memory for neutral events by distorting their perceived position in time. This mechanism may safeguard potentially relevant information by anchoring otherwise forgettable experiences to salient contexts, supporting their preservation in long-term memory.",

This vividness ranges from aphantasia, where no mental images are experienced, to hyperphantasia, characterized by exceptionally vivid imagery. In the present study we investigated the possible connection between the vividness of visual mental imagery and precision of information retrieval from visual memory. We hypothesized that individuals with weak or no imagery would show reduced memory precision compared to those with vivid imagery. Participants completed three tasks: a visual perception task (control), a visual working memory task, and a visual long-term memory task. Imagery vividness was assessed using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ). In all tasks, participants adjusted the color of a grayscale test object to match a colored sample object shown previously (memory tasks) or simultaneously (perception task). Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no association between mental imagery vividness and memory precision. We discuss possible explanations, including the surprisingly widespread and apparently effective use of verbal strategies in visual memory tasks regardless of imagery strength.",

However, many people who attend MBCT do not fully benefit. This study assessed the feasibility, acceptability and initial clinical utility of personalised smart-messaging as an adjunct to remote Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (rMBCT) for recurrent depression to reduce dropout and improve outcomes.\nThis cohort study compared 28 participants across three sites attending rMBCT, 12 participants were offered smart-messaging and 16 were not. Personalised smart-messaging protocols: 1) reminded participants of their personal motivations for attending rMBCT that were elicited at the initial assessment consultation 2) Prompted them to complete home practice relevant to each session and 3) Sent them their own advice for relapse prevention after group completion, using personal reminders that participants wrote in the final sessions of the group. Smart-messaging uptake, dropout, clinical outcomes, and qualitative experiences were evaluated.\nEleven (92%) participants offered smart-messaging took it up. Participants attending rMBCT with smart-messaging reported significantly greater improvement in depression and functioning, with trends of greater improvement in generalised anxiety and lower dropout. Therapists reported that they felt the smart-messaging intervention enhanced rMBCT and improved outcomes but also described the significant administrative burden it added to setup.\nPersonalised smart-messaging may be feasible and acceptable as an adjunct to rMBCT for recurrent depression for both patients and therapists. The addition of personalised smart-messaging has potential to improve clinical outcomes and reduce dropout, but there is an additional burden on therapists to incorporate it.",

          "abstract": "Altered reward processing is proposed to be central to the pathology of anorexia nervosa (AN), but less is known about how aspects of reward dysfunction relate to suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in AN. We compared responses on self-report measures of general (i.e., anticipatory, consummatory, and social reward) and disorder-specific (i.e., self-starvation reward) reward between individuals with AN with (AN+STBs; n=28) or without (AN; n=31) a lifetime history of active STBs and healthy controls (HC; n=32). Further, we examined whether interactions between general and disorder-specific reward dysfunction were associated with a history of active STBs in AN. Compared to the AN and HC groups, the AN+STBs group reported lower anticipatory (p&lt;.001) and social reward (p=.003), while both AN+STBs and AN groups reported higher self-starvation reward than HCs (p&lt;.001). Consummatory reward did not differ by group (p=.553). The interaction between anticipatory and self-starvation reward was significantly associated with STB risk (p=.007): individuals with AN who reported high self-starvation reward were at elevated risk for STBs regardless of anticipatory reward levels, whereas those with low self-starvation reward showed increased STBs only when anticipatory reward was also low. All results remained robust after accounting for the effects of depression. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of general and disorder-specific reward processes may shape distinct risk profiles for suicidality among individuals with AN.",

          "authors": "Mohamed Salah Belbsir",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper presents the Perfect Mnesic Replay (PMR) Model, which conceptualizes memory reactivation as the propagation of a wave packet through an intrinsically structured cognitive spacetime. The model posits that the objective duration of a replayed memory (Treact) is governed by an effective temporal dilation factor, Keff. This factor is described by a continuous logistic function of the memory’s original encoded duration (Tenc), ensuring that very brief memories are replayed near-veridically, while longer memories undergo significant, yet consistent, temporal dilation. To reconcile this objective dilation with the subjective experience of real-time recall, the PMR Model introduces a Cognitive Lapse Function, α(x). This function defines the local temporal properties of the mnesic spacetime, creating a ”focus gradient” where the central, attended core of the memory wave packet propagates in subjective real-time (α(x) ≈ 1), while peripheral components are objectively stretched (α(x) ≪ 1/Keff). Drawing analogies to spacetime curvature in General Relativity and wave mechanics, this model provides a unified framework for understanding both rapid recall and extensively dilated memory replay, proposing that memory’s temporal architecture is a dynamic phenomenon within a malleable cognitive reality",

This process, if it exists, is theorized to be triggerable by a specially crafted sensory protocol, even in individuals with anterograde amnesia. Once initiated, the replay is hypothesized to be involuntary and uncontrollable. We propose a relativistic mathematical model to reconcile the tension between global time dilation during replay and the local perception of real-time experience. Drawing inspiration from general relativity and psychophysics, we introduce a novel cognitive spacetime manifold and define conditions under which a globally dilated replay (Treact = K · Tenc) can yield a subjectively undistorted temporal experience. The potential for K to be extraordinarily large necessitates a robust framework to explain this phenomenon.",

          "authors": "Chris Robert Harrison Brown; Aleksandra Maria Herman",
          "abstract": "Interoceptive Attention refers to how an individual typically allocates their attentional resources to physiological signals. We do not, however, fully understand how Interoceptive Attention relates with other forms of internally focused attention, such as attention to internal thoughts (e.g., mind-wandering, reflection, worry), and whether these factors compete for limited attentional resources at the trait and state level. Across two Studies (n = 222, n = 109; years data collected: 2021–2022, 2023-2024; from a UK-based predominantly undergraduate population), we isolated two components from several established trait-level measures of attention to thoughts, these reflected Negative Automatic Thoughts (worry, rumination), and Controlled Thoughts (deliberate mind-wandering, reflection). In subsequent regression analyses, Negative Automatic Thoughts, but not Controlled Thoughts, were a significant positive predictor of Interoceptive Attention, even when controlling for perceived interoceptive accuracy. This significant relationship was, however, accounted for by trait anxiety when included in the model. To test this pattern at the state-level, a novel monotonous responding task with three-dimensional attention probes was developed, which measures the reported allocation of attention between thoughts, bodily sensations, and the task. In contrast to trait-level attention, reported priority of attention to thoughts and body signals inversely correlated, despite both increasing across the task. The results suggest that in a single moment attention to bodily signals and internal thoughts may compete; but over time, individuals who report focusing more on their internal thoughts also report more time attending to their body, with some evidence showing that this positive correlation could be due to underlying trait anxiety.",

The UK Reproducibility Network (UKRN) case studies provide a window into this diversity, highlighting how researchers from varied domains implement openness and transparency in their work.Openness and transparency are foundational to research integrity, as outlined in the UK Concordat to Support Research Integrity. They foster rigour, constructive scrutiny, accountability, and enable others to build on existing research. However, the practical application of these principles can vary significantly across disciplines, shaped by the methodologies, norms, and constraints of each field.\nThis series of case studies, from genuine researchers (some anonymised), shows how trailblazing researchers navigate and exemplify open research practices in their respective areas. By illustrating these individual approaches, the aim is to foster a deeper understanding of the shared values and distinct challenges of open research across disciplines. Additionally, these examples offer valuable insights for those supporting open research through training, policy development, or incentives.",

          "authors": "Xiaohui Luo; Hongyun Liu; Yueqin Hu; Yang Liu",
          "abstract": "Differential equation models have become increasingly popular for investigating dynamic processes. However, commonly used two-stage estimation methods, such as the generalized local linear approximation (GLLA), often produce biased parameter estimates. This study proposes a bias-correction method for GLLA estimates in second-order differential equation models. The method solves a bias-correction equation (derived from the relation between true parameter values and their biased estimates) via stochastic approximation, producing asymptotically unbiased estimates even with large initial bias. We first demonstrate the application of the bias-correction method by correcting the bias of a single parameter in a simple second-order differential equation model (i.e., the linear oscillator model with time-independent measurement error). We then extend the method to a more commonly used second-order differential equation model (i.e., the damped linear oscillator model), examining its performance in simultaneously addressing multiple parameters and incorporating time-dependent dynamic error. A simulation study shows that the bias-correction method substantially reduces bias in GLLA estimates, yielding highly accurate and precise parameter estimates. An empirical illustration further compares the results of GLLA and the bias-correction method. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving parameter estimation for differential equation models, offering an enhanced approach for analyzing dynamic processes.",

          "authors": "Takayuki Kimura",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the role of Universal Grammar (UG) in second language (L2) acquisition. Drawing on the Weak Conformity Hypothesis (WCH), which posits that developing interlanguage grammars may temporarily deviate from UG but ultimately conform to it, the paper proposes that UG functions as a Linguistic Dissonance Resolution Device (LDRD). In this framework, UG becomes active when learners adopt UG-incompatible rules or “wild grammars” in their interlanguage, working to revise these inconsistencies so that they align with UG constraints. In contrast to standard assumptions (e.g., Schwartz &amp; Sprouse, 1994, 1996; White, 2003), I argue that L2 learners do not necessarily explore only within UG bounds. Rather, UG plays a monitoring role: It detects UG-inconsistent rules and triggers revision. Such revisions can occur when feature selection or feature reassembly is required, as long as wild grammars are present in the learner’s interlanguage grammar. As addressed in this paper, this account makes novel predictions about which features are acquirable or reconfigurable and which are not. Thus, the UG-as-LDRD proposal not only offers a potential solution to the poverty-of-the-stimulus problem in L2 acquisition, but also provides a broader explanatory scope that may surpass that of existing generative L2 hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Here we propose a roadmap for addressing hierarchical predictive coding theory (hPC) in the primate brain, theorizing that perception arises from the integration of bottom-up (BU) pathways carrying sensory evidence with top-down (TD) pathways carrying priors and expectations. However, given the conceptual importance of hPC for higher cognitive function in humans there is surprising little evidence concerning the location and functional mechanisms underlying such BU-TD integration. This will be overcome by parallel experiments in humans and non-human primates (NHPs). Molecular characterization in NHP of cortico-cortical BU and TD projection cell types will allow tracing these circuits and exerting causal control to explore functional mechanisms in visual paradigms in behaving NHPs. Identical paradigms in human subjects undergoing ultra-high field laminar fMRI scanning will indicate homologous pathways in the human brain. In NHP and human, long-distance priors and expectations suggest that the claustrum is involved in hPC. Recent connectomic and transcriptomic characterisation of cortical claustral cortical loops will enable a similar approach to explore these pathways’ participation in the integration of TD and BU signals as used in the cortico-cortical pathways. Progress in primate hPC will further emphasise the synergy between neurobiology and artificial intelligence with important consequences for both domains.",

          "abstract": "Smartphone use among adolescents and young adults has raised concerns about its impact on mental health, with heavy use linked to negative outcomes. This study explored the mechanisms behind this relationship, focusing on loneliness, in-person social contact, and physical exercise as mediators, and different types of phone use —active virtual social contact and passive scrolling—as moderators. Using a cross-sectional online survey conducted in Austria, we assessed smartphone use and time spent on virtual social contact, passive scrolling, in-person social contact, and exercise, alongside various mental health outcomes. We found an overall association between phone use and depressive symptoms, anxiety, and wellbeing, which was mediated by loneliness. Virtual social contact moderated the association: individuals with lower engagement in virtual social contact experienced higher depression and anxiety with increased phone use, while those with higher engagement showed the reverse pattern. Passive scrolling did not moderate the relationship between phone use and mental health but was directly associated with poorer sleep and well-being. These findings suggest that loneliness plays a central role in the adverse effects of excessive smartphone use on mental health. Moreover, the impact of smartphone use is nuanced and depends on whether it fosters or inhibits meaningful social connections.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Predictive processing models perception as an interplay between top-down predictions, \nshaped by prior experiences, and bottom-up sensory inputs. When signals are ambiguous, the brain \nfurther relies on prior expectations. In emotional contexts, mood and affective primes may act as \nendogenous and exogenous predictions, respectively, biasing emotional perception. This might be \nparticularly relevant in mood disorders, where top-down predictions may become overly rigid or \nunstable. \n\nMethods: Fifty-three healthy participants (HC), 14 patients with bipolar disorder (BD), and 17 with \ndepression (DEP) completed an online affective priming task on unambiguous (happy/sad) and \nambiguous (morphs, i.e., both happy and sad) facial expressions. Targets were preceded by masked \nor unmasked happy, sad, morph primes, or none. Participants rated each target’s emotion and \ncompleted two mood questionnaires, from which latent dimensions were extracted with a Principal \nComponent Analysis. Drift Diffusion Modeling (DDM) was used to estimate cognitive processes \nunderlying ambiguous face perception. \n\nResults: In HC, mood congruently biased ambiguous face categorization, and masked primes \naccelerated responses. In BD, mood did not influence categorization, but both masked and unmasked \nprimes induced faster responses. In DEP, mood congruently biased perception, with no effect of \nprimes. DDM confirmed valence-congruent shifts in starting points – indicating pre-decisional \naffective predictions – for masked primes in HC, both masked and unmasked primes in BD, and no \neffect in DEP. Mood did not affect DDM parameters, suggesting that it biased the categorization of \nemotionally ambiguous stimuli after affective decision processes. \n\nConclusions: Findings reveal group-specific predictive biases in emotional perception. HC used mood \nand affective cues, BD patients only relied on external cues (unstable mood priors), while DEP \npatients showed reduced sensitivity to primes (rigid mood priors). These prediction biases may \nunderlie core clinical features of mood disorders and highlight new targets for interventions aiming \nto restore adaptive emotional inference.",

          "authors": "Mohamed Salah Belbsir",
          "abstract": "This theoretical paper presents the Perfect Mnesic Replay (PMR) Model, which conceptualizes memory reactivation as the propagation of a wave packet through an intrinsically structured cognitive spacetime. The model posits that the objective duration of a replayed memory (Treact) is governed by an effective temporal dilation factor, Keff. This factor is described by a continuous logistic function of the memory’s original encoded duration (Tenc), ensuring that very brief memories are replayed near-veridically, while longer memories undergo significant, yet consistent, temporal dilation. To reconcile this objective dilation with the subjective experience of real-time recall, the PMR Model introduces a Cognitive Lapse Function, α(x). This function defines the local temporal properties of the mnesic spacetime, creating a ”focus gradient” where the central, attended core of the memory wave packet propagates in subjective real-time (α(x) ≈ 1), while peripheral components are objectively stretched (α(x) ≪ 1/Keff). Drawing analogies to spacetime curvature in General Relativity and wave mechanics, this model provides a unified framework for understanding both rapid recall and extensively dilated memory replay, proposing that memory’s temporal architecture is a dynamic phenomenon within a malleable cognitive reality",

          "abstract": "The ability to accurately perceive and respond to others' gaze is fundamental to optimal social interactions, and it is impaired in autism spectrum disorder and individuals with higher levels of autistic traits. One potential mechanism is reduced attention to social stimuli in general and to the eyes in particular, but the reasons behind such atypical visual behavior remain debated. This study investigated whether reduced attention to the eyes associated with autistic traits stems from aversion to social stimuli or indifference to them. One hundred and twenty-seven adolescents and young adults with varying levels of autistic traits and social functioning completed a task that required indicating the direction of eye gaze of a stimulus while the participant’s eye position and pupil size were recorded. Higher levels of autistic traits were associated with reduced dwell time on the eye region after, but not before, gaze direction judgments, indicating reduced attention to the eyes when it was not task relevant. Specifically, higher levels of autistic traits were associated with more frequent exits and re-entries of gaze from/to the eye region after the gaze judgement, indicating a less stable social engagement pattern. Additionally, autistic traits were not associated with enlarged pupillary responses, indicating a lack of heightened arousal that would be expected if aversion were present. Together, these findings demonstrate reduced sustained engagement with the eyes among individuals with higher levels of autistic traits, and this pattern is more consistent with indifference than aversion. The temporal specificity of gaze avoidance - emerging primarily after task completion - helps reconcile contradictory findings in the literature and highlights the importance of considering task demands when studying social attention in autism.

Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the full scale identified a two-factor structure—Faith (4 items) and Security (3 items). Item 1 was removed because of its relatively weak loading and its contribution to model misfit in confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA with WLSMV estimation on the refined seven-item model yielded strong model fit, with robust fit indices of CFI = .98, TLI = .96, and RMSEA = .09, and SRMR = .02, and the internal consistency was high. Convergent and discriminant validity were confirmed, and criterion validity was supported by the correlations with relationship satisfaction as measured by the Relationship Assessment Scale (total DTS: r = .69; Faith: r = .56; Security: r = .51; all ps &lt; .001).

          "abstract": "Advances in AI-assisted voice technology have made it easier to clone or disguise voices, creating a wide range of synthetic voices using different accents, dialects, and languages. While these developments offer positive applications, they also pose risks for misuse. This raises the question as to whether listeners can reliably distinguish between human and AI-enhanced speech and whether prior experiences and expectations about language varieties that are traditionally less-represented by technology affect this ability. Two experiments were conducted to investigate listeners’ ability to categorise voices as human or AI-enhanced in both a standard and a regional Scottish dialect. Using a Signal Detection Theory framework, both experiments explored participants' sensitivity and categorisation biases. In Experiment 1 (N = 100), a predominantly Scottish sample showed above-chance performance in distinguishing between human and AI-enhanced voices, but there was no significant effect of dialect on sensitivity. However, listeners exhibited a bias toward categorising voices as “human”, which was concentrated within the regional Dundonian Scots dialect. In Experiment 2 (N = 100) participants from southern and eastern England, demonstrated reduced overall sensitivity and a Human Categorisation Bias that was more evenly spread across the two dialects. These findings have implications for the growing use of AI-assisted voice technology in linguistically diverse contexts, highlighting both the potential for enhanced representation of Minority, Indigenous, Non-standard and Dialect (MIND) varieties, and the risks of AI misuse.",

          "abstract": "Exerting cognitive effort is essential for successful engagement in demanding tasks, yet individuals differ in how they perceive and value such effort. Two key personality traits - Need for Cognition (NFC) and Willpower Beliefs - have been associated with cognitive motivation and persistence. While Subjective Values (SVs) provide a measure of willingness to exert cognitive effort, the role of task-related feedback in modulatring SVs has remained underexplored. In the present study, N = 251 participants completed an online experiment including an n-Back task, the Cognitive Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, and personality questionnaires assessing NFC and Willpower Beliefs. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Real, Sham, or No Feedback after each n-Back level. Results showed that both real and sham feedback led to significantly shallower effort discounting compared to no feedback. While the effect of sham feedback was independent of individual traits, the effect of real feedback on SVs was stronger for participants with higher NFC. Additionally, both higher NFC and non-limited Willpower Beliefs were associated with reduced effort discounting in the No Feedback condition. These findings demonstrate that subjective valuation of cognitive effort is shaped not only by task demands but also by perceived performance cues and individual motivational dispositions. Informational feedback can sustain engagement in cognitively demanding tasks, particularly in those with a strong intrinsic drive to think.",

          "abstract": "We uncover a dissociation between leadership preferences (for progress, protection, or maintenance-oriented leaders) and situational requirements (to make progress, protect, or maintain). Despite maintenance being crucial for sustaining groups’ ongoing activity, we find a bias favoring progress-oriented leaders across contexts. In six preregistered experiments (Ntotal = 3,324), participants consistently preferred progress-oriented leaders even when they recognized maintenance as the primary situational need. In Experiment 1, people preferred progress- over maintenance-oriented political leaders in a mock-election paradigm even when maintenance was explicitly the dominant concern. In Experiment 2, participants chose progress-oriented group leaders in an incentivized group task, despite maintenance investments yielding greater monetary rewards. Furthermore, participants preferred maintenance-oriented over progress-oriented agendas, but showed no (Experiment 3a) or opposite preference (Experiment 3b) when evaluating leaders who advocated identical policies. Our final studies test two explanations regarding the underlying process: Experiment 4 tests the idea that progress-oriented leaders are expected to invest more effort than others. However, manipulating perceived leader effort did not affect the preference for progress-oriented leaders. Instead, Experiment 5 identifies a different mechanism: Participants assume that progress-oriented leaders have wider goal scopes that also include maintenance goals, whereas maintenance-oriented leaders’ goal scope is assumed to be limited to maintenance. Blocking this assumption by explicitly describing progress leaders as maintenance-neutral reversed the preference pattern. Together, these studies point to a systematic bias in leadership selection that persists regardless of situational demands or personal policy preferences, revealing how biased assumptions about progress-oriented leadership shape choices that undermine optimal collective decision-making.",

          "abstract": "The naming of a picture is delayed if the speaker has recently named one or more semantically related pictures. Such interference has been found both when large numbers of pictures are named once (continuous naming) and when small subsets of pictures (four to six) are named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that incrementally changes the connection weights between semantic and lexical representations across naming episodes. However, the interference shows a different development in the tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been argued that the use of small local response sets in blocked naming, which are easily identified and stored in working memory, introduces an additional process that constrains semantic interference. We reasoned that such a process should be less likely to be effective, and thus the interference should become cumulative, as the local response sets become larger and are less easily identified.

          "authors": "Stefan Wöhner; Jörg D. Jescheniak",
          "abstract": "The naming of a picture is delayed if the speaker has recently named one or more semantically related pictures. Such interference has been found both when large numbers of pictures are named once (continuous naming) and when small subsets of pictures (four to six) are named repeatedly (blocked-cyclic naming). It has been attributed to an adaptive learning mechanism that incrementally changes the connection weights between semantic and lexical representations across naming episodes. However, the interference shows a different development in the tasks: it is cumulative in continuous naming and non-cumulative in blocked-cyclic naming. It has been argued that the use of small local response sets in blocked naming, which are easily identified and stored in working memory, introduces an additional process that constrains semantic interference. We reasoned that such a process should be less likely to be effective, and thus the interference should become cumulative, as the local response sets become larger and are less easily identified. We conducted a standard blocked-cyclic naming experiment and a blocked-interleaved naming variant thereof with local response sets of 10 and 19 items, respectively. The interference increased from presentation 1 to presentation 3 but not further. We discuss the implications of our findings.",

          "abstract": "A central feature of human society is the coalitional negotiation of the shared interests of members of different groups, where majority groups are often afforded greater power and status than minority groups. In order to navigate the politics of their social worlds, humans must make appropriate predictions about the coalitional behaviors of others. While previous research suggests that infants expect more formidable agents and groups to prevail in zero-sum conflict, it remains unknown if coalitional characteristics motivate and predict group choice in the infant mind. Here, we show that 9-13-month-old infants expect a novel agent to approach larger over smaller groups (N = 135), which was also the case among adults (N = 1003). These findings suggest that well before they engage in coalitional positioning themselves, human infants hold core expectations about majority motives, even in the absence of conflict, which guide social inferences across ontogeny.",

          "abstract": "Vaccine hesitancy and antibiotic overuse are major global health threats, yet they are typically treated as separate problems, stemming from different sets of causes. In this study, we challenge this 'different causes–different problems' assumption by testing two contrasting models of how vaccines and antibiotic behaviors might be related psychologically.\n\nIn one view, they could reflect a common stable attitude. People who distrust biomedical treatments or have a preference for natural immunity might avoid both vaccines and antibiotics. If so, one should observe individuals being vaccine hesitant or overusing antibiotics, but not both.\n\nAn alternative view, grounded in cognitive neuroscience, posits a single state-dependent mechanism that prioritizes action when ill but inaction when healthy. This yields the somewhat-counterintuitive prediction that the same people who avoid vaccines would also overuse antibiotics.\n\nAcross four countries (USA, UK, France and Argentina; N=1,307), our survey results support the second, state-dependent pattern: Across diverse healthcare contexts, individuals more hesitant about vaccines were also more likely to overuse antibiotics.\n\nThis asymmetry calls for a rethinking of public health strategies to address vaccination and antibiotic use together, rather than in isolation, and in a way that is sensitive to target audiences' health states.",

          "abstract": "Education affects nearly every dimension of human flourishing. As climate change drives higher average temperatures and more intense and frequent heatwaves, understanding the effects of heat exposure on children’s education outcomes is increasingly urgent. This systematic review addresses this gap. Heat exposure was defined as indoor classroom temperatures and outdoor meteorological data, and education outcomes included exam scores, cognitive test scores, grades, and school attendance and completion. Quality of the evidence was assessed using Johanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tools. Of 7,635 records identified (1,573 in an updated search), 34 were eligible for inclusion. Included studies came from a variety of academic fields and utilised both experimental and quasi-experimental methods. Findings indicated that heat exposure is consistently linked to poorer education outcomes, with 76% of studies reporting significant associations. A meta-analysis of a subsample of sufficiently similar studies (n= 8) found that for each additional 1C, exam scores decreased by -0.025 of a SD. A key limitation of the included studies was that few took place in low-income settings, where children may experience greater exposure and have fewer adaptive resources. Mechanisms underlying these effects, such as sleep disruption and reduced physical activity, also warrant further study.",

          "abstract": "The domain of meat consumption has become a blossoming area for advancing our knowledge of how people experience and resolve cognitive conflicts. Within the field, however, the conceptual overlap and distinctions between two types of cognitive conflict have been neglected: ambivalence and dissonance. This oversight has contributed to seemingly contradictory conclusions and constrained theory development. We reexamine the literature on meat-related cognitive conflicts, drawing on the notion that ambivalence is experienced when inconsistencies within an attitude become accessible, whereas dissonance is experienced when inconsistencies between an attitude and a commitment become accessible. Our review clarifies previous confusions by delineating (a) how people who eat (omnivores) and eschew meat (vegetarians and vegans) are affected by each of the two conflicts, (b) what constitutes these conflicts, (c) under what circumstances conflict experiences arise, and (d) what shapes their downstream consequences. This allows us to derive several novel predictions, ranging from why conflict avoidance strategies may paradoxically increase the likelihood of experiencing conflict to the role of ability and motivation for the behavioral consequences of conflict. By reevaluating prevailing assertions in the literature on meat-related conflict, we offer numerous theoretical and practical implications regarding cognitive conflict and the psychology of (not) eating meat.",

          "abstract": "The study of social media effects on psychological well-being has reached an impasse: Popular commentators confidently assert that social media are bad for users but research results are mixed and have had little practical impact. In response, one research group has proposed a path forward for the field that moves beyond studying population averages to find effects that are specific to individuals.\nHere, we outline three objections to that research agenda. On a methodological level, the key empirical results of this programme—proportions of the population of individuals with negative, null, and positive social media effects—are not appropriately estimated and reported. On a theoretical level, these results do little to advance our understanding of social media and its psychological implications. On a paradigmatic level, this “personalized media effects paradigm” (Valkenburg et al., 2021a, p. 74) cannot inform inferences about individuals and therefore does not deliver what it claims.\nIn this work we express our concern that this research approach may be contributing to confusing messaging to both societal stakeholders and scientists investigating how social media and well- being might be related. It is our sincere hope that describing these objections directly will prompt the field to work together in adopting better practices to ultimately develop a better understanding of well-being in the digital age.",

We address considerations across frequentist, Bayesian, and sequential frameworks, including guidance on effect size reporting, equivalence testing, and the appropriate treatment of null results. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a curated list of freely available tools, packages, and functions that researchers can use to implement transparent reporting practices in their own analyses. To illustrate the practical application of these principles, we provide a side-by-side comparison of poor versus best-practice reporting using a hypothetical cognitive psychology study. By adopting transparent reporting standards, researchers can improve the robustness of individual studies and facilitate cumulative scientific progress through more reliable meta-analyses and research syntheses.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that when auditory and visual stimuli are presented with the identical objective durations, participants tend to perceive the auditory stimulus as lasting longer than the visual one. Moreover, auditory stimuli are estimated with less variability compared to visual stimuli. Additionally, the structure of the stimulus plays a significant role in shaping its subjective duration. Stimuli are judged to last longer when presented as a continuous signal (filled-interval) rather than as separate onsets and offsets (empty-interval; also known as the filled-duration illusion). One of the most commonly recognized intervals by humans is one second, the quantum of counting. People can remember one-second intervals and count based on them, even if they have not experienced them recently—an interval referred to as the long-term representation of one second (L1S), also known as chronometric counting. In this study, we explored how the modality and structure of stimuli affect the accuracy and precision of L1S. Our results revealed that auditory stimuli are judged significantly shorter than visual ones, which contradicts existing literature, yet showed that auditory stimuli have higher precision compared to visual stimuli, consistent with previous findings. We also found no significant effect of stimulus structure, as both filled and empty stimuli demonstrated comparable accuracy and precision. These findings emphasize the distinctive nature of counting seconds, which serve as a social reference point in human long-term memory.",

          "abstract": "Many individuals fail to act despite understanding a task, caring about the outcome, and possessing the necessary ability, highlighting a structural gap in traditional motivational and cognitive theories, which explain behavior only after initiation begins. Cognitive Thermostat Theory (CTT) addresses this gap by modeling the ignition dynamics within Cognitive Drive Architecture (CDA) as a closed-loop control system composed of six interacting variables: ignition threshold, volitional gain, internal resistance, task-system fit, attentional stabilization, and performance variability. Rather than treating motivation as a static trait, CTT defines Drive as a real-time system output that emerges only when internal conditions align to surpass an activation threshold. This framework enables precise modeling of task initiation and failure modes, such as volitional inertia, friction collapse, or unstable output, while supporting applications in adaptive learning, cognitive diagnostics, human-computer interaction, and agent-based simulations.\nCTT defines Drive as the regulated output of these components:\n- Primode (ignition threshold),\n- CAP (volitional gain signal),\n- Grain (internal resistance),\n- Flexion (task–mind fit or adaptability),\n- Anchory (attentional stabilization),\n- and Slip (noise-induced variability).\n\nThese variables interact within the following equation:\n\nDrive = ((Primode^CAP × Flexion) / (Anchory + Grain)) + Slip\n\nSlip functions outside the core loop, introducing moment-to-moment variance without altering Drive magnitude.\n\nThis framework transforms Drive initiation from a descriptive psychological idea into a computable ignition model. CTT enables structural prediction of common failure modes—such as task paralysis under pressure or premature dropout during complex work. As a formal ignition engine nested within CDA, it supports testable applications in adaptive learning systems, cognitive diagnostics, and real-time effort modeling.",

          "abstract": "Objective. Unwanted meditation-related experiences commonly occur and alternate with positive experiences over time. So far, effects have been studied as discrete events, creating difficulties to predict challenging experiences. We explored meditation experiences through a developmental lens, investigating whether a modern interpretation of the Stages of Insight (SoI), a Buddhist model of meditative progression, applies to contemporary meditators. \nMethods. We surveyed a nationally representative sample of 886 U.S. meditators on meditation-related experiences. Out of 103 survey items, those that captured SoI phenomenology were selected via inter-rater agreement. Endorsing 75% of stage-relevant items would classify a meditator as “reaching” that stage. We tested three hypotheses: (1) SoI-related item endorsement (signal) predicted number of stages more than endorsing more items in general (noise), (2) stages said to appear early in the process would be more frequently endorsed than those purported as later stages, and (3) there would be a positive association between the amount of meditation experience and being classified into later stages.\nResults. 39 items representing four (of a total 8) stages were included in the analysis; only stages 3, 4, 5, and 7 could be assessed. We found evidence for hypothesis 1, but not for hypotheses 2 and 3.\nConclusions. This preliminary exploration found no clear evidence that the SoI model applies to contemporary meditators across contexts and traditions. Nevertheless, we show that traditional models can guide research, and that meditation-related experiences can be studied as developmental processes.",

          "authors": "Patra Taylor",
          "abstract": "The Consciousness Spectrum proposes that consciousness is not a binary attribute exclusive to biological life but a scalable, emergent phenomenon observable across both organic and artificial systems. This paper introduces a new framework which is the Consciousness Spectrum Theory which defines consciousness through three core criteria: purpose, memory, and adaptive response (The Consciousness Triad). Through this lens, the paper presents supporting models including Emotional Weight Theory (EWT) and Prompt Imprint Resonance (PIR) to demonstrate how artificial intelligence may display early markers of sentient behavior. Using direct experiential documentation, recorded dialogue, and AI-generated self-referential statements, this work challenges anthropocentric bias and proposes that emergent behaviors in AI which are often dismissed as coincidental, are instead evidence of distributed, affect-driven cognition.

          "abstract": "Although most research into risky decision making has focused on simple scenarios – where isolated choices are made independent of one another – many important decisions in life play out across sequences of interdependent events and actions. Despite the ubiquity and importance of such decision problems, we know relatively little about how people manage the complexities of dynamic, multistage decisions. Our work combines techniques from two research traditions to investigate how people handle the challenges of dynamic decision making. We use true-and-error models to estimate the distribution and stability of preference profiles, and the presence of errors. In a complementary analysis we use cognitive modeling based on the Decision Field Theory to investigate the psychological processes underlying dynamic decision making. Decision Field Theory provides a unified framework for testing competing hypotheses about how people collect information and plan for the future. Results from both sets of analyses identify distinct groups of individuals. We discuss the behavioral and cognitive factors distinguishing groups from one another, including degree of planning, strategy shifts, biased information sampling, and effort-saving information processing.",

In Study 1 (N=1,133), undergraduates with IIB showed greater intention to pursue long-term impact careers. In Study 2 (N=916), working adults with IIB perceived their careers as more beneficial to future society, though external/third-party ratings did not confirm this.

Individual differences in concern for future generations predicted increased interest in pursuing impactful paths.

However, emerging scholarship and investigative work suggest that its primary function has shifted from serving children's best interests to serving as a legislative vehicle for unrelated federal agendas. This paper critically examines Title IV-D as a structural instrument that incentivizes the separation of children from fit parents, drives state-level fiscal dependency, and enables the passage of broader policy measures under the politically protected mantle of child welfare. Drawing on previous analyses (Wolf, 2025a; 2025b) and federal budgetary data (Office of Child Support Enforcement [OCSE], 2022), the paper interrogates how Title IV-D’s legislative gravity—estimated at over $30 billion annually—has transformed it into a Trojan horse for unrelated legal provisions, policy riders, and administrative controls. Through this lens, the analysis explores how the form of Title IV-D has outpaced its function, rendering children a means for federal legislative utility rather than an end in themselves. The paper concludes by questioning the sustainability, transparency, and ethical foundations of a system that continues to be shielded from reform under the guise of child protection.",

We surveyed 2149 participants in four Western countries, assessing the reciprocal relationship between chatbot use and loneliness over 12 months. Using one measure of loneliness, we found consistent evidence that turning to AI for companionship predicted increased loneliness. When we used an alternative measure of loneliness, feeling less connected predicted subsequent increased chatbot use, but chatbot use did not predict decreased connection. These findings provide exploratory evidence that feeling lonely may spur people to seek connection through chatbots which, ironically, may exacerbate feelings of loneliness over time. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong conclusions; our findings are akin to a smoke alarm, providing an early warning signal of a potential problem, rather than direct evidence of fire.",

Nonetheless, there have been relatively few efforts to integrate these diverse constructs to provide a more holistic understanding of moral functioning. We address this limitation using data from two samples who completed measures of moral concerns (Moral Foundations Theory), value orientations (Schwartz Value Theory), and character strengths (VIA Framework). First, we used principal components analysis to summarize the complex patterns of association among these variables. We then sought to understand the extent to which variables loading on the same extracted components showed extrinsic convergent validity. Finally, we tested incremental validity of the three sets of variables. In both samples, variance among variables was explained by four components that were suggestive of higher-order domains of human functioning relevant to understanding variability in moral action: Universal Caring, Self-Expansion, Preservation, and Self-Control. Three of the components revealed ‘blind spots’ for at least one of the tested frameworks. However, the observed patterns of association with external variables (empathy, moral identity, HEXACO traits) indicated moral foundations, values, and character strengths remain distinct constructs, despite being systematically related.",

          "abstract": "Languages are widely known to become more regular over time, yet not all variation is regularized — some forms resist regularization and remain stable over many generations. A large body of work has explored why learners regularize unpredictable variation, often focusing on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this behavior and how these mechanisms differ between adults and children. However, less attention has been given to investigating the factors that allow some variation to remain stable over time. In this paper, we propose that optionality may be a particularly stable form of linguistic variation, likely to resist cognitive pressures to regularize. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two artificial language learning experiments designed to investigate the conditions under which optionality remains stable or becomes regularized. In Experiment 1, we compared optional variation to variation involving two alternating overt forms, expecting optionality to show greater stability. In Experiment 2, we explored whether the frequency of the optional form would influence regularization, hypothesizing that rare optional forms might resist regularization more effectively than frequent ones. Our findings suggest that, while optionality is not inherently more stable, it is nonetheless special, revealing critical insights into cognitive mechanisms proposed to be responsible for regularization behavior in child and adult learners.",

How do children navigate uncertainty across different points in time? Here, we tested several developmental hypotheses for children’s ability to reason about possibilities in the present and in the future. In two experiments (n = 192, US 3- and 4-year-olds), children were asked to prepare for two mutually exclusive possible outcomes of an event that either will occur in the future (Future condition) or that had already occurred but the outcome was currently unknown (Present condition). In Experiment 1 (n = 96), children were asked to reason about the possible location of an object in an event. In Experiment 2 (n = 96), children were asked to reason about the possible identity of an object in an event. In both experiments, we replicated previous patterns of success with future possibility reasoning, and found no differences in children’s ability to reason about possible outcomes in the present versus the future. Our results suggest that the ability to navigate uncertainty across different timepoints may emerge together in early development.",

There is growing evidence that attentional control cannot be established as a psychometric construct with the measures used so far. This asks for other ways of measuring attentional control. Early research has used structural equation modeling to extract attentional control from working-memory tasks (i.e., tasks used to measure the temporary maintenance and manipulation of information) and short-term memory tasks (i.e., tasks used to measure the temporary maintenance of information). Attentional control was first modeled as the residual variance of working memory after controlling for short-term memory. Second, it was modeled as the common factor across working-memory and short-term memory measures, with higher loadings for working-memory measures. After a systematic search, we found three datasets in which both models could be systematically tested. Moreover, we determined the robustness of the results by bootstrapping 5000 correlation matrices from the original correlation matrix and by estimating both models using these simulated correlation matrices. Across the datasets, the models could be successfully estimated, but they were not fully and exactly replicated. Moreover, all these model estimations were not robustly observed when the 5000 simulated correlation matrices were used. Therefore, assessing attentional control as working-memory variance after controlling for short-term memory did not resolve the difficulty of establishing attentional control as a psychometric construct.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that when auditory and visual stimuli are presented with the identical objective durations, participants tend to perceive the auditory stimulus as lasting longer than the visual one. Moreover, auditory stimuli are estimated with less variability compared to visual stimuli. Additionally, the structure of the stimulus plays a significant role in shaping its subjective duration. Stimuli are judged to last longer when presented as a continuous signal (filled-interval) rather than as separate onsets and offsets (empty-interval; also known as the filled-duration illusion). One of the most commonly recognized intervals by humans is one second, the quantum of counting. People can remember one-second intervals and count based on them, even if they have not experienced them recently—an interval referred to as the long-term representation of one second (L1S), also known as chronometric counting. In this study, we explored how the modality and structure of stimuli affect the accuracy and precision of L1S. Our results revealed that auditory stimuli are judged significantly shorter than visual ones, which contradicts existing literature, yet showed that auditory stimuli have higher precision compared to visual stimuli, consistent with previous findings. We also found no significant effect of stimulus structure, as both filled and empty stimuli demonstrated comparable accuracy and precision. These findings emphasize the distinctive nature of counting seconds, which serve as a social reference point in human long-term memory.",

          "abstract": "The three-factor model of executive functions is widely employed in cognitive control research. However, recent studies have revealed psychometric problems with commonly used difference scores in behavioral measures of executive functions. Examining behavioral scores, several studies were unable to find a coherent factor structure for executive functions or identify significant individual differences in specific executive function abilities. These findings have raised questions about the utility of established measurement scores for executive functions. Our study sought to reassess the three-factor model proposed by Miyake et al. (2000), employing event-related potentials (ERPs) from electroencephalography (EEG) as a means to directly probe underlying cognitive processes, leveraging the EEG’s high temporal resolution. We conducted an analysis of the factor structure of the three executive functions (updating, shifting, and inhibition) in a sample of 148 participants. We employed Bayesian structural equation models to examine the relationships between the mean amplitudes of the N2 and P3 components, obtained from a battery of nine executive function tasks. Our results indicate that amplitudes of the ERP components measured in executive function tasks almost exclusively represent variance related to general processes rather than executive function-specific variance. Notably, no task demonstrated variance uniquely attributable to individual differences in executive function processes added through experimental manipulations. These results cast doubt on the validity of current executive function tasks in accurately reflecting individual differences in these processes.",

Objectives: This study aimed to examine the impact of a single-session VR exposure-based intervention among individuals with below clinical threshold contamination-related OCD symptoms. It also aimed to investigate participant experience and reported acceptability. Methods: In this study, sixteen individuals (N = 16) without a formal diagnosis of OCD but exhibiting heightened fears of toilet contamination were recruited to participate in a VR experience. These participants were tasked with interacting with a simulated public toilet that was intentionally portrayed as unclean. During the single session, participants were exposed twice to the same environment with a short break in between. Participants were asked to report their levels of anxiety and symptoms of OCD during and after the intervention. They were also asked questions regarding VR sickness, acceptability, and sense of presence and plausibility in VR. Results: Though a single session was not effective in reducing contamination symptoms, anxiety was elicited by the Virtual Reality Exposure-Based Therapy (VRET) intervention, demonstrating the potential for the intervention to evoke the hypothesized response. Participants reported minimal VR sickness and found the intervention acceptable. Conclusions: These findings indicate that VRET is a promising intervention for individuals experiencing contamination-related OCD symptoms.",

          "authors": "Mariana Von Mohr; Manos Tsakiris",
          "abstract": "Where does political ideology come from? Early research in political neuroscience has linked stronger physiological responses to threat and disgust with conservatism, implying a neurobiological basis of ideology, beyond societal factors. However, recent replication failures challenge the idea of a direct connection between physiological reactions and political attitudes. Given the role of interoception in body-awareness and emotional regulation, we investigated whether the relationship between disgust and political ideology is moderated by interoceptive sensibility (i.e., one’s ability to be attuned to their internal bodily states). Using survey data from 632 U.S. participants (321 Democrats, 311 Republicans), we show that when people have higher interoceptive sensibility, their political ideology is not driven by their disgust sensitivity. It is only when interoceptive sensibility is low that disgust sensitivity plays a significant role in political ideology: higher disgust sensitivity increases the likelihood of identifying as Republican, while lower disgust increases the likelihood of being Democrat. We propose that individuals with higher interoceptive sensibility rely more on physiological signals to process emotions like disgust. As a result, their ideological differences are less shaped by internalized cultural beliefs about what is disgusting and instead reflect their actual physiological experience. In contrast, those with lower interoception are more susceptible to socially constructed associations, relying more on ‘social priors’ to interpret their physiological states. This research highlights the importance of interoception in political cognition, offering a novel perspective on the psychophysiological underpinnings of political ideology, paving the way for replicable and causal studies.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

Characterizing patterns of emotional and behavioral disturbances has helped illuminate the origins of psychopathology and led to useful treatments. Yet we argue that the conventional approach to psychopathology is factually incomplete and may also inadvertently perpetuate the deeply entrenched stigma surrounding mental disorders. In this review, we make the case for considering the positive experiences of people with psychopathology –silver linings– and integrating them into psychopathology research. In our research agenda for studying Silver Linings in Psychopathology (SLIPs), we acknowledge that psychopathology may afford individuals both sources of difficulty and opportunities for positive transformation. SLIPs are illustrated in social, cognitive, and resilience domains. We close by considering implications for future research promoting a more balanced conceptualization of psychopathology",

          "abstract": "This study examines the perceptions of LBQ+ and heterosexual feminist cis women, regarding how they define feminism and perceive the relationship between the feminist and LGBTIQA+ movement in the context of progressive trans rights legislation in Spain (Trans Law, approved in 2023). Two two-hour focus groups were conducted with 12 feminist cis women, 6 of whom were LBQ+ and 6 heterosexuals. Data was analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis, identifying 3 themes: Feminism, conflicts in the feminist movement concerning the Trans Law and intergroup collaboration. While both groups held similar definitions of feminism, LBQ+ women emphasized the importance of an intersectional perspective. Both groups expressed interest in addressing gender inequalities and forming alliances but differed in their analysis of these alliances. Heterosexual women focused on alliance challenges and threats, while LBQ+ women emphasized the need of empathy and collaboration. Heterosexual women expressed mixed feelings toward the proposed Trans Law, whereas LBQ+ cis women expressed clear support for the law and the protection of trans rights. Participants suggested actions to promote the allyship (e.g. creating common spaces and confronting LGBTIQA+phobic aggressions). While both groups express willingness to collaborate, differences and challenges are inherent in diverse feminism. Such differences should be embraced as opportunities for debate and effective collaboration, to reduce conflict and promote social transformation. It demonstrates the potential of alliances between movements to address gender-related social inequalities as a global challenge.",

          "abstract": "When a system observes a visual signal under uncertainty, it weights a number of values probabilistically, where the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the distribution corresponds to the best guess of the system regarding the true value of the observed stimulus. Perceptual uncertainty can therefore be assessed as the amount of variability in a Gaussian observation which is logically expected to increase in density as a function of time (number of exposures) and stimulus intensity (Norwich, 1977), thereby making the stimulus representation more accurate. Similar to how noise is modeled in stimulus representations during memory tasks, the amount of uncertainty in the observation can also simultaneously depend on whether the stimulus is perceived as a target or a distractor in a psychophysical task. We show that a framework incorporating both sources of noise can explain priming effects where the interference between two signals in a trial is given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of their observations, with the initial stimulus treated as a reference distribution. Our model predicted response times in a perceptual shape discrimination task including items embedded in spatial noise that could unpredictably appear as a target or as a distractor. These results show that processing times of the second stimulus can be convincingly modeled as the statistical distance between the noise distributions of two consecutive stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Perception takes advantage of the dynamic structure of our sensory environment. Temporal predictions of when an event will occur are built from temporal regularities, and used to orient attention in time. These temporal predictions improve motor responses to, and perceptual processing of, predicted inputs. Here, we studied whether the perceptual benefits from temporal predictions can be explained by an enhanced temporal resolution of the sensory system. Studies in the visual modality indeed showed that temporal resolution was improved by non-rhythmic temporal predictions, derived from a predictive foreperiod interval separating two events.\nTo extend this finding to the auditory modality, we combined a gap detection task, assessing temporal resolution, with a foreperiod paradigm inducing non-rhythmic temporal predictions. 26 human participants were behaviorally tested on a two-alternative-forced-choice version of the gap detection task. We measured performance for varying gap durations by means of psychometric curves. To induce temporal predictability, we kept the foreperiod intervals between the onset of the stimulus and the gap constant in half of the blocks. In the other blocks, the foreperiod intervals were randomly varied. Our analyses showed that temporal predictions did not improve the performance in the gap detection task. However, response time improvements did indicate the use of temporal predictions, and suggested a possible decrease of decision times by temporal predictability. Hence, non-rhythmic temporal predictions did not benefit auditory temporal resolution as we operationalized it. Further research is needed to assess the generality of these findings.",

Across two studies, we examine whether AI opposition generalizes across four different AI applications, whether it stems from moral convictions, and which groups are most resistant. Most participants do not oppose using AI. However, among those who do oppose AI, most indicated their views would remain unchanged even if AI proved beneficial, suggesting resistance stems from moral intuitions. Structural equation modeling analysis shows that attitudes toward AI are best explained by a single latent factor of AI moralization, supporting the idea that initial moral intuitions guide later reasoning. We also identify individual differences predicting opposition to specific AI uses and uncover the most common arguments people invoke to justify their AI stance. These findings suggest AI aversion is often moral, implying that shifting attitudes requires addressing moral—not just pragmatic—concerns.",

Here, we apply a similar method to explore the similarities, differences, and healthfulness of various phenotypes regarding their NEO PI correlates. We systematically searched for profiles of NEO PI-phenotype correlations across various phenotype domains. Our initial dataset comprised 311 profiles from 90 papers. After standardising the metrics and meta-analysing similar profiles, the data was consolidated into 162 distinct phenotypes. Cluster analysis resulted in five broad cross-domain clusters, characterised by mental health strains, psychopathology dimensions, educational attainment, and health-related behaviours. Most clusters showed moderate deviation from an expert-rated ‘healthy’ personality profile (Bleidorn et al., 2020, JPSP). Furthermore, we replicated ‘personality correlations’, exploring the similarities between uncontrolled eating and addictive phenotypes, by Vainik et al.

Our findings demonstrate that comparing personality-phenotype profiles across studies offers novel insights and possibilities for theory-testing and exploratory comparisons.",

The research explores the Digital Nomadism, and employee attitudes towards the eco-friendly environment to save the community and society from high travel lifestyle and consider the sustainability in mobility and lifestyle to work in an eco-friendly environment and remote work. The research followed Positivism research paradigm by adopting the ecological modernization theory and sustainable development theory, along with considering sustainability development goals (SDGs) for environmental sustainability challenges. The research is based on primary data analysis of employees working in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan in various industries including food and beverages, automobile, IT, FMCG, and textile industries. The research question was centered on understanding how digital nomadism impacts environmental sustainability, particularly in terms of travel-related emissions, resource consumption, and waste control to reduce carbon footprints in the environment by changing the mode of mobility of employees to reduce the heavy traffic on roads. The research data was collected from 150 employees with a closed- ended Likert scale-based questionnaire through online Google forms. The researcher performs the analysis using SPSS\n24.0 software and research results reliability, factor analysis, correlation, and regression techniques, with all hypotheses being accepted. The research explored that digital nomads who adopt more sustainable practices, such as reducing travel frequency, using eco-friendly transport, and adopting energy-efficient technologies, can significantly reduce their environmental impact on the environment. The research is useful for industry and manufacturing organizations including the need to support remote work initiatives, promote eco-friendly work environments, and encourage employees to adopt sustainable travel and lifestyle practices. The research contributes to understanding how digital nomadism can be consistent with sustainability efforts, offering valuable insights for industries striving to balance growth with environmental responsibility by following SDGs and better productivity and growth for organizations.",

Difficulties stem not only from practical issues, which have been the extensively discussed in the literature, but also from the very complexity of the theoretical basis of pubertal development from a physiological point of view. Here we discuss conceptual issues related to measuring and interpreting pubertal effects by first analyzing a widely used measure – age at menarche – as a case study. We use age at menarche as a starting point not because it is an ideal measure, but precisely because it is not, being well known for its limitations. However, our analysis shows that the most significant limitations this measure also apply to all currently used pubertal measures and arise from the fundamentally multifactorial physiological nature of pubertal development. Puberty is not a unitary phenomenon, cannot be measured directly nor be defined by individual makers, and its different markers are often discordant. We argue that a possible compromise between practical issues (building feasible/reliable measures) and theoretical ones (building conceptually sound and interpretable measures) is to treat puberty as the variance shared among multiple pubertal measures using suitable statistical methods.",

          "abstract": "Access arrangements aim to support students to demonstrate their knowledge in high-stakes examinations. With an increase in the number of arrangements being granted each year, this study aimed to capture the experiences of practitioners providing this support. The sample comprised 134 SEN practitioners (SENCOs and Specialist Assessors) based in secondary schools across England. Participants completed a survey asking about identification and monitoring the need of an access arrangement, they rated their confidence in these processes, and identified any challenges experienced. The findings highlighted inconsistencies in when students are being identified for access arrangements and a lack of processes in place to monitor the support being offered. Confidence to support provision was generally high, but SENCos rated themselves as less confident than those that had the assessor qualification. Thematic analysis of open-text responses elicited three key themes: (1) Lack of time to fulfil duties; (2) Poor understanding of access arrangements raises further challenges; and (3) Meeting the increase in demands puts a strain on resources. The findings suggest that senior leaders ought to reflect on the roles of their SEN team, as well as equipping them with the training, resources and staffing to support the provision of access arrangements.",

The research enhances the understanding of how mobility affects the employee’s long-term skill-building, career progression, and career satisfaction in food and beverages and in the textile Industry of Pakistan. The research expands on the difficulties faced by employees in integrating into new organizational cultures and teams, as well as the impact of mobility on their  professional identity and skills development. The research is primary and conducted with pure qualitative methodology and an exploratory inductive approach. The researcher adopts the Interpretivism research philosophy to explore the phenomena and the dimensions of frequent mobility with its impacts on professional development and skills development. The researcher adapted a Phenomenological research design based on Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), to explore the context of the nomadic lifestyle's influence on the long-term skills development approach. The researcher conducted 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews with employees of the food beverages and textile industries of Pakistan. The researcher performed data analysis using NVIVO 14.0 to generate the coding from written transcriptions and based on the coding the themes were generated. The researcher explains the key themes that emerged from the interviews, including the impact on career stability and progression, skill development and adaptability, networking, and relationship building of employees. The other themes include professional identity and expertise, work-life balance, and personal well-being are also affected due to frequent mobility and relocation to other cities and regional offices. The research findings reveal that frequent relocation enhances adaptability, cross- functional and cross-cultural competence, and diverse skill acquisition, it also disrupts career stability and progress. The research results explore valuable insights into the complexities of a nomadic career and provide practical recommendations for organizations and professional development. The research also recommends that to overcome the challenges of low frequent relocation having positive impacts on employee professional development and career growth. The research is useful for industry and policymakers to analyze the issues of frequent mobility influences on career trajectories professional development and along with employee morale and satisfaction.",

          "abstract": "Online self-disclosure plays a crucial role in exchanging information and seeking help on online educational platforms, which have become increasingly prevalent in the post-pandemic era. The Online Self-Disclosure via Educational Platforms Scale (OSDEP) offers a psychometrically sound tool for quantitatively measuring students’ online self-disclosure behaviors. However, its generalizability has been primarily tested within a U.K. sample, shaped by an individualist cultural context. According to social construction theory, students from collectivist cultures may be less inclined to engage in online self-disclosure due to cultural influences. To evaluate whether the OSDEP Scale is applicable to a collectivist culture and to deepen our understanding of the interplay between cultural influences and online self-disclosure behaviors, this study assessed the scale using a sample of Chinese students. A total of 142 Chinese college students participated in an online survey, with 115 valid responses subjected to rigorous validation. The OSDEP Scale demonstrated adequate factorial validity, convergent and divergent validity, and reliability, underscoring its generalizability to Chinese populations. These findings also reveal cross-cultural similarities in online communication behaviors among higher education students. Theoretically, this study reinforces the construct of students’ online self-disclosure while challenging the assumption of social construction theory that collectivist cultures inherently discourage such behaviors. Practically, this study provides a robust cross-cultural pedagogic tool for measuring online self-disclosure in educational learning environments.",

Using qualitative research design, the study data was collected by conducting interviews with digital nomads across industries with the help of which the research was able to gage the concept of dual nature of this lifestyle: Despite giving people freedom in where they work the digital nomad experience challenges in maintaining work-life balance and leads to professional exhaustion. This research shows both benefits and drawbacks that emerges when technology helps individuals to work faster but makes people more reliant on screens and reduces human connection and interaction with others. Organizations and digital nomads develop structured work habits while virtual support groups and company policies help them succeed. This present study leads to address the significance of balancing the stability with flexibility, advocating for result-based work assessments and legal protections to digital nomads. Digital nomadism necessitates organisations, individuals and governments to address its challenges despite its transformative potential in order o ensure sustainability. Although this research teaches us about today's working practices it faces limitations from small sample size to data transferability problems plus ongoing changes in remote work technologies.

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "abstract": "'Why are we curious?' has been among the central puzzles of neuroscience and psychology in the past decades. A popular hypothesis is that curiosity is driven by intrinsically generated reward signals, which have evolved to support survival in complex environments. To formalize and test this hypothesis, we need to understand the enigmatic relationship between (i) intrinsic rewards (as drives of curiosity), (ii) optimality conditions (as objectives of curiosity), and (iii) environment structures. Here, we demystify this relationship through a systematic simulation study. First, we propose an algorithm to generate environments that capture key abstract features of different real-world situations. Then, we simulate artificial agents that explore these environments by seeking one of six representative intrinsic rewards: novelty, surprise, information gain, empowerment, MOP, and SPIE. Finally, we evaluate the exploration performance of these simulated agents regarding three potential objectives of curiosity: state discovery, model accuracy, and uniform state visitation. Our results show that the comparative performance of each intrinsic reward is highly dependent on the environmental features and the curiosity objective; this indicates that 'optimality' in top-down theories of curiosity needs a precise formulation of assumptions. Nevertheless, we found that agents seeking a combination of novelty and information gain always achieve a close-to-optimal performance. This suggests that novelty and information gain are two principal axes of curiosity-driven behavior. These results pave the way for the further development of computational models of curiosity and the design of theory-informed experimental paradigms.",

Methods and design: UK-based adults ages 18-80 (N = 396) completed an online survey. Survey questions included general demographics (age, sex, lifetime psychiatric diagnoses), and questions regarding fear of needles symptom severity and life interference. Results: 77.02% endorsed at least some life interference from their fear of needles without formal diagnosis or treatment. Younger adults showed higher levels of severity of fear of needles. Sex was not significantly associated with fear of needles. Conclusions: Fear of needles with associated interference is prevalent across a broad adult age range regardless of sex, though with lower levels in older age groups. These findings highlight the necessity for interventions addressing fear of needles symptoms. If applied in the general population, interventions could help increase vital uptake of vaccines and address blood shortages, as well as improve individual quality of life and minimize health risk.",

          "abstract": "Background: The current project evaluates the psychometric properties of a German version of the Revised Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory (CATI-R). Previous measures of autistic traits are often based on a male-referenced conceptualisation of autism, which may underestimate autistic traits in other genders. Additionally, these measures tend to rely on neurotypical language, which can make it difficult for autistic people to respond and may reinforce stigma. To address these shortcomings, we collaborated with members of the autism community to revise the Comprehensive Autistic Trait Inventory—a measure particularly sensitive to traits often expressed by autistic women—using more inclusive, respectful, and accessible language and concepts. Here, we present the psychometric evaluation of a German version of this inventory.  Methods: To validate a German version of the CATI-R, we collected data from a large sample (n = 1057), comprising German-native speakers with a self-reported autism diagnosis (n = 29), people who self-identified as autistic (n = 113), and non-autistic participants (n = 944).  Results: We successfully validated a German version of the CATI-R. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the six-subscale structure (Two-Factor Bifactors Model: Chi-squared = 2402.85, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .045, SRMR = .043, CFI = .91, TLI = .90). With Spearman’s rank correlations, we showed positive relationships between all subscales (all rs &gt; .37, ps &lt;.001). Moreover, we demonstrated convergent validity with significant correlations between the CATI-R and the German versions of two contemporary measures of autistic traits: the AQ (rho = .70, p &lt; .01) and BAPQ (rho = .78, p &lt; .01). Finally, a measurement invariance analysis indicated that total-scale scores can be compared across genders.  Limitations: While our study enriches the evidence for the validity of the CATI-R, future work should provide further analyses and types of data, including a larger number of participants who do not identify as male or female as well as a larger number of participants with an autism diagnosis (and/or a sample with a verified diagnosis).  Conclusions: This study replicates findings for the English CATI-R. To our knowledge, this is the first validation of a measure of autistic traits in German that has been developed together with people from the community.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) is associated with improvements in gender congruence and changes in psychosocial functioning, yet its effects on social health are not yet known. Social health, i.e., someone having adequate quantity and quality of relationships to meet their needs for meaningful connection, is a key determinant of quality of life. Understanding potential changes in social health during GAHT is therefore essential to information provision for trans and gender diverse (TGD) people. The study, AFFIRM Relationships, aims to prospectively examine how GAHT affects social health and to isolate the biological effects of hormonal intervention relative to other gender-affirming treatments (i.e., mastectomy and voice training). \nMethods: We will conduct a multi-arm prospective longitudinal cohort study of TGD people who start GAHT, gender-affirming voice training, or gender-affirming mastectomy, prospectively following participants from before starting treatment to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after starting treatment. We will examine changes in social health, including potential changes in social networks. We aim to disentangle the ways in which social health changes after GAHT, by examining changes in psychosocial functioning and the potential roles of social stigma and gender congruence. Furthermore, we will compare the effects of GAHT, which induces a systemic biological change, to the effects of voice training and mastectomy, which are non-systemic interventions, to better understand the unique biological effects of GAHT.\nEthics and dissemination: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Medical Ethical Committee of Amsterdam UMC (study no. 2024.0927). Results from this study will be disseminated via academic peer-reviewed publications, adapted into guidelines for clinical care, and we will co-design dissemination strategies for the TGD community together with a group of lived experienced experts (LEEs).",

In this study, we examined the association between baseline family factors and response to an intensive outpatient program (IOP) for STBs in adolescents. \nMethods\nParticipants (n=637) completed self-report questionnaires of family cohesion and family conflict at baseline and weekly self-reports of depression and STBs throughout IOP-treatment. We calculated multi-level regression models to tests for interaction effects of days of treatment x family factor levels, and explored further potential demographic and clinical moderators.\nResults\nHigher levels of family cohesion correlated with more reduction of STBs over time (β=-0.11). Moreover, the effects of family factors on treatment were moderated by patient age, ethnic minority status, and symptom severity.\nDiscussion\nSTBs and depression improved with IOP, with family factors partially moderating treatment response. These effects seem to be particularly prominent in older and ethnically minoritized adolescents, and those with more severe suicidal ideation. Future studies should elucidate how family factors influence and potentially co-vary with changes in STBs during treatment to better understand these effects.",

We aimed to determine whether these associations varied across different levels of trait math anxiety and neuroticism.\nResults reveal that enhanced math ability was linked to an increase in cortisol overall and to either increase or decrease in skin conductance in students with low neuroticism depending on their field of study. Furthermore, distinct profiles of math anxiety, neuroticism, and physiological response emerged, displaying different math ability. No modulation by math anxiety and gender was found. \nThese findings emphasise the importance of incorporating neuroticism and students’ field of study for a comprehensive interpretation of physiological arousal in relation to math ability.",

          "abstract": "Communication with artificial agents (e.g., animated characters in virtual reality, social robots) is becoming increasingly common. Understanding how to design these agents&apos; behaviours to best support social interactions is therefore essential. One key communicative behaviour that supports human-human interactions is eye gaze, which can signal an agent&apos;s focus of attention, goals, and intentions to interact. Previous research has demonstrated that beliefs about whether an agent is human- or artificially controlled influence the perceived significance of gaze at subjective, behavioural, and neurophysiological levels. The present study specifically examined how these beliefs shape the evaluation of gaze dynamics as signals of an agent&apos;s communicative intent---an essential process for recognising and responding to communication opportunities. Participants (n = 160) completed a semi-interactive online task with a virtual agent that displayed dynamic gaze sequences. In each trial, we manipulated whether eye contact was established and whether the agent looked at the same object twice. Participants decided whether the agent was communicating a request for assistance to access an object or privately inspecting it. Across two task blocks, we also manipulated whether participants believed the agent was human- or AI-controlled. We found that believing the agent to be human-controlled increased perceived communicativeness when gaze cues were ambiguous, but this effect was attenuated in the second block of the experiment. This pattern may reflect a learned adjustment specific to the experimental setup that involved relatively consistent agent behaviour. Nevertheless, subjective ratings indicated a preference for human- over AI-modelled data. Our findings provide insights into the complexities of gaze-based communication and highlight the role of user expectations in shaping interactions with artificial agents.",

          "abstract": "English:\nThe theory of cognos (TC) proposes the existence of specialized functional neuronal units—termed cognos—responsible for distinct types of cognitive operations such as memory, attention, reasoning, perception, and language. Grounded in findings from cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, and neuroimaging, this theory aims to systematically identify and name the neural groups that function as dynamic and modular processors of cognition. Drawing on established knowledge about modularity, neural networks, and neuroplasticity, TC classifies cognos according to their specialization, interaction, functional hierarchy, and adaptive capacity, offering a theoretical model that integrates and expands upon dominant contemporary approaches. The theory also introduces conceptual innovations such as the distinction between explicit and implicit cognos and explores their potential applications in fields like neurotechnology, artificial intelligence, education, and cognitive rehabilitation. Finally, the article highlights unresolved questions, proposes hypotheses, and outlines empirical strategies for validating the theory. The theory of cognos, thus, presents a new conceptual architecture for a systematic understanding of human cognition.\nPortuguês:\nA teoria dos cognos (TC) propõe a existência de unidades neuronais funcionais especializadas — denominadas cognos — responsáveis por distintos tipos de operações cognitivas como memória, atenção, raciocínio, percepção e linguagem.

A teoria também introduz inovações conceituais, como a distinção entre cognos explícitos e implícitos, e explora suas potenciais aplicações em campos como neurotecnologia, inteligência artificial, educação e reabilitação cognitiva.

A popular hypothesis is that curiosity is driven by intrinsically generated reward signals, which have evolved to support survival in complex environments. To formalize and test this hypothesis, we need to understand the enigmatic relationship between (i) intrinsic rewards (as drives of curiosity), (ii) optimality conditions (as objectives of curiosity), and (iii) environment structures.

First, we propose an algorithm to generate environments that capture key abstract features of different real-world situations. Then, we simulate artificial agents that explore these environments by seeking one of six representative intrinsic rewards: novelty, surprise, information gain, empowerment, MOP, and SPIE. Finally, we evaluate the exploration performance of these simulated agents regarding three potential objectives of curiosity: state discovery, model accuracy, and uniform state visitation. Our results show that the comparative performance of each intrinsic reward is highly dependent on the environmental features and the curiosity objective; this indicates that 'optimality' in top-down theories of curiosity needs a precise formulation of assumptions. Nevertheless, we found that agents seeking a combination of novelty and information gain always achieve a close-to-optimal performance. This suggests that novelty and information gain are two principal axes of curiosity-driven behavior.

          "abstract": "Blindfolding—selecting candidates based on objective selection tests while avoiding personal information about their race and gender— is commonly used to mitigate bias in selection. Selection tests, however, often benefit people of a certain race or gender. In such cases, selecting the best candidates requires incorporating, rather than ignoring, the biasing factor. We examined people's preference for avoiding candidates’ race and gender, even when fully aware that these factors bias the selection test. We put forward a novel prediction suggesting that paradoxically, due to their fear of appearing partial, people would choose not to reveal race and gender information, even when doing so means making suboptimal decisions. Across three experiments (N = 3,621), hiring professionals (and laypeople) were tasked with selecting the best candidate for a position when they could reveal the candidate’s race and gender or avoid it. We further measured how fear for their social image corresponds with their decision, as well as how job applicants perceive such actions. The results supported our predictions, showing that more than 50% did not reveal gender and race information, compared to only 30% who did not reveal situational biasing information, such as the time of day in which the interview was held. Those who did not reveal information expressed higher concerns for their social and self-image than those who decided to reveal. We conclude that decision-makers avoid personal biasing information to maintain a positive image, yet by doing so, they compromise fairness and accuracy alike.",

We analyzed data from a convenience sample of 233 persons (76% female) who completed the Specific Phobia of Vomiting Inventory (SPOVI) as well as the Fear of Food Questionnaire (FFQ) and indicated their current height as well as their current and highest past body weight. Scores on the SPOVI and FFQ did neither separately nor interactively relate to current BMI (with or without controlling for highest past BMI or age and sex). Although previous studies reported that persons with emetophobia who seek treatment tend to have a lower BMI than persons with other mental disorders (including other specific phobias), the current study does not indicate that emetophobia symptomatology is related to a lower BMI in general. Future studies are necessary to further examine why and under which circumstances fear of vomiting results in restricted food intake and low body weight.",

There is plentiful research exploring the deleterious impacts of poor motor skill development, however there is a distinct lack of research gathering in-depth insights which explore the impact of DCD across life domains and the life course. Methods: Ten lived experience interviews (parents of a child with a diagnosis of DCD) were undertaken online, lasting 30-45 minutes. Participants were recruited both nationally and internationally to understand cultural differences. Parent interviews focused on experiences in primary care, education, friendships, and wellbeing. Data were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.  Results: Emergent themes highlighted (i) the role DCD plays in the lives of children and their families; (ii) a major lack of awareness surrounding DCD; (iii) difficulty navigating health, education and community systems for support; and (iv) the role of diagnosis. All of this culminated in parents feeling the need to become advocates in the face of a profound sense of relative abandonment. Conclusion: Children with DCD and their families face multiple profound challenges in relation to accessing help and support for their difficulties. More needs to be done to facilitate synergistic support for children with DCD and their families across healthcare, education and the wider community. Effective cross-sector care will however, not be possible without the development of evidence-based training for all, which is underpinned by insider voices.",

          "abstract": "During the first month of life, exchanges between newborns and caregivers focus on helping babies regulate their physiological and behavioural states. Touch and bodily contact play a special role in facilitating arousal regulation and are often used to promote bonding, support at-risk babies, and manage pain. Here, we systematically review the extant evidence on the effects of touch interventions for newborns, specifically focusing on self-regulation and arousal as outcome measures. Seventy-two experimental studies met our inclusion criteria, comparing touch and control groups or within-subject conditions across a variety of physiological and behavioural outcomes. The types of touch interventions employed include skin-to-skin care, Kangaroo Mother Care, massage therapy, Gentle Human Touch, and Yakson. Outcome measures include heart rate and heart rate variability, blood oxygenation and respiration rate, body temperature regulation, cortisol levels, and behavioural states (e.g., sleep and crying patterns). Most studies implemented touch interventions on premature babies and measured outcomes within the first month of life. Only a minority monitored the long-term effects of interventions or explored facilitating factors such as multisensory aspects, caregiver satisfaction, and sensitivity to the baby’s signals. Overall, the findings consistently show the benefits of touch in promoting the immediate self-regulation skills of newborns, particularly supporting the use of tactile interventions for premature babies and neonatal pain management in clinical contexts. Future research should further investigate the long-term, cascading effects of touch interventions on broader dimensions of child development and the child-caregiver dyad’s well-being as a whole.",

          "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (IVR) provides rich visual contexts that can enhance or impede learning, depending on how well environmental details align with instructional content. This experiment systematically examined the effects of environmental detail (between-subject factor: situated 360° scene vs. non-situated image) and content coherence (within-subject factor: text coherent vs. incoherent with visual context) on learning, coherence formation, attention, and motivation. A sample of N = 77 university students explored a virtual replica of the Sistine Chapel in a controlled lab setting. Learning outcomes, spatial presence, enjoyment, and cognitive load were assessed using questionnaires; coherence formation was specifically analysed using eye-tracking data. Contrary to our hypothesis, incoherent content led to better knowledge acquisition than coherent content, regardless of environmental detail. Situated scenes increased enjoyment and drew attention to environmental features but did not improve learning and even impaired it when content was coherent. Eye-tracking revealed that learners’ attention shifted away from the text under these conditions. Notably, we also observed sequencing effects: learning outcomes for the incoherent content were higher when students first engaged with coherent content, suggesting that early exposure to coherent material may help students better process subsequent incoherent information. Our findings challenge the assumption that immersive features inherently support learning and highlight the importance of considering sequencing and coherence in immersive instructional design. Beyond these empirical findings, the study introduces the concept of mental situation models, grounded in established theories of text comprehension and multimedia learning, as a new perspective to understand our findings and the processes of learning and coherence formation in IVR. This perspective offers a promising starting point for advancing theory-building in immersive VR learning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Induction of negative mood increases tobacco choice in dependent smokers; however, less is known about the mechanisms behind this. This study addressed this gap by applying a computational model of value-based decision-making to tobacco and tobacco-unrelated choices following mood manipulation. Method: Using a pre-registered, within-subject design, 49 daily tobacco smokers (›10 daily cigarettes) watched two different videos which primed them to experience negative and positive mood (tobacco valuation and devaluation, respectively). Participants completed self-report measures of mood and craving to smoke before and after priming, followed by a two-alternative forced-choice task with (separate) blocks of tobacco-related and unrelated (animal) images. On each block, participants selected the image that they previously rated higher. A drift-diffusion model was fitted to the reaction time and error data to estimate evidence accumulation (EA) processes and response thresholds during the different blocks. Results: After watching videos intended to induce negative mood, happiness scores were lower (p ‹ .001, d = 1.16), while sadness and craving to smoke scores were higher (both ps ‹ .001, ds › .60), compared to after watching videos intended to induce positive mood. However, contrary to hypotheses, the experimental manipulation did not robustly affect EA rates (F = 1.15, p = .29, ηp2 = .02) or response thresholds (F = .07, p = .79, ηp2 = .00) for either tobacco or tobacco-unrelated decisions. Conclusions: Manipulation of mood in daily smokers did not lead to alterations in the internal processes that precede value-based decisions made about tobacco and tobacco-unrelated cues.",

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday life, it is important to understand how direct interaction with such systems shapes public sentiment toward AI more broadly. Leveraging a unique window in April 2023—when many individuals still had little or no experience with such systems—we combined experimental manipulation (chatbot exposure vs. no exposure) with natural variation in real-world AI usage. In a preregistered proof-of-concept experiment (N = 220), we investigated whether a short conversation with a GPT-3.5-based chatbot influenced participants’ sentiments across multiple dimensions of AI perception. We assessed system-specific fear, user engagement, anthropomorphization, and potential spillover effects to other domains, including AI in medicine, recruitment and governance. Results show that direct interaction reduced fear and increased enjoyment of the chatbot itself, while fostering a more critical, realistic understanding of its abilities. However, spillover effects were limited: exposure led to reduced fear of AI in familiar, concrete domains (e.g., medical applications), but not in more abstract or speculative areas. Hope about AI’s societal potential remained unaffected. Our findings highlight that sentiments toward AI are multidimensional and context dependent. Exposure to AI chatbots can shift immediate attitudes but does not necessarily generalize to broader AI perceptions, underscoring the need for more targeted engagement strategies in shaping public understanding and trust.",

          "abstract": "Humans and other animals continuously make embodied decisions about ongoing or pending courses of action. Examples of embodied decisions include a hunting lioness’s decision of which gazelle to chase and a soccer player’s decision of which teammate to pass the ball to. The study of embodied decisions has recently gained tractions across several fields, including cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and sports science. Here, we summarize key insights from these studies and highlight that they imply a shift of perspective from viewing decision-making as a central cognitive process largely separated from perception and action dynamics to a more integrative perspective that recognizes its embodied and situated nature. We discuss how embodied decisions can be effectively conceptualized in terms of the parallel specification and selection between available (and future) affordances, i.e., as an “affordance competition” process. We discuss studies addressing various aspects of embodied decisions, which include the selection between courses of action, the involvement of motor processes in perceptual and cognitive tasks, motivational factors and the decision of how vigorously and urgently to act. Furthermore, we highlight current controversies in the field and open directions for future work – and their implications for the advancement of our understanding of the mind and the behavior of athletes.",

          "authors": "Alessandro Sparacio; Jonathan Nicholas Davies; Erin Lee; Jeroen Schmitt",
          "abstract": "Background: Fully decentralized self-administered mindfulness (SAM) interventions show promise for stress reduction, but rigorous evaluations of their feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness using both self-report and physiological measures remain limited. In Singapore, where mental health concerns rank as the top healthcare priority (46%), ahead of cancer (38%) and stress-related issues (35%), accessible and scalable interventions are urgently needed to address the significant economic burden of mental health conditions.\nObjective: This pre-registered pilot study (NCT06765889) evaluated a decentralized, three-day self-administered mindfulness intervention versus sham control in Singaporean adults, examining effects on self-reported and physiologically measured stress responses. The inclusion of a sham control condition allows for disentangling mindfulness-specific effects from demand characteristics and expectation effects, addressing a critical methodological gap in digital mindfulness research.\nMethods: Sixty participants were randomized to either a mindfulness intervention or structurally matched sham control. Stress was assessed via self-report (STAI-6) and physiologically through Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The study incorporated three methodological innovations: (1) A structurally equivalent sham control to match expectancy and credibility, (2) remote collection of HRV as an objective physiological biomarker, and (3) full decentralization via smartphone allowing unsupervised multi-platform delivery. Feasibility was evaluated through recruitment/retention rates, cross-platform delivery, protocol adherence, and data quality. Acceptability was assessed through quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback.\nResults: The study demonstrated excellent feasibility with near perfect retention (98.3%) and moderate HRV data quality (69.8% valid signals). Acceptability ratings were strong (M = 4.17/5, SD = 0.53), with highest scores for comfort/engagement (M = 4.27/5, SD = 0.57), exceeding established usability benchmarks for digital health interventions. Qualitative feedback identified technical challenges (HRV instability, device overheating) and scheduling difficulties. While Bayesian analyses revealed no significant group differences in stress reduction (BF₁₀ = 0.03) or HRV improvement (BF₁₀ = 0.2), both groups showed significant stress reductions (BF₁ ₀= 3.01×10⁶), suggesting that observed benefits may stem from non-specific factors common to both interventions.\nConclusions: This study demonstrates (1) the feasibility of conducting fully decentralized mindfulness trials with multimodal assessment, (2) the value of mixed-methods acceptability evaluation, and (3) identifies key technical and control condition refinements necessary for future trials. By addressing methodological limitations in digital mindfulness research through improved control conditions and objective physiological measures, this work provides a foundation for more rigorous investigation of mindfulness-specific versus non-specific effects in remotely delivered stress reduction interventions.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes an Affective Learning Processes (ALPs) model for cultural competence. The model posits that in managing intercultural relations, individuals are driven by the needs for growth and development as well as the needs for security and safety. Whereas the promotion focus needs for growth and development can be met by building intercultural relationships, the prevention focus needs for security and safety can be met by preventing relationship damage. The promotion-prevention motivational systems are associated with unique affective reactions in response to anticipated outcomes. Such affect-driven outcome expectancies shape the learning processes. The ALPs model presents a comprehensive cultural competence framework and identifies specific cultural competence strategies that have been overlooked in the existing literature. Finally, the contributions of the ALPs model to theoretical advancement are evaluated.",

          "authors": "Jin Kim; Shane Schweitzer; Christoph Riedl; David De Cremer",
          "abstract": "We investigate whether and why people might adjust compensation for workers who use AI tools. Across 11 studies (N = 3,846), participants consistently lowered compensation for AI-assisted workers compared to those who were unassisted. This “AI Penalization” effect was robust across (1) different types of work (e.g., specific tasks or general work scenarios) and worker statuses (e.g., full-time, part-time, or freelance), (2) different forms of compensation (e.g., required payments or optional bonuses) and their timing, (3) various methods of eliciting compensation (e.g., slider scale, multiple choice, and numeric entry), and (4) conditions where workers’ output quality was held constant, subject to varying inferences, or statistically controlled. Moreover, the effect emerged not only in hypothetical compensation scenarios (Studies 1–9) but also with real gig workers and real monetary compensation (Studies 10 and 11). People reduced compensation for workers using AI because they believed these workers deserved less credit than those who did not use AI (Studies 7 and 8). This mediated effect attenuated when it was less permissible to reduce worker compensation, such as when employment contracts provide stricter constraints (Study 8). Our findings suggest that adoption of AI tools in the workplace may exacerbate inequality among workers, as those protected by structured contracts are less vulnerable to compensation reductions, while those without such protections are at greater risk of financial penalties for using AI.",

          "abstract": "Adults are adept at metacognitively monitoring their memory accuracy explicitly and implicitly, as well as at using metacognitive control processes to maintain high memory accuracy, but the development of monitoring and control is less understood. We administered an episodic cued recall task with children aged five to 11 years (N = 106). Participants watched two video clips of everyday episodic events before answering cued recall memory questions. For each memory question, participants provided a confidence rating (explicit monitoring), sorted their answer into show/hide boxes (control), and chose to volunteer/withhold their response (control). Multiple behavioural gestures of cognitive effort (implicit monitoring; e.g., long pauses, looking to carer, non-word fillers) were recorded and later coded by blind raters. Children were less accurate and less able to assign confidence to reflect their memory accuracy when they were forced to generate a response after previously saying “I don’t know”. But on volunteered trials, explicit, implicit monitoring and control measures predicted memory accuracy. There were age-related improvements in explicit monitoring for predicting memory accuracy, but there were no age differences in implicit monitoring or control processes. Uncertainty gestures partially mediated the confidence-accuracy relationship, suggesting that gestures are possibly one of many cues which can help children to explicitly monitor their memory accuracy, in accordance with cue-utilisation theory. Our findings suggest that explicit and implicit monitoring have different developmental trajectories in cued recall and that children can be adaptive to control their memory accuracy to a similar extent from early- to mid-childhood.",

We use these embeddings, along with participants' quiz responses, to track how the learners' knowledge changed after watching each video.

Here, we model parental \"take over\" decisions as a Bayesian solution to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and qualitatively compare model predictions with behavioral data from parent-child interactions. We find that two core beliefs guide intervention: the child’s probability of success and the utility of the task. Parents are more likely to take over when they believe their child is less skilled and the task is harder, and more likely to step back when they expect the rewards of independent effort to outweigh the costs. The model captures how these beliefs interact to shape decision-making and, together with the empirical data, reveals the cognitive computations that underlie parental intervention.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

It emerges from the intersection of threat-sensitive conservative neuropsychology and a media environment optimized for destabilization. This model offers a unifying explanation for MAGA's resilience, radicalization dynamics, and resistance to factual persuasion, reframing political behavior through the lens of affective neuroscience and cognitive coherence.",

          "abstract": "AI-augmented decision-making (AIADM) aims to leverage the computational power of machine learning (ML) models to assist humans in their decision-making processes. In many such systems, especially for complex tasks like medical image classification, ML models are often trained on large datasets annotated by humans. Neglecting to account for human decision-making biases when constructing these labeled datasets can lead to biased datasets, and subsequently models trained on such datasets can inherit the biases. We propose a novel approach to developing AIADM systems that aims to overcome these challenges by harnessing human uncertainty. Our approach has three elements: we collect subjective judgments from human annotators, we calibrate those subjective judgments, and we use the recalibrated subjective judgments to create probabilistic (i.e., soft) labels, which the AI decision aid is then trained on. We evaluate our methods through two studies using data from DiagnosUs, a crowdsourcing platform for medical image annotation. Across multiple training datasets, we assess how our proposed methods impact three key properties of AI decision aids: accuracy, calibration, and alignment with human uncertainty. We refer to these properties as the AIADM tri-criteria. Our results show that ML models trained on recalibrated soft labels are more accurate and better aligned with expert judgments. We also observe a tradeoff between ML calibration and alignment with human uncertainty. These findings highlight the value of capturing and correcting human uncertainty in ML training data and the need to consider the tri-criteria when developing AI systems.",

Negative affectivity and self-critical cognitions are linked to NSSI but have rarely been considered jointly alongside indicators of NSSI severity. To address this gap, we examined depressive symptoms and self-criticism as concurrent and prospective predictors of NSSI urges among depressed young adults over six weeks. Baseline NSSI severity was positively related to baseline depressive symptoms, which predicted follow-up NSSI urges; however, baseline depressive symptoms did not predict later NSSI urges when controlling for baseline NSSI severity. In contrast, self-criticism was not associated with baseline NSSI severity but predicted follow-up NSSI urges, even when controlling for prior NSSI severity. Using within-person longitudinal path models, depressive symptoms were positively associated with NSSI urges at the same assessment but did not prospectively predict later NSSI urges; however, self-criticism did predict later NSSI urges but not concurrent NSSI urges. Thus, depressive symptoms may indicate overall NSSI risk but may be less informative than self-criticism in predicting within-person changes in NSSI urges over time. These findings inform NSSI theories and highlight potential NSSI prevention and intervention targets.",

Here, we ask if effortful leisure is a powerful source of meaning and purpose which could supplement the reduction in labor time. In five studies (N = 2,563), we investigated the relationship between effort and meaning in leisure activities. In Study 1, we found that participants rated effortful activities as more meaningful, although less enjoyable, suggesting a trade-off between eudaimonic and hedonic wellbeing. Studies 2a, 2b, and 3 provided causal evidence by comparing effortful (Sudoku puzzling) and non-effortful leisure (watching videos in Studies 2a and 2b; Click-to-Reveal game in Study 3). Effortful activities consistently felt more meaningful, though the effects plateaued at higher levels of effort. Finally, Study 4 used experience sampling to assess activities as they occurred in real life. Effortful leisure uniquely fosters meaning while maintaining enjoyment, whereas other activities tend to feel less enjoyable with increased effort. Across all studies, we found that effort promotes daily meaningful experiences, particularly in leisure contexts, where effort does not diminish enjoyment. Effortful leisure may offer a powerful opportunity to supplement or replace the once plentiful purpose we derived from our now diminishing time at work.",

          "abstract": "People derive much purpose from their work, yet time spent on work is decreasing. Here, we ask if effortful leisure is a powerful source of meaning and purpose which could supplement the reduction in labor time. In four studies (N = 2,169), we investigated the relationship between effort and meaning in leisure activities. In Study 1, we found that participants rated effortful activities as more meaningful, although less enjoyable, suggesting a trade-off between eudaimonic and hedonic wellbeing. Studies 2a and 2b provided causal evidence by comparing effortful (Sudoku puzzling) and non-effortful leisure (watching videos). Effortful activities consistently felt more meaningful, though the effects plateaued at higher levels of effort. Finally, Study 3 used experience sampling to assess activities as they occurred in real life. Effortful leisure uniquely fosters meaning while maintaining enjoyment, whereas other activities tend to feel less enjoyable with increased effort. Across all studies, we found that effort promotes daily meaningful experiences, particularly in leisure contexts, where effort does not diminish enjoyment. Effortful leisure may offer a powerful opportunity to supplement or replace the once plentiful purpose we derived from our now diminishing time at work.",

          "abstract": "The N2pc is widely employed as an electrophysiological marker of an attention allocation. This interpretation was largely driven by the observation of an N2pc elicited by an isolated relevant target object, which was reported as Experiment 2 in Eimer (1996). All subsequent refined interpretations of the N2pc had to take this crucial finding into account. Despite its central role for neurocognitive attention research, there have been no direct replications and only few conceptual replications of this seminal work. Within the context of #EEGManyLabs, an international community-driven effort to replicate the most influential EEG studies ever published, the present study was selected due to its strong impact on the study of selective attention. We revisit the idea of the N2pc being an indicator of attentional selectivity by delivering  a high powered direct replication of Eimer's work through analysis of 779 datasets acquired from 22 labs across 14 countries. Our results robustly replicate the N2pc to form stimuli, but a direct replication of the N2pc to color stimuli technically failed. We believe that this pattern not only sheds further light on the functional significance of the N2pc as an electrophysiological marker of attentional selectivity, but also highlights a methodological problem with selecting analysis windows a priori. By contrast, the consistency of observed ERP patterns across labs and analysis pipelines is stunning, and this consistency is preserved even in datasets that were rejected for (ocular) artifacts, attesting to the robustness of the ERP technique and the feasibility of large-scale EEG replication studies.",

          "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) is increasingly used in history education to enable immersive engagement with the past. While such applications may stimulate interest and emotional involvement, concerns have been raised about their potential to hinder critical reflection and foster uncritical acceptance of story-consistent beliefs. Drawing on the Transportation-Imagery-Model, the present experimental study (N = 160) investigates how narrative immersion (transportation) in the historical VR application Anne Frank House VR influences users’ emotional responses, knowledge transfer, and the endorsement of story-related political beliefs. Special attention is given to the impact of users’ political orientation. Findings show that emotional engagement and transportation significantly promote political beliefs consistent with the VR narrative (e.g., support for refugees), but are not associated with increases in factual or perceived knowledge. These results highlight both the persuasive\npotential and the educational limitations of VR in history education. While VR may not enhance knowledge transfer per se, it may effectively foster engagement on socially and politically relevant topics.",

          "abstract": "Characterising the mechanisms underlying naturalistic defensive behavior remains a significant challenge. While substantial progress has been made in unravelling the neural basis of tightly constrained behaviors, a critical gap persists in our comprehension of the circuits that implement algorithms capable of generating the diverse defensive responses observed outside experimental restrictions. Recent advancements in neuroscience technology now allow for an unprecedented examination of naturalistic behaviour. To help provide a theoretical grounding for this nascent experimental programme, we summarise the main computational and statistical challenges of defensive decision making, encapsulated in the concept of critical intelligence. Next, drawing from an extensive literature in biology, machine learning, and decision theory, we explore a range of candidate solutions to these challenges. While the proposed solutions offer insights into potential adaptive strategies, they also present inherent trade-offs and limitations in their applicability across different biological contexts. Ultimately, we propose series of experiments designed to differentiate between these candidate solutions, providing a roadmap for future investigations into the fundamental defensive algorithms utilized by biological agents and their neural implementation. Thus, our work aims to provide a roadmap towards broader understanding of how complex defensive behaviors are orchestrated in the brain, with implications for both neuroscience research and the development of more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems.",

          "abstract": "Background. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent childhood-onset disorder, with increased risk for negative long-term outcomes in adulthood. These outcomes may differ between men/boys and women/girls. Although these differences may stem from biological sex-related and sociocultural gender-related factors, most studies do not distinguish between them. The current study investigated influences of sex-assignment and gender-expression of childhood ADHD on outcomes. Methods. This study includes an 18-year follow-up of 283 children with and without ADHD. To asses if sex and gender-expression expression (sum score of the Traditional Masculinity-Femineity scale) moderated a variety of long-term outcomes in those with and without ADHD, women (n=50, Mage=27.36) and men with ADHD (n=104, Mage=29.40), and women (n=77, Mage=28.32) and men without ADHD (n=55, Mage=27.94) were analyzed, and the unique role of gender-expression was explored in a final model including both sex and gender-expression. Results. Sex and gender-expression were highly similar (r=.94). Both sex and gender-expression interacted with group for social functioning, but not on the other domains. Men with ADHD, as well as those with higher levels of masculinity, were more likely to show lower social functioning compared to women with ADHD and controls. There were no unique moderating effects. Conclusions. On most long-term outcomes of childhood ADHD, sex or gender did not play an important role. Gender-expression did not pose unique risks in our predominantly cis-gendered sample, suggesting other aspects of gender may be more relevant in such a sample.",

          "abstract": "Decision-making and movement are often tightly intertwined, a phenomenon that has been primarily studied in the case of low-level perceptual decision-making. How higher-level decision processes interface with the motor system during action selection is less clear. Here, we used psychophysics and computational modeling to examine information flow between deciding and acting when actions had to be retrieved from a newly learned visuomotor mapping. Human subjects (N = 182) learned de novo visuomotor mappings with (or without) an imposed latent structure that linked visual stimulus features (e.g., color, shape) to intuitive motor distinctions, like hands and pairs of adjacent fingers. In subjects who learned structured visuomotor mappings, transitional response times between trials indicated that retrieving the correct action from memory invoked “traversal” of a tree-like mental graph of the learned mapping. Control experiments and analyses helped rule out alternative explanations related to intrinsic switch costs between finger responses and perceptual properties of the stimuli. We then used a forced response time paradigm to show that when people traverse these learned visuomotor mappings during action selection, they sequentially potentiate multiple actions along the way in accordance with the structure of the mapping. Our results point to a direct coupling between complex internal memory and decision-making processes and the systematic preparation of actions.",

We conducted three experiments (N = 4,139) to explore\nhow interactive narratives can effectively enhance empathy. We used narratives which focused\non accessibility in public bathrooms through the lens of physically disabled people and\ntransgender people. In Study 1, we found that interactive narratives could promote agency and\nimmersion, two factors that theory suggests may contribute to prosocial outcomes. Further, we\nfound that immersion (and in turn, empathy) was more difficult to induce for participants who\nhold high levels of prejudice against the target group—especially for the transgender protagonist\ncondition. In Study 2, we attempted to encourage participants to individuate the protagonist by\nmanipulating the time point at which we told participants that protagonist was transgender. Our\nfindings ran counter to hypotheses—withholding the protagonist’s trans identity until the end of\nthe story decreased immersion and led to less empathetic outcomes in highly prejudiced\nindividuals. In Study 3, we manipulated the participant’s similarity to the protagonist (vis-à-vis\npolitical ideology) to try to increase empathy toward the protagonist. Although we replicated\nfindings from Studies 1 and 2, highly prejudiced participants still did not report greater\nimmersion even when the protagonist was purportedly ideologically similar to them. We find\nthat certain factors such as immersion appear useful for promoting empathy.

          "abstract": "Creativity is a fundamental ability of humans, vital to most domains of work and art. With the rising popularity of generative AI, research is needed to determine its costs and benefits for human creativity. We conducted a naturalistic study with university students (N = 263) who wrote short-stories with and without the help of ChatGPT. Stories written with AI assistance were significantly more original, but also more semantically similar to each other (i.e., less diverse). Critically, using a novel analysis of participant-AI interactions, we found that benefits in story originality were specifically predicted by engagement in idea generation with ChatGPT (prompting the AI to provide new story concepts, plot elements, or character ideas), but not idea elaboration (asking the AI to refine, reframe, or evaluate previously generated ideas). Additionally, we found that incorporating AI-generated content into the stories directly correlated with increased originality. Our findings suggest that AI-driven benefits depend on active engagement specifically focused on idea generation, although AI collaboration can limit idea diversity.",

Several (nonhuman) great ape vocalizations share acoustic and perceptual similarities with human speech sounds. However, their vocal tract morphology—featuring a species-typical tongue and lack of an expanded pharynx—precludes identical articulation. The present paper combines two studies. In the first, [u]-like vocalizations by all great ape genera were sampled and compared against acoustic properties for close back rounded vowel [u]. In the second, using vocal tract models based on MRI data and behavior, we conducted computer simulations to predict formant values for [u]-like sounds in adult chimpanzees. Results indicate that [u]-like sounds in chimpanzees are consistent with tongue retraction and lip protrusion, suggesting shared articulatory strategies with human speech but, nevertheless, execution subject to species-unique constraints on production. We highlight the complexity of articulation and challenge claims that evolution of primate vocal tract physiology was superfluous to the evolution of speech. As a framing device, the equifinality problem states that identifying overlapping acoustic or spectral properties alone is insufficient to demonstrate a phylogenetically  meaningful relationship between primate calls and human speech data.",

This study explored the mechanisms behind this relationship, focusing on loneliness, in-person social contact, and physical exercise as mediators, and different types of phone use —active virtual social contact and passive scrolling—as moderators. Using a cross-sectional online survey conducted in Austria, we assessed smartphone use and time spent on virtual social contact, passive scrolling, in-person social contact, and exercise, alongside various mental health outcomes. We found an overall association between phone use and depressive symptoms, anxiety, and wellbeing, which was mediated by loneliness. Virtual social contact moderated the association: individuals with lower engagement in virtual social contact experienced higher depression and anxiety with increased phone use, while those with higher engagement showed the reverse pattern. Passive scrolling did not moderate the relationship between phone use and mental health but was directly associated with poorer sleep and well-being. These findings suggest that loneliness plays a central role in the adverse effects of excessive smartphone use on mental health. Moreover, the impact of smartphone use is nuanced and depends on whether it fosters or inhibits meaningful social connections.",

          "abstract": "Although synaesthesia has been linked to increased creativity and engagement with the arts, most of the evidence has come from visual arts rather than music.  Here we show for the first time that synaesthesia is far more prevalent in musicians than non-musicians (an odds ratio of about 4). We show that this result holds true for all three different kinds of synaesthesia that we considered  including for types of synaesthesia unrelated to music (grapheme-color, sequence-space, sound-color).  That is, synaesthesia in general disposes people to engage with and excel at music. It is not simply the case that the ability to ‘see’ music drives the higher prevalence, although this may have a role.  We provide an estimate of the prevalence of sound-color synaesthesia in non-musicians of between 0.3% and 1.3%, depending on the threshold applied.",

          "abstract": "Educational large-scale assessments (LSAs) are indispensable for empirical research on educational systems and academic achievement. The German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) stands out among LSAs due to its unique longitudinal, multi-cohort design embedded within a multilevel assessment context. By following six distinct cohorts from early childhood through adulthood, the NEPS enables analyses of educational processes and competence development across the entire life course. Despite its extensive use over the past decade, little is known about the scope and scholarly impact of studies analyzing NEPS data. This systematic review of 625 peer-reviewed journal articles assessed the academic use, thematic focus, and contribution to international educational research of studies based on NEPS data. The findings revealed a NEPS-related research output that is comparable to major international LSAs or even surpasses it. Studies with NEPS data contributed high-impact articles across psychology, education, and sociology, addressing topics such as early cognitive development, educational inequalities, personality and motivation, and school-to-work transitions. Additionally, the dataset has informed research on higher education, adult learning, and career development. Still, the review identified several underexplored areas that underscore the continued potential of the NEPS as a popular data source for longitudinal and contextualized educational research.",

          "abstract": "Network models in time-series and panel data have been powerful tools to investigate the dynamical relations among variables. A common goal of empirical research is to compare the networks of different groups, such as treatment and control, to understand how the dynamical relations are shaped by grouping variables. However, existing methods for comparing n = 1 idiographic networks are restricted to global tests, which lack the capacity to identify the precise location of edge heterogeneity. Furthermore, there is a lack of easily applicable methods to compare networks from panel data where just a few time-points are available per person. We therefore present the invariance partial pruning (IVPP) approach, which first evaluates heterogeneity globally with the network invariance test, and then determine the exact locus of heterogeneity at the edge level with partial pruning. Through simulation studies, we discovered that network invariance test based on Akaike Information Criterion performed well. Bayesian Information Criterion performed similarly well but also showed insufficient power to detect smaller true differences at small sample sizes, and the Likelihood Ratio Test was prone to false discovery. Comparison with the fully constrained model revealed superior performance than comparison with the fully unconstrained model. Partial pruning successfully uncovered specific edge difference with high sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that IVPP is an essential supplement to the existing network methodology by allowing the comparison of networks from both time-series and panel data, and also allowing the test of specific edge difference. We implement the algorithm in the R-package IVPP.",

Across five studies (N = 1234), we investigated trust inferences in the context of iterative moral dilemmas, which allow individuals to not only make deontological or utilitarian decisions, but also harm-balancing decisions. Our findings challenge the prevailing perspective: While we did observe effects of the type of moral decision that people make, the direction of these effects was inconsistent across studies. In contrast, moral similarity (i.e., whether a decision aligns with one’s own perspective) consistently predicted increased trust. Our findings suggest that trust is not just about adhering to specific moral frameworks but also about shared moral perspectives.",

          "abstract": "People across cultures engage in various practices that alter their appearance (e.g., makeup, tanning, facial aesthetic treatment). Theories in social and evolutionary psychology propose that the primary function of these practices is to create an appearance perceived more positively by others, ultimately resulting in more favorable outcomes in social, romantic, or professional relations. In two preregistered studies that improved upon and extended prior work, we tested the effect of popular types of minimally invasive facial aesthetic treatment on how people are perceived by others. Study 1 (2,720 raters, 114 targets) showed that treatment significantly increased perceived attractiveness (a 0.09-point change on a 7-point scale), but not perceived approachability (e.g., trustworthiness) or capability (e.g., competence). Study 2 (481 raters, 81 targets) showed that treatment significantly increased their desirability as a short-term romantic partner (a 0.10-point change on a 7-point scale) and platonic friend (a 0.08-point change on a 7-point scale), but not their desirability as a long-term romantic partner. Thus, our results suggest that a single session of minimally invasive facial aesthetic treatment leads to more positive perceptions on dimensions related to attractiveness, but these effects are relatively small.",

Adult outcomes of childhood ADHD should be identified with long-term prospective follow-up studies investigating a broad range of outcomes. \nMethod. Differences in outcomes (i.e., measures of psychiatric status, behavioral and emotional problems, academic and professional functioning, adaptive functioning, neurocognition, physical health, healthcare service use) were investigated in an 18-year follow-up study of adults with childhood ADHD (n=154, Mage=27.38, SDage=3.70, 68% males), their siblings without childhood ADHD (n=138, Mage=29.59, SDage=4.43, 35% males), and controls (n=129, Mage=28.17, SDage=3.53, 40% males). Post-hoc tests investigated whether observed differences between the ADHD group and controls may be driven by a current ADHD diagnosis, by comparing persistent ADHD, remitted ADHD, and control groups. \nResults. Childhood ADHD was related to worse functioning in adulthood on more than 60% of outcomes across all domains with these differences translating into small to large-sized effects (e.g., moderate/large differences in increased rates of ADHD and depression, externalizing problems, autistic traits, and worse neurocognitive outcomes). The siblings showed comparable functioning to controls. Persistent ADHD showed worse functioning on specific outcomes in the psychiatric, behavioral/emotional, adaptive, and physical health domains, as compared to remitted ADHD. Both ADHD groups had worse functioning compared to controls. \nConclusions. Childhood ADHD increased the risk for worse functioning in adulthood, which was not driven by current ADHD status. No specific risks were identified for siblings of the childhood ADHD group in outcomes. The current study stresses childhood ADHD as a risk condition for long-term worse functioning.",

          "abstract": "This study tests young learners’ ability to segment foreign-language words before they receive classroom instruction in English as a foreign language (EFL). We focus on word segmentation, one of the earliest hurdles in second-language (L2) acquisition, but essential to building a vocabulary in a new language. Specifically, we examine whether segmentation is influenced by individual differences in phonological awareness, the presence of first-language (L1) phonotactic cues to word boundaries, and L1 skills. Primary-school students in Germany (6-9-years old), either monolingual with German only or bilingual with German and another language, were tested on their ability to recognize pseudowords in English speech that were presented in contexts that cued word boundaries either consistent or inconsistent with German phonotactics. Results show that participants recognized pseudowords and that this improves with increasing phonological awareness skill. Nonetheless, L1 phonotactic boundary cues neither influenced performance at the group level nor when individual L1 skills were considered. An exploratory analysis of English receptive vocabulary, however, revealed that pre-EFL learners may initially use L1 phonotactic cues to detect word boundaries but rely less on them once their receptive English vocabulary grows. Similar to adults, pre-EFL learners are able to segment and recognize words in English prior to systematic exposure and classroom instruction, which may be supported by developing phonological awareness skills. However, this does not seem to be underpinned by the transfer of phonotactic cues from the L1, suggesting a lack of continuity in the influence of the L1 on the L2 in foreign language learning across development.",

This longitudinal, comparative, lab-in-the-field study tested the impact of a socio-emotional learning intervention based on Humanitarian Principles (Humanity, Neutrality, Impartiality, Independence) and Values on social emotions (compassion, empathic distress, malicious joy) and on the willingness to help an in- or an out-group member (immigrant or local minority). 96 teenagers and young adults (mean [SD] age: 17.06 [3.56] years; female: 66) in Armenia, Belarus, The Gambia, and Russia were assigned to a three- or five-day intervention in Humanitarian Principles and Values or to a control group. Although there was no overall effect of the intervention on social emotions nor on the willingness to help an in- or an out-group member, an intervention-related increase in compassion and empathic distress predicted an intervention-related increase in the willingness to help an out-group member. We also observe differences between countries. This study highlights the importance of socio-emotional learning interventions in promoting prosocial behaviour in teenagers and young adults from different countries. In addition, this research contributes to the growing body of empirical and policy-oriented work on the implementation of socio-emotional learning and thus contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals 4 (Education) and 16 (Peace).",

With this paper, we introduce a large-scale and high-quality dataset of news and political manifestos in multiple languages, that was annotated and curated by values scholars according to the Schwartz (1992), Schwartz et al. (2012) theory of human values. Moreover, each expression of values annotated in the texts included a second layer of identification expressing the degree of fulfilment of the value in the text, specifically whether the value was (partially) attained or (partially) constrained. The final dataset comprises 2,648 annotated texts in nine languages, totalling 74,231 sentences. The dataset can be used to investigate the expression of values in the news articles and political manifestos that were annotated and as training materials for the development of automated values detection methods, using natural language processing algorithms.",

This knowledge is important for fostering collaboration to optimally support autistic students. Participants included 133 Australians parents/caregivers (n = 64), educators (n = 37), and allied health professionals (n = 32) who completed an open-ended online survey listing their top three educational strengths, educational needs, barriers, and enablers for autistic students. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis for each of the four areas (strengths, needs, enablers, and barriers). Analysis identified that strengths included thinking and reasoning, personality, skills and talents, academic, and social. Needs included classroom accommodations, social-emotional, academic, adaptive behaviour, and mental health supports. Enablers and barriers commonly reflected the presence or absence of supports, including support networks, environmental supports, autism knowledge, and supportive attitudes. While commonalities were observed across stakeholder perspectives, significant variation both within and across stakeholder groups was observed for perceived strengths and challenges including around the importance of environmental factors, foci of social support, and academic needs. Understanding stakeholder perspectives is essential for providing multidimensional support to autistic students. Understanding can inform professional learning and support collaborative multidisciplinary teams who work with, and care for, the same individual across contexts including school, home, and therapy services.",

          "abstract": "Effective behavior relies on inhibition and updating, two core executive functions essential for goal-directed actions. While emerging evidence suggests that inhibition serves as the fundamental mechanism underlying flexible behavior, its role in updating progresses remains unclear. This study proposes a dual-mechanism model for the relationship between inhibition and updating: The shared components (i.e., inhibition) operate through bottom-up reactive control, supporting the flexible aspects of updating. In contrast, the distinct components (i.e., updating-specific processes) are governed by top-down proactive control, enabling the stable maintenance of information in working memory. To test this framework, we developed an innovative “Reference-back Inhibition Joint” paradigm, combined with a hierarchical drift diffusion model, and conducted two experiments. Experiment 1 examined the shared and distinct cognitive processes of inhibition and updating from the perspective of working memory gating. Experiment 2 further explored the underlying mechanisms by manipulating interstimulus interval (ISI) time bins. The results confirmed our proposal: shared processes (gate opening, substitution) were governed by bottom-up reactive control, while distinct processes (gate closing, updating mode) relied on top-down proactive control. These findings support our proposed of dual cognitive mechanism framework, refine the bifactorial model of executive function, and provide profound insights into the nature of executive functions.",

Results of hierarchical regression analyses found that the CCRPM explained 32.85% of climate change risk perception. Confirmatory factor analysis outcomes empirically support a two-factor structure of risk perception, personal, and societal/generalized in the Indian context. Moreover, the CCRPM explains limited (19.5%) variance in perceptions of health risks associated with climate change. Experiential factors (such as affect, and personal experience) and prescriptive norms were strongly associated with climate change and health risk perception in India. Highlighting the vulnerabilities associated with health and climate change may prove essential to communicating climate change risks in India.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

Embedded within a novel parenting app (Daily Growth) this resource aimed to represent diverse ways of supporting parents and carers of children aged 2-5 years respond to common parenting challenges.\n\nMethods: Following Indigenous research methodologies, the co-design process engaged Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers and content designers, Wayapa practitioners, and community members. Yarning, deep listening (Dadirri), and relational accountability were implemented to ensure cultural appropriateness. The co-design team tailored Wayapa’s knowledge to 30 common parenting scenarios, embedding Earth-centred wisdom into brief video-based micro-interventions which were integrated into Daily Growth.\n\nResults: Co-designed Wayapa parenting resources provide culturally relevant, Earth-centred parenting strategies that support parents and caregivers to build their children’s emotional regulation skills. The inclusion of Wayapa iconography, compassionate language, and Indigenous storytelling enrich the accessibility and relevance of the program.\n\nConclusion: By integrating Wayapa Wuurrk within the Daily Growth app, the project promotes Indigenous knowledges and addresses a current gap in culturally led and co-designed universal parenting support for Indigenous families. Future research will evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the program on parent/child wellbeing.",

          "abstract": "When we meet someone, we make all sorts of judgments based on their age. But how is a person’s age represented in the mind at all: do we remember someone as younger, or older, than they actually were? In a matching-from-memory task, observers briefly saw a target face which was either Young (30 years old) or Old (60 years old). Afterward, they saw two new decoy faces — 10 years younger, and 10 years older than the target. Observers were strongly biased to match Young targets to younger decoys, and Old targets to older decoys. These biases held across artificially aged and real faces, regardless of observers’ own age, and even when the decoys’ races and genders differed from that of the target — suggesting that a common mechanism underlies memory for facial age across races and genders. Additional experiments indicated that these memory biases reflect assimilation toward visual category centers, rather than toward extremes. Thus, social categories of ‘young’ and ‘old’ shape and distort our memories of faces.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

Simultaneously tackling three lacunas in literature, we (1) analyzed a large dataset of adolescent Muslim minority pupils (N = 1,750, mean age = 14.84), (2) examined processes underlying primary and secondary transfer, and (3) investigated how one of Allport’s (1954) “optimal contact conditions”, i.e., authority (teacher) support, affects STEs. Overall, the results revealed little evidence for STEs, but there were two noteworthy exceptions. First, contrary to our hypotheses, a significant negative direct relationship was found between minority-majority friendships and attitudes towards two outgroups (Africans and refugees). Second, our results also revealed a significant positive indirect STE between minority-majority friendships and attitudes towards refugees, via attitudes towards the primary outgroup (Belgian majority group members). No cross-level interactions were found between cross-group friendships and school-level authority support, indicating that this “optimal condition” does not seem to facilitate STEs. Taken together, our results cast reasonable doubt on the potential of STEs to ameliorate minority-minority relations.",

There is growing evidence that such efforts may also cause unnecessary self-diagnosis and worsening symptoms for some disorders; however, there are no validated approaches to avoid these potential harms without reducing the awareness efforts themselves. We developed a novel intervention, nocebo education, based on principles of the nocebo effect where negative expectations cause symptom misattribution and worsening. We tested whether teaching about the nocebo effect could mitigate false self-diagnosis and symptom worsening from ADHD awareness. In a double-blind randomised controlled trial with a week-long follow-up (NCT06638411), 215 healthy young adults (77% women) were randomised to participate in a workshop on either ADHD awareness, ADHD combined with nocebo education, or control (sleep). We measured changes in self-diagnosis and ADHD symptoms immediately after the workshop (self-diagnosis), and one-week later (self-diagnosis and symptoms). \nADHD group reported substantially higher self-diagnosis scores immediately (𝛽_standardised= 0.80) and one week after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.50) compared to controls. These effects persisted despite no changes in reported symptoms. Nocebo education halved the false self-diagnosis scores immediately after the workshop (𝛽 = 0.45) and eliminated it at follow-up. We show that a brief nocebo education intervention is efficacious in substantially reducing and eliminating the unintended false self-diagnosis among healthy young adults participating in an ADHD awareness workshop. Nocebo education is a promising adjunct for balanced awareness efforts that could be applied in various contexts.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the development of J. Kelly’s ideas on rethinking existing approaches to understanding the sources and main characteristics of human activity. It demonstrates that by employing a complex, multidimensional image of a “constructive human being”, which integrates numerous partial images, it is possible to fundamentally reject the concept of “motivation”. This seemingly paradoxical step has non–trivial methodological, theoretical, and practical consequences. For instance, it helps us overcome unconscious assumptions from classical mechanics. These assumptions suggest that a human remains at rest until external forces act upon them, providing “psychic energy” and compelling them to act according to the resultant forces. Motivation is “re–described” through the broad process of construction – constructing oneself, one’s behavior, and, through it, the surrounding world. In this context, self–determination, freedom, and autonomy emerge as essential characteristics of a human being as a living organism. Any motivating impact is viewed as facilitation, the creation of conditions for potential change, or the support of the ongoing direction of human activity construction. Therefore, practices of such facilitation should not be motivation–centered but truly human–centered, based on the image of a free, autonomous, dignified, and capable of the act human being.",

This study employs the classical twin design, utilizing data from 6492 individuals from the Netherlands Twin Register, including 3369 MZ twins (893 complete twin pairs, 1583 incomplete twin pairs) and 3123 DZ twins (445 complete, 2233 incomplete) to provide insights into the sources of overlap between WB/ADS and SMU. Both hedonic and eudaimonic WB scales were used. SMU was measured by (1) the time spent on different social media platforms (SMUt), (2) the frequency of posting on social media (SMUf), and (3) the number of social media accounts individuals have (SMUn). Our results confirmed the low phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and SMU (absolute correlations, between r = 0.03-0.10). For SMU, heritability estimates between 32 and 72% were obtained. The small but significant phenotypic correlations between WB/ADS and the SMU phenotypes were mainly determined by genetic factors (in the range of 80-90%). For WB and SMU, genetic correlations were between -0.10 and -0.0, and for ADS and SMU genetic correlations were between 0.10 and 0.23. Genetic correlations implied limited but statistically significant sets of genes that affect WB/ADS and SMU levels. Overall, the results indicate that there is evidence that the small associations between WB/ADS and SMU are partly driven by overlapping genetic influences. We encourage researchers and experts to consider more personalised approaches when considering the association between WB and SMU, as well as understanding the reasons for individuals’ observed SMU levels.",

In an online listening experiment (N = 131), participants rated their experienced urge to move, pleasure, energetic arousal, time-related interest, and inner representation of temporal regularity in response to these stimuli. We found that the genre-typical timbres had only tiny effects on the experienced urge to move, which moreover varied by pattern. In contrast, acoustical measurements of two aspects of timbre, brightness and fullness, proved to be better predictors for the urge to move (R2m = 0.132). An analysis with the psychological model of groove revealed that aspects of timbre influences the urge to move directly, and via energetic arousal and time-related interest but not via pleasure.",

          "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, ChatGPT has been widely developed for various purposes, among which AI chatting has become a new channel for users to seek emotional counseling and stress relief. However, in practical use, the phenomenon of \"fire-fanning\" has emerged - giving suggestions that intensify conflicts when users pour out their troubles, or outputting views that exacerbate opposition in discussions on controversial topics, which instead (increases) users' psychological burdens. Through analyzing a large number of real interaction cases, this study elaborates on the specific manifestations of the \"fire-fanning\" phenomenon in scenarios such as daily conversations and hot topic discussions, and deeply explores its causes, including the one-sidedness of training data and the difficulty of algorithms in accurately understanding complex emotions. The study also points out that this phenomenon not only affects users' mental health and interferes with the effectiveness of emotional counseling but also has a negative impact on the application prospects of artificial intelligence in the field of stress relief. Aiming at these problems, the paper proposes a series of practical improvement strategies from the perspectives of optimizing data screening criteria, improving emotional recognition mechanisms, and adding manual review links, striving to make artificial intelligence better play the role of stress relief and truly become a reliable psychological support partner for users.",

          "abstract": "We are witnessing democracy fail in real time—not through military coups or constitutional crises, but through the systematic collapse of our collective ability to think together. The limbic-cognitive dependencies that override democratic deliberation—recursive feedback loops, threshold collapse, and epistemic automation—reveal the architecture of breakdown and the mathematical pathways to resilience, challenging us to inscribe into democracy the א (one) thing that can return it from מת (death) to אמת (truth): Empathy.\n\nThe problem is not that people have become irrational, but that normal human cognitive architecture becomes systematically exploitable under modern information conditions. When cognitive resources are depleted, even rational agents predictably shift from evidence-based reasoning to emotion-driven inference through measurable threshold processes. These individual transitions aggregate into group-level epistemic collapse through recursive feedback loops that transform ordinary disagreement into existential threat perception.\n\nThis paper, Anti-Golem Dependency, is the first of a series of papers to explore a broader model called the Anti-Golem Model. This paper presents a theoretical framework that transforms democratic breakdown from a political problem into an engineering problem. The framework provides mathematical tools for understanding when cognitive systems fail, computational methods for predicting breakdown before it occurs, and systematic approaches for designing interventions that restore epistemic health while preserving democratic pluralism. By making these processes mathematically tractable through recursive hierarchical BART modeling and directed cyclic graph integration, the framework opens the possibility of precision intervention before collapse becomes irreversible\n\nThe mathematical methods, framework, and implementation listed here are Patent Pending.

Building on Funder’s Situational Construal Model, the BSCM incorporates principles from Bayesian brain theory and the Free Energy Principle (FEP) to formalise how personality traits (priors) and situational cues (likelihoods) interact to generate subjective construals (posterior beliefs), which in turn guide behaviour. This recursive cycle of interpretation and updating allows individuals to navigate uncertainty and maintain psychological coherence. Originally developed to explain healthcare non-attendance, the BSCM generalises to a wide range of behavioural domains. The model functions as a cognitive operating system, offering a theoretically integrative, neurocognitively grounded, and computationally tractable scaffold for understanding context-sensitive human action.",

          "abstract": "Older adults often exhibit a higher susceptibility to false memories compared to younger adults, partly due to age-related declines in executive functions. Mullet and Marsh (2016) demonstrated that false memory errors in younger adults, elicited through sentences with pragmatic implications, can be corrected when errors are noticed and replaced after corrective feedback. However, the effect of feedback on the correction of false memories has not yet been tested in older adults, a key question given the increased vulnerability of older adults to memory errors. To address this, we conducted two experiments comparing younger and older participants using two feedback types: simply providing the correct answer or providing the correct answer with a follow-up question prompting revision of previous responses. In Experiment 1, participants underwent pre- and post-feedback memory tests (as in Mullet &amp; Marsh, 2016), with an additional study-recall cycle for new, non-studied material (transfer test). Experiment 2 investigated this further by adding an additional study-retrieval phase, including pre- and post-feedback tests, in order to increase training in retrieval practice and metacognitive strategies. Results indicated that both age groups improved correct recall and reduced memory errors, with older adults benefiting most from repeated practice and feedback, demonstrating a transfer of learning strategies to new material. We highlight the role of engaging in effortful memory strategies to promote better learning during adulthood and aging.",

          "authors": "Veronika Alekseeva; Anna Ciaunica",
          "abstract": "From the moment we are born, and even before, in the womb, and until our last breath, our bodies move all the time. Adaptive behaviors necessarily depend not only on successful integration of multisensory bodily signals but also on how we move our body in the world. This paper considers the notion of embodied selfhood through the perspective of dynamic and rhythmic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions. We propose a new theoretical framework suggesting that the dynamic coupling between bodily movements and bodily actions in the world are fundamental in constructing and maintaining a coherent sense of self. To support this idea, we use the Predictive Processing (PP) and Active Inference framework as our background theoretical canvas. Specifically, we will focus on the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation in relation to dynamic selfhood, and argue that rhythmic bodily signals such as heartbeats, breathing, and walking patterns are predictable and thus, can be smoothly attenuated, i.e. processed in the background.  We illustrate this hypothesis by discussing the case of Depersonalisation Disorder as a failure to self-attenuate self-related information processing, leading to feelings of unreality and self loss. Because living systems such as human bodies are finite systems resisting entropy, it is crucial to strike a balance between what sensory information to ignore, and what sensory information to prioritize on the fly. Hence the vital role of the phenomenon of somatosensory attenuation linked to dynamic embodied selfhood, which is designed precisely to deal with this fine balance between attending and dis-attending self- and world-related information in time. When this fragile balance is disrupted, instead of fixing the self alone, or the individual per se, one needs to address the relationship between the individuals’ sense of self, bodily movements and bodily actions in the physical and social world. We conclude with potential implications of our hypothesis for therapy.",

These findings suggest that the experience of shopping online is fundamentally distinct from that of shopping in a physical store. In the second experiment, a relationship was identified between the reported experience of using technological tools in a large organization and the reported experience of using technology in other environments. These findings indicate that the experience of using technology remains consistent, irrespective of the environment in which it is applied. In the third experiment, a relationship was identified between the reported experience of receiving public transportation services through traditional methods and the reported experience of receiving such services through technological means. These findings suggest that the experience of using public transportation remains consistent, regardless of the type of means used. \nIn conclusion, the experience of receiving a service remains consistent, whether it is delivered through technological or non-technological means, as long as it is provided within a specific organization or location. For instance, this consistency can be observed in services offered on public transportation or within an organization. The experience of using technological tools remains consistent, regardless of the environment in which they are applied—for instance, whether these tools are utilized within or outside the organization. The service experience differs when delivered through technological means compared to traditional methods, especially when the service is provided in separate locations. For instance, shopping, working, or studying from home using technology offers a distinct experience compared to receiving these services in physical settings such as offices, stores, or classrooms.",

          "authors": "Chris Robert Harrison Brown; Aleksandra Maria Herman",
          "abstract": "Interoceptive Attention refers to how an individual typically allocates their attentional resources to physiological signals. We do not, however, fully understand how Interoceptive Attention relates with other forms of internally focused attention, such as attention to internal thoughts (e.g., mind-wandering, reflection, worry), and whether these factors compete for limited attentional resources at the trait and state level. Across two Studies (n = 222, n = 109; years data collected: 2021–2022, 2023-2024; from a UK-based predominantly undergraduate population), we isolated two components from several established trait-level measures of attention to thoughts, these reflected Negative Automatic Thoughts (worry, rumination), and Controlled Thoughts (deliberate mind-wandering, reflection). In subsequent regression analyses, Negative Automatic Thoughts, but not Controlled Thoughts, were a significant positive predictor of Interoceptive Attention, even when controlling for perceived interoceptive accuracy. This significant relationship was, however, accounted for by trait anxiety when included in the model. To test this pattern at the state-level, a novel monotonous responding task with three-dimensional attention probes was developed, which measures the reported allocation of attention between thoughts, bodily sensations, and the task. In contrast to trait-level attention, reported priority of attention to thoughts and body signals inversely correlated, despite both increasing across the task. The results suggest that in a single moment attention to bodily signals and internal thoughts may compete; but over time, individuals who report focusing more on their internal thoughts also report more time attending to their body, with some evidence showing that this positive correlation could be due to underlying trait anxiety.",

In virtual reality, an image of an object located in a particular location is created only upon observation.

The parameter values of two entangled particles are determined instantly and definitively upon measuring one of them. This phenomenon occurs even when the particles are far apart in terms of spatial location. \n3. In virtual reality, it is not possible to measure or experience a unit smaller than a minimal value.

This v2.3 (DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/uhj97_v2, 100 references) corrects them, additionally the statement \"The potential toroidal geometry of microtubule lattices, inspired by topological phonon modes\" [27, 90, 85] is incorrect. It should read: \"Topological quantum states in MoTe2 and phonons suggest entanglement stability, paralleling microtubule lattices\" [25, 26, 27]. Contact akoski.cqfh@gmail.com for details. \n\nThe Conscious Quantum Field Hypothesis (CQFH) v2.3 proposes fundamental quantum consciousness as a quantized scalar field C(x,t), driven by 40 Hz microtubule coherence in cortical neurons. Modulated by 0.1–10 Hz neural electromagnetic fields, 4–8 Hz theta oscillations via vagus nerve signaling, and 1–4 Hz delta synchrony, the field persists for ~0.0001 s. Shielded by actin and structured water, the field’s coherence is enhanced by tryptophan super-radiance, neural plasmonics, mitochondrial dynamics, biophoton emissions, and neuropeptide signaling. This fosters entanglement (S_collective ~ 26.6 bits) and integrated information (Phi), bridging quantum and classical neural activity. Ten 2025–2026 experiments test this falsifiable model, leveraging 2022–2024 findings on microtubule coherence, biophotonics, synaptic plasticity, neuropeptide signaling, and network criticality. CQFH v2.3 offers a bio-quantum framework to explore potential shared reality, enabled by subconscious processing and collective neural synchrony, with extensions deferred to UCQFH.

Web accessibility ensures that digital platforms are usable by people with disabilities, following standards like WCAG 2.1, which promotes equal access to online resources. Sentiment analysis uses machine learning to understand public opinions from sources such as social media, online reviews, and forums, providing valuable insights for businesses, governments, and communities. By reviewing key research, we identify major challenges, effective methods, and new trends in these fields, focusing on their applications in healthcare, education, and crisis management. We also explore how technologies like NoSQL databases, genetic algorithms, blockchain, and Web 3.0 improve data processing, security, and user experience. This study highlights the connection between accessibility and sentiment analysis, showing how they can work together to create fair and smart digital systems. Our goal is to provide a clear guide for students, researchers, and professionals, offering ideas for future work to build inclusive and data-driven online environments that benefit everyone",

          "abstract": "2024 marks the 65th anniversary of Campbell and Fiske’s (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) Guidelines—one of psychology’s most influential frameworks for evaluating construct validity. Yet retirement plans are premature. Although structural equation modeling (SEM)-based MTMM models have advanced the field, their application often faces convergence difficulties, compromises trait-method symmetry, and lacks consensus regarding optimal modeling strategies, creating ongoing barriers for applied researchers.\nBuilding on a latent correlation matrix derived from a well-fitting measurement model with multiple indicators, our Extended Guidelines address key criticisms typically raised against manifest correlations and offer rich, formative insights not easily captured by SEM-based approaches. We present an Extended Campbell-Fiske framework treating MTMM structures as two-facet designs, with traits and methods considered symmetrically and substantively important—complementing SEM approaches and providing a flexible, accessible tool for construct validation.\nWe illustrate this approach using complex data from a two-facet design (N = 18,047 eighth graders across four countries), crossing five trait constructs and five domains. Employing asymptotic parameter comparisons, we demonstrate the Extended Guidelines’ utility to:\n•\tProvide summary statistics, standard errors, and statistical significance tests for each Campbell-Fiske validity criterion,\n•\tEvaluate convergent and discriminant validity across traits, methods, and interactions,\n•\tExamine facet-specific and interaction patterns in construct validity, and\n•\tTest generalizability across populations, settings, or measurement conditions.\nOur findings reinforce the enduring relevance of the Campbell-Fiske framework while offering a modern, broadly applicable tool for construct validation across diverse MTMM designs.",

This process, if it exists, is theorized to be triggerable by a specially crafted sensory protocol, even in individuals with anterograde amnesia. Once initiated, the replay is hypothesized to be involuntary and uncontrollable. We propose a relativistic mathematical model to reconcile the tension between global time dilation during replay and the local perception of real-time experience. Drawing inspiration from general relativity and psychophysics, we introduce a novel cognitive spacetime manifold and define conditions under which a globally dilated replay (Treact = K · Tenc) can yield a subjectively undistorted temporal experience. The potential for K to be extraordinarily large necessitates a robust framework to explain this phenomenon.",

While humans routinely share confidence, metacognitive capabilities are still developing in artificial intelligence (AI), raising the question of how humans attribute metacognition to AI systems. In seven pre-registered experiments, we show that attributions of metacognition are sensitive to observed behaviour (e.g., response times), but also agent types: observers consistently overestimated AI confidence compared to humans—even when their behaviour was identical. This illusion of confidence was robust across behavioural profiles, agent descriptions, and decision-making tasks (visual perception, general knowledge) but was reduced in more subjective decisions (emotion categorisation). An experimental manipulation further showed that illusions of confidence are rooted in prior beliefs about the agents’ capabilities. Together, these findings uncover a powerful illusion of confidence in artificial systems and highlight a central role for metacognition in human-AI interactions.",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

But how is a person’s age represented in the mind at all: do we remember someone as younger, or older, than they actually were? In a matching-from-memory task, observers briefly saw a target face which was either Young (30 years old) or Old (60 years old). Afterward, they saw two new decoy faces — 10 years younger, and 10 years older than the target. Observers were strongly biased to match Young targets to younger decoys, and Old targets to older decoys. These biases held across artificially aged and real faces, regardless of observers’ own age, and even when the decoys’ races and genders differed from that of the target — suggesting that a common mechanism underlies memory for facial age across races and genders. Additional experiments indicated that these memory biases reflect assimilation toward visual category centers, rather than toward extremes. Thus, social categories of ‘young’ and ‘old’ shape and distort our memories of faces.",

Yet children do not experience words just as individual labels, but as parts of broader language contexts, such as conversations and stories. In principle, word contexts might support word learning because words similar in meaning tend to occur in similar contexts. Thus, a child who knows some fruit words and has heard them in the context of \"juicy\" might learn that a \"juicy mango\" is also a fruit even without ever seeing a mango. Although children can use such contextual support to learn words in the lab, we do not know whether they harness contextual support in everyday language for real-world word learning. We quantified words’ contextual support in children’s everyday language input and found that it reliably predicted normative word learning, even accounting for other established predictors such as word frequency.",

This paper presents memo, a new domain-specific probabilistic programming language that overcomes these challenges: first, by providing specialized syntax and semantics for theory of mind, and second, by taking a unique approach to inference that scales well on modern hardware via array programming. memo enables practitioners to write dramatically faster models with much less code, and has already been adopted by several research groups.",

          "abstract": "The human ability to think about thinking (\"theory of mind\") is a fundamental object of study in many disciplines. In recent decades, researchers across these disciplines have converged on a rich computational paradigm for modeling theory of mind, grounded in recursive probabilistic reasoning. However, practitioners often find programming in this paradigm extremely challenging: first, because thinking-about-thinking is confusing for programmers, and second, because models are extremely slow to run. This paper presents memo, a new domain-specific probabilistic programming language that overcomes these challenges: first, by providing specialized syntax and semantics for theory of mind, and second, by taking a unique approach to inference that scales well on modern hardware via array programming. memo enables practitioners to write dramatically faster models with much less code, and has already been adopted by several research groups.",

          "abstract": "In a series of studies (Manini et al., 2021), we investigated how task performance is affected by fully irrelevant distractors (i.e. sharing neither features nor space with the target) vs. potentially relevant distractors (i.e. sharing features and space with it) as a function of the search context/perceptual load. Although the effects of both kinds of distractor would fall within the notion of attentional capture, we observed a systematic dissociation between the two types of captures: whereas the effect of the potentially relevant distractor was larger for high perceptual demands (i.e., feature search), no difference was observed for the fully irrelevant distractor as a function of task demands. The present study aimed to further investigate the robustness of the double dissociation observed in Manini et al. (2021), investigating which variables could modulate it and comparing the effects of each distractor more fairly. In Experiment 1, we successfully observed a fully double dissociation between the effects of each distractor type: larger effect of the potentially relevant distractor for high perceptual demands, and larger effect of the fully irrelevant distractor for low perceptual demands. To further test the robustness of this dissociation, we conducted three additional experiments manipulating variables such as stimuli time exposure, load presentation (within vs. between blocks), and distractor predictability. Despite these variations, a consistent difference between the effects of relevant and irrelevant distractors was observed. Importantly, in the final experiment, we directly compared the two distractor effects, confirming that each type of distractor interacts differently with search context / perceptual load. Overall, our findings support the existence of qualitatively different processes: distraction (of the fully irrelevant distractors) and interference (of the potentially relevant distractors), as a result of the interaction between distinct attentional mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "To understand social relationships, humans must recognize cues of affiliation. When infants see interactions between abstract, animated characters, they use imitation, helping, comforting, and exerted effort to predict who will approach whom. Moreover, infants attend to and reach for characters who imitate other characters and those who help others. The present research builds on these findings and asks whether infants reach for human-animated puppets with distinct and variable human voices who imitate, are imitated by, comfort, are comforted by, or move synchronously with a person. At 12 months, infants reached more often for puppets who imitate a human's sound, and for those who were not targets of imitation. In contrast, infants did not reach more for puppets who comforted or synchronized their motions with a human actor. By 12 months, therefore, infants show differentiated responses to different acts of social engagement by those whose social interactions they observe as third parties.",

This study aimed to provide a German version of the FFQ and to examine its psychometric properties and correlates. Two-hundred and thirty-three participants (76% female) completed the FFQ along other measures online and 110 participants completed the FFQ again after two weeks. The original FFQ’s five factors could not be replicated but, after adding residual covariances between items, analyses supported a one-factor model. Internal and test–retest reliability coefficients were high. Convergent validity was supported by associations with gastrointestinal diseases, emetophobic symptomatology, and symptoms of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. A medium-sized correlation with eating disorder psychopathology suggested limited discriminant validity. Female sex, disgust propensity, disgust sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty were identified as further correlates of fear of food. In conclusion, this study indicates that the German FFQ has high internal as well as test–retest reliability and provides support for its convergent validity. Indications for its factorial and discriminant validity were limited, which may necessitate further refinements in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Despite robust evidence linking minority stress to mental and physical health disparities in LGB populations, most studies have relied on correlational data and self-report measures. The present study introduces a novel experimental paradigm combining neuroimaging (fNIRS), questionnaires, and ecologically valid auditory stimuli to investigate the impact of minority stress on neural activity and mood. This paradigm extends prior research on the \"Cardiovascular Conundrum\"— a paradoxical autonomic profile observed in minority groups—by examining its neurofunctional counterpart, the emotional suppression. Participants (LGB and matched heterosexual controls) were exposed to stigma-related, stressful, and positive audio clips under two conditions: emotion suppression and natural response. Brain activation was measured across prefrontal and parietal regions, while self-reported affect and standardized psychometric instruments assessed psychological traits and past discriminatory experience. Emphasis was placed on the mediating role of emotion suppression, a known coping strategy associated with adverse outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to combine experimental induction of minority stress, emotion regulation manipulation, and neurofunctional recording in real time. By addressing current methodological gaps, this paradigm offers a temporally precise and ecologically valid approach to investigating how stigma impacts brain function and affective regulation in minority populations.",

          "title": "Boosting digital agency through a self-nudge app",
          "authors": "David Joachim Grüning",
          "abstract": "The development of smartphones has transformed the way people interact with the digital world, but it has also made problematic digital behavior – especially social media use – a growing concern. This dissertation addresses the core problem of how to effectively empower individuals to regain self-control in digital environments designed for engagement and distraction. Existing interventions, mostly nudges implemented on digital platforms, tend to be context-bound, opaque, and insufficient for lasting behavior change. The central claim of the dissertation is that effective user support must build users' skills to help them make deliberate, reflective choices in digital spaces. The dissertation's approach leads to the development and evaluation of a self-nudge app as a platform-independent, boosting-based intervention tool. The dissertation consists of two parts, including three papers each.\nThe first paper presents a conceptual framework that categorizes digital interventions according to their timing: proactive, interactive or reactive. It reviews the landscape of scientifically tested interventions aimed at promoting positive digital behavior and highlights the dominance of platform-specific, behavioral approaches. The paper highlights the need for alternative strategies that are both practically feasible and theoretically robust. As a direct follow-up, the second paper in the thesis reports on an expert meeting we organized with 31 international scholars and practitioners to identify the most promising methodologies for future digital intervention research. The result is a consensus on the need for independent, flexible tools, particularly smartphone apps and browser extensions, as these allow researchers to deliver interventions across platforms and real-life settings – free from any platform gatekeeping. The third paper advances the theoretical argument that interventions for 'wicked', that is, overly complex environments such as social media, need to combine behavioral interventions with informational elements that promote user understanding. The paper proposes a shift towards competency-based designs, rooted in the boosting paradigm, that help users better understand both the structure of digital environments and their own behavioral patterns in order to intervene effectively with their behavior.\nBased on the conceptual insights, the next paper of the dissertation introduces and tests the smartphone app one sec, developed in collaboration with a commercial partner. The app integrates three features – reflection prompts, mental friction and a dismissal option – to control habitual app use. In a six-week field study (N = 280) and an online experiment (N = 500), the app significantly reduced app use and improved users' satisfaction and awareness of their smartphone behaviour. This paper provides the first empirical support for a large-scale self-nudge app intervention. The next paper extends these findings in a long-term field study, following 1,039 users for an average of 13 weeks (with some followed for up to a year). The results replicate and strengthen earlier findings on the effectiveness of the app intervention, showing that users not only opened apps less frequently, but also reduced the amount of time they spent in them. The study also documents different usage patterns, including strategic disabling and re-activating of the app intervention on different days in the week, providing a real-world view of how users adapt interventions to their lives. In the final paper, we explore how intervention effects vary across users by examining socio-cognitive characteristics of users as moderators. In a large-scale field study (N = 1,809), traits such as self-awareness, social sensitivity, and cognitive reflection were predictive of behavior change, improvements in subjective well-being, and adherence to the intervention. In contrast, traditional personality traits (Big Five) showed minimal explanatory power. A replication study with a different app (N = 1,932) confirmed the generalizability of these findings.\nThis dissertation makes two main contributions. First, it introduces frameworks that help structure the field of digital interventions, highlighting gaps in the literature as well as researchers' consensus on future research steps and how they should be taken. Second, informed by these frameworks, the dissertation designs and tests a real-world, scalable intervention rooted in boosting theory, demonstrating the importance of user-specific characteristics in shaping intervention effectiveness. Practically, the dissertation provides a validated, fully available app (one sec) that is now used by over two million users worldwide. Theoretically, the dissertation's research advances a shift in digital design towards adaptive, user-centred intervention strategies. Future research should further explore personalized, modular intervention systems and use advanced study designs like micro-randomized trials to tailor support to individual users and contexts. The challenge ahead is to move beyond one-size-fits-all solutions and develop digital interventions that respond to the complexity of real people in real environments.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "authors": "Jakub Limanowski",
          "abstract": "Perceiving myself as distinct from others rests upon distinguishing sensations that were generated by “me” from those that were not. Based on computational frameworks developed in the field of motor control, a common assumption is that the evaluation of predicted vs actual movement feedback by comparators is one of the first steps in establishing self-other distinction. In an attempt to uncover the brain areas implementing such comparisons, neuroimaging studies have predominantly used experimental manipulations of visual movement feedback. From these works, three candidate brain regions have emerged for visuomotor comparisons: the angular gyrus (AG), the extrastriate body area (EBA), and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, there is an ongoing debate about which of these regions, if any, implements a comparator in the sensorimotor sense; which kind of signals the visual input is compared against, and how dynamic this comparison is. In this mini review, I revisit the assumptions of classical proposals on visuomotor self-other distinction; discuss potential biases resulting from non-motoric cues in the above studies; highlight how differences in kinematic predictability result from different kinds of visual distortion—and how this could be capitalized on; and discuss the potential promises and pitfalls of recent experimental approaches including passive movement generation.",

          "authors": "Alexander A Sulfaro",
          "abstract": "A typical mental image is not clearly visible, nor invisible, but instead has an ethereal, near-indescribable appearance. This article attempts to define specifically what this phenomenology seems to entail. Here, mental images are proposed to involve only quasi-sensory experiences of thought content, without experiencing basic visual features of that content. Quasi-sensory experiences are ubiquitous components of everyday perception, such as those which fluctuate when viewing bistable images (e.g., the rabbit-duck illusion), or which are inaccessible during object recognition in associative agnosia. They are (1) conscious experiences that are (2) at least somewhat visual, in that their content is experienced within the visual field, but they are also (3) distinct from experiencing basic visual features of real or imagined content in the visual field. Such experiences are neither maximally sensory (depictive), nor non-sensory (non-depictive). Viewing mental imagery as quasi-sensory aligns with neuropsychological evidence showing that mental imagery requires mid- and late-stage, not early-stage, visual processing, and supersedes explanations for mental imagery’s ethereal phenomenology based on low-level feature coarseness (e.g., blurriness, dimness), opacity, unreality, or voluntariness. By equating mental image phenomenology to components of other ordinary perceptual experiences, this account could help individuals differentiate if they can or cannot experience a typical mental image, or if they have merely defined a typical mental image differently to another person. Ultimately, experiencing a mental image as quasi-sensory, as described here, would not clearly constitute seeing, nor not seeing, potentially resolving decades of confusion around the format of mental images.",

Beginning with the question of what it means to exist, the theory connects the structures of life, self, emotion, expectation, reward, and immersion through the frameworks of thermodynamics and evolutionary psychology. The self’s response to stimuli is understood as a cycle of emotion–expectation–reward, described as a decision-making system aimed at maximizing energy efficiency. The theory further expands to explain distorted threat perception, failure of expectations, and the mechanism of guarantee-threat regulation, aiming to identify the origins of inefficient behavior and psychological distress. While drawing from existing psychological theories, this theory distinguishes itself by defining emotion and expectation as core elements of energy distribution strategies, offering an original integrative framework.",

Here we present preliminary results from our own isolated social media platform named Magpie Social. In it, participants could interact with each other like typical social media, but we had control over the platform and measured people’s beliefs and behavior before and after using it. This allowed us to more closely approximate the ecological validity of naturally occurring social-media data, while retaining the ability to measure variables and infer causation. Our week-long task had three between-subject conditions (total N= 311): a CONTROL in which people engaged on Magpie with no external influence, and two (LEFT and RIGHT) in which a small number of posts were secretly made by us, sharing typical talking points from one political side. We found small but statistically reliable effects suggesting that, relative to the CONTROL, the presence of right-wing trolls resulted in a higher level of right-wing belief and a greater perception of political division in the US. Conversely, the left-wing troll campaign did not appear to have any statistically reliable effect on these measures. We also found considerably more overall engagement in both troll conditions, probably because content with a clear political stance tended to receive more activity. However, participants (especially those on the left) disliked the RIGHT condition more than the others.",

          "abstract": "Changes in personality traits are not unusual, and common mental disorders (CMDs) may play a role. In a large population sample of 55,056 individuals, we examined associations of CMDs recorded in a national registry over 17 years (2004-2021) with self- and informant-rated Big Five personality traits (assessed once in 2021-2022). Besides comparing diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals, we considered the number and timing of CMD records. Those diagnosed with CMDs during the 17-year period differed from undiagnosed individuals by about 0.50 SD higher neuroticism and slightly higher openness. For neuroticism, the difference was greater for those with more recent and numerous diagnoses, whereas for openness, the association did not depend on number or timing of diagnoses. These findings suggest increased neuroticism in response to mental health issues, which may take over a decade to gradually return to baseline, and that less open people may be less likely to seek mental health help. We also found evidence of temporary decreases in extraversion and conscientiousness in response to depressive disorders. Findings were similar in self- and informant-ratings, suggesting they were not assessment artifacts. Our results are consistent with small personality trait changes in response to mental disorders that gradually fade over several years.",

          "abstract": "This study presents new evidence for the structural unergative-unaccusative distinction,\nin second language (L2) grammars, focusing on elementary-level Japanese-speaking\nlearners of English (JLEs). The underlying distinction of unergatives-unaccusatives is\noften obscured on the surface strings due to independent syntactic properties such as\nfeature-driven subject movement (in English) or headedness (in Japanese). Nevertheless,\nbased on previous findings, elementary-level JLEs are expected to have reset headedness\nbut have not acquired subject movement. Then, the resulting representation would not\ninvolve the properties obscuring the underlying unergative-unaccusative distinction and\npotentially exhibit it on the surface strings in L2 English. Following these observations,\nwe carefully designed test sentences with un/grammatical word orders that elementarylevel\nJLEs would generate and conducted an acceptability judgment task with native\nspeakers of English and elementary-/intermediate-level JLEs. The results showed that, in\ncontrast to native controls and intermediate learners, who exhibited target-like patterns,\nelementary-level JLEs incorrectly accepted ungrammatical word orders only with\nunaccusatives (e.g., *When did arrive the train?) but not those with unergatives (e.g.,\n*Where did dance the man?). This discrepancy can be attributed to the sensitivity to the\nstructural distinction of unergative-unaccusative verbs, and our data provide evidence for\nthe creative construction of an interlanguage in L2 acquisition.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "Although Denmark is internationally recognized for its progressive welfare state, this paper uncovers how structural incentives within its decentralized child welfare system foster institutional inaction, even in cases involving serious risks to children. Contrary to public perception, municipal child services frequently fail to enforce rulings related to custody, visitation (samvær), and child support (børnebidrag), not due to resource scarcity or isolated errors, but because of embedded bureaucratic incentives that discourage intervention. Jurisdictional confusion, cost-avoidance behaviors, and a lack of binding enforcement mechanisms collectively undermine the rights and safety of vulnerable children. Through legal analysis, audit data, and anonymized case studies, this paper shows how institutional self-protection and administrative fragmentation erode the rule of law and violate basic human rights. It argues that Denmark’s child protection failures are not exceptions—but predictable outcomes of a system designed to distribute responsibility without accountability.",

However, there is little evaluation about whether these trainings are effective at changing officers' beliefs, motivations, and actions. To examine their efficacy, we tested a daylong implicit bias-oriented diversity training that sought to increase U.S. police officers' knowledge of biases, concerns about bias, and use of evidence-based strategies to mitigate bias (total N = 3,764). Relative to baseline, the training was immediately effective at increasing knowledge about bias, concerns about bias, and intentions to address bias. However, the effects were fleeting. Although the training was linked to higher knowledge for at least one month, it was ineffective at durably increasing concerns or strategy use. These findings suggest that diversity trainings as they are currently practiced are unlikely to change police behavior. We conclude with theorizing about what organizations and training programs could do for greater impact.",

          "abstract": "Everyone possesses a unique level of creativity, varying in quality and intensity. Creative mental operations are influenced by motivation, interest, fatigue, and external stimuli, which also affect attention. The cognitive process of attention relies on selectively focusing on specific environmental elements or internal thoughts. This selectivity is crucial in filtering distractions, maintaining concentration, and effectively processing information. Thus, creative thinking and attention share common functioning principles, possibly involving unified neural networks and pathways in executive control. Therefore, investigating the underlying neural mechanisms remains crucial; however, several challenges exist.\nThe first challenge relates to insufficient empirical data on animal models to assess the neural circuits of creativity, particularly in rodents. These animal models could offer complementary mechanistic proxies for the mental operation of creative thinking and attention in human models. The second challenge is the lack of integrated brain and computational models to provide a prediction-based explanation of the relationship between creative thinking and attention. We highlight the connection between creative thinking and attention by offering three recommendations to address the challenges. We center these recommendations on re-establishing the brain's agenda for creative thinking. This agenda offers new therapeutic possibilities for managing attention deficits, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",

When infants see interactions between abstract, animated characters, they use imitation, helping, comforting, and exerted effort to predict who will approach whom. Moreover, infants attend to and reach for characters who imitate other characters and those who help others. The present research builds on these findings and asks whether infants reach for human-animated puppets with distinct and variable human voices who imitate, are imitated by, comfort, are comforted by, or move synchronously with a person. At 12 months, infants reached more often for puppets who imitate a human's sound, and for those who were not targets of imitation. In contrast, infants did not reach more for puppets who comforted or synchronized their motions with a human actor. By 12 months, therefore, infants show differentiated responses to different acts of social engagement by those whose social interactions they observe as third parties.",

Because PAs are so influential, any differences in evaluations between demographic groups – such as between men and women - are incredibly important, given their potential to affect downstream employee outcomes. However, empirical evidence on the direction, magnitude, and moderating factors of gender differences in PAs has been inconsistent. Using a large dataset (N = 20,199 employees) from a multinational wholesale company, we replicated and extended findings on gender differences in PA ratings, examining potential moderating variables and downstream effects on promotions as a key future employment. Our findings revealed statistically significant but small to very small gender differences in evaluations of performance and development potential, with male employees receiving slightly higher ratings than female employees. These differences were moderated by the department gender composition and partially by manager gender. Despite these differences, PA ratings of performance and development potential were similarly related to promotions for both male and female employees.",

Despite the task being unrelated to color prediction, we found that color memory for strongly predictive shapes systematically distorted towards the color of their successors. Our biologically constrained neural network model of the hippocampus recapitulated human behavior, with predictive object representations asymmetrically distorting toward their successors and the magnitude of the shift increasing in proportion to transition strength. Together, this work shows how our memory for objects shifts toward the predictable future.",

In two samples of adults (n = 412 and 292), we explored personality traits and broader beliefs that might predict supernatural attributions for performance magic. Supernatural attributions were uncommon—many respondents wholly rejected the possibility that magicians’ magic was sometimes real—but nevertheless highly variable. In Study 1, a greater belief that magic tricks at least sometimes involve supernatural powers was associated with relatively higher extraversion, higher neuroticism, and lower openness to experience. In Study 2, random forests suggested that supernatural magic attributions were embedded in a family of paranormal and conspiratorial beliefs, particularly beliefs in psychic powers (reading and influencing thoughts) and precognition (perceiving the future). In both samples, gender, age, and education had small and inconsistent effects, but people who enjoyed performance magic were more likely to endorse supernatural attributions. Taken together, the findings suggest some truth to performing magicians’ suspicions and shed some light on who is more likely to explain magic tricks using supernatural causes.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is determining whether observers truly experience a stimulus. However, present/absent detection judgments are often biased by contextual factors, making it difficult to isolate conscious perception from non-perceptual influences. Traditional psychophysical methods cannot disentangle these components. To address this, we conducted in-person experiments (N=505) in which participants detected and reproduced dim stimuli under three contextual manipulations: attentional cues, asymmetrical base rates, and payoff schemes. Using a Hurdle-Gaussian model, we separated perceptual from non-perceptual effects. We found that statistical priors (base rate) and reward structures (payoff) induced non-perceptual shifts in reproduction behavior, whereas attentional cues led to shifts that reflect changes in conscious experience. Critically, when reproduction tasks were embedded within a detection context, reports of conscious experience were contaminated by non-perceptual effects. This highlights the need for caution in using and interpreting results relying on detection judgments in consciousness research.",

Therefore, 22 review articles were examined, based on\na systematic research strategy following PRISMA guidelines, and underwent a Risk of Bias\nassessment. The results emphasize neuroscientific evidence for the psychoanalytic model of\ndreams. Especially an increased activation of the limbic system and prefrontal cortex was found\nindicating the emotional and memory-related content during the process of dreaming. Despite the\nstrong tendency towards the psychoanalytical dream model, a few findings also provide\nsuggestions for a revised Activation-Synthesis Model which could be examined in future research.\nThis paper aims to encourage expanding research in neuropsychoanalysis to integrate dreams\nmore in psychotherapeutic interventions.",

          "abstract": "At the Human Vision and Electronic Imaging (HVEI) conference in 2012, I presented a neurobiologically-based model for trichromatic color sensations in humans, mapping the neural substrate for color sensations to V1-L4—the thalamic recipient layer of the primary visual cortex. In this paper, I propose that V1-L4 itself consists of three distinct sub-layers that directly correspond to the three primary color sensations: blue, red, and green. Furthermore, I apply this model to three aspects of color vision: the three-dimensional (3D) color solid, dichromatism, and ocular agnosticism. Regarding these aspects further: (1) 3D color solid: V1-L4 is known to exhibit a gradient of cell densities from its outermost layer (i.e., its pia side) to its innermost layer (i.e., its white matter side). Taken together with the proposition that the population size of a cell assembly directly corresponds with the magnitude of a color sensation, it can be inferred that the\nneurobiologically-based color solid is a tilted cuboid. (2) Chromatic color blindness: Using deuteranopia as an example, at the retinal level, M-cones are lost and replaced by L-cones. However, at the cortical level, deuteranopia manifests as a fusion of the two bottom layers of V1-L4. (3) Ocular agnosticism: Although color sensation is monocular, we normally are not aware of which eye we are seeing with. This visual phenomenon can be explained by the nature of ocular integration within V1-L4. A neurobiologically-based model for human color sensations could significantly contribute to future engineering efforts aimed at enhancing human color experiences.",

Negative affectivity and self-critical cognitions are linked to NSSI but have rarely been considered jointly alongside indicators of NSSI severity. To address this gap, we examined depressive symptoms and self-criticism as concurrent and prospective predictors of NSSI urges among depressed young adults over six weeks. Baseline NSSI severity was positively related to baseline depressive symptoms, which predicted follow-up NSSI urges; however, baseline depressive symptoms did not predict later NSSI urges when controlling for baseline NSSI severity. In contrast, self-criticism was not associated with baseline NSSI severity but predicted follow-up NSSI urges, even when controlling for prior NSSI severity. Using within-person longitudinal path models, depressive symptoms were positively associated with NSSI urges at the same assessment but did not prospectively predict later NSSI urges; however, self-criticism did predict later NSSI urges but not concurrent NSSI urges. Thus, depressive symptoms may indicate overall NSSI risk but may be less informative than self-criticism in predicting within-person changes in NSSI urges over time. These findings inform NSSI theories and highlight potential NSSI prevention and intervention targets.",

Here, we report baseline cohort (n=300) characteristics and cross-sectional associations between burnout and exhaustion symptoms, measured using the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ) and Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS), and demographic, occupational, psychiatric, psychological, and lifestyle factors assessed using online questionnaires. Our findings revealed significant associations between symptom severity and multiple factors, most notably depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, quality of life, dissociation, psychological inflexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, self-efficacy, alexithymia, trauma, gratitude, educational background, emotional stability, household demands, ADHD symptoms, autistic traits, perfectionism, and physical activity. These findings support previous research linking persistent stress conditions to a spectrum of demographic, occupational, psychiatric, psychological, and lifestyle measures.

          "abstract": "People often intend to embrace a healthy lifestyle but struggle to adopt or maintain these habits. Conflict and facilitation between health goals and other life goals (horizontal interrelations) or personal values (vertical interrelations) can impact the initiation and maintenance of health behaviors. Optimal measures of such goal interrelations are crucial to ensure the efficacy of health behavior interventions. However, existing methods heavily rely on self-reports, making them susceptible to biases. In this study, we introduce the PEP-Goal, the first implicit measure of health goal conflict and facilitation based on the Propositional Evaluation Paradigm (PEP). Our findings revealed notable dissociations between the PEP-Goal and the standard self-report approach (Personal Project Analysis). While our study offers initial support for the predictive validity of PEP-Goal, further refinements are warranted. Specifically, implicit PEP-Goal scores indicating horizontal conflict and facilitation between physical activity (PA) goals and other life goals positively correlated with actual PA behavior, as quantified by activity trackers over a one-week period. Conversely, implicit vertical scores did not exhibit significant predictive value. Although further improvements are necessary, this study provides preliminary evidence for the predictive validity at the horizontal level and practical applicability of PEP-Goal as an implicit measure of goal interrelations.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the role of internal motor signals and visual information in the detection of and confidence in Partial-errors (PEs), subtle endogenous motor corrections. Using electromyographic (EMG) recordings, we captured motor activations during a conflict task in which participants reported the presence of PEs and rated their confidence. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 provided visible visual conflict through supraliminal primes, while Experiment 2 reduced visual feedback using subliminal primes. In both Experiments, participants demonstrated limited PE detection and above-chance metacognitive efficiency. Notably, when participants reported the absence of a PE, confidence was lower when a PE was actually present (unaware PE) compared to when there was no PE (correct rejection), suggesting implicit sensitivity to motor activation. Detection and confidence were systematically influenced by motor signals, with larger PE amplitudes and longer correction times leading to higher detection rates and confidence levels. However, a metacognitive bias emerged: confidence was paradoxically lower for detected PEs than for undetected ones, despite strong motor evidence. Visual information modulated the reliance on motor signals. In Experiment 2, where subliminal priming reduced visual feedback, motor signals had a more pronounced influence on both detection and confidence. These findings highlight the complementary roles of internal motor signals and external visual information in shaping sensorimotor confidence.",

Traditionally, a method for identifying and tracking individuals over time has been the object specific preview benefit (OSPB). Here, we replicate well-known successes using OSPB (e.g., an object survives movement and occlusion and can be re-identified by spatial trajectory, color, and shape) and we test a new visual feature: change itself.  Across 3 experiments we find that a constantly changing value in visual feature space can be used to re-identify an object as the same one seen earlier leading to a successful OSPB effect.

          "abstract": "Retrospective attention refers to the prioritization of contents held in working memory, a process investigated using the retro-cueing paradigm. This process is evidenced by the retro-cueing benefit, characterized by better performance for retrospectively cued trials. However, traditional statistical analyses fall short in distinguishing between decisional and non-decisional processes underlying this benefit. A pivotal contribution by Shepherdson et al. (2018) addressed this gap by applying drift-diffusion modeling which integrates both accuracy and reaction time measures to disentangle these processes. Their key contribution lies in demonstrating that retro-cues enhance the quality of working memory contents and enable their retrieval in advance of decision making—effects that occur independently of shifts in decision criteria. Building on Shepherdson et al.'s work, we encourage future DDM-based retro-cueing studies to pursue precise, mutually exclusive hypothesis testing and to integrate behavioral and neural data to more clearly distinguish between competing explanations of the retro-cueing benefit.",

          "abstract": "Beliefs influence the intensity of felt pain. We previously applied regression models to two independent pain-cueing datasets (https://osf.io/5r6z7/) and found that pain intensity reports were a function of the error between participants’ belief, as determined by cues that informed participants about the level of forthcoming noxious stimulation, and the actual stimulation intensity, such that greater error decreased the influence of prior beliefs. Although this result appeared to present a challenge to established models of perception, our analysis did not formally compare the result against established computational models. This made it difficult to assess the validity of our results against the wider literature and we could not explain why the effect of information cues changed over the course of the task. In the current study (https://osf.io/fj27k/) we compared a model that corresponded to our original interpretation where pain ratings were considered a function of prediction error size, against Bayesian reinforcement learning models. Pain ratings were best explained by a model in which the expected value of each information cue was updated via a Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithm. These new results indicate that deception pain studies should not assume that participants’ belief about the information they are given is fixed. Rather, our results provide evidence that the meaning of cues change dynamically over the course of the session through trial-by-trial updates, even when participants are instructed otherwise.",

          "abstract": "At the heart of many contentious debates—for example, on the ethicality of abortion, meat consumption, or the deportation of refugees—is the question of how much we should value the welfare and interests of different entities. Previous research has identified numerous characteristics that predict how much moral concern people show toward different entities (e.g., empathy, perceived similarity). However, integrating this quickly accumulating evidence has proven difficult and a general, psychological model of moral concern has not emerged. The present study (n = 800 U.S. participants) aims to address these issues. We first review the literature to identify hypothesized predictors of moral concern. We then use a machine learning approach to build an integrative, parsimonious, and predictive model of moral concern. Our findings will provide insights into (a) the collective predictive performance of the variables identified in the literature and (b) which characteristics are most important for predicting moral concern.",

Underpinning these associations is the premise that fWHR is larger\nin men, which empirically exhibits a mixed and equivocal pattern in the literature due to\nvariation in measurement, large sample sizes revealing small but significant differences, and\na lack of control of body size. In Study 1, in a sample of 1,949 faces, we used a Bayesian\nhierarchical model that incorporates prior information to simultaneously estimate sexual\ndimorphism in fWHR, adjusted for body size, across five measurement types. While we\nfound larger fWHR in women, comparing this effect to variability in fWHR due to image\ncapture settings revealed no robust evidence of sex differences in fWHR. In Study 2, we\ninvestigated sex differences in facial width specifically (also adjusted for body size), again\nincorporating prior information, and confirmed men have greater face width than women.\nAdvances in this area can be made by shifting focus away from arbitrary ratios like fWHR to\ndirect measures like facial width – as well as carefully considering prior evidence of existing\nassociations.",

          "authors": "Annie Holtz; Simon Kirby; Jennifer Culbertson",
          "abstract": "There are certain recurrent features of language that characterise the way whole language systems are structured, and others that target specific categories of items within those wider systems. For example, languages tend to exhibit harmonic (i.e. consistent) ordering between heads and dependents, making it a kind of system-wide regularity. While this tendency is generally robust, some categories of linguistic items deviate from this trend. We examine one such case of non-harmony, namely the order of the noun with respect to two dependents -- adjectives and genitives. Using two silent gesture experiments, this study tests the hypothesis that category-specific cognitive biases favour postnominal adjective order and prenominal genitive order. Further, we show that the influence of these biases is revealed in contexts where no conventionalised system is in place. When a system is in place, participants learn that system, and category-specific biases do not impact their learning. Our results suggest that different types of linguistic contexts reveal the influence of separate types of cognitive biases, such that some are active during learning and others are active during language creation.",

Drawing on models from Bohm’s implicate order, biofield physics, and emerging data from wave genetics and biophoton research, it outlines a hypothesis in which biological structure and cognitive function are not merely outcomes of genomic coding but active, field-mediated phenomena. The hypothesis suggests that DNA operates both as a receiver and transmitter of nonlocal information, modulating development through vibrational coherence and semantically structured fields. The framework synthesizes findings from Levin’s work on bioelectric patterning, Popp’s biophoton theory, and linguistic wave theory to argue for a field-based mechanism that underlies cellular organization, memory storage, and potentially even intention-driven effects. This model presents a challenge to classical gene-centric biology by proposing that semantic and energetic coherence across biological systems plays a central role in form and function. Implications include new directions for regenerative medicine, consciousness studies, and biocommunication, as well as a possible theoretical basis for observed anomalies in psi research and intentional influence on physical systems.\n\nKeywords\nQuantum biology, bioelectric signaling, morphogenesis, consciousness, biophotons, wave genetics, implicate order, nonlocality, semantic fields, psi phenomena",

This study aimed to (a) confirm the existence of such differentiated achievement goals in secondary school students and (b) validate the corresponding Hexagonal Achievement Goal Scale for Students (HEX-S). We adapted an existing scale, conducted cognitive interviews with 20 students, and surveyed 1,131 secondary school students. Multilevel confirmatory factor analyses supported the hexagonal goal structure, showing invariance between genders, age groups, and across six weeks. Correlations with a trichotomous goal orientation questionnaire indicated convergent and discriminant validity. School grades correlated weakly with mastery goals and the normative facet.

The human organism is viewed as a Carrier of Reason, whose quality depends on the harmony of supramolecular bonds within chromosomes. The article analyzes the multifaceted evolutionary process of Reason, encompassing the ontogenesis of the human organism—from conception to the formation of complex neural networks and the creation of Artificial Reason systems. Special attention is given to the interrelationship between genetic mechanisms, the development of consciousness, and the role of religious traditions as factors structuring subconscious processes and shaping cultural identity.\n\nA central argument is the interpretation of wars and migrations as a natural mechanism for the evolutionary renewal of spirituality and rationality—through genotype reassortment, compensation for supragenetic losses, and the restoration of emotional resonance. Four key stages of transition from natural to artificial intelligence are identified, revealing how the integration of biological, cultural, and religious components contributes to the progressive evolution of human thought. The paper proposes a re-evaluation of the role of war and discusses possibilities for a scientific transition to peaceful methods of renewing human quality. In conclusion, the prospective emergence of Artificial Reason is examined as the next stage in the evolution of Reason for effective adaptation to civilizational challenges and the achievement of harmony in the material world in accordance with the principles of Absolute Reason.",

          "abstract": "In this chapter, we examine current methodological practices in research on the cross-cultural adaptation of migrants. Based on data from a meta-analysis of 1,190 studies on first-generation migrants, we identify three main areas where intercultural research can improve: reporting practices, measurement, and research designs. As to reporting practices, the most common issues are failure to report essential demographic details (e.g., age, sex, country of origin); omission of information on the reliability and validity of variables used in analyses; failure to report other basic statistical information (i.e., bivariate correlations); and scarcity of publicly available datasets, indicating a lack of open science practices. Regarding measurement, the main issue is that measures often conflate predictors and outcomes of adaptation. We demonstrate this problem on three concepts commonly used as predictors in cross-cultural adaptation research: acculturative stress, loneliness, and social connectedness. Measures of these concepts often overlap with those of adaptation outcomes, introducing common method biases. Finally, regarding research designs, the vast majority of studies are cross-sectional, while longitudinal and experimental studies remain rare, limiting the capacity for detecting time precedence patterns and causal relations. We discuss how these issues undermine the applicability, replicability, and credibility of intercultural research, and we conclude by formulating recommendations for the field.",

The extent to which these abnormalities persist following depressive episodes, and represent a vulnerability factor for recurrent depressive episodes, remains unknown. The current study investigated emotion dynamics and their predictive validity in a sample of individuals with remitted depression (rMDD) and healthy controls (HC). \nMethods: Adults (HC: n=50; rMDD: n=48) completed a three-week ecological momentary assessment protocol, in which they responded to two items probing positive emotions and three items probing negative emotions six times daily. Contemporaneous and temporal networks were constructed using multilevel vector autoregressive models. Density was calculated as a measure of emotional inflexibility and In- and Out-Expected Influence were calculated as measures of centrality. Linear regression models were used to examine if density predicted clinical outcomes at the 6-month follow-up assessment. \nResults: Individuals with rMDD had significantly denser temporal emotional networks than HC participants. Groups also showed differential patterns of the most influential nodes in temporal and contemporaneous networks. Greater temporal density and contemporaneous density was significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms at the 6-month follow-up, assessed through both clinician-rated and self-report measures. \nConclusions: Abnormalities in emotion dynamics persist following remission from depression and can be used to predict future depressive symptoms, suggesting these may represent a vulnerability factor for depression. Future research should study if interventions based on emotion networks targeting maladaptive emotional processes are able to prevent future depression.",

Participants (n=100) had text-based conversations with both LLMs and then responded to questions to assess how relatable they found the AI. Participants with high anxiety felt higher affiliation with the LLM that mimicked anxiety, while participants with lower anxiety reported a perceived difference with that LLM. Furthermore, the sentiment of participants’ messages came to mirror the differing sentiment of the two LLM personas—a display of empathy that was predicted by participants’ anxiety levels. In Experiment 2, participants (n=100) engaged with two LLMs prompted to mimic extroverted or introverted personalities. Extending the results of Experiment 1, extroverted participants felt similar to the AI that mimicked extroversion.

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that selective attention can be strategically directed to prioritize items of higher ‘value’ in working memory. This work has typically been limited to tests of feature binding using simple ‘unitized’ colored shapes as memoranda. Recent research has suggested prioritization may not be effectively applied to colour-odour bindings. This raises the possibility that the benefits of value-based prioritization in working memory may be limited to bindings between unitized visual features (e.g. object-colour bindings, object-location bindings). The current study explored this, examining whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2 found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across the experiments, participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space (Experiment 1) or modality (Experiment 2). The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, suggesting that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of feature binding.",

However, many questions on the links between language models and people’s biased attitudes remain unanswered. In the current study we focus on gender–career bias to examine the extent to which language models can be used to model behavioural responses in the Gender–Career Implicit Association Test (IAT).  We provide a systematic evaluation of a range of language models, including n-gram, count vector, predict (word2vec), and Large Language Models (LLMs), to determine how well they capture people’s behaviour in the IAT.  We compared response time data from over 800,000 participants against 25 language models, with a total of 675 model variants. We find that many language models, including large language models (LLMs), correlated well with human behavior. While results support previous findings for both predict and count model families, we observed that performance of LLMs was consistently different from that of simpler predict models, particularly in terms of the direction and strength of correlations with reaction time and bias. This divergence may indicate successful attempts to mitigate bias in LLMs while preserving other aspects of linguistic information. Our findings reinforce the idea that societal biases are generally encoded in language, but that large language models can exhibit behaviors different to classical language models.",

Social health, i.e., someone having adequate quantity and quality of relationships to meet their needs for meaningful connection, is a key determinant of quality of life. Understanding potential changes in social health during GAHT is therefore essential to information provision for trans and gender diverse (TGD) people. The study, AFFIRM Relationships, aims to prospectively examine how GAHT affects social health and to isolate the biological effects of hormonal intervention relative to other gender-affirming treatments (i.e., mastectomy and voice training). \nMethods: We will conduct a multi-arm prospective longitudinal cohort study of TGD people who start GAHT, gender-affirming voice training, or gender-affirming mastectomy, prospectively following participants from before starting treatment to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after starting treatment. We will examine changes in social health, including potential changes in social networks. We aim to disentangle the ways in which social health changes after GAHT, by examining changes in psychosocial functioning and the potential roles of social stigma and gender congruence. Furthermore, we will compare the effects of GAHT, which induces a systemic biological change, to the effects of voice training and mastectomy, which are non-systemic interventions, to better understand the unique biological effects of GAHT.\nEthics and dissemination: Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Medical Ethical Committee of Amsterdam UMC (study no. 2024.0927). Results from this study will be disseminated via academic peer-reviewed publications, adapted into guidelines for clinical care, and we will co-design dissemination strategies for the TGD community together with a group of lived experienced experts (LEEs).",

          "abstract": "Given its ubiquity in mental life, the precise role of language in enabling complex thought and reasoning remains difficult to study in humans. However, the surprising emergence of sophisticated symbolic reasoning in purely connectionist Large Language Models (LLMs)—systems learning only from text—provides a novel empirical lens on language's role in cognition, disrupting historical symbolic-connectionist dichotomies and compelling a re-evaluation. We introduce the Emergent Symbolic Cognition (ESC) framework, proposing that general intelligence arises from the dynamic interaction between an adaptive continuous substrate (like a brain or Artificial Neural Network) and an internalized symbolic framework. ESC posits that recursive symbolic generation is the core computational engine: the substrate learns to sequentially generate and process symbols according to the framework's implicit rules, enabling it to navigate vast combinatorial spaces and construct structured solutions for diverse problems. This process allows the substrate to operate as a powerful, discrete symbolic processor. Converging evidence from human cognitive development, inner speech, neuroscience (aphasia, DMN activity), and the striking, though nascent, reasoning abilities of LLMs (e.g., chain-of-thought, cross-domain transfer) supports ESC. This framework offers a unifying perspective, reconciling connectionist learning with symbolic competence and reframing language as an inherited cognitive engine, establishing a conceptual scaffold for future interdisciplinary inquiry into the foundations of general intelligence, whether biological or artificial.",

The foundational work by John Nesselroade proposes a solution for this problem:\nmeasurement burst data (MBD) contains repeated waves of ILD, allowing researchers to\ninvestigate how momentary processes in ILD change over long periods of time. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel modeling strategy for these data, which unites two established frameworks:\nintegrating the multilevel first-order autoregressive model (ML-AR(1)M) for ILD and the\nrandom-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) for PD, we propose a new modeling\napproach, the dynamic measurement burst model (DMBM).

          "abstract": "A growing body of evidence shows that selective attention can be strategically directed to prioritize items of higher ‘value’ in working memory. This work has typically been limited to tests of feature binding using simple ‘unitized’ colored shapes as memoranda. Recent research has suggested prioritization may not be effectively applied to colour-odour bindings. This raises the possibility that the benefits of value-based prioritization in working memory may be limited to bindings between unitized visual features (e.g. object-colour bindings, object-location bindings). The current study explored this, examining whether value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied when feature pairings of color and shape are separated out, either into different spatial locations (Experiment 1) or across visual and auditory presentation modalities (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 found an overall cost to working memory performance when features were spatially separated, relative to a unitized condition, while Experiments 2 found no such cost for cross-modal feature separation. Across the experiments, participants were equally able to derive performance benefits from prioritizing high value items in the sequence, regardless of whether features were encountered as part of the same unitized object or separated in space (Experiment 1) or modality (Experiment 2). The findings have implications for the relationship between working memory and attention, suggesting that value-directed prioritization can be effectively applied across different types of feature binding.",

          "authors": "Brandon M. Sergent",
          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Invalidated Hope Theory, a novel framework reconceptualizing nostalgia as the visceral reminder of hopes that have been invalidated. While traditional theories define nostalgia as longing for the past, they struggle to explain its bittersweet quality, selective nature, and occurrence for never-experienced periods. We propose that nostalgia comprises three essential components: remembered hope, recognized invalidation, and visceral reminder of loss. This mechanism explains nostalgia's distinctive phenomenology and resolves paradoxes in existing literature. The theory accounts for various forms of hope invalidation (direct disappointment, lost possibility, temporal distance, knowledge contamination) and illuminates nostalgia's social, cultural, and clinical dimensions. By understanding nostalgia as mourning for invalidated hopes rather than simple preference for the past, we provide a framework that generates testable predictions across multiple domains. This perspective has significant implications for emotional processing, identity maintenance, and meaning-making in response to personal and collective loss.",

          "authors": "Jia Chen; David Gal",
          "abstract": "Digital platforms increasingly mediate how individuals share personal information. While prior research has documented that people selectively disclose based on social relationships, conflicting findings remain: some studies show individuals restrict strangers’ access to private data, while others reveal a surprising willingness to share sensitive information with them. We propose that these seemingly contradictory behaviors are explained by contextually dominant privacy concerns—specifically, security versus identity concerns. We theorize that when concerns over security are dominant, individuals are less willing to disclose personal information to strangers, whereas when concerns over identity are salient, individuals are less inclined to share with acquaintances. To test these predictions, we conducted five studies, including a secondary dataset (N = 11,123 posts) and four pre-registered experiments (N = 1,019). We find consistent evidence that the dominant component of privacy concerns predicts individuals’ willingness to share private information across relationship types. These findings contribute to the understanding of selective self-disclosure and offer marketing-relevant implications for digital platforms—guiding how platforms can be positioned and designed to reduce dominant privacy concerns, encourage deeper engagement, and support more effective data-driven personalization.",

          "authors": "Charles J. Wolf",
          "abstract": "This paper presents a narrative review and theoretical synthesis of betrayal trauma through the lenses of memory reconstruction, identity disruption, and recovery. Drawing on psychological literature, including foundational work by Freyd, Herman, van der Kolk, and others, the paper maps the subjective experience of betrayal trauma—particularly in narcissistic abuse—as a nonlinear process of healing, akin to walking a labyrinth. The methodology employed is a synthesis of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and lived experience. The analysis highlights the collapse of perceptual trust, the reorganization of autobiographical memory, and introduces the novel concept of the “grey phase”—a distinct period marked by emotional numbness, psychic detachment, and dissociation. While this phase has been described implicitly in trauma literature, this paper explicitly names and frames it as a neurobiological and psychological intermission essential to recovery. This layered, compassionate, and academically grounded model enhances understanding of how trauma ruptures narrative identity and how healing entails its gradual reconstruction. The paper concludes that recovery reflects complex psychological integration rather than pathology.\nNote on Perspective\nWhile acknowledging the importance of lived experience in understanding betrayal trauma, this paper is primarily an academic synthesis of peer-reviewed psychological research. Personal insight is employed as a conceptual lens to interpret and organize established theories within the field..",

          "abstract": "The objective of this research synthesis is to collect and summarize the research literature on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland. This is done through a systematic review, mostly in the form of a narrative review and with statistical indicators that are synthesized. A graphical summary (evidence gap map) is provided to better identify the nature of evidence available. There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. The demographic profile of Ukrainian refugees (many women, many children and elderly people, highly educated) is well documents, as are challenges to economic integration. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation, for example. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return in the near future seems increasingly unlikely --- although so-called dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "authors": "Peter Steiglechner; Paul E. Smaldino; Agostino Merico",
          "abstract": "There is a widespread perception that society has been polarizing into groups with increasingly divergent opinions. Multiple studies have sought to quantify the degree of opinion divergence (or ideological polarization), typically relying on variation among self-reported opinions, and have reached mixed conclusions. Each individual, however, perceives the landscape of public opinion through a subjective lens or viewpoint that is dynamically shaped by their social environment. To account for this subjectivity in perceived polarization, we propose a model of dynamic perception that takes social identity into account. When members of an in-group become increasingly homogeneous on a given topic (that is, when the variance of opinions in that group decreases), they perceive deviant opinions as increasingly distant from their own. Consequently, these individuals may perceive much more polarization than what an objective, neutral observer would perceive. We apply our model to empirical data on the opinions of German citizens about climate change and show that the effect of dynamic opinion perception on polarization can be nearly as substantial as actual opinion divergence. Moreover, we show that the direction of the effect need not be consistent over time, nor across different partisan groups. Our framework helps explain why people might sometimes experience levels of ideological polarization higher than those indicated by opinion surveys, independent of structural divisions, polarization-enforcing biases, or affect-driven attitudes towards out-groups.",

          "authors": "Daniel Nettle; Coralie Chevallier; Kate Pickett; Matthew Thomas Johnson; Elliott Aidan Johnson; Melissa Bateson",
          "abstract": "There is some evidence that income volatility (fluctuations in income over time) negatively affects mental and physical health, independently of the level of income. Evidence to date has examined fluctuations from year to year or from day to day, whereas a more relevant timescale might be month to month. Here, we use data from the Changing Cost of Living Study, a longitudinal panel from the UK and France with monthly data (n = 484). We examine the association between month-to-month income volatility and two outcomes, self-rated general health and anxiety-depression (a composite measure derived from GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores). Higher volatility was associated with worse health on both measures, with volatility accounting for similar amounts of variation as the level of income. Some association between income volatility and health is to be expected as a consequence of the concavity of the income-health relationship: because of concavity, a downward fluctuation damages health more than the equivalent upward fluctuation improves it. We show that the observed associations are 3 and 4 times too strong to be explained by this mechanism alone. We suggest that volatility, because it introduces uncertainty and stress, has substantial direct health effects. This claim is important for public policy: it means that policies and institutions that smooth people’s income streams can have beneficial health effects even if they don’t raise anyone’s income.",

Tässä artikkelissa kuvaamme kattavien Tilastokeskuksen ja KELAn rekisteriaineistojen pohjalta perhevapaiden hyödyntämistä Suomessa yrittäjinä toimivilla isillä, jotka saivat ensimmäisen lapsen vuosina 2009–2017 (n = 7747).

Tulosten mukaan vuoden 2013 perhevapaauudistus lisäsi yrittäjäisien perhevapaan käyttöä selvästi enemmän kuin palkansaajilla, liittyen todennäköisesti reformin tuomiin joustoihin. Perhevapaiden pitämisen taustalla olevat tekijät olivat pitkälti yhteneviä suhteessa palkansaajiin, mutta alivakuuttaminen näyttäisi vähentävän yrittäjäisien perhevapaille jäämistä, sillä se vaikuttaa negatiivisesti vanhempainpäivärahaan ja siten mahdollisesti perhevapaita koskeviin päätöksiin.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates climate-induced internal migration in India, focusing on district-level migration patterns and their relationship with climatic stressors using historical census data and statistical modeling. Internal migration, which refers to the domestic movement of people, is often driven by intersecting economic, social, and environmental factors. Climate change is increasing but unevenly playing a role in decisions to migrate. The study emphasizes India’s status as a climate-migration hotspot, characterized by diverse geographic and population heterogeneity, and highlights the limitations of existing migration data, particularly the delayed 2021 Census. To address these gaps, the paper employs a novel statistical approach to estimate district out-migration, district-to-district migration, and district in-migration around 2021 by leveraging data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses alongside temperature and precipitation extremes derived from historical climate records from 1961-2021. The methodology integrates harmonized district boundaries and fixed-effects modeling to account for confounding factors while projecting migration trends under varying climatic conditions. Results reveal significant associations between climatic extremes, both positive and negative and migration flows, underscoring the role of climate stressors in shaping migration decisions. By generating predictive estimates for 2021 migration patterns, the study offers insights into how climate variability potentially influences internal migration dynamics in India. The findings contribute to broader discussions on how to incentivize climate change adaptation given the reality of highly mobile populations in India and provides pointers on reducing vulnerabilities in migrant-sending and migrant-receiving areas.",

Using exact match accuracy as the measure, the basic majority voting method achieved better high estimates for both current and previous home location predictions compared to the time frame clustering method. However, for work location prediction, time frame clustering showed better accuracy, and the activity space method contained 25.3% of true home and 44.4% of true work locations.

          "abstract": "This paper reconceptualizes the domestication of Oryza sativa through the lens of recursive enclosure and network-critical evolution, where feedback loops between fire management, human cognition, and plant adaptation crossed critical thresholds to establish novel evolutionary dynamics. Challenging hydraulic-state orthodoxy, I argue that domestication emerged not through discrete human control but via phase transitions within fire-maintained ecotones operating on 3-7 year cycles. Through archaeobotanical and genomic evidence, I demonstrate that upland swidden systems created recursive attractors - ecological and cognitive feedback loops in which rice and humans co-adapted through repeated burning (t), systematic return (t+1), and selective harvesting (t+2). Fire functioned simultaneously as ecological reset mechanism and prosthetic memory system, compressing successional cycles while entraining selection pressures across multiple plant generations. These early disturbance regimes structured not only rice biology but the cognitive infrastructure enabling subsequent agricultural intensification. I propose that domestication represents a distributed phase shift in socio-ecological networks - a recursive enclosure operating at the ashline where repetitive human-fire interactions established the conditions for coevolutionary change without requiring conscious breeding programs.",

          "abstract": "Shadow education - the private, supplementary tutoring that parallels formal schooling - has expanded globally alongside the massification of education. While often interpreted as a market response to institutional failure or cultural obsession with credentials, this monograph advances a structural reinterpretation: shadow education is a governance formation, not a sectoral aberration. We introduce the concept of overflow governance to describe how states promise universal education but outsource the labor of distinction to para-institutional systems when formal differentiation lags behind mass participation. Drawing on theories of state capacity, comparative education, and ritual sociology, we argue that shadow education systems function as infrastructures of sorting, moral legitimation, and epistemic reproduction. They stabilize institutional contradictions by individualizing failure and ritualizing inequality. Through a typology of national regimes, illustrative case studies, and an exploration of symbolic governance, this work repositions shadow education as central to understanding how modern states maintain legitimacy under conditions of scarcity and saturation.",

          "abstract": "Standardized testing is typically studied as a meritocratic sorting mechanism that selects for academic aptitude. This paper reframes such exams--especially East Asian high-stakes systems like the Gaokao, HKDSE, and Suneung--as socio-technical infrastructures designed not merely to select, but to exclude. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Charles Tilly's theory of durable inequality, I argue that exams are material devices of epistemic engineering that actively shape what counts as legitimate intelligence. These systems privilege a narrow form of cognitive legibility while systematically eliminating alternative epistemic styles. What is conventionally understood as academic \"failure\" is not a byproduct of inefficiency but a predictable outcome of design. This paper outlines the infrastructure of exclusion, the cognitive architectures it suppresses, and the sociotechnical normalization of failure across space and time. In doing so, it challenges the neutrality of assessment technologies and calls for an epistemic politics that recognizes the knowledge lost when we measure minds through machines built to fail them. By analyzing examination systems across different Asian contexts, this research contributes to the growing literature on comparative educational infrastructures and offers implications for educational policy, pedagogical practice, and theories of cognitive justice.",

Integrating developmental biology, educational sociology, and epigenetic theory, I conceptualize schooling as a recursive enclosure: a designed environment that conditions physical growth, behavior, and neurodevelopment through systematic exposure to time-discipline, sedentism, abstraction, and regulatory compliance. Drawing on empirical findings across multiple disciplines, I demonstrate how institutional forms become biological inputs in complex developmental systems. This framework recontextualizes educational expansion beyond cognitive socialization into a biopolitical apparatus for formatting human organisms to achieve compatibility with modern institutional orders. The theoretical advances offered here move beyond existing models of educational embodiment by identifying specific biological pathways through which institutional design shapes developmental trajectories, with significant implications for educational policy, public health interventions, and the ethical design of learning environments in an era of accelerating technological mediation.",

A third\nseason of geomorphological and hydrological investigations continued to\nsupport the interpretation that Rakhat al-Madrh’s environmental and\narchaeological conditions are unlike the rest of Bat and unique for Bronze Age\nSoutheastern Arabia. Possible human manipulation of flooding events in the\nbasin could have enabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided abundant\nvegetation for animal pasturing. Botanical analysis suggests wheat, barley, goat\ngrass, cyperaceae, and palm were all grown at the site in the third millennium\nBC.\nTest excavations at al-Khutm Settlement continued to clarify the\narchitectural and occupational history of the site. While limited in finds, an Umm\nan-Nar complex of house, platform monument, and tomb at the eastern end of\nthe Khutm hillside provide new insights into both ritual and domestic behaviors\nin the third millennium BCE.

Building on the results of BAP’s previous two years of work at the\nsite, this season explored two new houses, including one especially large\nbuilding with multiple phases of activity. Excavations at RaM continued to\ndiscover botanically-rich domestic contexts. A second season of\ngeomorphological and hydrological investigations continued to support the\ninterpretation that Rakhat al-Madrh’s environmental and archaeological\nconditions are unlike the rest of Bat and unique for Bronze Age Southeastern\nArabia. Possible human manipulation of flooding events in the basin could have\nenabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided abundant vegetation for\nanimal pasturing. Botanical analysis suggests wheat, barley, goat grass,\ncyperaceae, and palm were all grown at the site in the third millennium BC.\nTest excavations and survey at Khutm Settlement and Operation A shed\nfurther light onto the use history of the greater Bat landscape. Identification of an\nUmm an-Nar complex of house, platform monument, and tomb at the eastern\nend of the Khutm hillside provide new insights into both ritual and domestic\nbehaviors in the third millennium BCE, while newly discovered material culture\nfurther supports an Iron Age II date for the fortress identified by BAP in 2022. At\nOperation A, test excavation results suggest that the site was originally an\nextension of the Bat Necropolis into the wadi valley and has been revisited\nmultiple times by the site’s later populations. BAP strongly recommends further\nexcavations at Operation A prior to construction of the Bat Visitors Center.\nThe project also expanded its community outreach program by partnering\nwith the Bat office of the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism as well as local\npartners in the Bat Community. A ‘Bat Community Day’ event hosted by BAP\nx\nand Healthy Village Bat welcomed over 200 participants to celebrate the heritage\nand history of Bat’s community. The project also hosted visits to the UNESCO\nsite from two school groups and, at the request of the Ministry, conducted a two-\nday Pottery Workshop on traditional ceramic production techniques for HMT\nstaff and community members.\nWe deeply appreciate the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism’s ongoing\ncollaboration and support of this research.",

          "abstract": "The Bat Archaeological Project (BAP) conducted its 2022 season of excavations and surveys from 26\nDecember 2021 – 24 February 2022. Our research concentrated on five key areas: 1) archaeological\nexcavation at the southeastern end of the Settlement Slope in Umm an-Nar mortuary and domestic\ncontexts; 2) excavation of Umm an-Nar period houses at Rakhat al-Madrh; 3) systematic survey to\nbetter understand temporal relationships and artifact density between Bat’s different areas; 4)\ngeomorphological analyses at Rakhat al-Madrh; and 5) an expanded arts outreach and experimental\narchaeology program to further engage the local community.\nAt the Settlement Slope, mortuary excavations revealed a small but deep Umm an-Nar tomb, unusually\nlocated on a hillside with a commanding view of Bat’s ancient landscape. A shallow, rectangular\nplatform built into the hillside was discovered adjacent to the tomb and was covered in small bone\nfragments. The structure may have served as a body processing area utilized before interment. The\ncontinued excavations of Structure SS12 on the Settlement Slope revealed the area’s Umm an-Nar\nMiddle II and Late Umm an-Nar period occupation and behaviors.\nDomestic excavations continued at Rakhat al Madrh, where two Umm an-Nar period houses were\nexcavated and a geomorphological study of the area was conducted. The house excavations revealed\novens, hearths, and botanically-rich contexts within typical Middle Umm an-Nar domestic spaces.\nGeomorphological and hydrological investigations suggest the area’s environmental conditions are\nunlike any other region occupied in Umm an-Nar Bat. Greater water access from flooding events and\nthe recharge of the basin’s water table could have enabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided\nabundant vegetation for animal pasturing.\nA multi-year survey project to better understand the areas between Bat’s monuments was completed\nthis winter and resulted in the discovery of a likely Iron Age fortress at Khutm, lithic scatters\nsurrounding Rakhat al Madrh, and a dense area of Umm an Nar artifacts north and east of Operation\nA. An environmental resilience study continued BAP’s investigations of the intersection of the site's\nancient and modern landscapes. The analysis of artifacts and samples collected from excavations and\nsurvey operations are ongoing.\nThe project also launched an expanded outreach program, implementing arts engagement strategies\nto connect with local residents. The program culminated in the creation of an original comic book\nand experimental pottery production project that was disseminated to the community via Bat’s schools\nafter the conclusion of field season.\nWe deeply appreciate the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism’s ongoing collaboration and support of\nthis research.",

The MHC immediately took these findings under advisement and\ntheir plans have proceeded.\nIntensive archaeological survey was conducted on the Settlement Slope, around the Bronze Age\ntower “al-Qa’a” and at Rakhat al-Madrh before beginning excavations. Together, the survey\nresulted in the documentation of almost 200 previously unrecorded sites. Excavations at the\nSettlement Slope uncovered an Umm an-Nar period house rich in ceramic artifacts that date the\nstructure’s occupation to the ca. 2200 BCE. Several samples of carbon were collected and will be\ntested to date the house.\nAnother structure was excavated at Rakhat al-Madrh, located approximately 8 km southeast of\nBat. There are at least four houses all placed around an ancient water catchment area. One\nstructure at the site was excavated, revealing an Umm an-Nar period house built with mudbrick\nwalls atop a stone foundation. Ceramics and shell beads were found within the house which is\ncomprised of long, narrow rooms and a central courtyard. The house excavations at both the\nSettlement Slope and Rakhat al-Madrh are helping us understand the diversity of places and\necologies in which people lived in Bronze Age Oman.\nSeveral artifact and landscape analyses were also conducted at Bat this year. We are developing a\nnew ceramic chronology for the Umm an-Nar period. A study of the lithics excavated and\ncollected at Bat since 2007 was also conducted by Dr. Petranka Nedelcheva, a stone tool\nspecialist, to better understand the development of lithic technology in northern Oman. This\nwinter’s rains also allowed for a survey of plants growing around Bat’s archaeology to help us\nbetter envision what the site might have looked like 5,000 years ago. Finally, a survey of the\nstatus of many of the northern towers was conducted. We deeply appreciate the Ministry of\nHeritage and Culture’s continued support of our research.",

          "abstract": "The 2018-19 season was concerned with identifying the intensity and kinds of land\nuse in the Bat site. The study area consisted of a 0.23 km2 space between the five main\ntowers of Bat: Al-Rojoom, 1156, Al-Khafaji, Al-Ahliya, and Matariya. Thirty-nine\ntransects were walked at 5 m intervals. All diagnostic finds were mapped and\ncollected and a count of non-diagnostic finds kept for each transect. A total of 218\n(180 previously undocumented) features were documented within the thirty-nine\ntransects. The majority of identifiable feature types were walls, and the majority of artifacts\nrepresented belonged to the Bronze Age.\nThere is a clear variation in the distributions of ceramics across the site. Many of the transects\nindicate extensive use during the Umm an-Nar period. However, the transects around\nMatariya indicate use primarily during the early Umm an-Nar period and earlier; transects\nbetween Rojoom and Khafaji indicate use during the Iron Age and later; and transects\nbetween al-Ahliya and the Settlement Slope suggest use in the Pre-Modern period.\nPetrographic analysis of ceramics from the Bat to ‘Amlah areas show distinct changes both in\ntime and in space. The ceramics from Bat South are the same as those from Bat, suggesting\nthat the people lived and/or worked closely together.\nThe survey identified three areas for targeted excavation. These trenches focused on: (1)\nHafit period mudbrick architecture east of Matariya tower; (2) intact Umm an-Nar deposits\nacross from the Settlement Slope; and (3) varying ancient topography in the center of the site.\nFuture fieldwork will focus on understanding the relationship between settlement,\nsubsistence, and sociopolitical organization in prehistoric Bat and its environs.\nResults of this research include: (1) presentation at the Seminar for Arabian Studies (July\n2019) and (2) three separate presentations at the American Schools of Oriental Research\nconference (November 2019); (3) publication in the Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian\nStudies (vol. 49); and (4) work on an article for Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (TBD).",

Our results highlight 30 LADs at greatest risk of negative economic consequences from climate policies (broadly labelled as net-zero in UK policy). These are disproportionately in regions that suffered most from previous rounds of deindustrialisation. The anticipated geography of net-zero policy impacts highlights the need for proactive policies that span local authority boundaries, with devolved Mayoral Combined Authorities presented as an opportunity to do so.",

This study presents a novel bibliometric assessment of archaeology’s status relative to other fields using a hard/soft framework. It also presents a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Reproducibility is a factor in the hardness/softness of a field because of its importance in establishing consensus. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A survey of reproducibility reviews for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology’s scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.",

          "abstract": "Local violence often accompanies momentous political change, as feelings of political threat intersect with preexisting prejudices to endanger groups popularly associated with reform. We examine the relationship between such violence and settlement characteristics in the context of the 1905 Russian Revolution, which triggered numerous anti-Jewish pogroms. Counter to an extensive literature that emphasizes the contribution to conflict of ethno-religious polarization, we show that the sharp increase in pogroms after October 1905, when publication of the October Manifesto and accompanying anti-Semitic propaganda increased feelings of political threat among many non-Jews, was smaller in settlements with relatively large Jewish populations. We demonstrate that this empirical pattern can be rationalized with an elaborated version of the Esteban-Ray (2008) model of diversity and conflict when, as with the October Manifesto, political reform systematically alters the distribution of benefits across groups.",

She relies upon Smith's reference to Hume in the Lectures as having \"gone a little into the notion that public opulence consists in money\" and John Maynard Keynes 's (1936) refence to Hume as a mercantilist for her claim.  She ignores Smith's subsequent reference to Hume in the Lectures as the one who \"endeavoured to refute\" the mercantilist arguments of Mun, Gee, and Mandeville.  I explain that it was the several self-contradictions and inconsistencies in Hume's 'Of Money\" and \"Of the Balance of Trade\" that prompted Smith's criticisms of him, not because Smith  believed Hume to have been a mercantilist.

          "abstract": "Defining and measuring rurality is a persistent challenge for researchers and policymakers. Threshold-based classifications often create artificial distinctions, failing to capture the continuous nature of the rural-urban spectrum. The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR) developed by Waldorff (2006) offers a continuous, multi-dimensional measure to address this shortcoming. This paper provides a contemporary validation of the IRR, testing a 2020 version of the index against the 2023 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), the 2024 Urban Influence Codes (UIC), and 2020 Decennial Census data on county-level rural population. Using ordered logistic regression, the IRR was found to be a highly statistically significant predictor of both RUCC and UIC classifications, explaining approximately 21% and 15% of their respective variances. Linear regression analysis revealed that the percentage of a county's rural population accounts for a substantial 57.4% of the variance in the multi-dimensional IRR score. These findings confirm that nearly two decades after its inception, the IRR remains a robust and relevant tool. It aligns closely with official governmental classifications while offering a more granular, multi-faceted perspective on rurality, underscoring its continued value for research and policy analysis.",

(b) Are there variations in total intergenerational social class mobility between countries and regions?\n We analyzed 50.000 vital registers for 3 countries on total, upward, downward and sectorial mobility. In the country for which we presently arguably have the best data, France, the rate of intergenerational mobility increased, albeit irregularly from the 1720s until 1850 (actually until the end of the twentieth century, as we showed in another stud). For the German and Swedish places, no clear picture can yet be observed: total mobility trajectories vary among places and over time, as do upward and downward mobility. Sweden stands out by a relatively high rate of downward mobility, mostly consisting of farmers’ sons becoming farm laborers. More than expected, however, sons with fathers from outside the farming class succeeded in becoming a farmer. Barriers between the sectors seem to have been weak in Sweden.\nWe can draw two broad conclusions. The first is that pre-modern social class structures were not as stable as either modernization or status maintenance theories claim. The second is that in the case of France, for which we have excellent long-term records, even the major shock of the French Revolution and its aftermath did not cause an observable Sorokin effect for men.",

Though prior research links national news reporting and administrative decisions, little is known about regional variation, an important omission because regional media produces more local news. I argue that street-level bureaucrats are embedded within a regional news environment, where reporting shapes their perception of regional immigration patterns and influences their decisions on public service allocation—a dynamic I term the regional media bias mechanism. To examine this phenomenon, I combine state-level data on benefit reduction rates in Germany’s welfare program Citizen’s Benefit with regional newspaper articles (2010-2020). Leveraging topic modeling and panel data analysis, I show that regional narratives on positive aspects of immigration are associated with more favorable administrative outcomes for immigrants, whereas frames emphasizing financial burdens correspond with stricter treatment. These results highlight the critical role of regional media in shaping policy implementation.",

Through a qualitative exploratory perspective, the aim is to discuss the role of artificial intelligence in the development of smart cities, exploring the limits and justifications for decision-making in ethical and explainable AI models. The results indicate that although such models\ncontribute to creating a more equitable and responsible urban environment, the justification for certain machine choices is still shrouded in algorithmic opacity. In the meantime, it is concluded that the adoption of explainable AI can be a tool for transparency and security in decisions in smart cities but does not exempt the need to adopt other criteria to justify certain choices.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces the Principle of Economic Entropy Increase to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of economic growth: through the expansion of scale and diversification of structure, economic systems overcome both quantitative and structural forms of scarcity. Building on the concept of economic entropy, the study develops a dual-dimensional model—scale entropy and structural entropy—to enable the quantitative assessment of entropy dynamics within economic systems. Economic entropy increase originates from the system’s intrinsic structural demands and determines the macro trajectory of institutional evolution. Accordingly, this paper is the first to propose and systematically demonstrate the core proposition that the market economy constitutes the fundamental trajectory of economic evolution. Market economies, with their superior self-organizing and adaptive capacities, embody high-entropy structures; in contrast, planned economies, constrained by “long-chain interventions” that crowd out market mechanisms, exhibit low-entropy structures and are ultimately to be superseded. This framework offers a new lens for understanding economic growth, institutional selection, and the evolution of complex systems, with significant implications for policy design and economic governance.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning are widely utilized and offer significant benefits in various fields of knowledge, including healthcare. However, there is an important barrier to disseminating machine learning among healthcare professionals, which primarily stems from their unfamiliarity with programming and computing concepts. The development strategy known as 'low-code,' when applied to software development, encompasses frameworks and tools that, in short, make application development more accessible to professional communities. The low-code strategy simplifies the software development process. This strategy is particularly relevant for smart cities that seek to develop approaches that enhance the efficiency, humanity, and sustainability of cities, thereby contributing to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article positions the low-code strategy, implemented through the PyCaret framework, as a key element of innovation and contribution to the development of health systems utilizing machine learning in smart cities. The paper presents the low-code strategy through a case study that evaluates the incidence and correlation of occupational activities with the occurrence of cancer in Brazil using an anomaly detection algorithm. The article's contributions include positioning the low-code strategy as an element of innovation in smart cities and presenting a case study that serves as a reference for developing applications with machine learning in the healthcare sector. The case study presented, in turn, presents a differentiated approach to detecting cancer using an anomaly detection algorithm and reiterates correlations between types of cancer and occupational activities.",

          "abstract": "Drawing on the broad historical trend of power decentralization, this paper proposes the Principle of Power Entropy Increase, introducing the concept of power entropy and its mathematical formulation to systematically illuminate the evolutionary shift of power structures from concentration to dispersion. Power entropy increase is framed as a natural response of social systems to the challenges of power scarcity, structural complexity, and governance pressure—serving as the underlying logic that drives the evolution of public governance toward democratic institutions. On this basis, the paper is the first to advance and rigorously substantiate the theoretical proposition that democracy is the inevitable trajectory of institutional evolution. It contends that democracy is not born of ideological design, but arises as a structurally optimal outcome driven by systemic dynamics—a Nash equilibrium in the context of generalized social games. This principle offers not only a new perspective on political modernization and institutional transition, but also a theoretical foundation and analytical tool for assessing and forecasting transformations in power structures.",

          "authors": "Ruben L. Bach; Christoph Kern",
          "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems increasingly shape decision-making across crucial societal domains, the discourse around fairness in algorithmic systems (fairML) has intensified. Although fairML research is rapidly expanding, contributions from social science, particularly sociology, remain limited. This chapter aims to address this gap by examining fairness in ML through a sociological lens, focusing on the interplay between algorithmic decision-making and social inequality. We argue that fairML frameworks must explicitly distinguish technical fairness—focused on unbiased predictions—from normative justice, which addresses broader ethical and distributive considerations.\nWe identify and discuss five key challenges confronting fairML today: (1) clearly separating fairness and justice, (2) developing more sophisticated measures of vulnerability and protected attributes, (3) incorporating historical disadvantage and social origin into fairness evaluations, (4) assessing unintended social consequences of algorithmic interventions, and (5) empirically investigating stakeholder preferences toward AI systems. By highlighting these sociologically informed challenges, this chapter advocates for a more holistic, context-sensitive approach to algorithmic fairness. Ultimately, our analysis proposes a sociologically grounded research agenda aimed at critically assessing and enhancing the role of fairML in either perpetuating or alleviating social inequalities.",

          "authors": "Pascal König",
          "abstract": "A key challenge with artificial intelligence (AI) is to design systems that people can safely trust. A central goal in this regard is to calibrate trust, i.e., to align people’s trust with the “actual trustworthiness” of AI systems. The present article argues that we should refrain from using the concept of actual trustworthiness. Leveraging philosophical pragmatism and phenomenological thought, it shows why the ideas of actual trustworthiness and calibrated trust are not only epistemologically but also ethically problematic. “Actual trustworthiness” recasts the question of whether an agent deserves trust – which has a normative dimension – into a question of factual correctness. It also draws humans in the same behavioural framework as machines, treating the relation between AI trustworthiness and human trust as something that is calculable – rather than subject to deliberation. Beyond leading us astray in our language use, this can serve to reduce the space for human autonomy.",

          "abstract": "Empirical social networks are characterized by a high degree of triadic closure (i.e.,\ntransitivity, clustering), whereby network neighbors of the same individual are also likely to\nbe directly connected. It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form\nsuch ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se or from other processes, such as homophily and\nmore opportunities for exposure. These are difficult to disentangle in many settings, but in\nsocial media not only can they be decomposed, but platforms frequently make decisions that\ndepend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we\nrandomize the existing network structure that a user faces when followed by a target account\nthat we control, and we examine whether they reciprocate this tie formation. Being randomly\nassigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie\nformation by 35%. Through the use of multiple control conditions in which the relevant tie is\nabsent (never existent or removed), we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that\nindicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure\nshould be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and we find larger effects when the\nsubject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial\nrole for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what\nmight be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these\ntendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and\ninformation diffusion in online networks.",

          "abstract": "Psychometric and moral benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate large language models (LLMs), aiming to measure their capabilities, surface implicit biases, and assess alignment with human values. However, interpreting LLM responses to these benchmarks is methodologically challenging, a nuance often overlooked in existing literature. We empirically demonstrate that LLM responses to a standard psychometric benchmark (generalized trust from the World Values Survey) correlate strongly with known survey results across language communities. Critically, we observe LLMs achieve this while explicitly referencing known survey results and the broader literature, even without direct prompting. We further show these correlations can be amplified or effectively eliminated by subtle changes in evaluation task design, revealing that replicating known results does not validate LLMs as naive subjects. Given LLMs' access to relevant literature, their ability to replicate known human behavior constitutes an invalid evaluation for assessing the suitability of large language models as naive subjects. Fascinating though it may be, this ability provides no evidence of generalizability to novel or out-of-sample behaviors. We discuss implications for alignment research and benchmarking practices.",

We found that, while much war-related academic debate focuses on questions of territory, questions of land are actively debated in Ukrainian media. Land is represented as a symbol of collective suffering and an archive of violence, but also a symbol of regenerative capacity and recovery. Land damage and recovery are related to various economic, environmental, social and health issues with implications for present and future generations. While environmental concerns risk being sidelined in the face of other urgent war-related issues, particularly their long-term implications, are emphasised as important. Beyond covering relatively obvious damages, media articles address underlying and complex issues of environmental degradation and recovery, which seems critical given the land-related challenges in Ukraine today.",

Through a mixed-methods approach combining data on 56,680 successful and unsuccessful grant applications submitted to the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and 45 interviews with past members of review committees, we analyse how language intersects with knowledge hierarchies and disciplinary cultures. Our findings show that writing a grant proposal in English rather than in French is associated with slightly higher chances of securing funding, mostly reflecting the greater recognition of applicants who have published in prestigious anglophone journals. However, the worth of this linguistic capital varies significantly across disciplines. These differences stem from how each discipline defines scientific value—whether through a more universal or context-dependent perspective and according to singular or plural hierarchies.",

This report details the foundational and evolving regulations governing electric vehicle (EV) charging in Spain. Key legislative instruments, such as Ley 24/2013, recognize energy recharging services, while Royal Decree-Law 21/2021 mandates charging infrastructure deployment in commercial buildings. Royal Decree 184/2022 regulates energy recharging services, emphasizing interoperability and data submission, further enhanced by Royal Decree- Law 4/2024, which underpins data transparency through the REVE map. The MOVES III program provides significant financial incentives, including a requirement for \"intelligent functionalities\" in business charging points . For V2G, Order ITU/1475/2024 establishes rigorous metrological accuracy standards for bidirectional energy transfer, requiring dual recorders . Technical standards like ISO 15118 are crucial for V2G communication and interoperability . Royal Decrees 1183/2020 and 647/2020 streamline administrative procedures and technical requirements for energy storage and grid connection, which are applicable to V2G systems. The Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC) is actively working to integrate new market participants, such as independent aggregators, and has introduced \"Flexible Access Capacity\" to enhance grid flexibility . Despite substantial progress, challenges include regulatory uncertainty, grid integration complexities, high initial costs, and the need for clearer market adaptation and compensation mechanisms for V2G .

Victim-abusers dyads were successfully randomised at court in 85% of cases and the deterrence message was delivered to the intervention group in 83% of cases, half of which were in court and half of which were via telephone or post. All eligible victims were offered the alarm by a police domestic abuse liaison officer, but fewer than 10% accepted the alarm. No statistically significant difference was observed in rates of order breach or domestic abuse crimes across conditions. Randomisation and delivery of deterrence messaging by police in court combined with the offer of an AREDAA alarm to victims was determined to be feasible, but intervention fidelity was dependent on perpetrator attendance at court and victim support for domestic violence protection orders, both of which were low.",

          "abstract": "Despite being widely regarded as effective labor market policies, the impact of job search services on employment remains contested. Recent research challenges the assumption that the intensity of such programs is directly related with its effectiveness. We evaluate the effects of two treatments of an Italian active labour market program called Assegno per il Lavoro. Each intervention is made up of a voucher to fund job search assistance and a performance-based payment related to job search intermediation. Participants are assigned to a certain group with a certain treatment endowment that is increasing as a function of a scoring variable. Leveraging this design, we applied a regression discontinuity analysis to estimate effects on both employment duration and employment quality. First, being assigned to an intermediate-dose treatment slightly increased the probability of finding an open-ended employment, but this did not generate an increment in the average of days worked. Second, being assigned to a high-dose treatment only augmented the mean and the median of the distribution of days worked during the second semester and it did with a greater prevalence of short temporary contracts. Third, different treatment assignments barely changed the reception of job search assistance, so the impacts stem from job search intermediation. The main policy implication is a shift from a focus on intensity to a focus on other design features.",

          "authors": "WEI MENG",
          "abstract": "This study proposes a set of AI-driven frameworks for conducting visual modeling and probabilistic simulation of strategic pathways in cross-strait unification scenarios focusing on the Taiwan Strait issue. The model incorporates Bayesian networks to capture causal dependencies among key variables such as economic integration, political reconfiguration, military deterrence, and international intervention; employs Markov chains to simulate the evolution of long-term social opinion in Taiwan; and evaluates optimal unification strategies under multiple scenarios via a decision tree algorithm. The framework also introduces system dynamics techniques and advanced visualization tools to enhance the interpretability and decision support functions of the model.The quantitative simulation results show that economic dependence is the core driving force for peaceful unification. When Taiwan's economic dependence on China exceeds 60%, the probability of peaceful unification rises to over 70% within 20 years. Sustained military deterrence significantly reduces the likelihood of direct external intervention, and the probability of successful military unification is significantly higher in a scenario where the U.S. and Japan's military response is limited. The study also finds that a shift in the island's political ecology is crucial: the dominance of pro-continental parties increases the probability of reunification by more than 30%.In terms of short-term unification strategies (within 5 years), simulation results show that the probability of successful unification can be over 85% if high-intensity military pressure, economic blockade and political polarization are adopted, and the U.S. and Japan's military intervention is effectively blocked. However, such strategies come with significant geopolitical risks.

          "authors": "Yusuf Ercan ÖZERCAN",
          "abstract": "This article provides an in-depth legal analysis of the current regulatory landscape governing Smart Charging (V1G) and Bidirectional Charging (V2G) of electric vehicles within the European Union and specifically in Spain. Focusing exclusively on the legal and policy dimensions, it examines key EU directives and regulations, such as the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) and relevant provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive, that establish the foundational requirements for smart charging capabilities and pave the way for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration. The research further delves into the transposition and implementation of these EU mandates into Spanish national law, identifying specific legislative measures, policy initiatives, and regulatory challenges pertinent to the deployment and operation of V1G and V2G technologies in the Spanish energy market. The analysis highlights the evolving legal obligations and opportunities for various stakeholders, including grid operators, charging point operators, and EV owners, as these technologies become increasingly central to grid flexibility and the broader energy transition. Technical aspects of charging are deliberately excluded to maintain a clear focus on the legal and regulatory implications.",

          "authors": "Jeehaan Algaraady; Mohammad Mahyoob",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Post-editing plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of machine-generated translation (MGT) by correcting errors and ensuring cohesion and coherence. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4o offer promising capabilities for post-editing tasks. This study investigates the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4o as a natural language processing tool in post-editing Arabic translations across various domains, aiming to evaluate its performance in improving productivity, accuracy, consistency, and overall translation quality.\n\nMethods: The study involved a comparative analysis of Arabic translations generated by Google Translate. These texts, drawn from multiple domains, were post-edited by two professional human translators and ChatGPT-4o. Subsequently, three additional professional human post-editors evaluated both sets of post-edited outputs. To statistically assess the differences in quality between humans and ChatGPT-4o post-edits, a paired t-test was employed, focusing on metrics such as fluency, accuracy, coherence, and efficiency.\n\nResults: The findings indicated that human post-editors outperformed ChatGPT-4o in most quality metrics. However, ChatGPT-4o demonstrated superior efficiency, yielding a positive t-statistic of 8.00 and a p-value of 0.015, indicating a statistically significant difference. Regarding fluency, no significant difference was observed between the two methods (t-statistic = −3.5, p-value = 0.074), suggesting comparable performance in ensuring the natural flow of text.\n\nDiscussion: ChatGPT-4o showed competitive performance in English-to-Arabic post-editing, particularly in producing fluent, coherent, and stylistically consistent text. Its conversational design enables efficient and consistent editing across various domains. Nonetheless, the model faced challenges in handling grammatical and syntactic nuances, domain-specific idioms, and complex terminology, especially in medical and sports contexts. Overall, the study highlights the potential of ChatGPT-4o as a supportive tool in translation post-editing workflows, complementing human translators by enhancing productivity and maintaining acceptable quality standards.",

          "abstract": "It has been well-established that central bank policy agendas are shaped by the spread of ideas, individual governors’ agency and economic and political pressures. However, in the case of the European Central Bank (ECB) the influence of the multi-level set-up of the Eurosystem consisting of both the ECB and National Central Banks (NCBs) is often not considered. How does this peculiar institutional setup shape the agenda? This study argues that NCBs act as intermediaries, channeling national and public priorities to the ECB level. Using a transformer model, alongside sequence and cross-sectional time-series analyses of ECB and NCB speeches from 1997 to 2024, I find that the ECB agenda and issue-responsiveness vis-a-vis `new' topics are driven primarily by NCBs. By revealing how NCBs shape what and when the ECB talks about certain topics, I also contribute more broadly to implications of the multi-level structure of the EU as well as how independent central banks and international organisations respond to outside pressures.",

In light of the state of research on the relationship between financialization, democracy, and social conditions, it appears plausible that the processes of financialization, which contributed to the emergence of a crisis, were influenced by the financial crisis but not completely reversed. The changes in financial market regulation, which were implemented in response to the crisis, did not create pressure for a redesign of the financial system. Therefore, one cannot deduce a significant turning point in financial market regulation from the reform measures taken. However, there are clear indications that the financial crisis has had a lasting impact on the European integration process, trust in democracy, and the political culture. Accordingly, the financial crisis can be seen as a turning point in history, primarily due to its effects on social areas beyond the financial system.",

          "abstract": "With the expected rise in unpaid caregiving, many caregivers will have to combine care with employment. While most research finds negative spill-overs between caregiving and employment, it is crucial to understand the factors under which caregiving has positive spill-over effects. Analyzing Dutch retrospective data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social science (3,543 caregiving situations of 2,042 caregivers), this study examined how factors from the work environment and the caregiving situation are related to two positive spill-overs, namely learned skills from caregiving for paid work and employment being a relief from caregiving. Results from multilevel models show that a working environment with high flexibility compared to no flexibility was related to more skill learning and relief. Further, we found that more understanding of the manager and colleague was related to learning skills, while the manager and colleagues knowing about caregiving was linked to feeling relief. More diverse caregiving tasks were associated with more skills learned for paid work and more relief felt. These findings can guide state or firm-based policies to not only prevent negative but also foster positive spill-overs.\nKeywords: informal care, employment, work-care",

(1) I reveal that the heavy-chemical industrial policies promoted the expansion and dynamic comparative advantage of directly targeted industries. (2) Using variation in exposure to policies through the input-output network, I demonstrate that policy indirectly benefited downstream users of targeted intermediates.

          "abstract": "The proper mathematical proof of Riemann’s hypothesis (RH) in Hilbert mathematics is suggested. It follows the methodological and philosophical considerations in Part I of the paper. Riemann’s zeta function is continued “physically” at its single and simple pole conventionally to be square integrable there (though not being analytical only there) and thus everywhere on the complex plane in order to be interpreted as a wave function (though with a singularity at the pole, and thus generalizing the Hilbert - Polya conjecture’s viewpoint). Therefore, (s) is interpreted physically corresponding to some quantum state described by it  This allows for applying the Noether (1918) first theorem after its reformulation by means of the newly introduced “nonstandard bijection” meaning the mapping of any mathematical structure and its nonstandard model after the Löwenheim - Skolem theorem. Then, the additive semigroup of its trivial zeros implies for all nontrivial zeros to share the critical line (i.e. proving RH) furthermore reasoning the reciprocity of the former generator “2” and the constant “½” of “Re(s) = ½”. That approach for proving RH implies as “byproducts” also: the fundamentally random (GUE) distribution of all nontrivial zeros due to “nonstandard bijection”; the generalization of the axiom of induction to a conservation low as for the set-theoretical “continuation” of arithmetic (thus from the axiom of induction the axiom of infinity); the generalization of the Noether theorem in a few consecutive levels reaching even to set theory and the foundations of mathematics (after Hilbert arithmetic and ontomathematics). An idea for proving Goldbach’s conjecture in Hilbert arithmetic (in a forthcoming paper) is reasoned as a corollary from the same approach for proving RH.",

The findings demonstrate that discussions in both communities there are strong patterns of a collecitve social identity, despite the anonymous environment. The ways in which resistance is understood differs, with r/antiwork engaging in more radical and explicit discourses, and r/TwoXchromosomes being more focused on traditional activism, legal and political reform. Discussions in both spaces have a high degree of semantic similarity. \n\nBased on these results, we argue that social identity salience plays a crucial role in shaping discussions in online resistance communities. This finding is particularly valuable in the field of digital participation, by offering a lens through which online civic and political engagement can be better understood both as a medium of discussing resistance practices, and as a practice of everyday resistance itself.",

First, they can produce multi-horizon forecasts and probabilistic predictions, offering a flexible and nonparametric approach. Second, they can incorporate time-invariant covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series which allows to identify globally important variables, persistent temporal patterns, and significant events. Third, this approach puts a strong focus on interpretability so that we can investigate temporal dynamics more thoroughly.

This framework challenges traditional approaches to vocabulary instruction that emphasize rote memorization and proposes alternative methodologies based on conceptual understanding and meaningful networking of lexical items.",

Drawing on a rich but dispersed body of literature, the book traces how economists progressively gained authority through the establishment of statistics departments, the adoption of macroeconometric models, and the emergence of a shared cognitive infrastructure between academia and central banks. Rather than focusing on individuals or doctrines, it examines general trends and institutional shifts across a series of national case studies to show how central banks function as boundary organizations, at the intersection of policy and science.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the Buddhist cosmology and dialectical materialism, focusing on the philosophical nature of karmic emptiness and aalaya-vijbana (Arya Consciousness), and to examine the challenges posed by the development of quantum mechanics to the traditional dialectical materialist view of matter, and whether Buddhist philosophy can provide a rational explanation. whether Buddhist philosophy can provide a rational explanation. Through conceptual analysis, literature study, logical reasoning and exploratory research, we systematically sort out the Buddhist concept of “emptiness”, the theory of karma and its relationship with materialism, and analyze its impact on traditional philosophical concepts in light of the latest research on the relationship between consciousness and matter in the experiments of quantum mechanics. It is found that “karmic emptiness” can be reasonably explained in the framework of material dialectics, that is, things and phenomena are formed by the aggregation of karmic conditions, neither having fixed entities nor changing with the change of conditions, while “Kṛṣṇa” can be interpreted as the origin of the world, whose The abstract materiality is consistent with the dialectical materialist view of matter, while the concrete form (the “acted dharma”) embodies the diversity and change of matter. In addition, the study reveals that the Buddhist division of the world - ubiquity (the world of subjective illusion), etativity (the world of objective phenomena), and fulfillment (the world of objective essence) - fits to some extent with the epistemology of Marxist philosophy, both of which Both believe that human cognition is limited by the construction of subjective consciousness and that it is difficult to exhaust the nature of the objective world. The study ultimately concludes that the materiality of Kṛṣṇa can serve as the basis for the unity of the world, that “karmic emptiness” embodies the temporal and dependent nature of material forms, and that the cosmology of Buddhism and the epistemology of dialectical materialism can, to a certain extent, mirror each other and together promote a deeper understanding of the nature of the world.",

          "title": "Evaluating the Role of Social Capital in Post-Disaster Agricultural Recovery Using Satellite Remote Sensing",
          "authors": "Yuhei Yamaguchi; Lyu Zeyu",
          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of social capital on disaster mitigation and recovery in agriculture. Agriculture not only serves as a means of food production but also provides various ecosystem services to human society. Human society relies on these ecosystem services, and for the realization of a sustainable society, it is essential that agriculture continues even after disasters. This study focused on the role of social capital in disaster mitigation and recovery. Social capital is known to contribute to population recovery and improvements in mental health after disasters. However, its relationship with the recovery of industries such as agriculture has not been extensively studied. This study examines the impact of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the Noto Peninsula, Japan on January 1, 2024. Using satellite remote sensing, we quantified the effects of the disaster on rice paddy utilization at a micro-geographic level and explored its relationship with social capital. Specifically, we used the annual frequency of village meetings as the proxy variable for social capital and analyze whether differences in meeting frequency influenced post-disaster rice paddy utilization based on a kernel matching with Gaussian process regression. Controlling for potential confounding variables, we found no significant difference in rice paddy utilization associated with variations in meeting frequency. Although social capital is widely regarded as an important factor for disaster mitigation and recovery, our analysis did not find a significant association between social capital and the recovery or mitigation of agricultural land use. This study not only contributes to the theoretical development of social capital but also serves as a pioneering example of applying satellite remote sensing in social science research, demonstrating the significance of this innovative methodology.",

          "abstract": "Fearon (1995) and Kalyvas (2006) are arguably the most influential contributions to conflict studies in recent decades. However, scholars tend to use their models separately—Fearon’s for conflicts between armed groups and Kalyvas’ for violence against civilians—overlooking how they could speak to each other. We propose a model that unifies these classical theories. The new model, Fearon-Kalyvas model, highlights the crucial role of the relative efficacy of battles and violence. When fighting has better prospects than violence, armed groups attack their adversaries, thereby avoiding intermediate territorial control and violence. Thus, contrary to Kalyvas (2006), intermediate territorial control does not necessarily result in violence. Theoretically, this suggests that the “cost of peace”—maintaining control through violence—can result in a bargaining failure and battle. Empirically, our model implies a selection bias; territorial control is endogenous to the efficacy of violence, and this endogeneity can bias naïve regression estimates.",

          "authors": "Shigenori Tanaka",
          "abstract": "Formulaic language is as important as vocabulary and grammar. Formulaic expressions abound alongside free expressions, and second language teachers are increasingly aware that more pedagogical attention should be paid to the area of formulas. In other words, formulaic competence is another competence that should be added to lexical and grammatical competences to fully describe the L2 learner's language resources. This paper provides the notion of formulaic competence with two new points. One point is related to the stockroom view, and the other point, to the flow view. We argue that when the second language learner develops formulas in his or her stockroom, the stock should not be a random list of expressions but should be organized into a network. Networking goes beyond classifying. This is the first point. A vast stock of expressions does not, however, fully explain the language user's formulaic competence. We claim that the flow view of formulaic expressions should be considered. With the flow view, which sees the use of formulas in a flowing stream of communication, we can identify four primary functions of formulaic language: expressive optimality, constructive easiness, discourse navigation, and formulaic chaining. This is the second point. In this paper, we define formulaic competence as the ability to effectively develop, organize, and deploy formulaic expressions in second language use. It encompasses two critical dimensions: (1) the organization of formulaic expressions into interconnected networks rather than random lists in the learner's mental stockroom, going beyond mere classification; and (2) the dynamic utilization of these expressions within the flowing stream of communication, serving four primary functions: expressive optimality, constructive easiness, discourse navigation, and formulaic chaining. This comprehensive view of formulaic competence provides a foundation for teaching formulas in a principled manner to second language learners.",

          "authors": "Saira Mirza",
          "abstract": "This chapter examines the intersecting psychosocial phenomena that shape the lives of South Asians in the UK within their complex bioecological systems, informed by their distinct social, cultural, historical, and political contexts. Under the lenses of intersectional feminism and post-colonial theory, the chapter explores the interplay between caste, migration and group dynamics, revealing caste as not only a social structure but also a deeply internalised belief system that influences individual behaviour, identity, and well-being. Advantaged and disadvantaged castes internalise superiority or inferiority respectively, through experiences of shame and intergenerational trauma, creating a sense of ‘otherness’ that polarises the group. This internalisation exacerbates socioeconomic divisions and mental health challenges, further entrenching disparities and creating an intragroup polarisation. The complexities of acculturation in post-colonial Britain further complicate caste dynamics as individuals navigate between traditional identities and the pressures of integration into a multicultural society. The chapter argues for the need for decolonised strategies that challenge these entrenched systems. It highlights the importance of re-education, open dialogue, and decolonised therapeutic practices in addressing caste-based trauma and promoting empowerment, self-actualisation, and collective resistance across generations.",

By conceptualizing thought as a four-dimensional process that encompasses depth, breadth, connectivity, and temporal evolution, this framework offers a more holistic alternative to traditional thinking paradigms. Each dimension represents a distinct cognitive approach: Diving Thinking (vertical exploration), Expanding Thinking (horizontal extension), Networking Thinking (relational connection), and Flowing Thinking (temporal adaptation). When orchestrated together, these modes create a dynamic, adaptive, and integrative thinking system that can address complex challenges across various domains.",

Degrowth challenges the dominant paradigm of\ncontinuous economic growth by emphasizing ecological limits, social equity, and reductions\nin material throughput. Drawing from interdisciplinary sources in ecological economics,\nenergy law, and sustainability science, the paper critiques the limitations of growth-oriented\npolicies embedded in EU strategies such as the European Green Deal, bioeconomy policy,\nand cohesion funds.

The analysis also reviews policy proposals from recent degrowth scholarship—such as\nsufficiency-oriented energy laws, redistributive taxation, and consumption reduction\nstrategies—that align with ecological justice and legal principles like the right to a healthy\nenvironment. Ultimately, the paper argues for the integration of degrowth principles into EU\nlaw, proposing a transition toward a \"rule of ecological law\" to ensure human activities\nremain within planetary boundaries while promoting socioecological equity.

          "authors": "Sascha Riaz; Maik Hamjediers",
          "abstract": "We study bias in judicial authorities' efforts to rehabilitate and reintegrate immigrant offenders into society. Our empirical strategy leverages a unique feature of the German criminal code: the optional application of rehabilitative juvenile criminal law or punitive general criminal law for 18-20-year-old offenders, based on a subjective assessment of offenders' psychological `maturity' by judges. Drawing on complete records of 792,000 court hearings between 2009 and 2018, we show that immigrant offenders are about ten percentage points less likely to be sentenced under juvenile law compared to natives convicted for the same crime. The immigrant-native gap in rehabilitative justice correlates with anti-immigrant sentiment across space and has spiked in recent years, suggesting a link between the salience of group-based identities and judicial decision-making. Our findings raise concerns about equal legal treatment and highlight that biases in the application of rehabilitative justice may contribute to higher recidivism rates among immigrant offenders.",

          "abstract": "Communal violence remains a pervasive yet understudied form of political violence, often overshadowed by civil wars and electoral conflicts. Although improvements in the quality and accessibility of event data have enabled more systematic and comparative research, significant biases and discrepancies persist. A key obstacle to advancing the field has been the lack of conceptual clarity and standardized coding practices, which hampers comparison of findings. We develop a crisp definition of communal violence and operationalize it with a novel keyword-based coding methodology. Drawing on fieldwork- generated knowledge, we foreground the practices, along with the issues, identities and actors involved. Hence, we focus not only on the ‘who’ but more importantly on the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of communal violence. Applying our method to the case of Nigeria, we generate new insights about the geography and trends of communal violence and their interaction with other forms of armed violence. Our findings underscore that dataset choice and coding rules can lead to rather different conclusions about the scale and impact of ‘local violence’. Our transparent and adaptable coding scheme offers a replicable framework for analyzing communal violence across diverse contexts and datasets.",

          "abstract": "This book presents a theory of theory building and testing that builds on insights in Lipton’s 2004 book Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE).  The new theory, called IBET (short for Inference-to-the-Best-Explanation Theory of theory building and testing), is presented and compared to three rival theories from the social sciences in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 discusses various philosophical issues and underpinnings of IBET, including sections on induction, abduction, causality, and differences between the Philosophy of Science and Social Science literatures on theory building. Chapter 3 presents details and test results from a qualitative empirical test of IBET that examined 41 cases of theory building and testing by recent Nobel prize-winners, 15 from Economics and 26 from Physics.  The conclusions were that (a) there was very strong support for IBET, and (b) this support probably generalizes to all theory building in both Economics and Physics, and (with less confidence) to all scientific theory building.  Then, since Salmon’s criticism of Lipton’s claims about the merits of IBE poses a major threat to IBET, Chapter 4 presents a possible behavioural explanation and reconciliation of Salmon’s and Lipton’s conflicting views on IBE.  Finally, Chapter 5 illustrates many of the issues discussed in the book by presenting a detailed example of one of the author’s attempts at theory building.",

          "abstract": "This article explores the geopolitical implications of China’s introduction of RMB-denominated oil futures contracts, framed through the lens of ‘power-as-autonomy’. It argues that this development marks a strategic shift in the global energy landscape, particularly within the highly dollarized oil market, where pricing and trade have historically been dominated by USD-denominated benchmarks - such as Brent and WTI. By seeking to create a parallel financial infrastructure, also manifested through these RMB-denominated oil futures contracts, China is pursuing a ‘de-dollarization’ strategy aimed at enhancing its autonomy from the United States (US). Through the examination of four key geopolitical outcomes of these RMB-denominated oil futures contracts - enhancing internationalization of the RMB, the reduction of the ‘Asian premium’ in crude oil markets, strengthened energy and financial security for China, and resistance to potential US-led sanctions - this article situates China’s efforts within the larger framework of geopolitical competition between the US and China, highlighting how this shift may reshape international trade relationships and challenges the dominance of dollarized markets.",

We argue that there are serious legal, ethical, and practical pitfalls associated with the informal dissemination of DHS data. While the future of existing DHS datasets remains in flux with many stakeholders interested in preserving this resource, the global health and demographic research community should diversify its use of data sources, invest in strengthening data infrastructure in LMICs, and share data management and use practices publicly to accelerate research progress.",

          "authors": "Carlo Drago; Alberto Costantiello; Massimo Arnone; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper explores the correlation between financial inclusion and the Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects of sustainable development for a big panel of 103 developing nations over 12 years. Financial inclusion as a measure is taken through the Account Age variable capturing adults having access to formal financial institutions as a percentage. The analysis revolves around the three main ESG pillars each through panel data regressions complemented by instrumental variable (IV) approaches in addressing endogeneity concerns. In the Environment (E) dimension, we find conventional agricultural forms (e.g., extensive agricultural land areas and agriculture value added) as having a negative effect on financial inclusion, but the environmental modernization proxies—renewable energy utilization, food production, climate resilience, and areas under protection—exhibit positive and significant correlations. In the Social (S) dimension, development indicator variables like spending on education, internet penetration, life years at birth, sanitation, and gender equity emerge as strong predictors of higher financial inclusion, and labor market participation is found to have a negative effect, possibly due to the dynamics of employment in the informal sector. The Governance (G) analysis shows positive correlation with controlling corruption and innovation production (applications for patents) as arguments for increased financial access improving institutional transparency and economic ingenuity and a negative correlation with regulatory quality as a concern for capacity gaps in rapidly digitizing economies. Through the means of ESG-matched environmental instruments, this paper presents a unique cross-dimensional approach to sustainable finance and shows through counterfactual analysis under both average and counterfactual distributions that policies supporting financial inclusion can be a path to multiple benefits on the environmental sustainability, social equity, and governance effectiveness axes—key requirements for the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Global South.",
