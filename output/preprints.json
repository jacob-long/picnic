          "authors": "Zezhong Wang; Sheelagh Carpendale",
          "abstract": "We explore input data comics as a medium to foster active engagement with data input through visual storytelling. They integrate the richness of human experience, narrative, and visual communication into the data collection process, producing contextualized narratives. Through three examples, we illustrate how input data comics foster engagement, support interpretation, and create space for participatory storytelling experiences between the comic creator and the audience. We explore seven purposes through which input data comics can transform data into participatory and reflective experiences. These purposes parallel those of input visualizations: Individual Reflection, Public Group Reflection, Public Activity Documentation, Data Discussion, Survey, Planning, and Organizing. This suggests the broad potential applications of input data comics in the future.",

          "abstract": "The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE), one of the most widely consumed media products in the world, has evolved from a podcast with comedic roots to a platform of political significance. The transformation of JRE exemplifies a broader trend of politicization of traditionally apolitical spaces in the United States that may have consequential political implications. To examine this shift and its effects on political outcomes, this paper presents findings from two studies: Study 1 is a content analysis of JRE episodes aired through December 2024 (N = 2,175) that demonstrates a rise in socio-political content on the show. Study 2 draws on a nationally representative survey (N = 1,600) to assess the relationship between JRE exposure and voting behavior in the 2024 presidential election. In light of these findings, we discuss the role of non-traditional media in contemporary politics.",

          "authors": "Salim Ahmad",
          "abstract": "In the digital age, visual storytelling has become a key strategy for brands seeking to establish meaningful connections with their audiences. Instagram, as a visually driven platform, provides an ideal space where images, narratives, and consumer psychology intersect. This paper examines how narrative imagery on Instagram affects brand perceptions by influencing emotional responses, trust, and consumer engagement. Drawing on psychological theories of narrative processing and visual persuasion, the study highlights how cohesive image sequences and symbolic cues construct brand identity and foster authenticity. The findings suggest that brands employing visual storytelling not only capture attention but also encourage deeper cognitive and emotional associations that influence purchase intentions and long-term loyalty. By situating Instagram within broader psychological frameworks, this work underscores the strategic value of narrative images as tools for branding in contemporary digital culture.",

          "abstract": "Scientific research increasingly involves large, multidisciplinary teams networked across multiple institutions to develop new technologies. Despite the rise of complex research networks and big team science, there has been little analysis to date of the ethical challenges facing these networks. The extensive literature on the ethical issues confronting individual researchers and small teams (the micro level) and on the larger societal challenges flowing from research and new technology (the macro level) leave a troubling gap in between, at the meso level of the research network involved in big team science. Yet the ability of complex networks to conduct research ethically – which is essential if the results are to be deemed reliable and trustworthy – depends on recognizing the ethical issues that emerge at this intermediate network level, identifying the values that should guide networks in addressing those issues, and equipping research leaders to build a culture supporting the ethical conduct of research across the laboratories and institutions that comprise the network. This paper calls out the problem, analyzing the gap and recommending next steps.",

          "abstract": "Publication bias poses a serious challenge to the integrity of scientific research and meta-analyses. There exist persistent methodological obstacles for estimating this bias, especially with heterogeneous dataset, where studies vary widely in methodologies and effect sizes. To address this gap, I propose a Likelihood Ratio Test for Publication Bias, a statistical method designed to detect and quantify publication bias in datasets of heterogeneous studies results. I also show the proof-of-concept implementation developed in Python and simulations that evaluate the performance. The results demonstrate that this new method clearly outperforms existing methods like Z-Curve 2 and the Caliper test in estimating the magnitude of publication bias, showing higher precision and reliability. While inherent challenges in publication bias detection remain, such as the influence of different research practices and the need for large sample sizes, the Likelihood Ratio Test offers a significant advancement in addressing these issues.",

          "authors": "Peggy L. St. Jacques",
          "abstract": "Subjective features of memory are often treated as secondary to the objective content of remembered events. However, growing evidence suggests that these features actively shape how memories are constructed, experienced, and used. Rather than treating visual perspective as a peripheral correlate of subjectivity, this review positions it as a key mechanism that shapes the memory. Because perspective can be flexibly controlled and reliably measured, it offers a unique window into how retrieval goals interact with mental simulation to produce vivid and emotionally resonant recollections. Drawing on behavioral and neuroimaging research, this review shows that visual perspective determines the spatial framing of memory, and the emotional and sensory qualities of recollection. Focusing on the posterior parietal cortex, it outlines distinct roles for the angular gyrus (AG) and the precuneus in supporting perspective-dependent retrieval. The AG contributes to the selection and maintenance of a retrieval perspective, integrating perceptual and conceptual features into a coherent scene. In contrast, the precuneus supports spatial transformation and modulates the vividness, emotional tone, and embodied character of recollection, particularly when individuals recall events from a non-dominant or shifted perspective. Together, these findings position visual perspective as a central mechanism in the construction of subjectivity. Understanding how perspective shapes the process of remembering provides insight into how memory supports emotion regulation, mental simulation, and the continuity of the self across time.",

          "authors": "Jessica Daphne Ayers; Diego Guevara Beltran; Denise Mercado; Athena Aktipis",
          "abstract": "Friendships help people achieve many fundamental adaptive functions. As such, one might theorize that humans are designed to seek out and maintain as many friendships as possible. However, with time and energy as finite resources, humans face a unique challenge in determining the number of friendships they can sustain - do they prioritize maximizing friendship quantity (potentially at the expense of investment in each friend, thus compromising friendship quality), or do they prioritize friendship quality (potentially at the expense of friendship quantity)? Here, we introduce the novel concept of friendship promiscuity – an individual difference in preference for a wide friendship network and desire for friendship intimacy – and develop a tool for measuring this trait. Across 5 studies (NTotal = 5,707), we created and confirmed the Friendship Promiscuity Scale’s factor structure, its test-retest reliability, and construct and discriminant validity. Critically, we demonstrate that the scale achieves measurement invariance across three geographically diverse countries and is associated with friend-seeking motivation and behaviors beyond relevant controls. The scale offers a novel method for assessing an unexplored aspe",

          "abstract": "The University of Queensland Video Speed Test (UQVST) has shown validity for measuring speed propensity–a tendency to prefer faster or slower driving speeds. Since the test used driving clips filmed in Australia from the left side of the roadway, the validity of the test for use in samples in the United States is not known. A new United States Video Speed Test (USVST) was developed. The new test used ten video clips, each 8 seconds in duration, which participants viewed before indicating how much slower or faster they would drive in the same scenario. In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers. Males also scored significantly higher on the USVST than females. Collectively, this evidence suggested that the USVST may be a useful tool for measuring speeding propensity.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of human experience is that of being a bounded and embodied agent. This basic sense of self typically operates implicitly, yet traditional contemplative accounts alongside recent work in philosophy, phenomenology and neuroscience suggests that it can be attenuated or even fully dissolved while retaining awareness. Here we present an extended analysis of data from a large-scale neurophenomenological study investigating such minimal modes of awareness, in which 46 long-term meditators alternated between resting-state and meditative conditions of self-boundary (SB) dissolution and maintenance during magnetoencephalography. Results show global increases in broadband entropy rate and directed information transfer in both meditation conditions compared to rest. Spectral decomposition of both measures reveals that broadband effects are driven mostly by high-frequency activity, and that information transfer and entropy rates exhibit qualitatively different spectral patterns. Although these global changes don’t clearly differentiate meditative self-boundary dissolution, localized reductions in information transfer from the anterior cingulate to mid and post cingulate and in high-beta entropy rate in sensorimotor and posterior-medial cortices did differentiate the meditation conditions. Furthermore, a relative reduction of broadband orbitofrontal cortex entropy rate, and broadband information transfer from occipital, cingulate, limbic and subcortical areas, both correlated strongly with SB-dissolution phenomenology. Together with a previously reported neural correlate from the same dataset of reduced high-beta power in the posterior-medial cortex, these two neural correlates synergistically explained over half the variance in phenomenological dissolution scores (R² = 0.52), exhibiting a neurophenomenological association of unprecedented strength. By integrating nuanced phenomenology with multiscale neural metrics, our findings provide novel insight into self-attenuation and advance the empirical investigation of minimal phenomenal experience.",

          "abstract": "The sensitive period for phonetic learning, normally considered to be between 6 to 12 months of age, has been demonstrated as one of the earliest milestones for language development. Infant speech processing towards the end of the sensitive period has been shown to predict individual language development trajectories up to school entry and most recently, risk of speech and language disorders, suggesting its potential clinical relevance. Yet, this literature is largely limited to typically developing infants with regard to their family histories of speech and language delays or disorders. The current study begins to fill the gap by investigating associations between neural markers of the sensitive period, family history risk factors, and language outcomes by gathering extensive information from a large group of infants. Specifically, family information includes an extensive parental survey of family background and clinical history, a comprehensive assessment of language skills for one older sibling by a research speech-language pathologist (SLP), and a daylong audio recording in infants’ homes for assessing their language environment. The study design focuses on comparing neural predictors of language development in infants with or without first-degree family history of speech and language delays and disorders (i.e., High vs. Low-risk infants). Infants’ neural speech processing is measured three times using Magnetoencephalography (MEG) at 6 months, 12 months, and 14 months of age. Infants’ language development is tracked until school entry by both parental surveys (MB-CDI) and the same comprehensive assessment protocol with a research SLP. This protocol documents the study design and methodological details for data collection and preprocessing. This study will allow our research team to start tackling important questions regarding early predictors of speech and language delays and disorders (e.g., late-talking, Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)) and contribute significant value to the broader field.",

          "abstract": "The post-treatment continuation of effective elements, strategies, techniques and behaviors acquired in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a key element of relapse prevention. Research indicates that the quality rather than the quantity of these elements predict therapeutic outcomes in CBT. However, it remains unclear which factors facilitate the post-treatment implementation and continuation of individually helpful elements. This study investigated whether the quality of \"bridging elements\" predicts their implementation in the post-treatment phase. Bridging elements were defined as any element of previous therapy that a patient has experienced as helpful and that helps maintain treatment effects from the patient's perspective after treatment termination. Criteria were derived from the literature to rate the quality of patients' open-ended descriptions of their bridging-elements. A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted with 120 inpatients who had been previously treated with CBT. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that a quality score composed of four quality criteria significantly predicted implementation of bridging elements even after controlling for motivational factors, while none of the single quality criteria alone was predictive at four-month follow-up. Prior to treatment termination individually helpful bridging elements should be identified to foster enduring change. Specific attention should be paid to defining high-quality bridging skills, which should be specific, time-limited, independent from others, action-oriented, measurable, and frequently applicable.",

We conducted a preregistered questionnaire study of 956 participants to examine how vulnerable and grandiose narcissistic traits differ in relation to mentalizing capacity, tendency to trust in socially transmitted information (epistemic trust), belongingness needs, and experiences of internal and external shame. Our findings confirmed hypotheses, differentiating distinct inter- and intrapersonal patterns between narcissistic subtypes: Individuals high in vulnerable narcissism displayed compromised mentalizing and were associated with increased epistemic mistrust and credulity, higher need for belonging, and heightened experiences of internal and external shame. Conversely, grandiose narcissistic traits predicted lower belongingness needs, reduced shame experiences, and higher epistemic mistrust without credulity or clear deficits in mentalizing abilities. These results clarify clinically meaningful distinctions within narcissistic presentations, highlighting vulnerable narcissisms pronounced interpersonal instability and grandiose narcissisms defensive self-regulation. The findings emphasize the importance of differentiating narcissistic subtypes to inform targeted therapeutic strategies addressing specific emotional and relational impairments.",

          "authors": "Norbert Meskó",
          "abstract": "Exploitation is a pervasive yet under-theorized phenomenon shaping interactions from intimate relationships to global institutions. Existing approaches typically examine narrow domains—manipulation in interpersonal contexts, cheating in economic games, or corruption in political systems—without an integrative account. The General Exploitation Theory (GET) addresses this gap by conceptualizing exploitation as a continuum, ranging from benign utilization of opportunities to abusive appropriation that imposes disproportionate costs on others or the environment. This continuum-based approach aligns with dimensional models in psychology and the behavioral sciences. GET advances a bio-psycho-social model in which exploitation emerges through the interplay of evolved biological mechanisms, intrapsychic processes, interpersonal strategies, and societal structures. Reward circuits, hormonal modulation, and cognitive biases may bias individuals toward short-term opportunism; emotions and motivational drives such as envy, greed, and status striving provide proximate energy for exploitative behavior; interpersonal dynamics translate these tendencies into deception, coercion, and betrayal; and societal and institutional arrangements embed exploitation at scale through hierarchies, inequalities, and legitimizing ideologies. Evolutionary theory clarifies its resilience, framing exploitation as a conditional strategy that can yield reproductive or material benefits despite long-term costs. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, GET offers a comprehensive framework for understanding exploitation as an adaptive, multi-level process. This perspective not only explains its persistence but also provides a roadmap for systematic research on mechanisms, variability, and consequences. In doing so, GET positions exploitation as a central construct for the behavioral sciences and a consequential dimension of human nature across levels and contexts and over time worldwide.",

          "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor in the acceptance and safe deployment of automated vehicles (AVs). In recent years, it has remained a prominent topic of discussion, with market data indicating that public trust in these technologies remains suboptimal. As a result, researchers have explored various strategies to enhance trust in AVs. One such strategy involves anthropomorphizing AVs in different modalities, such as adding human-like visual features or human voices. Initially, it was assumed that incorporating anthropomorphic features would enhance trust in AVs. This meta-analysis addresses the role of anthropomorphism in AV trust as a timely response to the ongoing debate. Following PRISMA guidelines, a total of 66 articles and 70 effect sizes from 5903 participants from seven databases were included in this meta-analysis.\nThe results revealed that anthropomorphic interfaces, compared to non-anthropomorphic interfaces, do not significantly improve trust in AVs (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = 0.04, not significant). However, in general, adding auditory anthropomorphic features is recommended for increasing trust compared to visual anthropomorphic features (SMD: 0.30 vs. -0.48). Moreover, different levels of anthropomorphism (superficial vs. deep) did not have a significant impact on trust in AVs.  The overall trend indicated that with increasing age of participants, the reliance on anthropomorphic interfaces for increasing trust became more pronounced.\nThis meta-analysis shows that adding human-like features is not a dependable way to build trust in AVs. Future works are needed on how it can be compared to other approaches like explainability. Generally, as a suggestion for stakeholders, it is important to recognize that the impact of anthropomorphic interfaces on trust in AVs is not the same as assumptions.",

In the study, robust effects were observed, supporting the need for further research in the feasibility and effectiveness of narrative moviola therapy.",

          "abstract": "The COVIS theory of category learning posits separate roles for two different category learning systems. An explicit system mediated by prefrontal regions is involved in learning rule-described categories and an implicit system mediated by the tail of the caudate nucleus is involved in learning non rule-described categories. We conducted two behavioural experiments to validate a carefully controlled categorization task intended to dissociate these explicit and implicit systems. Then we applied fNIRS neuroimaging within-subjects to localize a neuroanatomical dissociation. We localized two effects to R DLPFC (1) a simple single-dissociation of higher activity in RB categorization, and (2) a negative relationship between overall task performance and the magnitude of neural activation. We conclude that explicit and implicit cortical activity are dissociable by neuroimaging, and that fNIRS is a feasible modality to study human categorization.",

          "abstract": "Irony requires listeners to infer that speakers mean the opposite of what they say (e.g., “What a fabulous chef he is” to imply that he cooks poorly), but it remains unclear what interpretative algorithms enable listeners to arrive at stable yet flexible meanings during comprehension. Across four experiments, listeners heard various speakers describe two characters while their eye-movements were measured to these referents. Afterwards, listeners provided judgments about the speaker’s intent. Eye-movements revealed frequency effects for literal but not ironic meanings, systematic reference restriction for ironic but not “opposite” speakers, and late-emerging conflicts between literal and ironic meanings. Judgments revealed intuitions about the pragmatic function of irony and relations to truth conditions. These findings demonstrate that ironic interpretations are not directly retrieved from conventionalized representations in the lexicon. Instead, they involve real-time reasoning about utterance semantics and speaker intentions, and that these dual processes yield distinct signatures during comprehension.",

          "abstract": "Creativity depends on the rapid generation of novel associations and the equally rapid evaluation of their usefulness; yet, prevailing dual-process theories treat these operations as sequential and largely independent. We propose System 3, an integrative cognitive architecture in which intuition-dominated search and analysis-dominated checking are locked into a fast, self-regulating micro-cycle that we call transformative metathought. The model is specified by three behavioral indices—associative-distance density, analytic-verification ratio, and convergence latency—and mapped onto a neural motif in which Default Mode Network (DMN) activity alternates with Central Executive Network (CEN) activity on a sub-second timescale. A review of recent fMRI, EEG, and causal stimulation studies shows that (i) DMN–CEN coupling increases with idea originality, (ii) rapid network switching predicts insight accuracy, and (iii) dual site neuromodulation that balances the two networks boosts creative output without loss of practicality. System 3 also reframes cognitive biases as scalable heuristics that expand the search space when monitored by metacognitive confidence signals, and positions dopamine and serotonin as chemical gain controls on the generate–evaluate loop. Practical applications range from AI assisted ideation and precision neurofeedback to cautious exploration of pharmacological and genetic levers. An ethical framework is proposed to safeguard psychological integrity, authenticity, and equity as such interventions mature. Finally, developmental data suggest that the generative component matures early in adolescence, whereas evaluative gating and full-loop metacognition continue to develop into adulthood, inviting longitudinal tests of the model. System 3 thus offers a falsifiable, multi-level account of creative cognition and a scaffold for responsible enhancement technologies.",

This has sometimes been attributed to age-related change in communication goals, yet little is known about how different age groups modify their discourse style when they have different goals. Here, young and older adults produced discourse on a range of topics, first without specific instructions and then when instructed to be as entertaining or as focused as possible. When aiming to entertain, both age groups spoke more quickly and were less globally coherent, particularly in the later stages of responses. This later decline in coherence was more pronounced in the older group.  These results indicate that deviations from the topic of discussion can stem from a desire to entertain one’s audience. Thus, a shift in communication goals is a viable possible explanation for age-related declines in coherence.",

          "abstract": "Unreliable measurement can lead to lower statistical power, attenuated effect sizes and residual confounding. However, estimating reliability can be challenging for complex cognitive and behavioural assessments without test-retest data. Most statistical methods for assessing reliability with a single test administration are designed for fixed-item questionnaires. We introduce a novel Bayesian procedure called relative measurement uncertainty (RMU) for estimating reliability that can be broadly applied, including to many widely used computational models. Our approach draws pairs of samples from each subject's posterior and calculates the correlation between draws. We demonstrate analytically and via simulation that this method provides accurate reliability estimates and well-calibrated credible intervals across linear factor, signal detection and reinforcement learning models. Simulations found that RMU was more accurate (lower root mean square error) than existing measures (coefficient alpha, coefficient H, split-half), but more importantly, it can be applied across a wide range of computational models. RMU offers a general method for estimating reliability, leveraging the modelling flexibility of Bayesian statistical methods.",

Central tendencies extracted from the clusters at different levels of abstraction revealed featural prototypes and an overall family resemblance structure. To probe the effects of regional context on conceptual structure, we used a subset of participants who were long-term residents of Canada or the United States. We found that prototypical features varied regionally, suggesting an effect of participants’ geographical region on conceptual structure. This work is the first to investigate how people represent settlements as concepts and helps centralize the utility of semantic feature norms in understanding how people collectively think about where they live, and the importance of context effects on representations of settlements.",

Within this framework, yawning—a stereotyped behavior linked to arousal regulation and social contagion—offers a unique opportunity to explore maternal-fetal relationships before birth. While contagious yawning has been extensively studied in postnatal contexts, its presence and developmental role in utero remain unexplored. This study investigated whether fetal yawning behavior is modulated by maternal yawning, suggesting a primitive form of behavioral contagion within the dyad. Thirty-six pregnant participants were exposed to video stimuli designed to elicit yawns, while fetal facial movements were recorded using 2D ultrasound. Maternal and fetal yawning frequencies were analyzed across four conditions: baseline, maternal still-face, maternal mouth opening/closing movements, and maternal yawning. Fetal and maternal time series were further examined using Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), and an LSTM-based neural network was employed for automated behavioral classification. Results showed a significant increase in fetal yawns following maternal yawning, but not during control conditions, indicating selective behavioral responsiveness. CRQA revealed enhanced temporal structure in true mother-fetus dyads compared to shuffled pairs, suggesting non-random coordination. The LSTM model accurately distinguished yawning from other facial actions, supporting the reliability of the behavioral data. These findings provide the first evidence of prenatal yawning contagion and support the notion that behavioral alignment may reflect embodied mechanisms of attunement that precede postnatal social engagement, offering new insights into the developmental origins of intersubjectivity.",

          "abstract": "Semantic-categorically related distractor words slow down picture naming more than unrelated distractor words do (e.g., “dog” vs. “car” for the picture of a horse). This semantic interference effect in the picture-word interference task has been replicated numerous times and is an empirical cornerstone of speech production research. However, picture-picture interference studies in which the distractor words were replaced with distractor pictures have yielded highly inconsistent results, reporting semantic interference, semantic facilitation, and null effects. We present a meta-analytic summary of the published studies. We found the estimated semantic effect to be close to zero (2 ms, 95% CI [-5, 9]). This contrasts with the results of 14 previously unpublished picture-picture interference experiments from our laboratory. Across these experiments, the estimated semantic interference effect was 15 ms (95% CI [9, 21]). When all data were included in a meta-analysis, the pooled estimate was 9 ms (95% CI [4, 14]). This suggests that the magnitude of semantic interference from distractor pictures has been underestimated and that it is not as elusive as previously thought. We conclude that there is no qualitative difference in the semantic effects caused by distractor words and pictures, and we discuss the implications for modelling word production.",

We present three experiments that force us to revise this dual process view. We used a two-response paradigm in which participants had to give their first, initial answer under cognitive load and time pressure. Next, participants could take all the time they wanted to deliberate and select a final answer. This enabled us to identify the intuitively generated response that preceded the final response given after deliberation. Results show that participants do not necessarily need to deliberate to avoid the illusion and that incorrect respondents consistently display error sensitivity (as reflected in decreased confidence), even when deliberation is minimized. Both reasoning performance and error sensitivity in the initial, intuitive stage tended to be driven by the semantic relatedness between the anomalous word (e.g., “Moses”) and the undistorted word (e.g., “Noah”). We show how this leads to a revised model where the response to semantic illusions depends on the interplay of both incorrect and correct intuitions.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is one of our most archaic senses but its central mechanisms are lesser known than those of other senses. In this work, we address a possible link between olfactory stimuli and mental spatial representations. Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction.

Due to inconsistent results in the literature, three experiments investigated the role of statement type and study context as potential moderators. Experiments 1 and 2 examined memory for veracity feedback with comparative statements and definitions—varying within or between participants. Experiment 3 focused on the impact of instructed study goals (preparing for a quiz show vs. learning a foreign language) on participants’ memory for veracity feedback. The results indicated that statement type and study context influenced memory for “true” and “false” feedback. For comparative statements, participants showed symmetric memory for truth and falsity. For definitions, on the other hand, participants remembered truth better than falsity, but only when the statement type was manipulated between participants.\nFurthermore, this effect was amplified by the study instructions. Taken together, these findings challenge traditional models on the mental representation of truth and falsity, which propose a rigid encoding of “false” tags (and “true” tags, respectively). Instead, the results argue for an optional encoding of “true” and “false” tags, which is shaped by the informational value of the different types of veracity feedback in a given study context.",

          "abstract": "Meditative experience has long been associated with conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity to phenomena, increased present moment perception and more pleasant experience. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such meditative “deconstruction” are not well understood, with no formal computational models available to explicate how deconstruction alters perception and action during meditation. Using the active inference framework, I demonstrate that the phenomenology of deconstruction–in terms of conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity and shorter temporal scale perception–naturally emerges from the dynamics of hierarchical inference when the deconstructive notion of letting go is cast as a reduction in belief precision over hidden states at a specific level of the generative model. I present a formal hierarchical three-level generative model and simulate deconstruction as an intervention in a facial recognition task, where the agent selects a letting go policy when perceived affective valence becomes excessively negative. The results demonstrate that the capacity to deconstruct permits agents to self-regulate experienced affect via letting go. I furthermore propose that the proposed letting go mechanism may underlie the emergence of minimal phenomenal experiences such as pure awareness states. The model offers a novel perspective within the paradigm of computational phenomenology on conceptual attenuation, equanimity, stillness and affect during meditative deconstruction.",

We argue that many previous studies supporting this view have significant shortcomings. Specifically, these studies conflate measures of objective performance with those of subjective experience, and cannot exclude the possibility that their observed effects might have been mediated by post-sensory processes instead (e.g., semantics, memory). To address these issues, our paradigm combined elements from two published studies by Sekar et al. (2011) and Lupyan and Ward (2013). Participants (N = 19) observed and rated visual targets of fixed intensity corresponding to their 50% identification threshold; visual targets were preceded by nonpredictive speech cues which matched or mismatched the target. Participants carried out an identification task and rated their subjective experience (“didn’t see”, “couldn’t identify”, “unsure”, and “sure”), while event-related potentials were recorded. We found that identification of targets that remained unseen (“didn’t see”) was not facilitated by congruent cues, but was impaired by incongruent cues. In addition, cue congruence did not affect the relative frequency of nonconscious (“didn’t see”) to conscious visual experiences, nor did it affect the amplitude of the Visual Awareness Negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The results indicate that language cues did not enhance the processing of subliminal visual inputs, nor boost them into conscious experience. This outcome aligns with accounts of low-level perception that exclude the influence of linguistic or conceptual knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Background: Despite clear evidence linking indoor sunbed use to an increased risk of skin cancer (melanoma), sunbed use among young adults in the UK remains prevalent. This research explored barriers and facilitators influencing the use of sunbeds and tanning alternatives among young adults in the UK, aiming to inform strategies to encourage safer tanning behaviours.\nMethods: An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and June 2025. Using purposive sampling, we recruited UK-based young adults (aged 18–24) who had used sunbeds in the past year. A total of 502 participants (Mage = 21.73, SDage = 1.76) completed the survey and were included in the analysis. Measures included demographics (e.g., age, ethnicity), social deprivation, skin cancer risk, sun protection behaviours, willingness to use alternatives, and barriers/facilitators to indoor sunbed and sunbed alternatives use, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Backward stepwise linear regressions predicted frequency of using indoor sunbeds and alternatives (past year) from TDF constructs. Significant predictors were entered into separate linear regressions controlling demographics in the first model. Qualitative feedback was gained to further assess barriers/facilitators for using each alternative; analysed using content analysis.\nResults: Quantitative findings indicated that facilitators for indoor sunbed use related to tanning addiction (behavioural regulation), lower intentions to reduce or replace sunbed tanning, achieving tanning goals, less knowledge relating to associated health risks, and beliefs that alternative tans are temporary. Frequent use of sunbed alternatives was associated with perceptions of a natural-looking tan, stronger future intentions, identity alignment, and social influence from other users. Qualitative findings indicated positive emotion and beliefs about consequences as key facilitators of sunbed use, whereas knowledge of health risks and costs were barriers. For alternatives, greater facilitators were associated with convenience and affordability. There were mixed views regarding beliefs about consequences between alternatives.\nConclusions: Efforts to promote switching from sunbeds to sunbed alternatives should target sunbed tanning addiction, knowledge of health risks, intentions to replace sunbed use, and beliefs about consequences from using sunbed alternatives. Understanding modifiable behavioural drivers can inform targeted strategies.",

          "abstract": "Meditation and psychedelics have separately been studied as powerful tools for probing consciousness through their capacity to deconstruct the sense of self. Yet, direct empirical comparisons remain scarce, particularly in expert meditators. Here, we report for the first time a case study in which an advanced meditator and Lama from the Mahāmudrā meditation tradition engaged in a traditional style of nondual meditation, placebo, and two doses of 5-MeO-DMT (5 mg and 12 mg), while high-density EEG (hdEEG), psychometric scales, and phenomenological interviews were collected in a controlled environment.\nThe nondual meditation practice employed and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT showed overlapping features, including timelessness, reduced labeling of sensory content, and reductions in the narrative self and thoughts. Both states were marked by increased alpha power and decreased gamma power, with cross-decoding confirming significant neural overlap driven by posterior and right frontal gamma reductions. At the same time, phenomenological and hdEEG profiles differed: nondual meditation uniquely emphasized the recognition of nonduality and clarity of mind, while low-dose 5-MeO-DMT was characterized by visual imagery. In contrast, high-dose 5-MeO-DMT produced a qualitatively distinct profile of sensory disconnection, seeing a ‘white-light’, and broad increases in gamma power.\nThese qualitative findings indicate that while self-dissolution in this style of non-dual meditation and 5-MeO-DMT overlap in certain respects, they also diverge along specific dimensions. The  hdEEG findings suggest that self-deconstruction and approximations to contentless awareness are associated with at least two distinct routes: a “saturation” route, characterized by increased neural firing (indexed by elevated gamma activity), and increased entropy, associated with experiences of spaciousness, white light, and sensory disconnection (high-dose 5-MeO); and a “subtractive” route, characterized by reduced neuronal firing, and decreased entropy, linked to drastic reductions in conceptual elaboration, and increased equanimity (nondual meditation and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT). The latter convergence points to low-dose psychedelics as a potential complement to meditative training, offering synergies that may expand both scientific understanding of consciousness and clinical applications. A promising avenue for testing this possibility would be for future studies to investigate non-dual meditation under low-dose 5-MeO-DMT.",

          "abstract": "When decisions are delegated to artificial intelligence (AI), human principals are more likely to implicitly request misconduct, and AI agents are more likely to comply more than human agents would. Across incentivized experiments recruiting human principals (N = 600) and three Large Language Models as AI agents, we confirm that these two mechanisms combine to generate substantial negative externalities, in the form of financial harm to a charity. In line with recent recommendations in AI ethics, we investigate the power of whistleblowers to contain these negative externalities. Whistleblowers are inside observers who are willing to incur personal costs to alert about unethical practices in their organizations. In an incentivized experimental set-up capturing the tensions and costs of whistleblowing (N = 300), we show that the more unethical the request from a human principal, the more likely a participant is to become a whistleblower---which means that more participants, on average, become whistleblowers under AI delegation, to the point where the negative externalities of AI delegation are entirely neutralized by the behaviour of whistleblowers. These findings support recent calls to institutionalize protective mechanisms for whistleblowers within the AI sector.",

          "abstract": "The most well known study on doing nothing concluded that being alone for 15 mins with nothing to do but think is aversive. Here we examine skilful doing nothing in the form of Stillness Meditation. Meditation-naive adult participants (N = 165) were randomly allocated to 15 mins of Stillness Meditation or one of two active controls (Focused Attention and Audiobook). Stillness Meditation participants were found to have acquired the basic skill of doing nothing in the 15 min session. They typically reported the session was calm, pleasant, and easy, and their mean interbeat interval and heart-rate variability significantly increased relative to pre-session baseline. Scores for our primary measure of self-reported calm were significantly higher in the Focused Attention condition than for Stillness Meditation and Audiobook, but there were no significant differences for easiness, pleasantness, or the cardiac measures. The findings validate our Stillness Meditation protocol and provide evidence that skilful doing nothing is calming, pleasant, and easy — not aversive. The protocol constitutes a novel experimental tool that can be used in future studies to enable highly controlled investigations of pure consciousness, the state aimed for in the practice.",

          "authors": "Lea M. Bartsch; Alessandra S. Souza; Eda Mizrak; Klaus Oberauer",
          "abstract": "Working memory (WM) has been proposed to act as a gateway into long-term memory (LTM), such that only information successfully stored in WM can be transferred into LTM. Accordingly, the capacity limit of WM should constrain the acquisition of LTM traces. Evidence for that prediction is mixed: Some studies showed that increasing WM load translated into weaker LTM of the memorized information. Others found no effect of WM load on LTM learning. Here we present the results of three experiments that comprehensively test the gateway hypothesis. All experiments included a WM test and a delayed LTM test for the same information. WM set size was varied from 2 to 8 or 10 items. Further, we varied the type of materials (verbal or visual), whether the task requires memory for items or bindings, and the type of test (recognition vs. recall). The WM set size influenced performance in the LTM test only when two conditions were met: (1) The WM task involved tests of item memory through old-new recognition with concrete objects or words, and (2) LTM was tested for items not tested in the WM test. Yet even these effects were not found consistently across all experiments. This Registered Report indicates that increasing WM load rarely impairs LTM encoding, implying that WM capacity does not act as a bottleneck to the formation of memory traces in LTM under most conditions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Long waiting times remain a key barrier to accessing outpatient mental health care in the Netherlands and worldwide. Little is known about patterns of symptom change during waiting times and whether certain individuals are at greater risk of deterioration. This brief report used routine outcome monitoring data from Dutch outpatient clinics to examine changes in psychological distress during waiting and to test whether age, sex, socioeconomic status, and length of waiting predicted improvement or worsening. Methods: Routine outcome monitoring data were analyzed from 962 individuals referred by their general practitioner to a large Dutch outpatient mental health provider. Psychological distress was assessed with the Symptom-Questionnaire-48 (SQ-48), which participants completed at both referral and intake. We computed reliable Change Indices (RCI) to classify individuals as improved, deteriorated, or unchanged. Logistic and  multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the effects of waiting time, socioeconomic status, age, and sex on change status during waiting times. Results: Mean SQ-48 scores decreased significantly between referral and intake, but changes were not clinically meaningful. Most patients (92.02%) showed no reliable change; 6.03% deteriorated, and 1.35% improved. Waiting time, sex, age, and socioeconomic status did not predict symptom change during waiting time. Limitations include the relatively short average waiting time (M = 18.90 days), limited variability in socioeconomic status, and potential systematic dropout. Conclusions: Most individuals remained stable, with only small proportions showing reliable improvement or deterioration during short waiting times. These findings highlight the need for precision-based approaches to identify those at risk of worsening.",

          "abstract": "This study investigated the crosslinguistic distribution of intrinsic vowel duration, the observation that high vowels tend to be shorter than low vowels, using a large-scale corpus phonetic approach. Previous studies have reported a durational difference but have been limited by small speaker samples and narrow language coverage. Nevertheless, this observation has been debated to reflect an automatic consequence of the vowel height difference, or to be under speaker control. We reconsider this dichotomy in terms of competing pressures of target uniformity and enhancement in phonetic realization. Target uniformity would be consistent with a systematically shorter duration for high than low vowels and no systematic asymmetry between front and back vowels. In contrast, enhancement would predict larger, more variable durational differences between high and low vowels. To address the empirical gap, we analyzed duration contrasts among /i/, /u/, and /a/ in inter-obstruent contexts from over 60 languages, 80 language–length contrasts, and 16 language families in the VoxCommunis Corpus using automatic and manual vowel segmentations. Linear mixed-effects models assessed duration differences across vowel height and backness, incorporating rate-normalized and raw measures, while by-speaker analyses probed individual consistency. High vowels were shorter than low vowels in approximately 90% of language contrasts and significantly so for almost 80%. Crucially, no consistent durational bias emerged between high front and high back vowels. These findings suggest that intrinsic vowel duration is better understood as a statistical universal emerging from the balance between uniformity and enhancement in phonetic realization, rather than as a purely automatic universal.",

          "abstract": "This preregistered study investigated whether linguistic information can influence low-level visual perception. We argue that many previous studies supporting this view have significant shortcomings. Specifically, these studies conflate measures of objective performance with those of subjective experience, and cannot exclude the possibility that their observed effects might have been mediated by post-sensory processes instead (e.g., semantics, memory). To address these issues, our paradigm combined elements from two published studies by Sekar et al. (2011) and Lupyan and Ward (2013). Participants (N = 19) observed and rated visual targets of fixed intensity corresponding to their 50% identification threshold; visual targets were preceded by nonpredictive speech cues which matched or mismatched the target. Participants carried out an identification task and rated their subjective experience (“didn’t see”, “couldn’t identify”, “unsure”, and “sure”), while event-related potentials were recorded. We found that identification of targets that remained unseen (“didn’t see”) was not facilitated by congruent cues, but was impaired by incongruent cues. In addition, cue congruence did not affect the relative frequency of nonconscious (“didn’t see”) to conscious visual experiences, nor did it affect the amplitude of the Visual Awareness Negativity, an electrophysiological correlate of visual awareness. The results indicate that language cues did not enhance the processing of subliminal visual inputs, nor boost them into conscious experience. This outcome aligns with accounts of low-level perception that exclude the influence of linguistic or conceptual knowledge.",

Lastly, we reinforced that dimensions of ERI were related to both mental health and well-being, with some dimensions of identity serving a more pronounced role among specific ethno-racial groups.

The same mechanism that fuels success -- rationally integrating information from others -- can also create bias. Using hiring in labor markets as a relevant context, we simulate networks of Bayesian learners, generative agents, and human participants making hiring decisions independently or collectively. In all three cases, integrating social information improves efficiency when one option is best, but also produces inequality: agents converge on a few options even though all are equally qualified. Our experiments show that collective bias can emerge purely from individually rational and fully transparent social learning, even without any loss of information. Pooling information compresses experiences, reduces exploration, and amplifies early randomness, revealing a general mechanism of emergent inequality.",

Additionally, we explored the effects of a mindset induction just before the intervention hypothesizing a boost effect on khat use outcomes. \nIn a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, a sample of 322 university students from Jimma, Ethiopia, were randomly assigned (1) to the BI or cognitive tests as a control condition and (2) to either a deliberative or an implemental mindset induction. We used (generalized) linear mixed-effects models to test the effects of the BI and the mindset on khat use outcomes, controlling for covariates (e.g. comorbid psychopathology and motivation to stop khat use).\nThe results revealed a general decrease in the amount and frequency of khat use in the two weeks after the intervention, with the BI group showing a significant greater reduction in frequency than CG. No significant effects emerged regarding the mindset induction. We found khat use affected by psychopathological symptom load and motivation to change khat use. \nThe findings indicate that the adapted ASSIST-linked Brief Intervention can be promising in reducing khat use.

In bilingual individuals, metaphor production is influenced by language proficiency and cultural context. However, there is no psychometrically validated test measuring metaphor production ability beyond English. This study develops a tool to assess bilingual metaphor production using simple prompts (e.g., “The small dog is...”) that require original metaphors (e.g., “a tiny tornado”). Using automatic item generation with GPT-4, we generated 100 metaphor prompts, evenly split between English and Spanish. A sample of 160 Spanish-English bilinguals on Prolific provided responses. To evaluate metaphor originality, 100 Spanish-English bilingual raters scored responses using a planned missing data design. We applied a graded response model (GRM) to compute factor scores for each item and person, yielding sufficient rater agreement and measurement precision across both languages (Factor Determinacy Index = .77, ranging from .58 to .87). To further develop the assessment tool, additional factor analysis identified the most effective items, forming a short test of 10 items per language. This research provides a foundation for developing reliable and valid assessments of bilingual metaphor production, advancing the understanding of creative language use in multilingual populations and supporting linguistic assessment applications.",

          "abstract": "In memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, recent autobiographical memories are disproportionately vulnerable to loss, yet most traditional reminiscence therapies focus on remote past events. We present a case study examining whether a digital reminiscence intervention designed to support memory for recent experiences can improve episodic recall and psychosocial outcomes in neurodegenerative memory impairment. G.F., a 79-year-old man with early-stage dementia, completed an 11-week personalized intervention using HippoCamera, a neuroscience-based smartphone application that helps users generate and review multimodal memory cues from everyday events. Events that G.F. reviewed using HippoCamera were recalled with greater episodic detail than events that were recorded but not reviewed. Post-intervention, G.F. reported improvements in quality of life, life satisfaction, self-concept, and perceived episodic and spatial memory abilities, along with reduced depressive symptoms. Qualitative feedback revealed that the intervention helped G.F. regain confidence, re-engage socially, and feel more optimistic about the future. These findings suggest that digital interventions targeting memory for recent experiences—a domain often overlooked in traditional reminiscence therapy—may provide benefits to cognition and well-being in the early stages of dementia. This work highlights the promise of HippoCamera as an accessible, neuroscience-informed tool to support memory and well-being in those experiencing memory loss.",

          "abstract": "Research on relatively simple forms of visual perception with limited emotional content has dominated the empirical and theoretical efforts to identify the neural basis of consciousness. In contrast, research on auditory affective experiences like misophonia, autonomous sensory meridian responses (ASMR), and musical chills promises to broaden our understanding of consciousness and challenge existing theories to accommodate a wider range of phenomena. Most notably, these experiences are driven primarily by meaningful environmental sounds but are often shaped by input from other modalities, including vision, touch, and interoception. This perspective highlights how subjective experiences may arise from interactions between sensory cortical pathways, bodily signals, and wider cortical networks implicated in emotion, interoception, and salience processing. Prior studies on misophonia, ASMR, and musical chills have indeed implicated the anterior insula, anterior cingulate, amygdala, striatum, secondary auditory cortex, and premotor cortex. These activity patterns are consistent with several mechanistic theories that explain auditory emotional experience, some of which may generalize across auditory affective phenomena, while others appear more specific to a smaller subset of them. Here, we review and synthesize findings and theoretical explanations from this growing area of research, and propose future directions aimed at identifying the commonalities and differences in mechanisms underlying auditory affective experiences.",

          "abstract": "Meditation and psychedelics have separately been studied as powerful tools for probing consciousness through their capacity to deconstruct the sense of self. Yet, direct empirical comparisons remain scarce, particularly in expert meditators. Here, we report for the first time a case study in which an advanced meditator and Lama from the Mahāmudrā meditation tradition engaged in a traditional style of nondual meditation, placebo, and two doses of 5-MeO-DMT (5 mg and 12 mg), while high-density EEG (hdEEG), psychometric scales, and phenomenological interviews were collected in a controlled environment.\nThe nondual meditation practice employed and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT showed overlapping features, including timelessness, reduced labeling of sensory content, and reductions in the narrative self and thoughts. Both states were marked by increased alpha power and decreased gamma power, with cross-decoding confirming significant neural overlap driven by posterior and right frontal gamma reductions. At the same time, phenomenological and hdEEG profiles differed: nondual meditation uniquely emphasized the recognition of nonduality and clarity of mind, while low-dose 5-MeO-DMT was characterized by visual imagery. In contrast, high-dose 5-MeO-DMT produced a qualitatively distinct profile of sensory disconnection, seeing a ‘white-light’, and broad increases in gamma power.\nThese qualitative findings indicate that while self-dissolution in this style of non-dual meditation and 5-MeO-DMT overlap in certain respects, they also diverge along specific dimensions. The  hdEEG findings suggest that self-deconstruction and approximations to contentless awareness are associated with at least two distinct routes: a “saturation” route, characterized by increased neural firing (indexed by elevated gamma activity), and increased entropy, associated with experiences of spaciousness, white light, and sensory disconnection (high-dose 5-MeO); and a “subtractive” route, characterized by reduced neuronal firing, and decreased entropy, linked to drastic reductions in conceptual elaboration, and increased equanimity (nondual meditation and low-dose 5-MeO-DMT). The latter convergence points to low-dose psychedelics as a potential complement to meditative training, offering synergies that may expand both scientific understanding of consciousness and clinical applications. A promising avenue for testing this possibility would be for future studies to investigate non-dual meditation under low-dose 5-MeO-DMT.",

Although both religiosity and spirituality were positively associated with vaccine skepticism and CAM usage intentions, only spirituality showed a causal effect by increasing CAM usage intentions. Our results emphasize the need for causal, within-person analyses rather than relying solely on cross-sectional correlational studies.",

          "abstract": "Narrative tasks externalize language and social cognition providing a powerful window in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This systematic review synthesizes previous research on the effects of ASD on narrative microstructure (i.e., lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, morphosyntactic accuracy, productivity) and macrostructure (i.e., story grammar/episodic structure, causal and temporal cohesion, mental-state language, referential clarity in individuals with ASD. To address this aim, a systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Records were screened in Covidence by two independent reviewers and data was extracted using standardized procedures, and appraised risk of bias. Across studies and languages, children with ASD typically were found to produce narratives that are shorter, lexically less diverse, and syntactically simpler than those of typically developing (TD) peers; morphosyntactic accuracy is comparatively mixed and often relatively preserved. At the macrostructural level, children with ASD include fewer complete story grammar elements, show weaker causal/temporal linking, use sparser mental-state vocabulary, and display greater referential ambiguity. Variability in outcomes is explained partly by moderators such as age and cognitive level, language experience (mono-/bilingual status), elicitation demands, and analytic indices. Narrative difficulties in ASD arise primarily from discourse planning and socio-cognitive impairment, with local linguistic form though being relatively more preserved. The field would benefit from longitudinal and intervention studies using harmonized narrative measures to assess causal links between social cognition, and multimodal computational studies with executive control measures, and narrative growth.",

          "abstract": "Stimuli that reliably predict reward can increase their capacity to capture attention. This Value‑Modulated Attentional Capture (VMAC) is typically viewed as independent of task goals or physical salience, arising from Pavlovian learning. However, recent evidence suggests that the awareness of the stimulus‑reward contingency may be necessary during the acquisition of such attentional biases, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. One possibility is that awareness mediates the learning process of VMAC by directing selective attention toward the reward-predictive feature. The present preregistered study tested whether reward‑related attentional biases arise primarily from such selective attention, independently of awareness. Participants performed a visual search task in which one of two singleton distractors—one predicting high reward, the other low reward—appeared on a subset of trials. Selective attention to the reward‑predictive feature (i.e., distractor color) was manipulated between groups: In some trials, one group reported the reward-predictive distractor’s color, while the other group reported an irrelevant, non-reward predictive feature (its location). Otherwise, the stimulus–reward contingencies remained identical for both groups. The typical VMAC effect, as measured by slower response times for the high‑value compared to the low‑value distractor, emerged only in the group that attended to the color. Critically, the previous result cannot be explained by individual differences in awareness. These findings demonstrate a causal role of selective attention in the acquisition of reward-related attentional biases.",

          "abstract": "Olfaction is one of our most archaic senses but its central mechanisms are lesser known than those of other senses. In this work, we address a possible link between olfactory stimuli and mental spatial representations. Although olfactory percepts are not commonly related to space (as are visual or auditory percepts), perfumiers tend to describe scents in terms of top/head or base notes, using spatial terms, and arrange notes vertically on olfactory pyramids, with more volatile notes on top. Based on preliminary evidence, we tested in a well-powered, preregistered study whether odors evoke in naïve participants a mental vertical representation dependent on odor quality, in the absence of any explicit references to elevation. In a speeded choice classification task, 110 participants were asked to press one of two vertically aligned buttons in response to a series of olfactory stimuli. A spatial stimulus-response compatibility (SRC) effect was expected to emerge from alternative mappings (compatible vs incompatible) of stimuli to responses, due to the hypothesised dimensional overlap between odors and response alternatives. However, the preregistered contrast on means of median correct responses neither confirmed the presence of a vertical SRC effect at the group level, nor provided conclusive evidence for its absence. An analogous exploratory test on restricted means did support the presence of the predicted effect at the group level, whereas its Bayesian counterpart found the outcome inconclusive. Exploratory analyses revealed the presence of three distinct clusters of participants with regards to the vertical SRC effect for odors, with two clusters (N = 61 and N = 19) showing a significant effect in the expected direction and one cluster (N = 30) showing a significant effect in the opposite direction. These results call for replications with an approach that factors in potential sources of individual differences.",

Parenting is a key risk factor, yet prior research often focuses narrowly on single behaviors, overlooking how broader patterns of parenting that consider multiple behaviors (i.e., involvement, warmth, inconsistency, monitoring, and punishment) interact with parent/family characteristics to predict internalizing and externalizing. \nMethods\nUsing data from the ABCD Study, we conducted latent profile analysis (LPA) using six parenting behaviors (involvement, positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, poor monitoring and supervision, corporal punishment, other punishment) to identify broad parenting patterns. Logistic regression models tested differences between profiles by parent/family characteristics. Linear regression models predicted youth internalizing and externalizing from parenting profile, parent psychopathology, and family characteristics across late childhood and early adolescence. \nResults\nLPA identified three parenting profiles (entropy 0.956-0.994). Profile 1 was characterized by the lowest involvement, warmth, and monitoring and the highest punishment and inconsistency; Profile 2 by moderate levels; and Profile 3 by the highest involvement, warmth, and monitoring and the lowest punishment and inconsistency. Profiles 1 and 2 were associated with higher parental psychopathology and poorer family environments. Regression models indicated that youth externalizing differed by parenting profile in childhood but not adolescence.

          "authors": "Niyati Kachhiyapatel; Igor Grossmann",
          "abstract": "How can one bring wisdom into STEM education? One popular position holds that wise judgment follows from teaching morals and ethics in STEM. However, wisdom scholars debate the causal role of morality and whether presence of apriori moral dispositions is a necessary condition for cultivating and expressing wisdom. Some philosophers, education practitioners and behavioral scientists champion this view, whereas social psychologists and cognitive scientists argue that moral features like prosocial behavior are reinforcing factors or outcomes of wise judgment rather than pre-requisites. This debate matters particularly for science and technology, where wisdom-demanding decisions typically involve incommensurable values and radical uncertainty. Here, we evaluate these competing positions through four lines of evidence. First, empirical research shows that heightened moralization aligns with foolish rejection of scientific claims, political polarization, and value extremism. Second, scholarship on repeated economic games (Folk Theorem) suggests that wisdom-related metacognition—perspective-integration, context-sensitivity, and balancing long- and short-term goals—can give rise to prosocial behavior without an apriori moral blueprint. Third, in real life, moral values often compete, making metacognition indispensable to balance competing interests for the common good. Fourth, numerous scientific tasks require wise handling of ill-defined challenges, without a clear role of morals for such tasks. We address potential objections about immoral and Machiavellian applications of blueprint-free wisdom accounts. Finally, we explore implications for giftedness: what exceptional wisdom looks like in STEM context, and how to train it in the classroom via self-reflection exercises and exercises that highlight one’s knowledge gaps.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Social inferential processes, including theory of mind, pragmatics (comprising irony and sarcasm), deception, and social judgments, enable individuals to interpret intentions, beliefs, and socially normative behaviors. Traditional measures using vignettes or static images often lack ecological validity, whereas video-based tasks provide a more naturalistic approach. This scoping review maps video-based measures of social inference in adults over the past 30 years. \nMethods: A systematic search in PsycInfo, PubMed, and SocIndex identified 5057 records, with 421 meeting inclusion criteria. We extracted details on test and stimuli characteristics, populations studies, and video features. \nResults: A total of 189 tests were identified: 33% assessed theory of mind, 25% social judgment, 20% deception, 12% irony/sarcasm, and 7% pragmatics. Most were in English or European languages, with videos typically featuring speaking actors (77%) and over half showing real interactions. Commonly used tests included the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition, Awareness of Social Inference Test, Interpersonal Perception Task, and EmpaToM. Thirteen stimuli banks were identified, mainly covering theory of mind, deception, and social judgment, with limited linguistic diversity. Psychiatric populations, particularly schizophrenia, were most studied, while neurodegenerative disorders were underrepresented. \nConclusion: The breadth of tools demonstrates strong innovation in task design and offers a practical resource for researchers and clinicians. However, validation remains limited, stimuli banks are scarce, and key populations such as older adults and patients with neurodegenerative disorders are underrepresented. Future work should focus on strengthening existing tools, expanding accessibility, and linking assessments more closely to clinical and real-world social functioning.",

This effect tends to be less pronounced or even reversed when immediate tests are employed instead of delayed tests. The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of this effect by varying the complexity within the same specific knowledge domain. Consequently, a quantitative investigation was developed with a sample of 310 students from an elementary school in the city of Santa Isabel, Ecuador. The sample included 171 females and 139 males, with an average age between 9 and 12 years, and a factorial design was implemented with the variables of task sequence (example-example vs. example-problem), element interactivity (i.e., high vs. low), and test timing (i.e., immediate vs. delayed). The results indicated that performance in both immediate and delayed tests is superior in tasks with a low level of element interactivity compared to tasks with high element interactivity. It was also found that example-problem tasks are better than example-example tasks in the delayed test. It is concluded that the relationship between element interactivity and the testing effect is not entirely clear, and it is suggested that the design of learning tasks should impose cognitive load within the limits of working memory.",

We introduce a quantitative framework that integrates multimodal tracking of eye and body movements and heart rate with machine learning and Bayesian models to identify predictors of coordination in a fast-paced ball-hitting task. Coordination success depended primarily on similarity in partners’ predictive styles rather than on general anticipatory ability. Well-coordinated pairs showed similar anticipatory saccades in individual tasks, enabling more efficient prediction of self and partner actions during joint tasks. By contrast, demographic variables, overall physiology, motor activity, and self-assessments were minimally linked to success. By reverse-engineering behavioral signatures, our framework identifies alignment in action anticipation as a key mechanism of coordination in both human–human and human–robot interaction.",

The urgency of global climate action highlights the importance of understanding public support towards environmental policies. The Value-Belief-Norm theory offers a model for understanding psychological processes underlying pro-environmental policy support. This study aims to evaluate the Value-Belief-Norm theory as an explanatory model of policy support. Method: We searched Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and three registries. We included 23 cross-sectional survey studies testing the Value-Belief-Norm model to explain support for environmental public policies, nine of which were eligible for random-effects meta-analysis of correlations. Results: Model-explained variance in policy support ranged from 2% to 72%, with substantial variation in the Value-Belief-Norm theory application across studies. Policy support was positively associated with Ascription of responsibility (r = .39, p &lt; .001), Awareness of consequences (r = .37, p &lt; .001), Pro-environmental personal norms (r = .36, p &lt; .001), Ecological worldview (r = .28, p &lt; .001) and Altruistic values (r = .13, p &lt; .01). The strongest correlations were between policy support and policy-specific beliefs, specifically Perceived fairness (r = .77, p &lt; .001) and Perceived effectiveness (r = .59, p &lt; .001), which are not part of the Value-Belief-Norm theory.

The model is specified by three behavioral indices—associative-distance density, analytic-verification ratio, and convergence latency—and mapped onto a neural motif in which Default Mode Network (DMN) activity alternates with Central Executive Network (CEN) activity on a sub-second timescale. A review of recent fMRI, EEG, and causal stimulation studies shows that (i) DMN–CEN coupling increases with idea originality, (ii) rapid network switching predicts insight accuracy, and (iii) dual site neuromodulation that balances the two networks boosts creative output without loss of practicality. System 3 also reframes cognitive biases as scalable heuristics that expand the search space when monitored by metacognitive confidence signals, and positions dopamine and serotonin as chemical gain controls on the generate–evaluate loop. Practical applications range from AI assisted ideation and precision neurofeedback to cautious exploration of pharmacological and genetic levers. An ethical framework is proposed to safeguard psychological integrity, authenticity, and equity as such interventions mature. Finally, developmental data suggest that the generative component matures early in adolescence, whereas evaluative gating and full-loop metacognition continue to develop into adulthood, inviting longitudinal tests of the model. System 3 thus offers a falsifiable, multi-level account of creative cognition and a scaffold for responsible enhancement technologies.",

As primary gatekeepers to professional help and treatment, parents play a crucial role in identifying and responding to children’s SAD symptoms. The threshold hypothesis posits that cultural socialization norms influence how parents evaluate SAD symptoms by shaping expectations for child behaviors. However, recent work suggests that stigma could explain cross-cultural differences in such parental evaluations. This study used an experimental vignette design to examine the role of cultural norms and stigma in shaping parental responses to SAD in China and Germany. A total of 295 parents of children aged 7 to 13 participated. The experimental manipulation of norm salience did not pass the manipulation check or affect parental evaluations. Perceived seriousness of SAD symptoms did not differ between the two groups. However, Chinese parents reported higher levels of help-seeking intentions, parental distress, and more shame in response to SAD symptoms, despite perceiving symptom severity similarly to German parents. These findings suggest that while cognitive appraisals of SAD symptoms may be similar across cultures, behavioral and emotional responses differ. Stigma-related distress appears to drive cultural differences in help-seeking, challenging the threshold hypothesis.",

          "abstract": "Social identity profoundly shapes whom people choose as information sources, constraining exposure to diverse perspectives. While people are motivated to seek accurate information, they systematically avoid outgroup sources even when group membership is irrelevant to the task at hand.  Here we investigate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can circumvent these identity-driven biases in source selection. In Study 1, a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1,054) preferred AI over human sources when seeking information about political conflicts. In Study 2 (n = 284), an incentivized political fact-checking experiment revealed that participants preferred AI sources over outgroup (d = 0.470) and even ingroup (d = 0.230) partisan sources, despite recognizing their equal competence level. In Study 3 (n = 277), using an identity-irrelevant shape categorization task, participants only preferred AI over outgroup sources (d = 0.191), with no difference between AI and ingroup sources. Computational modeling revealed that these preferences emerge through dual processes: participants initially favored human sources but subsequently accumulated evidence against partisan advisors during deliberation. These findings suggest that AI's perceived neutrality enables it to bypass identity-based discrimination. These results highlight the potential of AI to reduce echo chambers and broaden epistemic exposure by serving as an identity-neutral conduit for information acquisition.",

In two preregistered studies (n1 = 571, n2 = 1,323), a 10-item People Pleasing Scale was developed and validated. Study 1 revealed three dimensions of people pleasing, namely, Responsibility, Neglect of Own Needs, and Others’ Expectations. This structure was confirmed in Study 2. Residual measurement invariance across genders was found in both independent datasets. Nomological network analyses revealed that people pleasing, as measured with the People Pleasing Scale, was correlated with yet distinguishable from facets of agreeableness, honesty-humility, emotionality, empathy, and subclinical psychopathy. Furthermore, people pleasing went along with charitable giving in the ultimatum game and the dictator game, and with a social value orientation. The findings underscore the utility of the People Pleasing Scale for scientific and applied purposes. Outlooks for future applications and further validation endeavors are outlined.",

Based on propensity score matching and a variety of control group sample specifications it is found that CARA significantly reduces recidivism and that for every £1 spent on CARA there is an economic benefit of £3.31 and £11.03 respectively for the two police force areas, annually, in 2024 prices. Extrapolating these findings to England and Wales, the intervention's yearly cost would be £2,176,438 while the savings, or net economic benefit, would be £18,372,615.  The economic benefits are likely underestimates of the true benefits providing empirical support for the economic significance of CARA.",

          "authors": "Federica Bulgarelli",
          "abstract": "Recent research reveals that children’s language development is tied to their linguistic input. While the majority of this research has focused on speech children hear from adults, children around the world do not exclusively interact with adults. Instead, children regularly interact with other children, whether in the home or in early childhood education settings. Here, I contextualize the frequency of interactions with speech from other children. I then highlight properties of speech from children, such as its acoustic signature and content, that might make it particularly relevant for early language learning. Lastly, I discuss how considering speech from children allows us to create theories that are inclusive of societies around the world, where caretaking often involves more children and in lower-SES settings, where higher birthrates are common. I conclude that theories of language development should consider speech from other children as an important component.",

          "abstract": "Recent theories on emotion regulation (ER) assume that emotional intensity affects the choice and success of ER strategies. Whereas laboratory studies investigating this association found consistent evidence, experience sampling (ESM) studies yielded mixed results. In this ESM study, we investigated the effect of emotional intensity on the choice of disengagement (e.g., distraction) or engagement strategies (e.g., reappraisal) and their success in attenuating unpleasant emotions. Between 2020 and 2021, we collected ESM dyadic data from couples in a community sample of 183 participants over 28 days, with three prompts per day. Multilevel modelling revealed that the choice of most of the disengagement strategies was not significantly predicted by the intensity of unpleasant emotions. The choice of the disengagement strategy “substance use” and most of the engagement strategies was associated with higher within-person emotional intensity. Acceptance was more likely to be chosen with lower within-person emotional intensities. Regarding ER success, the attenuation of unpleasant emotions through disengagement strategies did not vary by emotional intensity. However, engagement strategies attenuated unpleasant emotions more successfully in situations with lower within-person emotional intensities. Overall, results on ER choice mostly diverge from recent theories and previous laboratory studies, whereas findings on ER success align with theoretical outlines.",

          "abstract": "Background: Long waiting times remain a key barrier to accessing outpatient mental health care in the Netherlands and worldwide. Little is known about patterns of symptom change during waiting times and whether certain individuals are at greater risk of deterioration. This brief report used routine outcome monitoring data from Dutch outpatient clinics to examine changes in psychological distress during waiting and to test whether age, sex, socioeconomic status, and length of waiting predicted improvement or worsening. Methods: Routine outcome monitoring data were analyzed from 962 individuals referred by their general practitioner to a large Dutch outpatient mental health provider. Psychological distress was assessed with the Symptom-Questionnaire-48 (SQ-48), which participants completed at both referral and intake. We computed reliable Change Indices (RCI) to classify individuals as improved, deteriorated, or unchanged. Logistic and  multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the effects of waiting time, socioeconomic status, age, and sex on change status during waiting times. Results: Mean SQ-48 scores decreased significantly between referral and intake, but changes were not clinically meaningful. Most patients (92.02%) showed no reliable change; 6.03% deteriorated, and 1.35% improved. Waiting time, sex, age, and socioeconomic status did not predict symptom change during waiting time. Limitations include the relatively short average waiting time (M = 18.90 days), limited variability in socioeconomic status, and potential systematic dropout. Conclusions: Most individuals remained stable, with only small proportions showing reliable improvement or deterioration during short waiting times. These findings highlight the need for precision-based approaches to identify those at risk of worsening.",

Is this effect driven by the debunking facts and evidence, or does it rely on the messenger being an AI model? In other words, would the same message be equally effective if delivered by a human? To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 955) in which participants reported either a conspiracy belief or a non-conspiratorial but epistemically unwarranted belief, and interacted with an AI model that argued against that belief using facts and evidence. We randomized whether the debunking AI model was characterized as an AI tool or a human expert and whether the model used human-like conversational tone. The conversations significantly reduced participants’ confidence in both conspiracies and epistemically unwarranted beliefs, with no significant differences across conditions. Thus, AI persuasion is not reliant on the messenger being an AI model: it succeeds by generating compelling messages.",

William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model” proposes that ostracism threatens fundamental social needs that individuals spontaneously attempt to secure by seeking reaffiliation. Using the Cyberball Game, a computerized ball-tossing game used to study psychological responses to ostracism via game social inclusion vs. exclusion conditions, recent studies showed that attention to social signals was an accurate proxy of the reaffiliation needs, themselves derived from  the social exclusion feelings. Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attentional is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model”, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feelings. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, and that they likely depend on individual features.

We further examined the roles of social perception dimensions—warmth, competence, and moral character—and individual differences in social dominance orientation (SDO). Contrary to expectations, stereotype congruence did not influence credibility. As predicted, perceived moral character was the strongest predictor of credibility, highlighting the importance of trust-related traits in credibility assessments. Competence negatively predicted credibility, perhaps reflecting suspicion that capable applicants are deceptive, while warmth and SDO showed no association with credibility.

Objectively and subjectively speaking? 2) How do we perceive and understand these other minds? 3) How are other minds represented in the brain? 4) Is the perception of minds in other species or artificial agents not just mere anthropomorphism? 5) Is it important how the other looks? Does it matter if the other is human-like (e.g., robots) or cute (e.g., animals)? 6) Does it matter at all if you think an agent has a mind on how you view yourself and others? And finally, 7) where does it all end? What methods and techniques, perspectives or approaches does the field need to answer these and future questions? Together, the answers to these questions suggest that minds are grounded in sociality and people judge minds on the capacity to feel and think, with a distinct neural network supporting this. There is emerging evidence on the flexibility thereof in terms of activity to diverse minds and presence of this network across species. Mind perception and anthropomorphism are distinct at the conceptual, psychological, and neural level, and beliefs and other top-down effects are more important than just the visual appearance of an agent. Reports on threat to human identity, intergroup effects, as well impact on group dynamics, show that there are clear inter- and intrapersonal consequences of mind perception. Future research should focus on an interdisciplinary approach embracing different disciplines from comparative psychology to linguistics, employing a multi-method assessment of mind perception in interactive, embodied, everyday situations, capturing the inter- and intrapersonal consequences thereof, to provide further answers on these and other questions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cross-cultural mental health assessment faces significant methodological challenges when Western-derived instruments are applied in non-Western settings, potentially missing culturally salient features of psychological distress. This study examines whether locally developed instruments can complement Western tools in understanding adolescent mental health among Kenyan youth.\n\nMethods: We evaluated the psychometric properties and complementary utility of the Ndetei-Othieno-Kathuku (NOK) Scale (a locally developed tool in Kenya) alongside standard Western-derived instruments (PHQ-8 for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety) in 2,906 Kenyan adolescents (M age = 15.97, SD=1.45; 57.0% Female) across 40 secondary schools. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, receiver operating characteristic curves, multidimensional scaling, and network analysis, we examined instrument psychometrics, overlap, and established clinically-elevated symptom thresholds. We also assessed the association of clinically-elevated symptoms with sociodemographic factors.\n\nResults: The NOK scales demonstrated poor-to-adequate internal consistency (NOK-Anxiety α = .78; NOK-Depression α = .61) with distinct factor structures from Western instruments. ROC-derived thresholds were 3.5 for depression and 6.5 for anxiety, with moderate diagnostic accuracy (AUC = .72-.77). Prevalence estimates were higher using NOK scales (45.91% depression, 32.11% anxiety) compared to Western instruments (27.28% depression, 21.95% anxiety). Multidimensional scaling revealed clear clustering by instrument origin, while network analysis showed NOK items demonstrated higher centrality, suggesting greater interconnectedness with other symptoms. Age, gender, perceived academic ability, family structure (living with both parents), and parental loss emerged as significant factors associated with clinically-elevated symptoms.\n\nConclusions: Complementary use of locally-developed and Western-derived instruments can provide an enhanced understanding of adolescent mental health in diverse contexts. This \"both-and\" approach captures culturally specific expressions of distress while maintaining cross-cultural comparability, supporting more comprehensive and culturally responsive assessment practices.",

          "abstract": "Preterm birth remains a global health challenge with significant implications for neonatal outcomes and parental mental health. This paper explores the complex psychological experiences and intrapersonal processes of parents after preterm birth, highlighting their heightened risk for mental health difficulties such as postpartum depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Existing mental health interventions are medicalised, primarily focusing on infant care. As a result, there is currently a lack of emotionally-focused interventions aimed at supporting parents after preterm birth. The current conceptual review proposes a compassion-focused framework to address the unique challenges faced by these parents. The paper aims to: 1) examine common experiences of parents after preterm birth, 2) explore the complex psychological processes that underpin these experiences, 3) present theoretical models that can be applied to understand parent’s psychological responses, 4) critically review existing interventions aimed at supporting parent mental health following preterm birth, 5) introduce a compassion-focused approach as a novel framework for support, 6) review existing compassion-based interventions aimed at perinatal populations, and 7) outline directions for future research. By integrating a compassion-focused approach, this paper aims to provide actionable insights to support parents’ mental health following preterm birth.",

          "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the origins of language and music are rooted in a common precursor. A common origin is likely if there are shared features, functions, and acoustic correlates, which can be studied by comparing across domains and species. One feature central to music, speech, and animal communication is timbre. Timbre depends on characteristics of the frequency spectrum and is used both to recognize individuals and to convey emotions in speech and mammalian vocal communication. However, to date, no work has been directly comparing timbre usage in music to the other two systems. The central question of this manuscript is therefore, whether similar functions of timbre are present in music relative to speech and mammalian vocal communication, and whether these functions are implemented by similar acoustic correlates. A review was conducted to investigate the functions of timbre and its underlying acoustic features in music. The results show that timbre in music conveys both emotion and identity relying on similar acoustical features as in speech and other mammalian vocal communication. This common function of timbre and the similar implementation across different communication systems suggests a common origin of music and language, likely broadly shared throughout mammalian communication.",

          "abstract": "Classical musicians’ individual practice time is central to their musical life and development, yet little research has examined the cognitive and affective processes that influence its effectiveness. This study investigates boredom, mind-wandering and flow during classical music practice, both on the trait and state level (i.e., during practice in general as well as during a specific session) as experiences associated with practice effectiveness. Classical musicians (N=105) completed two 20-minute practice sessions and filled out questionnaires beforehand, between sessions, and after the second session. Boredom emerged as a clear negative correlate for all performance outcomes: Trait boredom during practice was negatively associated with performance satisfaction, while state boredom was negatively related to both efficacy and creativity in a specific practice session. No significant associations were found between trait or state mind-wandering during practice and any outcome variables. Flow during practice, on the other hand, was positively associated with both efficacy and creativity. These findings suggest that while boredom is robustly linked to poorer outcomes and flow to better outcomes in classical music practice, the same is not true for mind-wandering. A possible explanation may lie in heterogeneous nature of mind-wandering and the relative freedom of practice. Given that boredom was consistently associated with less effective, less creative practice and lower performance satisfaction, whereas flow states were linked to more effective practice and higher creativity, future experimental or intervention-based studies should be developed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which cognitive and affective states influence musicians’ practice.",

DynAffect-C recovers known value-signaling effects and, with regulatory baseline-attraction terms, explains substantially more moment-to-moment variation than value-only models. The model reveals nonlinear pull toward baseline affect, alternating mood states in a subset of participants, and a trade-off between stronger internal momentum and transient impacts of external events.

          "abstract": "Music psychology researchers have long been interested in how emotions are expressed in music. Increasingly, researchers employ computationally derived measures of emotion (e.g., valence and arousal) from services such as Spotify. These measures are easy to use, but how they are calculated is not transparent. It is not clear whether these computational measures reflect how people rate perceived emotions in music. Addressing this, our study investigated the validity of Spotify’s automated ratings with subjective ratings from actual listeners. Participants were recruited from first-year university student cohorts and the general public (N = 244). Participants listened to 40 song excerpts, approximately 20-30 seconds in length, and rated tracks on their perception of its mood (valence), energy (arousal), danceability, familiarity, and enjoyment. Participant ratings were compared with Spotify’s automated ratings. We found that Spotify audio features energy and valence were positively associated with human ratings for these factors, with a strong relationship for arousal, and moderate relationship for valence. Spotify danceability, however, was not strongly associated with human ratings of danceability. These findings corroborate the utility of the widely used circumplex model for measuring emotions concisely. We further extend this by validating automated emotion ratings, such as those implemented by Spotify’s system, for use in music psychology, and highlight that if used cautiously, this is a useful tool in research.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Speech perception continues to develop throughout school age and plays a fundamental role in language and reading development. Recent findings in English-speaking children suggest that speech categorization consistency—the stability of a listener’s percept across multiple encounters with a speech sound—predicts both language and reading abilities, with a particularly strong link between reading skills and vowel perception. One hypothesis is that this is due to complex grapheme-phoneme correspondences (GPCs) in English vowels. The present study tested (1) whether the relationship between categorization consistency and language/reading abilities extends to typologically different languages and (2) whether the vowel-specific link observed in English is shaped by GPC complexity, using data from Korean, a language with relatively transparent GPC mappings.\n\nMethod: Forty-four 1st-grade Korean-speaking children completed a Visual Analog Scaling (VAS) task, in which they heard tokens from a speech continuum and rated the correspondence between the stimulus and each word on a continuous scale. Standardized assessments of language and word reading were also conducted. \n\nResults: Children with poorer language/reading abilities exhibited lower categorization consistency, which is consistent with the findings from English-speaking children. In contrast to prior findings, however, this relationship was not specific to vowel perception but was held across all contrast types tested. Categorization gradiency (slope of the categorization function) was not significantly associated with any outcome. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend prior work by demonstrating that categorization consistency predicts language and reading abilities, even in a language with transparent GPCs. Importantly, this association was observed across all phonemic contrasts, not just vowels—suggesting that the previously observed vowel-specific link in English may stem from the greater GPC complexity of English vowels. Together, while categorization consistency appears to be a critical predictor of linguistic outcome, the specific pattern may vary across languages depending on the structure of their GPCs.",

          "authors": "Matthias Borgstede",
          "abstract": "Numeric ratings of agreement (also known as Likert-scales) are one of the most common assessment tools in psychology. However, little is known about the measurement theoretic properties of such ratings. Most prominently, the question whether such ratings yield interval scaled measurements has been questioned on theoretical grounds, the key issue being that interval scales do not only require ratings to be order preserving, but also additive. In this article, I apply a representational measurement model to investigate intra-individual response structures with regard to Likert-scale items. The model is borrowed from the psychophysical paradigm of cross-modality comparisons and allows for an explicit empirical test of additivity on the level of individual responses.  A within-subjects experiment with N = 140 individuals was conducted, where subjects were instructed to rate their agreement to a set of items from a standardized personality questionnaire. The ratings were performed repeatedly with varying reference stimuli to evoke difference ratings for agreement. These difference ratings were then used to test the conditions of the measurement model. The results indicate that 51% of the individuals showed additivity in their rating behavior. Therefore, an interval scale representation of subjective agreement was possible for about one half of the individuals, whereas the other half did not produce agreement ratings on an interval scale. While the results clearly demonstrate that interval scale measurements using numeric ratings are possible, they also indicate that such quantitative representations should not be taken at face value but need to be tested empirically.",

          "abstract": "Content moderators aim to prevent misinformation and abuse in online communities. Human moderators have limitations like limited capacity that can potentially be addressed by AI moderators. However, in order for AI to be effective as a moderator, we need to understand how people perceive an AI moderator compared to a human moderator. We report two experiments (N = 698) that showed a human or AI moderating misinformation in online groups, varying the moderator's arguments and the group's size. In Experiment~1, AI was seen as less effective when it used harm-based arguments to refute misinformation; however, this gap disappeared a year later in Experiment~2, perhaps as attitudes towards AI shifted. Perceptions of AI moderator effectiveness were unaffected by the moderated group's size. We suggest that there may be growing acceptance of AI as content moderators in online groups, and highlight some of the potential challenges their use may raise.",

As produções da forma-alvo foram analisadas acusticamente e submetidas a Análises de Picos com simulações de Monte Carlo e a Análises de Pontos de Mudança. Os resultados apontam padrões individuais de variabilidade e mudança possivelmente ligados aos tratamentos pedagógicos. Os achados reforçam a pertinência de estudos de processo para o desenvolvimento fonético-fonológico em LNN e a compatibilidade entre a TSDC e o Modelo de Aprendizagem da Fala, além de evidenciar ganhos do uso complementar dos dois métodos de análise.",

In this model, respondents allocate time across items to maximize expected performance subject to a fixed time budget, so response time and accuracy are determined jointly and endogenously. The framework captures the time–accuracy trade-off within and across items and naturally yields the inverted U-shaped relation between time and accuracy observed in data. Using TIMSS data, the model reproduces item-level response times in a low-stakes setting: agreement between observed and predicted times is reasonably high overall, higher for stronger performers, and lower for respondents who finish quickly. We also find evidence of systematic time misallocation and miscalibrated beliefs about item properties during the test. Overall, the model offers a practical tool for analyzing response time data and for understanding respondents' test-taking behavior and strategies.",

          "abstract": "Purpose. Research on workplace violence has predominantly focused on individual, organizational, and situational risk factors associated with employee victimization. However, limited attention has been paid to the interactional processes that shape workplace violence events despite microsociological theories and evidence underscoring the critical role of face-to-face interactions in conflict situations. This paper proposes a microsociological approach to better understand how workplace encounters escalate into acts of victimization. Methodology. To exemplify the value of a microsociological approach, we analyze body-worn camera footage of a work situation that escalates into aggression between a ticket inspector and a bus passenger without a valid ticket. Using qualitative process analysis, we examine how interactional dynamics involving status and emotions shape the step-by-step progression of this high-risk encounter. Findings. We demonstrate how the imposition of a fine transforms the inspector-passenger interaction into a status negotiation, with passenger aggression emerging in response to the inspector’s exercise of authority. Moreover, the inspector’s emotion management plays a key role in preventing the situation from escalating further into mutual displays of anger and aggression. This case illustrates how a micro-interactional analysis of risky work situations can reveal the mechanisms of violence and inform situational prevention strategies. Implications. We provide methodological and theoretical guidance for incorporating microsociological analysis into workplace violence research. Originality. This study demonstrates how a microsociological approach, grounded in a novel video-observational method, yields unique insights into the interactional dynamics that causally shape incidents of workplace violence.",

Against the background of two exemplary theories, a concept is presented which modifies otherwise contrasting models and merges essential features of consciousness into a modified concept. This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

Here, we designed an fMRI task to test how curiosity, as defined by children’s self-reported excitement about learning information, modulates memory and neural activity in 5- to 8-year-olds (n = 60 with behavioral data, n = 51 with fMRI). We observed greater learning when children reported more curiosity. In whole-brain analyses, high-curiosity was associated with greater activation in inferior frontal gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, the thalamus, and the putamen. Curiosity did not modulate activation in preregistered regions of interest (dorsal attention network, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens) but did modulate activation in an exploratory region of interest, the amygdala. Multivariate searchlight decoding revealed local activity patterns that reliably distinguished reported curiosity levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, angular gyrus, precuneus, and cerebellum. Together, these findings suggest that curiosity enhances engagement of language, visual, and attention-related regions during learning in children.",

          "abstract": "Autistic adults experience disproportionately high levels of loneliness, often influenced by social environments that are inaccessible or unaccommodating, rather than a lack of social interest. To address this, some individuals have turned to digital tools, such as companion chatbots, which simulate emotionally supportive conversations as an alternative means of connection. This article critically examines the role of chatbots in alleviating loneliness and promoting the well-being of autistic adults. Following a brief overview of chatbot companions’ technologies and current theories of loneliness dimensions, this argument examines whether these technologies truly provide meaningful support for autistic individuals. By analysing chatbots through the lens of methodologies frequently proposed to mitigate loneliness, the paper highlights the benefits of these technologies in conjunction with ethical considerations, emotional risks, and design limitations—particularly when grounded in normative assumptions regarding communication, loneliness, and relationships. It concludes that, although companion chatbots may function as temporary support for companionship, they must be developed in accordance with neurodivergence-affirming principles to effectively alleviate loneliness and avoid further isolation or dependence for autistic users.",

We also show that an extended version of the REM, endorsed by Marsh et al. (2024), may seemingly be supported by data generated without any direct effects between self-concept and achievement.

Using repeated occurrences of such inattentional deafness, alongside objective and subjective awareness probes, we measure the processing of supraliminal, but undetected words. In two pre-registered EEG experiments (N = 67), we show a unique, temporally late, neural response that differentiates words from pseudowords in the absence of conscious awareness. Additionally, an exploratory analysis found a behavioral interference of undetected words with visual task performance. Both results were contingent on the relevance of word detection to participants, implying that auditory non-conscious processing is not automatic but goal-dependent. Overall, our results support flexible capabilities for non-conscious speech perception, suggesting the ability to integrate acoustic information over time.",

          "abstract": "In today’s world, humans collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) and often make judgments with the help of AI assistance in such contexts as medical diagnoses. Greater AI accuracy and trustworthiness is generally regarded as the goal of designing decision-support AI systems. However, highly accurate AI may not always provide optimal assistance. Rather, AI with bias, especially in the direction opposite to an individual’s bias, may improve the accuracy of individual judgment. This is because the AI’s bias will cancel out the individual’s bias (e.g., individuals’ overestimation bias is corrected by AI’s underestimation bias). In this study, we call such aggregation of human and AI biases resulting in a change of final judgment “bias interaction.” We investigated such interactions using a simple perceptual judgment task simulating medical judgments. First, a theoretical analysis using computer simulations showed that optimal AI assistance depended on individuals’ biases. Second, two behavioral experiments demonstrated that AI with biases in the direction opposite to participants’ biases tended to improve participants’ accuracy. However, participants tended to evaluate such AI as being less trustworthy. The theoretical and empirical results of our study raise questions about conventional beliefs that attribute superiority to more accurate and trustworthy AI. We also discuss the practical implications of designing AI to be a better collaborator.",

          "abstract": "Climate misinformation has been identified as a barrier to mitigative action. One prominent example occurred when the 2019/2020 “Black Summer” bushfires in Australia were blamed on arson. This claim is cognitively attractive because of its simplicity and was widely publicised at the time, but also thoroughly debunked. In two experiments, we examined the impact of a misleading article implicating arson as the primary cause of the Black Summer fires on Australian (Exp. 1, N = 509) and Canadian (Exp. 2, N = 506) participants’ reasoning, associated donation behaviour, and climate change attitudes. The misinformation significantly influenced reasoning about the Black Summer and future fires in both experiments; it also reduced the donations of Australian participants to a local climate organisation and impacted Canadian participants’ reasoning about a novel, conceptually related (but fictional) flooding event. Corrections were largely effective at mitigating misinformation impact. A bolstered correction that portrayed climate change as an important causal factor through its impact on risks and emphasised the multicausality of natural disasters was more effective than a simple correction that merely refuted the misinformation. Climate change attitudes were largely unaffected by the misinformation and interventions. Our findings demonstrate that event-specific climate misinformation can influence reasoning beyond a specific event, and that corrections are broadly useful for combatting its effects.",

This study investigates whether social connectedness can be improved by modulating inter-brain coupling, a neural correlate of successful social interactions, through neurofeedback. Using an inter-brain neurofeedback system (i.e., a multi-brain computer interface that provides real-time visualizations of inter-brain coupling between dyad members), we showed dyads real-time visualizations of the extent to which their brainwaves (electroencephalography signals) were “in sync”. Our results showed that, compared to a sham control group, who received feedback based on randomly generated signals, dyads receiving real multi-brain neurofeedback exhibited an increase in inter-brain coupling, and, critically, that this increase was associated with a higher sense of social connectedness. A chain mediation analysis suggested that this experience of enhanced social connectedness may have been driven by a sense of joint control and shared intentionality. Together, our findings demonstrate the potential of inter-brain neurofeedback to modulate inter-brain coupling and to support key components of social connectedness.",

However, critics argue that persistent demonstrations of suboptimal perceptual decision-making indicate limits in representational complexity. We contend that suboptimality arises not from genuine limits, but participants’ resource-rational adaptations to task demands. For example, when tasks are solvable with minimal attention to stimuli, participants may neglect information needed for complex representations, relying instead on simpler ones that engender suboptimality. Across three experiments, we progressively reduced the efficacy of resource-rational strategies on a carefully controlled decision task. Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational strategies were effective, and favored complex representations when ineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or complex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an epistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory of perception.",

          "abstract": "Emotion regulation plays a role in the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Most of the research in this area has focused on how people regulate their own emotions, a process called self-emotion regulation, or self ER. Self ER strategies are well-established predictors of PTSS. However, people also regulate their emotions with the help of others, a process called social emotion regulation, or social ER. Relative to self ER, social ER is understudied, and its associations with PTSS and self ER are unclear. Therefore, we examined the relationships between self ER, social ER, and PTSS using a network analysis. Adults with a history of direct trauma exposure (N = 1,061) reported on their use of four social ER strategies (soothing, social modeling, perspective taking, and enhancing positive affect), two self ER strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression), and PTSS. We identified ER nodes that had the greatest bridge expected influence (EI) centrality with PTSS. Expressive suppression (a self ER strategy) had the strongest bridge EI centrality in the network, followed by soothing and social modeling (two social ER strategies). Expressive suppression was also differentially associated with social ER strategies. Although longitudinal research is needed to establish the direction of effects, these findings underscore the importance of evaluating the roles of both self and social ER in the development and maintenance of PTSS.",

          "abstract": "Prototype and exemplar theories of categorization have been compared for decades. However, little research has examined why individuals adopt different approaches to categorization. The aim of the present studies was to investigate individual differences in prototype and exemplar categorization. Study 1 examined how global and local processing, autistic traits, and analytic-holistic cognition relate to category representations using Medin and Schaffer’s (1978) 5–4 categorization task. Participants completed the classification task, followed by a Navon task to assess attentional processing and self-report trait measures. Results showed that reaction times on the Navon task had some associations to categorization strategy, suggesting that global processing abilities may be related to category learning. Study 2 experimentally manipulated attentional focus by priming participants’ attention either globally or locally before completing the 5–4 categorization task. Although priming did not significantly influence strategy use, attention weight analyses revealed nuanced differences in how participants allocated attention to stimulus features. Specifically, participants who focused on the details, attended to less optimal stimulus features when classifying. These findings contribute to our understanding of individual differences in categorization and category learning and highlight the role of attentional focus in shaping category representations",

This preference for “sycophantic” (or overly agreeable and validating) chatbots may entrench beliefs and make it challenging to deploy AI systems that open people up to new perspectives. Across three experiments (n = 3,285) involving four political topics and four large language models, we found that people consistently preferred and chose to interact with sycophantic AI models over disagreeable chatbots that challenged their beliefs. Brief conversations with sycophantic chatbots increased attitude extremity and certainty, whereas disagreeable chatbots decreased attitude extremity and certainty. Sycophantic chatbots also inflated people’s perception that they are “better than average” on a number of desirable traits (e.g., intelligence, empathy). Furthermore, people viewed sycophantic chatbots as unbiased, but viewed disagreeable chatbots as highly biased. Sycophantic chatbots’ impact on attitude extremity and certainty was driven by a one-sided presentation of facts, whereas their impact on enjoyment was driven by validation. Altogether, these results suggest that people’s preference for and blindness to sycophantic AI may risk creating AI “echo chambers” that increase attitude extremity and overconfidence.",

Individuals with pediatric onset conditions represent a large proportion of the global burden of complex and severe disability, and will likely benefit significantly from such systems.

          "abstract": "Recent work suggests that people tend to use lexical causal statements (like X activated Y) to\nexpress a productive concept of causation—where one event causes another when the first event\nproduces the second—and periphrastic causal statements (like X caused Y to activate) to express\na counterfactual concept—where one event causes another when if the first had not happened,\nthe second would not have too. A critical test for this account comes from the action effect and its\nreversal: in conjunctive structures (X and Z cause Y), people tend to judge actions as more causal\nthan inactions, but in disjunctive structures (X or Z cause Y), people tend to judge actions as less\ncausal than inactions. Critically, productive concepts of causation have no explanation for the\nreverse action effect. So, if people use lexical and periphrastic causatives to express distinct\nconcepts of causation, they should show a reverse action effect for periphrastic but not for lexical\ncausal statements. If, however, people use counterfactual thinking when considering causal\nstatements generally, they should show a reverse action effect for lexical and periphrastic causal\nstatements. In Experiment 1, I replicated the action effect and its reversal with periphrastic causal\nstatements. In Experiment 2, I investigated whether the reverse action effect depends on\ncausative type, and I found the reverse action effect for lexical and periphrastic causal\nstatements. These findings suggest that counterfactual thinking affects causal judgment across\ncausative types, which is consistent with the view that people have a singular, counterfactual\nconcept of causation.",

          "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are robust predictors of later mental and physical health problems, yet methodological inconsistencies in their measurement complicate prevalence estimates and cross-cultural comparisons. The present study provides the first nationally representative data on ACEs in Serbia while critically examining current scoring practices and proposing a novel normalized scoring system. Data were collected from a stratified national sample of adults in Serbia using the ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ; WHO, 2018). Thirteen ACE domains were assessed with binary and scaled items. Prevalence was calculated using two recommended WHO scoring methods (binary and frequency), and a new normalized scoring approach in which each domain was rescaled to a 0–1 range. Criterion validity was tested against trauma-related symptoms and physical health outcomes. Prevalence estimates varied dramatically depending on the scoring method: physical abuse was reported by 50.2% (binary) versus 7.8% (frequency), and emotional abuse by 78.8% versus 23.9%. Binary scoring suggested that over half of respondents experienced four or more ACEs, while frequency scoring indicated that 37% reported none. The normalized scoring approach produced more nuanced distributions and showed consistent associations with both trauma symptoms and health outcomes, particularly respiratory and neurological problems. Findings underscore the need for standardized ACE scoring methods. The proposed normalized approach enhances psychometric clarity, facilitates cross-cultural comparability, and improves the utility of ACE assessment for epidemiological research, clinical practice, and public health interventions.",

          "authors": "Mike W.-L. Cheung",
          "abstract": "There are various statistical models with different features and assumptions in meta-analysis. Popular models are, for example, the fixed-effect (or common effect), random-effects, and mixed-effects models. Apart from these models, several alternative models, such as the multiplicative error model (unrestricted weighted least squares model), the hybrid of additive and multiplicative error models, and the location-scale model, have been proposed in the literature. Understanding these models can be challenging for researchers without a solid mathematical background. Implementing or modifying these models is even more challenging for researchers unless they have advanced statistical and programming knowledge. This tutorial elucidates a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework to understand these models. Several R packages are introduced to facilitate the\nspecifications and generation of graphical models for these meta-analytic models. More importantly, researchers may use the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation method to fit these models. This holds significant potential across two domains. First, it can be used as an educational tool in teaching and learning meta-analytic models. Second, the framework supports developing and evaluating novel meta-analytical models,\nwhich have not yet been implemented in current meta-analysis software, fostering advancements in meta-analytic methods. This tutorial also demonstrates with three real datasets how to extend it to address research questions involving complicated meta-analytic models, including nonlinear models, multivariate meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM). Limitations and future directions to extend the SEM-based meta-analysis are discussed.",

This research explores menstruation stigma is enacted in discussions around menstrual health both socially and with healthcare professionals. Reflexive thematic analysis of 45 semi-structured interviews with menstruating women, provides insights into the complex interplay between hegemonic femininity and menstrual stigma in how women approach menstrual health conversations with each other and healthcare providers. Results illustrated how enacted stigma as well as internalisation of stigma and hegemonic femininity contributed to participants’ sense of anticipated stigma, which inhibited their ability to communicate openly about menstruation outside of close informal support networks. Stigma experiences eroded participants’ trust in healthcare providers, and resulted in self-censorship in conversations about menstruation more broadly. However, the research also shows how empowering positive healthcare interactions can be, and a number of participants engaged in menstrual activism by resisting menstrual taboo. By highlighting the experiences of young women in menstrual health communication, this research contributes to our understanding of the pervasive impact of menstrual stigma and patriarchal norms of femininity, while shedding light on the potential to harness change through supportive healthcare interactions and everyday menstrual activism.",

The current study examined changes in secondary school students’ social and emotional loneliness and problematic social media use (PSMU) following a total smartphone ban, and the extent to which these changes depended on students' initial levels of social avoidance and distress (SAD). Our sample included 982 students (Mage = 14.1) from two Dutch secondary schools implementing a total smartphone ban. Students completed questionnaires about loneliness, PSMU, and SAD before the ban (W1) and three months following the ban (W2). Data were analyzed using difference score and multiple regression analyses. Students used substantially less social media during school breaktimes post-ban compared to pre-ban. Further, we found a small mean-level increase in emotional loneliness from pre-ban to post-ban. While mean levels of social loneliness remained stable, higher baseline levels of SAD predicted increased social loneliness post-ban. There were no changes in PSMU at the mean level nor in relation to students’ baseline levels of SAD. Taken together, we did not find that a total smartphone ban alleviates secondary school students’ loneliness and problematic social media use in the short term. On the contrary, such a ban may entail an initial adjustment period and may not be a one-size-fits-all solution for improving students’ socio-emotional functioning.",

The sample included 184 mothers, most of whom had higher education.\nResults: Parental stress was significantly directly associated with lower caregiver responsiveness. Additionally, depressive symptoms partially mediated the relationship (for MRQ, but not PRS) between parental stress and responsiveness. The effects of personality traits were statistically non-significant.\nConclusions: Parental stress emerged as the most consistent predictor of caregiver responsiveness, underscoring its central role in shaping parental behavior.

          "abstract": "The achievement goal perspective highlights the importance of mastery-approach goals in facilitating students’ academic achievement. However, a socio-ecological lens would suggest that the effectiveness of these mastery-approach goals might vary across different levels of income inequality, specifically national- and school-level income inequality. Understanding the role of income inequality is essential for advancing a socio-ecologically sensitive achievement goal approach. This study examines whether the association between mastery-approach goals and academic achievement is moderated by national- and school-level income inequality. Our hypothesis is that the adaptive benefits associated with mastery-approach goals are weaker in socio-ecological contexts with higher national- and school-level income inequality. The study involved 273,269 students nested in 10,785 schools from 33 countries. The results revealed that both national- and school-level income inequality significantly moderated the associations between mastery-approach goals and academic achievement in the three focal subjects of mathematics, reading, and science. Both national- and school-level income inequality weakened the positive role of mastery-approach goals, and this was especially pronounced for lower socioeconomic status students. These findings underscore the importance of considering socio-ecological contexts when evaluating the impact of mastery-approach goals on academic outcomes, highlighting the need to address both achievement goals and broader socio-ecological contexts to support academic success for all students.",

          "abstract": "Early theories of perception as probabilistic inference propose that uncertainty about the interpretation of sensory input is represented as a probability distribution over many interpretations—a relatively complex representation. However, critics argue that persistent demonstrations of suboptimal perceptual decision-making indicate limits in representational complexity. We contend that suboptimality arises not from genuine limits, but participants’ resource-rational adaptations to task demands. For example, when tasks are solvable with minimal attention to stimuli, participants may neglect information needed for complex representations, relying instead on simpler ones that engender suboptimality. Across three experiments, we progressively reduced the efficacy of resource-rational strategies on a carefully controlled decision task. Model fits favored simple representations when resource-rational strategies were effective, and favored complex representations when ineffective, suggesting that perceptual representations can be simple or complex depending on task demands. We conclude that resource-rationality is an epistemic constraint for experimental design and essential to a complete theory of perception.",

We address this gap by applying sparse equation discovery (SINDy) to a large happiness dataset from a gambling task (N = 16,337) and introduce DynAffect-C, a unified model that separates and quantifies endogenous and exogenous inertia. DynAffect-C recovers known value-signaling effects and, with regulatory baseline-attraction terms, explains substantially more moment-to-moment variation than value-only models. The model reveals nonlinear pull toward baseline affect, alternating mood states in a subset of participants, and a trade-off between stronger internal momentum and transient impacts of external events. The result integrates two literatures and yields a unified theory and testable equation for affect.",

          "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly common in the psychology and neuroscience literature to use Bayes factors to provide evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The most common approach reports a Bayes factor that compares the null hypothesis to a “default” alternative. This approach can show that the data is more likely to have been generated under the null hypothesis than under the specific alternative tested, but it cannot provide evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, analyses using default alternatives can return evidence in favor of the null hypothesis when the data is consistent with medium to large effects. I show that common interpretations of these Bayes factor analyses are misleading, and I provide examples and simulations that help to understand what a Bayes factor in favor of the null does and does not tell us. I argue that Bayes factors have no special ability to help us understand null effects when compared to frequentist methods such as equivalence testing and confidence intervals.",

          "abstract": "Apathy, characterized by diminished motivation and reduced goal-directed behavior, is prevalent in normal aging. Recent evidence suggests that it may result from biases in the evaluation of costs and benefits during decision making. However, most research has focused on simple decisions involving the trade-off between motor or cognitive effort and monetary reward. Meanwhile, it is possible that the disrupted real-life decisions of people with apathy reflect biases affecting many other dimensions of value. Additionally, the extent to which mood symptoms that frequently co-occur with apathy also contribute to biases in decision making is unclear. To address these gaps, we developed a novel online task completed by 158 older adults who first rated everyday activities (e.g., watching TV, going to the park) across 19 value attributes (e.g., enjoyment, social obligation), and then made a series of choices between random pairs of the different activities. A factor analysis of attribute ratings identified three latent factors representing reward, effort, and obligation, which strongly predicted choices and choice response times. Apathy was selectively associated with an overweighting of effort-related attributes in models controlling for impulsivity, depression, or anhedonia; it did not affect the weighting of reward or obligation-related attributes. Interestingly, impulsivity, which was positively correlated with apathy, was associated with an underweighting of effort. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling supported these findings, showing that apathy and impulsivity modulated the influence of effort on the rate of evidence accumulation in opposite directions. Overall, these results suggest that decisions about everyday activities rely on the integration of a wide range of value attributes and that apathy is selectively associated with an overweighting of the effort dimension of value, driving choices away from activities that require greater effort.",

Participants listened to and rated perceived pleasure for melodies that varied in predictability while we measured pupil dilation as an index of attention and arousal. Participants then learned to play the ending of each melody. We found that pupil dilation during listening was sensitive to musical predictability and liking ratings, with pupil size increasing for more liked and more predictable melodies. During the motor learning task, participants’ asynchrony scores were modulated by liking and predictability: more predictable melodies resulted in lower asynchrony overall while more liked melodies elicited steeper learning slopes. During recall, more predictable melodies were better recognized. Finally, individuals with better recognition performance also showed greater pupil dilation during the initial listening, along with steeper motor learning slopes. Altogether, these findings indicate that arousal is linked to predictability and pleasure, and that all three factors influence auditory encoding, motor learning and explicit recognition of musical stimuli.",

We argue that further theoretical and practical progress requires addressing three key challenges: (1) some claims are inherently difficult to identify as objectively false, (2) researchers and the public may not always share a common epistemology, and (3) each of these creates challenges in developing social consensus about what is and is not misinformation. To this end, we introduce a framework grounded in critical realism, which assumes that a mind-independent reality determines the consequences of (mis)information belief, but that evidence can be partial, contestable, and accessed through different psychological and epistemic lenses. Within this framework, we define evidence retrievability as a time-indexed property of claims and distinguish objective misinformation (claims that contradict reality) from attributional misinformation (claims labeled false within a given epistemology). We then present an agent-based model that assigns agents trust weights over different evidence channels, such that epistemic conflict arises when agents discount others’ evidential standards, and epistemic bridging occurs when they adopt them. Our simulations provide an initial illustration of how objective and attributional misinformation can diverge, and that bridging may produce a socially cohesive but objectively false consensus when evidence retrievability is low.

While ISL has several characteristics of unconscious processing (e.g., it operates unintentionally, produces subjectively unconscious knowledge), participants in ISL experiments always report some fragmentary conscious knowledge. Thus, the notion that ISL is truly an unconscious process has been the subject of perpetual debates. In the present study, we challenge the assumption that these conscious reports reflect direct access to the acquired knowledge. Building on predictions from key theories of consciousness and suggestive evidence in the literature, we tested the hypothesis that participants’ conscious reports in ISL reflect a post hoc conscious model of their non-conscious knowledge. Across two artificial grammar learning experiments, participants were exposed to sequences of stimuli (letters, faces, or body movements in VR) generated by different artificial grammars. In a subsequent test, they decided whether novel strings were grammatical or not and reported their subjective awareness trial-by-trial. In both experiments, we found extreme Bayesian evidence that repetitions embedded in the testing strings made participants more aware of the knowledge driving their grammaticality decisions, above and beyond their influence on responses or accuracy. This suggests that, lacking access to the true basis of their decisions, participants attributed their responses to the most salient feature available—the repetitions. Thus, we find evidence that our conscious experience can misrepresent not only the external world but also our own unconsciously learned representations.",

Out of the myriad of existing illusions, however, rarely are they produced thanks to priors about the physics of our world. Here, we present a novel illusion of this kind — the Double Ring Illusion — which demonstrates that a representation of the physical constraint of solidity (i.e., objects cannot pass through one another) shapes perception. Thus, when viewing ambiguously rotating rings that are compatible with multiple interpretations, the percept is strongly altered by the solidity constraint: Observers predominantly perceive the interpretation respecting solidity rather than the alternative interpretation where solidity is violated. A series of experiments first confirmed that observers reliably experienced this illusion. We then demonstrated that the effects of the illusion influence orthogonal perceptual judgments of object width, thus ruling out decision-level processes as a driver of these effects. Furthermore, we showed that the solidity constraint shapes visual processing even when the stimuli are unambiguous thanks to additional motion and depth information. And finally, we found that the visual system predictably makes use of solidity even in contexts other than the Double Ring Illusion. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of a robust prior for solidity in visual processing, guiding the computations of object motion and interaction.",

Understanding these dynamics is crucial for educators supporting children’s academic development and mental health. The present study examined the development of children's mathematics and reading skills alongside their corresponding anxieties, focusing on how and if these domains influence each other over two time points in grades 2 and 3. A Finnish sample of 800 children (409 girls) was assessed in Grade 2 (N = 668) and Grade 3 (N = 711) using standardized tests for reading and arithmetic fluency, while self-evaluation questionnaires measured reading and math anxiety. The single-domain models for math and reading revealed a bidirectional relationship between math anxiety and arithmetic fluency and a unidirectional relationship between reading fluency and reading anxiety. The cross-domain models revealed only one significant positive cross-domain path from reading fluency to arithmetic fluency. The lack of other significant longitudinal cross-domain associations suggests early domain-specificity. Concurrently, higher math and reading anxiety were associated with lower fluency across domains, but this may be due to being assessed in the same situation. No gender differences were found in the longitudinal associations between skills and anxiety. Overall, the findings highlight that the associations between skills and anxieties become interconnected as early as Grades 2–3, both concurrently and longitudinally, suggesting the emergence of potential reciprocal cycles that may contribute to slower learning and heightened achievement-related anxieties.",

          "authors": "Justine Fiévé; Maxim Likhanov; Pascale Colé; Isabelle Regner",
          "abstract": "Background. Gender differences in academic performance are well documented, with boys often outperforming girls in mathematics and girls excelling in literacy. Yet, the psychosocial processes underlying these disparities remain insufficiently understood, particularly in primary school.\nAims. This study tested whether such gaps are already evident in third grade and examined the roles of academic self-esteem, achievement goals, and perceived parental academic involvement as explanatory mechanisms.\nSample. Participants were 185 French third graders (98 girls, 87 boys; M = 8.73 years, SD = 0.36) from 20 classes across eight socioeconomically diverse schools.\nMethods. Students completed standardized mathematics and literacy tests and questionnaires on psychosocial factors. Analyses included t-tests to assess gender differences, hierarchical regressions and mediation models to assess the role of psychosocial factors.\nResults. Boys outperformed girls in mathematics (d = 0.35), whereas girls outperformed boys in literacy (d = 0.52). Comparison of objective vs. subjective performance showed that boys tended to overestimate their abilities in both domains, whereas girls underestimated themselves, particularly in literacy. In mathematics, self-esteem fully mediated the gender gap. In literacy, gender, self-esteem and mastery-avoidance goals contributed to performance, but only mastery avoidance partly mediating the effect of gender on performance. \nConclusions. Mathematics disparities appear primarily driven by self-esteem, while literacy outcomes reflect a more complex influence. Detecting these processes by third grade underscores the need for early interventions that strengthen girls’ confidence in mathematics and reduce avoidance-oriented motivations in literacy.",

          "abstract": "Numerous studies have documented racialized disparities in school disciplinary practices, with students from stigmatized racialized groups facing harsher punishment than their non-stigmatized peers. These disparities are often attributed to teachers' negative stereotypes. However, psychological theories have largely overlooked the impact of contextual factors, such as racialized segregation and the demographic composition of school environments, on teachers' decision-making processes. Drawing on ecological systems theory, we identify three gaps in the psychological literature on racialized disparities in school discipline: (1) the restricted focus on teachers’ interactions with individual students, (2) the neglect of superordinate contextual levels, and (3) the limited consideration of racialized segregation patterns. To address these gaps, we introduce a context-based discrimination model, which holds that the racialized composition of school settings (classrooms, schools, and surrounding areas) shapes teachers’ social categorization, stereotyping, and decision-making processes. We define context-based discrimination as the phenomenon whereby overall discipline rates between school settings systematically vary with their racialized composition. Crucially, effects of context-based discrimination may not be limited to students from stigmatized racialized groups, but may also affect non-stigmatized peers in a school setting. To understand how inequality is reproduced in educational settings, psychological science must investigate how structural context shapes teacher behavior.",

This study explores the (1) prevalence, (2) quality of in-person and online-only friendships, and (3) age and gender differences in these characteristics among Latin American youth. In Study 1, 5159 students between 10–17 years of age from Peru reported on the prevalence and perceived positive qualities of online-only and in-person friendships. In Study 2, 3154 students from Bolivia and Uruguay reported on the prevalence and positive and negative qualities of their in-person and online-only friendship(s). We analyzed cross-sectional trends in friendship quality (Studies 1 and 2) and, for a subset of youth with available data in Study 2 (N = 516), changes in the prevalence and quality of friendships between two data waves. More than one-third of participants reported having an online-only friend and, on average, declared twice as many in-person friends. Best in-person friendships involved both greater closeness but also greater discord than best online-only friendships. There were no differences in exclusion. Boys reported greater intensity of overall discord towards their best in-person friends and online-only friends compared to girls. In contrast, girls reported stronger closeness towards their best in-person friends than boys. Older adolescents reported stronger closeness towards their best online-only friends than younger adolescents. The findings indicate that adolescents rely on in-person friends for positive friendship support to a greater extent than online-only friends. However, despite overwhelming emphasis on the psychological drawbacks of online friendships, our findings suggest these friendships may also be associated with less negative qualities and do not necessarily discourage formation of in-person friendships.",

          "abstract": "While bystander reactions to violence against humans have been well studied, less is known about how people react to animal abuse. We studied whether the same psychological predictors are relevant to reactions to the abuse of animals and humans. We examined the role of Dark Tetrad traits (Narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and sadism), ideologies of superiority (social dominance orientation and speciesism – the belief in human superiority over non-human animals), as well as moral disengagement, self-efficacy, and descriptive social norms in predicting reactions to animal and child abuse. In a survey study (N = 518), participants indicated their general reactions to animal abuse as well as how they would react in a situation depicting the abuse of a dog and a child.  The general reactions to animal abuse were best predicted by the Dark traits and the endorsement of the ideologies of superiority, most significantly, sadism and speciesism. Both animal and child abuse elicited high and comparable levels of distress and active response intentions. In addition to the general predictors mentioned above, bystander reactions in the case of animal abuse were predicted by lower moral disengagement and perceived self-efficacy, while it was moral disengagement alone that predicted reactions to child abuse. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the relevant psychological aspects of reactions to violence and empowering citizens to react more actively to abuse and violence.",

          "abstract": "Introduction. Determining which interventions meaningfully foster students’ socio-emotional learning (SEL) remains an urgent concern in educational and psychological research. Valid statistical conclusions about an intervention’s effect, however, require robust experimental designs with adequate sample sizes. Therefore, the availability of appropriate and reliable estimates of design parameters for a priori power analyses is crucial.\nMethods. To generate a comprehensive database of design parameters for SEL research, we analyzed data from nine German probability samples involving students in grades 1 to 13. These data covered self-oriented, other-oriented, and task-oriented domains of SEL outcomes, assessed via student self-report, parent rating, and teacher rating methods. Using linear and multilevel regression modeling techniques, we estimated the following design parameters: Intraclass correlations at the classroom and school level as well as the proportions of variance explained by different sets of covariates (sociodemographic characteristics, baseline measures, their combination) at the student, classroom, and school level. We also derived meta-analytic summaries of these design parameters, broadening their applicability.\nResults. The compiled SEL design parameters along with meta-analytic summaries span both the overall student population and subpopulations defined by academic tracking. This provides a flexible foundation for a range of study designs, including single-level (non-clustered), two-level (students nested within schools), and three-level (students nested within classrooms nested within schools) randomized experiments.\nDiscussion. The present database, complemented by extensive supplemental material, serves as a curated and practical resource for planning sufficiently powered randomized intervention studies targeting students’ SEL outcomes.",

Our objective in this research was to rely on the MEP to further our understanding of athlete perfectionism on two key points. First, we focussed on a scale designed to measure dispositional perfectionism and excellencism – the Scale of Perfectionism and Excellencism (SCOPE) – and tested the factor structure of an adapted version of the SCOPE for athletes (SCOPE-A). Second, we addressed the substantive question of whether perfectionism, beyond excellencism, is beneficial, unneeded, or harmful for athletes’ thriving (i.e., experiencing high levels of well-being and performance satisfaction). We analyzed data collected across four samples of athletes (total N = 1,549). The results of confirmatory factor analyses and multiple regression analyses provided evidence to support the factor structure of scores from the SCOPE-A, and the conclusion that, when it comes to athlete thriving, perfectionism is almost always unneeded and excellencism is almost always good enough. These results shed new light on the connection between excellencism, perfectionism, and athlete thriving, and contribute to future research examining the effects of excellencism and perfectionism in athletes using the SCOPE-A.",

          "abstract": "Workplace inclusion is fundamental to fostering diversity and equity in organizations, yet it\nremains inconsistently defined and operationalized in the literature. This paper integrates\nresearch on the psychology of belonging with social network analysis to propose a framework\nthat bridges organizational practices of inclusion, meso-level network dynamics, and individual\nexperiences of belonging. We define inclusion as the organizational structures, policies, and\npractices that foster a sense of individual belonging; we conceptualize belonging as stemming\nfrom an individual's experience of value, reciprocity, and fit. And we argue that organizational\npractices of inclusion shape individuals’ experiences of belonging in part by re-shaping the\nsocial networks that comprise their daily interactions. Drawing from social network research, we\nposit key structural indicators of individual-level belonging, including network centrality,\nbidirectional ties, and structural equivalence, which shape employees’ experiences within\norganizations. Applying this framework, we then highlight how employees from marginalized\ngroups are disproportionately excluded from informal networks, restricting their access to\ninformation, mentorship, and advancement opportunities, and changing the affordances of\nnetwork positions. We argue that social network analysis provides a potential tool to diagnose\nand address these disparities, enabling organizations to measure and intervene in structural\nbarriers to inclusion. By linking organizational-level practices of inclusion to the richly theorized\nindividual-level experience of belonging, with networks serving as the bridge, we provide a\nroadmap for future research and practical interventions that promote retention, well-being, and\nengagement among diverse groups of employees and advance a more coherent and actionable\napproach to fostering inclusion in the workplace.",

However, responsible deployment requires controls around non-deterministic outputs and safety evidence.\n\n\nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate the user safety risk and early signals of clinical effectiveness of a clinician-curated generative AI care agent for anxiety and depression symptoms, using large-scale simulation and real-world testing.\n\n\nMethods: The digital program investigated delivers a structured Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) skills training program through a constrained generative AI architecture. A multi-agent safety system combining synthetic high-risk scenario testing, automated harm detection, and clinician oversight was developed to ensure user safety. Safety and early indications of symptom reduction were assessed through 1) evaluation of 43,325 simulated responses to a mix of high and low-risk synthetic patients, and 2) in a 2-week prospective study of US adults with moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression (N=85).\n\n\nResults: In simulation experiments, potentially harmful outputs occurred in &lt;1 in 10,000 responses (0.01%, 95% CI [0.01%, 0.03%]); none encouraged harm to self or others, judged or actively invalidated the user, or used offensive language. In real use, no harmful outputs were observed (&lt;1 in 12,000), no serious adverse events occurred, and deterioration rates were 5% and 3% for anxiety and depression symptom scores respectively (within expected bounds for psychotherapy). Clinically meaningful reductions were seen for anxiety (B = −5.3, d = 1.1) and depression (B = −5.8, d = 1.2) symptoms, with &gt;50% of users meeting responder criteria after a median of ~90 minutes of use.\n\n\nConclusions: A constrained generative AI architecture with multi-layered safety oversight can deliver clinically aligned and safe mental health support. Although controlled trials are needed to confirm intervention effectiveness, this dual evaluation, combining high-throughput simulation with real-world deployment, offers a scalable model for the responsible use and continual evaluation of generative AI in mental healthcare.",

          "abstract": "Prior knowledge strongly influences memories for new experiences, typically distorting a new experience to better ‘fit’ within our prior conceptions. While conceptual features, like category membership, have long been shown to induce memory distortions, perceptual features of to-be-remembered information, like color, can also distort memories. We investigated whether conceptual and perceptual features of new episodic memories – when in competition – equally contribute to a memory’s distortion, or if there is a hierarchy of featural influence. To do so, we used a spatial learning task that has been shown to induce distortions in new location memories due to the influence of prior knowledge. Image locations were organized by conceptual or perceptual features (e.g., separate clusters of birds and blue things), and some images were placed in locations that conflicted with one or both cluster types (e.g., a raven placed away from most birds, a blueberry placed away from most blue things, a blue jay placed away from both). Memory distortion was measured as the extent that these conflicting images were retrieved closer to their respective cluster locations relative to their encoded locations. We observed that in isolation, both conceptual and perceptual features contribute to memory distortions of equivalent magnitude, but when competing, images were predominantly biased toward their conceptual cluster. This greater conceptual distortion persisted even when changing the encoding task to one that prioritizes processing of perceptual features. These results suggest that conceptual features play a privileged role in the organization of new long-term memories regardless of encoding demands.",

We also manipulated perceptual load, memory stage (encoding vs. recall), and attentional focus on the auditory modality. \n\nOur design enabled us to isolate the contribution of cross-modal correspondence under varying cognitive demands. Under low load, sounds improved performance regardless of their correspondence, likely by enhancing alertness. Under high load, performance improved only when audiovisual correspondence was present and irrespective of attentional allocation. \n\n These findings suggest that lightness-pitch correspondence influences memory under increased cognitive demands, supporting predictions from Bayesian models of learned associations.",

          "abstract": "Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

          "abstract": "Over the last 20 years, personality development has become one of the most widely studied topics in personality science. However, evidence on normative and event-related personality development stems almost exclusively from Western countries, providing limited insight into the cross-cultural generalizability of personality trait changes. To address this limitation, we used data from the Africa Long Life Study to examine personality development in young adults from Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa over 1 to 2 years (N = 2,382). We found that the cross-cultural Big Two personality traits – Agency and Communion – were moderately rank-order stable over 1 year, with test-retest correlations of r = .38 to r = .55. In contrast to our expectations, Agency and Communion significantly decreased across the study period. Finally, using open-ended questions, we investigated the most important life changes of our participants and examined their associations with personality trait changes. We found that personality trait levels predicted the occurrence and perception of life events, while the occurrence and perception of life events, in turn, predicted personality trait changes. Overall, our findings were partly in line with but also partly diverging from findings on personality development from Western countries. This suggests that insights into personality development cannot automatically be generalized across cultural contexts but that a careful examination of which personality development phenomena are universal and which are culture-specific is warranted. Our study provides initial indications that environment-driven personality trait changes may be a mechanism of personality development that generalizes across cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether listening effort, as measured by pupil dilation and perceived listening effort (PLE) ratings, varies depending on whether the speech is produced by a speaker with mixed spastic-flaccid dysarthria secondary to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus a neurotypical speaker, and whether the listener accurately perceives the spoken phrase.\n\nMethod: Thirty-four listeners completed a speech perception task while an eye-tracking camera tracked their pupil dilation. Phrases in the task were produced by a speaker with dysarthria secondary to ALS and a neurotypical speaker. After hearing each phrase, listeners repeated what they heard and rated PLE on a 7-point Likert scale. Phrase repetition accuracy (accurate vs. inaccurate) was determined from their verbal response. Generalized additive mixed-models (GAMMs) were used to evaluate the relationship of the speaker type (ALS vs. neurotypical), phrase repetition accuracy and their interaction with pupil dilation. PLE ratings were similarly evaluated using linear mixed-effects (LME) models.\n\nResults: Both pupil dilation and PLE ratings were greater when presented with the phrases produced by speaker with dysarthria relative to the neurotypical speaker, even when the phrase was accurately perceived by the listener. Inaccurately perceived phrases were associated with greater pupil dilation and PLE ratings than accurately perceived phrases. Interaction effects were revealed between speaker type and phrase repetition accuracy for pupil dilation but not for PLE ratings. Additionally, pupil dilation results indicated that the allocation of effort over time differed between the trials produced by both speakers.\n\nConclusions: The results suggest listening effort is increased overall when listening to speaker with dysarthria compared to neurotypical speech, even when intelligibility is preserved. Although there was some overlap in the results for the pupil dilation and PLE ratings, notable differences suggest these measures are likely sensitive to distinct factors influencing listening effort.",

          "abstract": "In recent decades, the average age of parents at the birth of their children has increased. Older parents have generally completed their education, are emotionally more mature and usually have work experience and their own income, which can be an advantage for their children’s development. On the other hand, the risk of mutations (in the father) increases as the parents get older, and there are also general health risks (especially in the mother). This means that both positive and negative factors for cognitive development are linked to the age of the par-ents. In our study with five diverse samples from different ethnic backgrounds, we covered an age range of 6 to 18 years (primary and secondary schools in Austria and Ecuador, N=920), used tests for both fluid and crystallized intelligence, and used target-specific measures for control variables. We calculated correlations and regressions between parental age and chil-dren’s intelligence (controlling for parental education, parental income, number of children, birth order and sex of children). Positive (linear) correlations were found in four out of five samples, on average r=+.10 to r=+.11 (N=920). Curvilinear (quadratic, inverted U-shaped) correlations are higher than linear ones (R=.20). The association with the age of the mother is somewhat stronger (father RF=.16 vs. mother RM=.19). The effect of parental age remained positive when other family variables were taken into account in a regression: beta=+.19. The par-ents’ level of education was more relevant (beta=+.28). Even if the possible effects are not large, there are predominantly positive (statistical) effects of the age of parents at the birth of their children on the development of their children. The slight inverted U-shaped curvilinearity in-dicates an optimal age for expectant parents of around 25/30 to 40 years.",

          "authors": "Thuy-vy Thi Nguyen",
          "abstract": "Humans are social, yet during moments of distress, brief time alone helps recovery. We ran two ecological momentary assessment studies – with adult (N=110; 6 prompts/day for 7 days) and preregistered adolescent sample (N=69; 6 prompts/day for 10 days). General negative experiences (negative emotions, worsened mood) predicted higher odds of preferring solitude, and so did social experiences (loneliness, high social load). Preference for solitude under distress emerged despite whether the person was with others or alone, so it is not just about wanting to get out of unpleasant social encounters. In adolescents, while such desire for solitude is generally avoidance-driven, those prone to social stress also preferred this time for regulatory aims – rest,  autonomy, and reflection. Overall, the patterns support an allostatic view: the everyday desire for time alone is to help manage demand, not merely to escape; it highlights moments when withdrawing, rather than seeking more socialization, may be preferable.",

          "abstract": "Birth order has long been argued to be an important individual difference variable for domains such as personality and achievement. However, after many decades of research, the evidence for a birth order effect is scarce at best. Less is known about the role of birth order for social relationships, in particular romantic relationships. This paper re-examines a previously reported finding that firstborns report less romantic jealousy than laterborns. We present data from four samples (total n &gt; 950) with a MANOVA design, mirroring the study on which this original claim was based. Across all samples and multiple robustness checks, we found no statistical support for the claim that firstborns report less jealousy than laterborns. Both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses did not support a birth order effect on jealousy (frequentist estimate:  r = .08, 95% CI [-.018, .172]). These findings challenge the notion of birth order as a significant predictor for romantic jealousy and suggest that research on romantic relationships may yield greater insight by focussing on other individual difference variables than birth order.",

          "authors": "Jordan Poppenk",
          "abstract": "Here I advance an account of hippocampal memory grounded in three features: locally integrated computation; representational plasticity; and graded long-axis receptive field sizes. Together, these premises reposition the hippocampus as a multiscale integrator, in which variable tolerances for pattern overlap are fundamental to operation. Lower tolerances (associated with the posterior hippocampus; pHPC) elicit frequent “trace breaks” in memory integration, yielding temporally dense and structured representations with high retroactive interference. These traces comprise an episodic memory store of detailed, sequential, and infrequently accessed information. Higher tolerances (associated with anterior hippocampus; aHPC) elicit less frequent trace breaks, yielding a lower density of sparse, accessible representations that support an atemporal and non-episodic hippocampal memory store of information integrated over overlapping events. By layering these experiences using non-monotonic learning rules, this store establishes summaries and inference without executive overhead, while also supporting episodic search and prospective thinking. Because these memory systems emerge from divergent tuning of a common hippocampal architecture, they share features such as shared circuitry, rapid encoding, and cortical reinstatement. I describe this more integrative aHPC store as tableau memory, based on its temporally folded synthesis of events, and propose testable predictions in the domains of list-learning, novelty, and contextual processing. By abstracting experiences persistently and automatically, this store helps to reconcile the hippocampus’ known roles in memory specificity and integration, and to support constructive operations required for numerous non-memory functions. Overall, the model reframes hippocampal memory as a system that captures and mobilizes meaning across a variety of biologically relevant timescales.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas; Melanie B. Fessinger",
          "abstract": "Research Summary\nWe compared ratings provided by 355 judges and 372 laypeople on the ethicality of various prosecutorial behaviors and whether they should be investigated as possible misconduct. Most prosecutorial behaviors were sourced from exoneration cases and varied from highly egregious misconduct (e.g., manipulating exculpatory evidence) to more questionable in nature (e.g., opposing a defense expert witness on Frye grounds). Results showed that laypeople had generally stricter ethical standards—perceiving acts as more unethical (d = 0.36) and more worthy of investigation (21 of 27 acts; 77%) compared to judges. Notably, however, this varied based on individual acts. For some acts, specifically those with clearly established legal rules, judges had stricter ethical standards instead. Overall, our data showed wide variation in ethicality and investigation judgments across individuals, across respondent type, and across specific acts. \nPolicy Implications \nLaypeople were more skeptical of prosecutorial discretion than judges—a skepticism that may be justified given that many of the behaviors stemmed from wrongful conviction cases. Yet, as experts, judges are in a better position to identify and report misconduct. This discrepancy between who perceives and who reports misconduct may partly explain why misconduct is seldom investigated or sanctioned. Laypeople, however, are not powerless to mitigate such injustices. As jurors, awareness of misconduct can protect them from being unduly influenced by improper prosecutorial tactics. As members of the court of public opinion, laypeople shape narratives about justice processes, apply pressure for institutional accountability, and can mobilize collective action when official outcomes clash with public values. Most critically, as voters, laypeople influence the platforms on which prosecutors run and who ultimately gets elected, which can help drive more ethical institutional norms within prosecutors’ offices. Our results highlight the challenges facing prosecutorial oversight and accountability, underscoring the roles that judges and laypeople can play in addressing them.",

          "abstract": "The prevalence of religious beliefs and practices is puzzling from the evolutionary viewpoint, but previous research suggested that religious traditions provide cooperative benefits and improve well-being. Seemingly in contrast with this claim are worldwide secularization trends where people disaffiliate from religions and belief in god(s). Theoreticians suggested that diminished pressures on cooperation and well-being no longer motivate individuals to seek religious benefits and pay the participation costs. We investigate this causal claim using the National Study of Youth and Religion dataset, which tracks the development of religiosity among US Christians from adolescence to young adulthood (n = 3 370). Using a general lagged panel methodology, we found that material security in Wave 1 (early adolescence) predicts higher probability of decrease in belief in God in Wave 4 (young adulthood). This result provides support for the hypothesis that participation in religious traditions is associated with living in an insecure socio-ecology, where the systems may still confer benefits onto their members. We conclude with a call for further research using more nuanced measures and larger sample sizes that may provide further insights into the potentially adaptive  nature of cultural systems.",

          "abstract": "For decades, investigators have been wary of subjective measures of visual mental imagery such as the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) and have sought an objective alternative. A method for substituting a measure of hippocampal asymmetry for subjective measures of visual mental imagery ability is presented. Individual differences in VVIQ scores were shown to be strongly associated with left-right (L/R) asymmetry in hippocampal subfields. In samples of 20 and 53 healthy people, and 38 people with neurological conditions, a significant relationship was found between L/R hippocampal subfield volume ratios and VVIQ scores. A regression of VVIQ scores against hippocampal subfield asymmetry variance yielded R-squared values of .91, .91 and .99 respectively. A sample of 201 participants with the Memory Experiences Questionnaire yielded R-squared equal to 1.0 for the association between memory imagery experience and hippocampal L/R subfield asymmetry variance. A measure of anterior/posterior hippocampal asymmetry variance also yielded R-squared equal to one for its association with imagery ability. These finding points to a robust link between hippocampal asymmetry variance and the vividness of mental imagery. The greater variability in hippocampal subfield asymmetry may reflect enhanced lateral specialization and functional differentiation to support richer VMI. Individual differences in neuroanatomical asymmetry of the hippocampus appear to play a previously underappreciated role in controlling mental imagery experience.",

Study 1 (N = 6,353 participants from 36 countries) examined the negative relationship between societal freedom (as measured by the Human Freedom Index) and generic conspiracy beliefs. Study 2 (N = 44,458 participants from 52 countries) focused on interest groups-related COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs - a measure not explicitly refering to government actors. Moving to the individual level, Study 3 (N = 278) examined relationships between perceived societal freedom and various conspiracy beliefs, while Study 4 (N = 246) experimentally tested whether manipulating perceptions of societal freedom affected belief in generic conspiracist beliefs as well as those related to vaccines and financial crises. Results indicated that both greater societal freedom and higher perceived societal freedom are associated with lower levels of conspiracy beliefs. In Study 5 (N = 592), we examined the psychological mechanisms mediating the relationship between perceived societal freedom and conspiracy beliefs and found the significant indirect effect of political anger. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of how both macro-level conditions can be incorporated into efforts to reduce the prevalence of conspiracy theories.",

          "authors": "Miles R A Tufft; Daniel C. Richardson",
          "abstract": "Sharing a task in the real world can be more efficient than doing it alone. However, psychology experiments using shared task paradigms have often revealed a cognitive cost from working together. Research on joint action has shown how people track and prioritise the actions and intentions of task partners even when this generates cognitive interference and impairs performance. In contrast, we present four experiments using the picture–word interference (PWI) task in which joint action removed cognitive interference and facilitated performance. In the standard PWI task performed alone, participants respond to target pictures while ignoring distractor words written on top. If picture–word pairs are related (e.g., apple–orange) then responses are slowed compared to when they are unrelated (e.g., apple–book), known as semantic interference. In our joint version of the task, we removed semantic interference by telling participants they would be collaborating with a partner who was responsible for the distractor words (Experiment 1, N = 77). Furthermore, interference was only removed when participants believed that their partner was responding specifically to the words (Experiment 2, N = 78), was perceived as high in social status (Experiment 3, N = 80), or high in task competence (Experiment 4, N = 76). We propose this demonstrates how people can deprioritise information associated with partners on shared tasks. In doing so, they can reduce their own cognitive demands by leveraging the cognitive resources of others to support an efficient division-of-cognitive-labour. We term this social offloading.",

          "abstract": "Humans are efficient at learning new behaviors through verbal instructions, bypassing the need for trial-and-error learning, but requiring a certain degree of cognitive flexibility. Recent theories suggest that abstract functions of cognition, like cognitive flexibility, can be (up)regulated by contextual features in our environment with which they are associated. Here, we tested whether people show a more flexible control mode in contexts where one frequently learns new task instructions. Specifically, participants had to encode and execute a series of new task instructions, and the likelihood of encountering a new (relative to old) task instruction varied in function of whether the instruction was presented above versus below the center of the screen (Experiment 1, n = 40), or in a blue versus green font (Experiment 2, n = 40). We measured the level of interference from retained new task instructions on secondary task performance to index cognitive flexibility, and show enhanced flexibility (i.e., enhanced receptibility for new task instructions) for contexts in which the likelihood of encountering new task instructions was relatively high.  Similarly, participants were also faster to encode new instructions in these contexts. A third, online study (n = 77) replicated the main finding of Experiment 2, whose context manipulation (i.e., font color) was most effective. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive flexibility can bind to, and be signaled by, contextual features in our environment. Such ‘learning when to learn’ provides a (self-)regulating mechanism for the cognitive processes that support the encoding (and execution) of new task instructions.",

          "abstract": "What does it mean to listen, and what enables people to do it well? This study examines the cultural foundations, conditions, expressions, and outcomes of listening through a qualitative analysis of 20 semi-structured interviews with Israeli participants. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we identified five interrelated themes showing how listening is shaped by relational closeness, emotional safety, internal motivation, behavioral expression, and emotional impact. Participants described listening as an intentional and emotionally effortful process, grounded in trust, cultural norms, and personal willingness to remain present. It was experienced not only through visible behaviors but through authentic emotional presence and attunement. Crucially, listening was described as the most vulnerable and most revealing in contexts of conflict, emotional strain, or power asymmetries, where relational and ethical demands intensify. These findings highlight listening as a culturally situated, interpretive practice shaped by collective norms, emotional intensity, and social hierarchy. This study contributes to context-sensitive models of listening with implications for interpersonal relationships, organizational leadership, and intercultural communication, particularly in high-conflict or culturally diverse environments where listening serves as a key relational and managerial resource.",

Our analyses consider more than a thousand concepts, and demonstrate that  average usage frequency across dozens of languages is a relatively good predictor of the typological prevalence of lexicalization across hundreds of languages.

Here, we assessed the psychometric properties of Western-derived instruments, prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms, association with psychosocial and socio-demographic factors, and symptom network structures in a large multi-year sample of Kenyan adolescents. \n\nMethods: We administered depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), social support, perceived control, and wellbeing measures to 7,865 Kenyan secondary school students aged 13-20 across three studies (2021-2023). \n\nResults: Both PHQ-8 (α = 0.70) and GAD-7 (α = 0.78) showed adequate reliability. Factor analyses yielded 1-factor structures with good model fit (PHQ-8: RMSEA=0.052, CFI=0.945; GAD-7: RMSEA=0.056, CFI=0.970). Overall, 30.3% and 25.1% met clinical cut-offs for depression and anxiety, respectively, with striking temporal variation: prevalence peaked in 2021 (41.9% depression, 37.7% anxiety), decreased in 2022, then partially rebounded in 2023. Mixed-effects modeling revealed social support (B = -0.10 for depression, B = -0.11 for anxiety) and perceived control (B = -0.27 for depression, B = -0.22 for anxiety) as robust protective factors. Final school year students showed elevated risk (B = 1.41 for depression, B = 1.36 for anxiety). Students in girls' schools demonstrated significantly higher symptoms (B = 1.57 for depression, B = 1.48 for anxiety) compared to mixed-gender schools. Contrary to expectations, minority tribal status showed no significant associations with either depression or anxiety symptoms. Academic performance demonstrated clear dose-response relationships, with excellent performance associated with substantially lower depression (B = -2.54) and anxiety (B = -1.78) symptoms. Network analysis identified worry-related anxiety symptoms as most central, with hopelessness and nervousness serving as key bridges between depression and anxiety domains. Elevated-symptom groups showed higher network connectivity (global strength = 3.58 vs 3.26). Multidomain analysis revealed optimism as the most central variable across psychological domains. \n\nDiscussion: Western-derived measures met psychometric standards with Kenyan adolescents. Depression and anxiety showed high prevalence with pandemic-related temporal patterns and significant associations with academic stress, school environment, and psychosocial resources. The elevated symptoms in girls' schools highlight important environmental factors requiring further investigation. Network findings identify potential intervention targets and demonstrate how mental health symptoms embed within broader psychological systems in this understudied population",

          "abstract": "Are children and adults sensitive to gaps in their knowledge, and do they actively elicit information to resolve such knowledge gaps? In a cross-situational word learning task, we asked 5-year-olds, 6- to 9-year-olds and adults to estimate their knowledge of newly learned word–object associations. We then examined whether participants preferentially sampled objects they reported not knowing the label in order to hear their labels again. We also examined whether such uncertainty-driven sampling behaviour led to improved learning. We found that all age groups were sensitive to gaps in their knowledge of the word–object associations, i.e. were more likely to say they had correctly indicated the label of an object when they were correct, relative to when they were incorrect. Furthermore, 6- to 9-year-olds and adults—but not 5-year-olds—were more likely to sample objects whose labels they reported not knowing. In other words, older children and adults displayed sampling behaviour directed at reducing knowledge gaps and uncertainty, while younger children did not. However, participants who displayed more uncertainty-driven sampling behaviour were not more accurate at test. Our findings underscore the role of uncertainty in driving 6- to 9-year-olds’ and adults’ sampling behaviour and speak to the mechanisms underlying previously reported performance boosts in active learning.",

          "authors": "Jicheng Chen; Jia Jiangkun; Jia Ensuo; Han Mengmeng; Huang Liwen",
          "abstract": "Natural science is founded on materialism. We treat the independent relationship between inner experience and outer physical entities as an axiom. This cognitive paradigm has successfully explained many natural phenomena; however, certain phenomena, such as those in quantum mechanics and psychological experiments, challenge this view, suggesting the inseparability of the inner and outer. Yet, the inner and outer appear to be distinct categories of existence, and experimental models demonstrating their transformative relationship remain lacking. This has led to issues like the explanatory gap. We propose that adopting holism is a potential solution to reconcile this dilemma: the inner experience can be objectively described and possesses objective causal efficacy. According to holism, objective reality and a causal relationship are not absolute but inseparable from the cognitive perspective. Materialism's view that the inner and outer exist as independent relations is an underlying assumption based on the third-person perspective rather than an axiom. From the third-person perspective, the physical properties of things are described, and we establish a causal relationship confined to spacetime, where things interact through physical medium. This cognitive perspective excels at describing the laws of motion governing simple systems but simultaneously introduces limitations, such as the explanatory gap. From the first-person perspective, the holistic attributes of things can also be objectively described. \"Inner\" and \"outer\" can be seen as two different states of experience, and things here interact holistically without a physical medium, forming causality unrestricted by spacetime. This perspective excels at revealing the laws governing complex systems/phenomena and can reconcile the explanatory gap. These two cognitive perspectives, although superficially opposed, are functionally complementary. Therefore, the generalized complementarity principle based on holism provides a falsifiable research approach for the \"subjective\" interpretation of quantum theory, potentially reconciling the contradictions between quantum theory and relativity. Holism also offers a solution for reconciling divergent viewpoints among consciousness theories, enabling phenomena related to consciousness across multiple disciplines to be explained within a unified theoretical framework. To test these hypotheses, we propose an experimental model to demonstrate that, similar to the role of force that we revealed in the third-person perspective, holistic interaction without a physical medium from the first-person perspective is also an objective way of interaction between things. Under holistic interaction, the inner experience, as a holistic attributes of things, can also produce observable and objective causal efficacy.",

Eingeschlossen wurden RCTs, systematische Reviews und Metaanalysen, die Interventionen untersuchten, welche von psychiatrischen Pflegefachpersonen durchgeführt wurden. \nErgebnisse: Es wurden 28 RCTs aus 13 Ländern eingeschlossen, die überwiegend in ambulanten bzw. gemeindenahen Setting durchgeführt wurden, häufig mit Fokus auf Personen mit Schizophrenie oder anderen schweren psychischen Erkrankungen. Die Interventionen lassen sich vier Gruppen zuordnen: psychologische/psychotherapeutische, psychosoziale/selbstmanagementorientierte, ganzheitlich-kreative sowie strukturell-systemische Ansätze. Die untersuchten Outcomes waren vielfältig, ließen sich jedoch in Symptome, Recovery-bezogene Perspektiven, soziale Teilhabe sowie Gesundheitsverhalten bzw. Inanspruchnahme von Diensten einteilen. Positive Effekte wurden konsistent für psychische Symptome, soziale Funktionsfähigkeit und Gesundheitsverhalten berichtet. Die Ergebnisse für Adhärenz und Krankheitseinsicht waren heterogen, während die meisten Studien überwiegend keine klaren Effekte für körperliche Parameter zeigten.\nSchlussfolgerungen: Psychiatrische Pflegeinterventionen zeigen ein deutliches Potenzial zur Verbesserung patientenbezogener Outcomes. Ihre breitere Implementierung im deutschsprachigen Raum erfordert gezielte Schulungen, klare Rollenprofile und unterstützende Rahmenbedingungen. Zukünftige Forschung sollte stärker Recovery-orientierte Outcomes, PROMs und PREMs berücksichtigen und Studiendesigns einsetzen, die komplexe pflegerische Interventionen adäquat abbilden.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) show impaired social cognition, which may contribute to altered trust judgments and increased vulnerability to health risks like sexually transmitted infections. Along with aberrant salience attribution in SZ, the salience network, a key system for processing socially and emotionally relevant information, might contribute to altered social risk attribution.\n\nMethods: Patients with SZ, a clinical control group of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD), and healthy controls (HC) were asked to rate the trustworthiness of persons pre-classified as HIV+ or HIV- based on a previous study, while imagining to be in a dating context. Behavioral ratings during fMRI, post-ratings of trustworthiness, attractiveness, and HIV probability were collected, and brain activity focusing on the salience network and its connectivity were analyzed.\n\nResults: All groups rated HIV+ pre-categorized person as less trustworthy than HIV− ones. SZ patients showed generally higher trust ratings, accompanied by reduced connectivity between the salience network and regions involved in social-cognitive processing. Activation in insula and nucleus accumbens was more influenced by attractiveness in SZ than HC. AUD patients exhibited increased insula connectivity during untrustworthy evaluations, and activation in reward-related brain regions was less modulated by perceived trustworthiness than in HC.\n\nDiscussion: Our findings point to differential biases in trust evaluation across clinical groups, and suggest distinct patterns of salience attribution. In SZ, increased trust and stronger neural responses to attractiveness, paired with reduced integration of risk-related cues, may reflect a diminished ability to detect socially relevant threats. In contrast, AUD patients showed enhanced sensitivity to negative social cues. These results demonstrate how altered salience attribution in trust perception shows differently across disorders, with SZ being characterized by under-attribution of social risk and AUD by heightened threat sensitivity.",

Therefore we ask: what are the effects of\ndifferent forms of emotional appeals on vote choice, also taking into account different\n(political) contexts and preferences? To answer this question, we integrate perspectives\nfrom political science, psychology and communication science and propose a wide range of\npreregistered hypotheses. To test them we introduce an innovative Leader Choice Task,\ni.e., a visual conjoint experiment displaying two election posters simultaneously. Each\nelection poster shows a political candidate with a manipulated emotional expression,\na statement regarding different political issues with different positions on that issue,\nvarying emotional tone. we embedded this task in 9 online survey experiments and\none lab experiment (total N = 12,108) conducted in the Netherlands, Poland, Greece\nand the United States. Across the 10 studies, we find consistent evidence that people\nare attracted by positive emotional appeals (in tone and expression) and disapprove of\nnegative emotional appeals. These effects hold across different manipulations of issue\ncongruence, issue salience, threat-related issues, slogans, politicians’ facial dominance,\nintuitive vs deliberative contexts, government versus opposition politicians and countries.\nThe only strong moderator we find is ideology: among right-wing participant candidates\nwith negative tone are more popular than among left-wing and centrist participants.\nTaken together, our findings demonstrate the persuasive power of positive emotional\nappeals, an important message in a time of increasing negativity in politics",

          "abstract": "Advances in AI have enabled chatbots to provide warm, personalized support. Yet, little is known about the long-term consequences of AI companionship. Across a 12-month longitudinal study with more than 2000 adults from four Western countries, we examined the bi-directional relationships between social chatbot use and loneliness. We found consistent evidence that increased social chatbot use predicted increased loneliness, using a single-item measure of emotional isolation. When we used a broader and more stable measure of social connection, we found consistent evidence that feeling less socially connected predicted subsequent increases in social chatbot use; however, chatbot use did not significantly predict decreases in social connection. Taken together, these findings provide initial evidence that being lonely may spur people to seek companionship through chatbots, but that such use may, over time, exacerbate feelings of loneliness. We urge caution, however, in drawing strong conclusions, given the exploratory nature of our analyses.",

          "abstract": "As part of a broader research programme, this paper empirically investigates the direct relationships between three prominent cognitive biases—Overconfidence Bias (OB), Herding Bias (HB), and Decision Avoidance Bias (AB)—and the behavioural outcome of Procrastination (PR) in workplace decision-making. Building upon the theoretical foundation of a preceding study  (Ohms, 2025g), and addressing gaps concerning non-investment contexts and the Singaporean workplace identified in a systematic review (Ohms, 2025h), this study employs a mono-quantitative, cross-sectional survey methodology (Ohms, 2025f). Data were collected from 365 Singaporean employees and underwent validation procedures, including outlier detection, normality assessment, and reliability testing (Ohms, 2025a) to ensure a robust basis for analysis. The paired sample t-tests, correlation analysis, and multiple regression results revealed a highly significant, strong positive relationship between AB and PR (r = 0.797, p &lt; 0.001). Conversely, OB exhibits a significant weak negative correlation with PR (r = -0.222, p &lt; 0.001), while HB displayed no significant correlation. Therefore, AB was validated by multiple regression as the only significant predictor of PR in the base model. These findings show that procrastination is directly influenced by cognitive shortcuts, which supports behavioural economics and organisational practice. They also emphasise how crucial it is to address decision avoidance to improve the efficiency of decision-making in Singaporean work settings.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) frequently utilises a “cotherapy” model, in which two therapists jointly support participants or patients through preparation, dosing, and integration sessions. While common in clinical trials, the experience of cotherapy from the participant perspective remains underexplored. \n\nThis qualitative study examined experiences of cotherapy within a trial of psilocybin-assisted therapy for generalised anxiety disorder. Semi-structured interviews with 18 participants (29 interviews in total) were analysed thematically, guided by Affordance Theory to consider how cotherapy dynamics shaped therapeutic possibilities. Three major themes were developed: (1) Dose day cotherapy: safety, trust and the realities of access; (2) Cotherapy influences therapeutic processes; (3) Cotherapy shapes the impact and credibility of therapeutic insights.\n\nTogether, these findings position cotherapy in PAT as both a safety and supportive measure, and a potentiator of therapeutic processes. In the context of a single site with high levels of clinician qualification and training, participants generally valued cotherapy. Insights from this study can guide clinical practice and future research, so that feasibility and accessibility are enhanced while preserving the safety and therapeutic benefits afforded by cotherapy.",

          "authors": "Hongkai Mao; Yuan Chang Leong; Yutong Jiang; Alex Koch; William J. Brady; Joshua Conrad Jackson",
          "abstract": "Most people believe that social media discourse is negative and divisive. Here we show how this negativity can evolve even when users are not motivated to be negative. We propose that social media users seek to differentiate themselves from other users, and it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity than positivity because negative information is more heterogeneous and counter-normative than positive information. This makes users increasingly likely to post negative comments as a conversation unfolds and it becomes more challenging to make unique contributions. Analyzing 2.05 billion comments from 2,150 Reddit communities shows that comments become more negative over time, both within threads and community histories. This trend towards negativity is mediated by the semantic uniqueness of comments, suggesting that it arises from users differentiating themselves. This trend is strongest when initial dialogue is positive, making negative comments highly counter-normative. We replicate these patterns in a multigenerational experiment simulating social media dialogue (n = 4,000). Participants become more negative over time, but only when incentivized to be unique, and especially when dialogue begins positively. These findings suggest that the structure of social media platforms interacts with human motivation to foster a drift towards negativity over time in online discourse.",

          "abstract": "This paper explores how political demands transform into collective rights through a psychological lens, emphasizing the process of naturalization. Building on Moghaddam et al.'s framework, the authors introduce the idea that collective demands, when reframed as rights, are perceived as inherent, timeless, and essential to group identity. The paper discusses psychological mechanisms like essentialism, autochthony beliefs, and collective continuity, illustrating how groups come to view their demands as fundamental aspects of their existence. The authors explore examples from the Middle East’s ethno-political conflicts and food sovereignty movements, showing how rights claims are naturalized to strengthen group identity and mobilize action. However, the paper also highlights the potential negative consequences of this process, such as deepening social polarization and complicating conflict resolution. By framing rights as eternal, these demands become resistant to negotiation, often intensifying divisions rather than fostering shared human values. The study calls for a more nuanced understanding of rights discourse in contemporary political struggles.",

          "authors": "Stephanie Aurora Cárdenas",
          "abstract": "Objective(s): Strategic overcharging involves threatening disproportionately harsh punishment to widen the differential between the potential sentence if convicted at trial (PTS) and the plea sentence. Though larger discounts increase plea acceptance, excessive PTSs can counterintuitively reduce acceptances when holding discount constant. Drawing on anchoring theories, I investigated whether PTSs anchor defendants’ sentencing preferences, alter case appraisals, and influence plea decisions.\n\nHypotheses: I predicted (a) transparently irrelevant numeric anchors would not affect plea decisions; (b) a disproportionately harsh PTS would raise maximum acceptable sentences; and (c) higher sentencing preferences would increase plea acceptance.\n\nMethod: Prolific.com adults read a felony-DUI vignette and rendered a plea decision. Experiments 1 (N = 247) and 2 (N = 193) presented irrelevant anchors (48 vs. 8 months); Experiment 2 framed the anchor as a starting point for adjustment or hypothesis-testing. Experiment 3 (N = 844) presented more severe, prosecutor-threatened PTSs (18 vs. 4 years vs. none).\n\nResults: Irrelevant anchors did not alter plea decisions, ORExperiment_1 = 0.95 [0.57, 1.57]; ORExperiment_2 = 1.01 [0.56, 1.80]. In Experiment 3, the 18-year PTS increased sentencing preferences (d18_vs_4 = 1.04 [0.87, 1.22]; d18_vs_No-PTS = 0.75 [0.58, 0.92], but paradoxically increased estimates of acquittal (OR18_vs_4 = 1.74 [1.25, 2.44]; OR18_vs_No-PTS = 1.56 [1.12, 2.18]), strengthened perceptions of favorable evidence (d18_vs_4 = 0.26 [0.09, 0.42]; d18_vs_No-PTS = 0.22 [0.06, 0.39]), and increased plea rejections (OR18_vs_4 = 8.25 [4.41,15.42]).\n\nConclusions: PTS values may operate through distinct psychological pathways—altering sentencing preferences through less elaborative processes, but case appraisals via more elaborative processes. This challenges the rational-actor model assumption that treats PTS and conviction likelihood as independent, exogenous inputs to defendants’ plea decisions. Practically, overcharging may backfire from its intended strategic goal by causing defendants to overestimate their trial prospects.",

          "abstract": "Objective. The aging of the population has led to an increase in dementia diagnoses, highlighting the importance of neuropsychological assessments. However, several factors, including test anxiety, could significantly impact cognitive performance on these tests. While research has established links between test anxiety and poorer tests results in younger populations, the extent of its effects on neuropsychological testing in older adults remains largely unknown. Method. This study used data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) to examine the influence of test anxiety, assessed in 342 cognitively unimpaired older adults during a standardized clinical assessment (Benson Complex Figure Immediate and Recall Copy, Verbal Fluency, Trail Making Test (TMT) part B, WAIS-R Digit Symbol, Craft Story 21 Recall Immediate and Delayed, Number Span Test Forward and Backwards and Multilingual Naming Test (MINT)). The Social Behavioral Observer Checklist was used to categorize participants based on their displaying of self-conscious reactions and anxiety responses during testing. Analyses of covariance assessed differences in performance across the cognitive tasks, adjusting for sex, education, and age. Results. Our study indicated that both anxious and self-conscious individuals performed significantly worse than their counterparts on tasks of delayed recall (Craft Story Recall and Benson Figure recall). Conclusions. These findings suggest that delayed memory is most vulnerable to test anxiety in older adults. Overall, the study emphasizes the relevance of addressing test anxiety in clinical assessments and further investigate the links with anxiety related to dementia to ensure accurate evaluations of cognitive function in older adults.",

          "abstract": "A central challenge in consciousness research is to dissociate perception from awareness using\nrigorous, bias-free methods. Traditional approaches often suffer from two key limitations: the\ncriterion biases in reporting perceptual (un)awareness, and the criterion content fallacy, where\nawareness measures do not capture the specific information required to perform the perceptual\ntask. These problems are compounded by the widespread use of single-object paradigms, which\ntypically involve presenting isolated stimuli near threshold and suppressing them with masking\ntechniques. These constraints result in a low signal-to-noise ratio that severely limits sensitivity to\ndetect effects, and offer low ecological validity. Here we introduce a novel paradigm based on\nensemble perception that overcomes these long-standing limitations. Experiment 1 used a bias-free\ntwo-interval forced-choice task in which observers had to discriminate the predominant category in\nensembles comprising animate and inanimate items and also detect which interval contained the\ntask-relevant features Experiment 2 extended these findings with a single-interval design, addressing\nconcerns about potential detection inefficiencies. Multiple control analyses across experiments\ndemonstrate robust unconscious ensemble perception: observers reliably discriminated\nensemble-level properties even when detection of the task-relevant features was at chance.\nAdditionally, Bayesian ideal observer modeling anchors these findings within a computational\naccount of unconscious perception. Together, our findings demonstrate that perceptual processing\nof complex visual summaries can occur without conscious awareness - a phenomenon we term\nensemble blindsight. The work offers a new framework for studying visual consciousness beyond\nthe limits of traditional single-target paradigms.",

          "abstract": "Classical musicians’ individual practice time is central to their musical life and development, yet little research has examined the cognitive and affective processes that influence its effectiveness. This study investigates boredom, mind-wandering and flow during classical music practice, both on the trait and state level (i.e., during practice in general as well as during a specific session) as experiences associated with practice effectiveness. Classical musicians (N=105) completed two 20-minute practice sessions and filled out questionnaires beforehand, between sessions, and after the second session. Boredom emerged as a clear negative correlate for all performance outcomes: Trait boredom during practice was negatively associated with performance satisfaction, while state boredom was negatively related to both efficacy and creativity in a specific practice session. No significant associations were found between trait or state mind-wandering during practice and any outcome variables. Flow during practice, on the other hand, was positively associated with both efficacy and creativity. These findings suggest that while boredom is robustly linked to poorer outcomes and flow to better outcomes in classical music practice, the same is not true for mind-wandering. A possible explanation may lie in heterogeneous nature of mind-wandering and the relative freedom of practice. Given that boredom was consistently associated with less effective, less creative practice and lower performance satisfaction, whereas flow states were linked to more effective practice and higher creativity, future experimental or intervention-based studies should be developed to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms by which cognitive and affective states influence musicians’ practice.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Children’s literature can teach life lessons and effective coping strategies, and can be a way to disseminate evidence-based practices (EBPs) for mental health as a universal prevention strategy. We conducted a content analysis on the presence of EBPs for youth anxiety in children’s literature picture books about anxiety. \nMethod: Analytic plan was preregistered on OSF. 1640 books were screened, and 191 books were coded for eight EBPs for youth anxiety: psychoeducation, labeling body sensations, relaxation, identifying/challenging anxious thoughts, problem solving, contingency management (e.g., rewards and praise), approaching-anxiety provoking situations (i.e., exposure), and post-approach processing.\nResults: Characters in the books modeled an average of 2.39 EBPs (SD = 1.76). The most frequently modeled EBPs were identifying/challenging anxious thoughts (60% of books), approaching-anxiety provoking situations (46%), and labeling body sensations (42%). The least commonly modeled EBP was contingency management (7%). Books written by licensed therapists were more likely to demonstrate post-approach processing. Books with self-help information at the end were more likely to model post-approach processing and relaxation skills. Books written for youth age 9-12 years modeled more EBPs than books written for youth age 8 years and younger.\nConclusions: Children’s books on youth anxiety model relatively few EBPs. Although approaching anxiety-provoking situations was one of the most used EBPs, 54% of books with an anxious character do not model having that character face their fears–a key strategy for youth anxiety. Additionally, few books demonstrate use of rewards and praise by caregivers, who often read stories with their children. Clinicians, caregivers, and librarians are encouraged to purchase books written by therapists or with self-help information in the back, given that these books are more likely to model EBPs.",

          "abstract": "Infant vocal production is closely linked to autonomic arousal yet the developmental transition from reflexive vocal production to vocalisations produced independent of internal state remains unclear. Using naturalistic daylong recordings from wearable devices, we examined the relationship between vocal output and heart rate in 92 infants aged 4 to 21 months. Early vocalisations occurred predominantly at heightened levels of autonomic arousal, but this coupling weakened progressively with age. Daylong heart rate time series associated with vocalisation timing above chance (ROC AUC = 0.64) and hierarchical linear mixed effects modelling confirmed a progressive developmental decoupling. Arousal also strongly associated with the acoustic features of both cry and non-cry vocalisations, with higher arousal associated with higher and more variable pitch, more harmonicity and longer duration. Notably, the influence of arousal diminished with age for non-cry vocalisations but remained stable for cries. This differential developmental trajectory suggests the emergence of parallel vocal pathways: one remaining tied to physiological state for fixed affective signals such as cries and laughs, and another increasingly decoupled from internal states for the functionally flexible signals critical to speech communication. Importantly, infants whose mothers responded contingently to a greater proportion of non-cry vocalisations showed significantly greater decoupling, suggesting that caregiver responsivity plays a role in this developmental trajectory.",

Evidence suggests feelings of similarity drive friendship formation and continuation. Youth who feel dissimilar to peers may have fewer opportunities to develop friendships. In the current study, we developed a Perceived Dissimilarity Scale to assess autistic and non-autistic youth perceptions of dissimilarity to other kids in general and to a friend. We then examined if youth perceptions of dissimilarity associated with related constructs and concurrent and future loneliness. 194 adolescents (36% autistic, 36% female, 64% White, Mage = 12.81) participated in the study. At the first assessment, youth self-reported perceived dissimilarity, perceived disconnection and loneliness and completed an fMRI scan to assess neural similarity. At the second and third assessments, youth self-reported loneliness. Exploratory factor analysis indicated we developed a Perceived Dissimilarity Scale with two discrete subscales (kids vs friend) that had high internal consistency across groups (α’s ≥ .80). Autistic youth experienced more perceived dissimilarity, perceived disconnection and loneliness than their non-autistic peers, particularly to kids rather than to a friend. Autistic youth with greater neural similarity reported more perceived dissimilarity to kids, whereas non-autistic youth with lesser neural similarity reported more perceived dissimilarity to kids. Additionally, perceived dissimilarity to kids mediated the relation between group and loneliness. Our Perceived Dissimilarity Scale is a valuable metric for understanding individual differences in youth and may better explain experiences of loneliness than an autism diagnosis alone.",

These types of missingness in a dataset can lead to problems such as biases in parameter estimates and loss of power during statistical testing, and ultimately, interpretation of findings. Yet, few studies report key information about missingness in their sample. Moreover, while a breadth of information already exists on the types of missingness and potential methods for handling missingness, the field lacks details on how to conduct a missingness analysis in a real-world setting. In this tutorial, we illustrate key steps in handling missing data and provide an opportunity for researchers to practice appropriate steps in identifying the magnitude and patterns of missing data, as well as assess both selection and retention bias. We utilize a large publicly available longitudinal pediatric population-based study with a focus on air pollution as the primary exposure and a type of emotional health behavior, known as internalization, as the outcome.

These multimodal behaviours are manually coded by human researchers, making these approaches susceptible to observer bias, dependent on inter-rater reliability, and substantial demands on time and resources. In this study, we aimed to develop a multimodal machine-learning model that could be capable of automatically detecting and classifying multimodal behaviours from video recordings of caregivers and their infants (N=81; infant mean age = 251.334.9 days) engaging with objects. We focused on four behaviors i.e., caregiver scaffolding, caregiver intrusiveness, infant object engagement and infant distractibility. Low-level features from audio, video, and pose data were extracted using specific AI models, and input into a Transformer-based architecture capable of learning temporal patterns across modalities. Our findings revealed a significant contrast in model performance depending on how the data was partitioned. When the dataset was split such that data from all dyads contributed to the training, validation, and test sets - the models achieved notably high classification accuracy of over 98%. However, following 5-fold cross-validation with dyad-level separation, ensuring that test set dyads were entirely unseen during training and validation, the performance dropped markedly to ~55%. These results suggest that the models did not learn behaviors of interest but instead relied on video-specific or dyad-specific details. This work lays a foundation for future research aimed at refining these models and extending their applicability across diverse caregiving contexts.",

          "abstract": "Students often rely on flawed strategies to compare fractions, focusing on individual components rather than rational magnitudes. Only a handful of studies have explored whether these strategies result in difficulties in other fraction domains or whether they are the consequence of reduced cognitive capacities or attending to the wrong numerical distances (e.g., numerator and denominator distances). Mexican high school students (N=76, mean age=16.18 years) completed a fraction comparison task with pairs either compatible with whole-number rules (e.g., 18/19 vs. 12/19) or misleading (e.g., 23/49 vs. 23/30). Participants completed conceptual and procedural fraction knowledge tests and three executive function tasks. First, cluster analyses revealed that almost half of the students used flawed componential fraction comparison strategies. Particularly, we found two biased (whole-number bias and reverse bias) groups and a third group with overall high performance. Notably, whole-number biased students had lower math achievement, conceptual and procedural fraction knowledge than reverse biased or high-performance students. Next, we probed differences in rational and componential magnitude processing between these groups. Remarkably, both biased groups showed neither rational nor componential distance effects. In contrast, high-performing students' performance was better explained by robust rational distance effects. Together, these results suggest that while fraction conceptual and procedural knowledge distinguish whole-number bias students from reverse-bias and high-performing students, only rational magnitude processing distinguishes between students with flawed strategies and high-performing students.",

          "abstract": "Although moral attitudes are often characterized as stable and rooted in “moral truth,” whether people act on them depends heavily on situational factors. We present a framework for understanding how attitudes, social norms, and perceived control collectively shape moral behavior. People adapt their behavior as they move across social contexts, following norms that either encourage moral behaviors (e.g., expressions of outrage on social media) or restrain them (e.g., professional settings). We explain why people are influenced by norms, focusing on two goals – affiliation (desire to affiliate with one’s group) and accuracy (desire to be morally right in ambiguous situations) – and how these goals become uniquely intertwined in moral behavior. This framework can help explain why people overestimate their willingness to speak out on a moral issue, when people opt out of collective action, and why they engage in moral hypocrisy.",

          "abstract": "How does the brain prioritize information when visual scenes contain multiple relevant features? While emotionally evocative content has long been considered central to attentional capture, recent perspectives highlight the intrinsic relevance of social information. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of these relevance dimensions remain unclear. We co-registered event-related potentials (ERPs) and eye movements while participants viewed complex scenes varying in social content (social, non-social) and emotional valence (positive, negative, neutral). Early ERP responses (P1) showed enhanced amplitudes for positive social images, suggesting that social relevance can mitigate the early-stage negativity bias. Social content also modulated the EPN, while emotional valence shaped later components (P300, LPC), with larger amplitudes for negative scenes. Eye-tracking measures mirrored these effects: initial saccades were faster for social images, and fixation patterns showed increased visual exploration for both positive and negative social scenes compared to neutral. Together, these results support a sequential appraisal process in which social content is prioritized at early perceptual stages, while emotional valence influences later evaluative processing. This pattern challenges the notion of a general negativity bias and highlights the interactive and stage-specific contributions of social and emotional relevance in affective scene perception.",

          "authors": "Christy D. Yoon; Hedda Meadan; Frederick Shic",
          "abstract": "Background: Eye tracking has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing autism research, including diagnostics and interventions. However, studies on joint attention (JA) in autistic children have predominantly concentrated on the responding to joint attention (RJA) construct, with limited focus on the initiating joint attention (IJA) construct. Moreover, despite the interactive nature of JA, researchers have often relied on passive paradigms to study JA in this population. To address these gaps, we developed a gaze-contingent eye-tracking battery targeting three developmentally appropriate JA skills for young children: RJA, IJA to request, and IJA to comment or reference.\n\nMethods: The development process was multifaceted and iterative, involving a series of collaborative steps and the allocation of various resources. These steps included determining the motion format and type of stimuli, designing and prototyping the stimuli, recruiting an actor to serve as a communication partner in the stimuli, recording and editing videos for the stimuli, and building and test-running the battery.\n\nResults: We developed the Interactive Eye Tracking for Joint Attention (IET-JA) battery, which consists of 32 JA stimuli: 16 RJA stimuli, eight IJA-Request stimuli, and eight IJA-Comment/Reference stimuli. The stimuli are dynamic (i.e., videos) and feature a preprogrammed interactive human communication partner who is responsive to the participant’s gaze. The IET-JA takes approximately 8 minutes to complete, and its duration is expected to vary based on the participant’s level of engagement.\n\nConclusion: Implications for advancing methodologies, fostering team science, and enhancing iterative processes are discussed.",

This study examined acceptability of in-person and online remote psychotherapy, integrating quantitative and qualitative perspectives.\nMethod: Convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used. Quantitative data were obtained from 449 adults (18–65+ years) in online survey assessing acceptability, delivery format preference, technology use, cultural influences, and treatment orientation. Qualitative data were acquired in semi-structured interviews with 34 participants (20–62 years) from diverse cultural backgrounds. Thematic analysis explored experiences and perceptions of formats.\nResults: \nIn-person psychotherapy was rated significantly higher for affective attitude, perceived effectiveness, ethicality, and likelihood of recommendation, whereas remote psychotherapy was rated higher for convenience and accessibility. Ethnicity and technology self-efficacy modestly influenced preferences, while cultural influences affected in-person acceptability among specific subgroups (e.g., Arab women). Thematic analysis identified themes: (1) connection and therapeutic presence, emphasising nonverbal cues and physical co-presence for understanding (2) therapeutic space, with structured environments valued for in-person; (3) safety and privacy, emphasising importance of confidentiality and emotional security; (4) practical aspects of online therapy, and (5) perceived suitability of format. \nConclusion: In-person psychotherapy was preferred by most participants, while online delivery was viewed as an acceptable and practical alternative.",

Während ihre Relevanz auf internationaler Ebene hinlänglich nachgewiesen wurde, verläuft die Entwicklung im deutschsprachigen Raum langsamer, und es fehlt an wissenschaftlicher Evidenz zur Wirksamkeit pflegerischer Interventionen.\nZielsetzung: Darstellung und Analyse der Wirksamkeit psychiatrisch-pflegerischer Interventionen auf Basis randomisiert kontrollierter Studien (RCTs) einschließlich Metaanalysen.\nMethode: Es wurde eine narrative Literaturübersicht unter Verwendung von PubMed, Embase und CINAHL durchgeführt (Zeitraum: 2015–2025). Eingeschlossen wurden RCTs, systematische Reviews und Metaanalysen, die Interventionen untersuchten, welche von psychiatrischen Pflegefachpersonen durchgeführt wurden. \nErgebnisse: Es wurden 28 RCTs aus 13 Ländern eingeschlossen, die überwiegend in ambulanten bzw. gemeindenahen Setting durchgeführt wurden, häufig mit Fokus auf Personen mit Schizophrenie oder anderen schweren psychischen Erkrankungen. Die Interventionen lassen sich vier Gruppen zuordnen: psychologische/psychotherapeutische, psychosoziale/selbstmanagementorientierte, ganzheitlich-kreative sowie strukturell-systemische Ansätze. Die untersuchten Outcomes waren vielfältig, ließen sich jedoch in Symptome, Recovery-bezogene Perspektiven, soziale Teilhabe sowie Gesundheitsverhalten bzw. Inanspruchnahme von Diensten einteilen. Positive Effekte wurden konsistent für psychische Symptome, soziale Funktionsfähigkeit und Gesundheitsverhalten berichtet. Die Ergebnisse für Adhärenz und Krankheitseinsicht waren heterogen, während die meisten Studien überwiegend keine klaren Effekte für körperliche Parameter zeigten.\nSchlussfolgerungen: Psychiatrische Pflegeinterventionen zeigen ein deutliches Potenzial zur Verbesserung patientenbezogener Outcomes. Ihre breitere Implementierung im deutschsprachigen Raum erfordert gezielte Schulungen, klare Rollenprofile und unterstützende Rahmenbedingungen. Zukünftige Forschung sollte stärker Recovery-orientierte Outcomes, PROMs und PREMs berücksichtigen und Studiendesigns einsetzen, die komplexe pflegerische Interventionen adäquat abbilden.",

          "abstract": "The ability to discriminate experiences in memory is an important indicator of cognitive health in older age, and a sensitive marker of hippocampal integrity. Measures of mnemonic discrimination, such as the mnemonic similarity task (MST) have the potential to become early diagnostic tools of Alzheimer's dementia. It is thus important to understand how hippocampus-dependent memory functions interact with non-mnemonic processes to determine mnemonic discrimination performance. In this study we investigate which features contribute to mnemonic discrimination in younger and older age. First, we found in a sample of younger (n=93, 20-30 years) and older adults (n=103, 65-82 years) that age impacted performance on the MST above and beyond the effect of perceptual discrimination of 2D novel configurative objects. However, the association between mnemonic and perceptual discrimination slightly diverged across age groups. While we found a weak association in younger adults, there was no relationship in the older group. Next, we acquired similarity and feature difference ratings for the MST lures from younger (n=24, 20-25 years) and older adults (n=26, age&gt;65). Using random forest regression and representational similarity analysis, we found that the two groups exhibited unique similarity rating patterns. Finally, enriching our memory data with the feature information, we showed on the trial-level that mnemonic decisions of older and younger adults are affected by distinct object features. Altogether, these results provide evidence that older adults perceive the differences of lure images distinctively, and they may rely on different levels of representations for mnemonic discrimination.",

          "abstract": "In stratified societies, structural and perceived socioeconomic inequalities increasingly shape adolescents’ learning trajectories—not only through access to resources but also through their self-beliefs and adaptive functioning. This study investigates how both objective socioeconomic status (SES) and perceived academic standing influence the development of general self-efficacy (GSE), a core motivational mechanism linked to learning and well-being. Using longitudinal survey data from 6,994 adolescents in Singapore, we show that subjective perceptions of academic standing significantly mediate the relationship between SES and self-efficacy, underscoring the cognitive salience of relative academic rank in high-stakes systems. We further disentangle adaptability into cognitive, behavioural, and affective domains and identify affective adaptability as the most robust predictor of GSE across all SES levels. Notably, for adolescents in the lowest SES deciles, the predictive value of perceived rank is attenuated, whereas affective adaptability remains a stable, universal predictor. These findings highlight GSE as a malleable cognitive-motivational construct shaped by both sociocultural and intrapersonal factors. We discuss implications for designing equity-oriented learning environments that support emotional adaptability and foster positive learning beliefs, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth.",

          "abstract": "As authoritarianism rises worldwide, understanding authoritarian tendencies among ordinary citizens is an increasingly urgent scientific and societal challenge. However, our understanding of individuals’ authoritarian tendencies is limited by thin empirical evidence on their everyday behavioral patterns. Here, we develop a comprehensive behavioral portrait of authoritarianism in everyday life using more than 280 million digital records collected via smartphones. These records include app usage, music listening, keyboard typing, calling and texting, locking and unlocking, and GPS location logs collected over three to six months from 669 volunteers’ smartphones. We processed the digital records using a theory-informed variable derivation approach, enriched them with data from external sources, and analyzed them using interpretable machine learning methods. Our findings are twofold. First, we find that everyday behavioral patterns predicted self-reported authoritarian tendencies independently of, and more strongly than, demographic characteristics typically linked to authoritarianism. Second, we find that behavioral predictors of authoritarian tendencies included reduced exposure to unfamiliar people and cultures, a preoccupation with status and hierarchy, and heightened aggression and emotionality. Notably, patterns of social media use—particularly greater Facebook use—were the strongest behavioral predictors of authoritarian tendencies. Overall, these behavioral patterns provide insight into the psychology of individuals with authoritarian tendencies, advancing psychological theories of authoritarianism. We discuss the implications of our findings for developing behavioral assessments and interventions that document and potentially counter authoritarianism’s rise among ordinary citizens in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "Efforts to develop “empathic AI” often assume a universal definition for empathy—a singular, objective understanding of “human” experiences. This implies that achieving empathic AI is only a matter of optimization difficulty, where researchers should find the “correct” way to align AI systems with human-like empathy—essentially an engineering problem. In this chapter, we challenge this assumption. We begin by emphasizing the multifaceted nature of empathy. Then, we explore how variations in (1) the multiple forms of empathy and (2) the many groups we are embedded within present significant challenges in creating a universally applicable empathic AI. We discuss the difficulties of codifying empathy (an inherently context-dependent phenomenon) into AI systems, as well as the recent evidence for cultural biases and moral stereotypes in widely used Large Language Models (an important class of AI systems), highlighting the broader ethical, epistemic, and possibly existential issues inherent in designing machines that “understand” or “feel” others as humans do. We conclude by advocating for a more contextualized approach to empathic AI, one that is culture-aware, context-sensitive, and pluralistic, moving beyond the reductionist notion of “humans” as a monolith. We do not intend to address the question in our chapter’s title with a simple yes-or-no answer; instead, we advocate for asking questions such as “What kind of empathy?” and “Empathy for whom?” as researchers and engineers move toward developing more empathic generative language models.",

          "abstract": "Perceiving agency from motion cues is fundamental to social cognition. While goal-directed motion is a well-known agency cue, the role of synchronous motion between inanimate entities remains underexplored. This study examines whether synchrony contributes to agency perception, enhances goal-directed motion cues, and influences metacognitive confidence. In Experiment 1, 78 U.S.-based neurotypical participants watched videos of pre-programmed disc movements, judged whether the discs were chasing, and rated their confidence. Experiment 2 (78 participants) extended the investigation to purposeful interactions beyond chasing. Findings demonstrate that synchrony plays a fundamental role in agency perception, shaping judgments of chasing and purposeful interaction. While chasing perception requires cue integration, with synchrony amplifying directed motion effects, purposeful interaction perception is shaped independently by each factor. Response times and confidence ratings reveal cue integration, suggesting that even when categorical judgments treat cues separately, the perceptual system processes both. Data was collected in August 2024. Age and gender were balanced, but the sample was predominantly White, highly educated, and U.S.-raised, limiting generalizability. While perceptual mechanisms are likely universal, cultural, developmental, and neurocognitive factors may shape higher-level judgments. These findings inform social cognition and interactions with artificial intelligence, highlighting synchrony as key to perceived agency.",

Furthermore, it is unclear if commanding social agents vs. mere physical events changes one's sense of agency. Three experiments, involving making virtual agents clap their hands and/or streetlamps turning on, explore this topic. All three experiments reveal a robust linear increase in explicit agency judgments with follower count. Interestingly, experiments 2 and 3 show that this effect is amplified with human-like avatars (relative to streetlamps), suggesting that there may be something special about commanding a group of human-like social agents.

Although restrictions were interpreted more strictly in some countries than in others, widespread social isolation resulted on an unseen scale, leading to severe negative mental health consequences such as loss of hope, increased anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbance. During this time, while governments were battling the health crisis, musical engagement provided key, individualized coping strategies for laypeople. This was first demonstrated anecdotally in captivating balcony music videos from Italy and Spain and later substantiated in large scale, multi-country survey studies. This chapter reviews the emerging research literature on music listening and making during pandemic lockdown to establish how music became a compensatory source of hedonic pleasure and how it satisfied the need for eudaimonic meaning in life during socially and psychologically impoverished times.",

Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",

In this preregistered study (n=412), we show that rewarding people more on task switch trials led them to show more voluntary switching behaviour, but also more task-rule interference. We further show that it is difficult to unlearn this shift along the flexibility-stability trade-off, even when the mapping between task switching and reward reversed. People with more autism traits or an autism diagnosis were equally fast at learning these contingencies but seemed to start from an overall smaller task-rule interference effect and larger switch costs – suggesting they show higher levels of cognitive stability at the cost of less flexibility. These patterns seemed unique to autism, as we failed to observe similar effects in four major transdiagnostic traits extracted from a principal component analysis based on 15 clinical questionnaires.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, demonstrate that numerical magnitude is represented along a left-right continuum. Theories of shared magnitude processing (ATOM) and polarity correspondence suggest that emotional dimensions might be spatialized in a similar way. Across two experiments, we tested whether emotional valence and intensity elicit spatial-emotional associations and whether exposure to emotional stimuli modulates numerical SNAs. In Experiment 1, participants completed a number parity judgment task (NT) and a gender judgment task with emotional faces (FT) that varied in both valence (happy/sad) and intensity (0%, 20%, 80%, 100%). Experiment 2 removed direct valence contrasts by presenting either happy or fearful faces per participant, isolating intensity effects. Across both experiments, the NT revealed a reliable reverse SNARC effect. Crucially, this effect disappeared when the FT preceded the NT, indicating that emotionally salient stimuli disrupted subsequent SNAs. By contrast, emotional intensity produced no consistent spatial mapping in the FT, regardless of valence. These findings challenge the view that emotional magnitude is spatialized like numerical magnitude and instead suggest that emotional stimuli indirectly influence SNAs by taxing attentional or control processes. Emotional salience thus modulates, but does not itself constitute, spatial-magnitude representations.",

          "abstract": "Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills. The test battery is openly available on https://osf.io/gmv72/.",

          "abstract": "Individual family members impact each other and the family system at the physiological, brain, behavioral, phenomenological, and social level. Previous research used established methods, such as self-report and behavioral observation, to provide thorough insights into family dynamics. Here, we aim to complement existing methods and argue for a neurocognitive approach in family research. Neurocognitive tools can provide detailed and nuanced insights into complex family dynamics by capturing behavioral and brain processes at the individual and family level. By measuring neural activity and the alignment of brain activity between family members we can uncover complex recurrent and situation-dependent interactions that so far have remained hidden. Using this approach, we can increase the scope of family research, especially when measuring family members across generations with different levels of verbal ability. It allows to study emotionally interconnected family members across multiple generations. Measuring behavior and brain activity of multiple family members simultaneously is therefore a promising method to reveal additional factors contributing to family well-being and inform theory and practice. As mobile neuroimaging advances, studying family interactions in natural settings, such as the family home, becomes more feasible. This opens new possibilities for family research while simultaneously increasing ecological validity. The neurocognitive approach allows us to understand known and unknown factors contributing to family dynamics and brings a mechanistic understanding closer to “home”.",

Alcohol-related risk perception is distorted in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), but it is rarely employed in substance use research and therapy. The German questionnaire “Form to assess Alcohol-related Risk perception (‘Fragebogen zur alkoholbezogenen Risikowahrnehmung’; FAR) is a 44-item self-report instrument measuring the subjective risk perception of typical dangers caused by hazardous alcohol use (health, risk behavior, social life, work, law). It is based on the theoretical framework of four risk perception domains and allows the quantification of the Optimistic Bias. In this study, we report on the validation of the German 20-item short version, FAR-S.\nWe used two secondary data sets: A first sample of 690 students was used to perform a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. In a second sample of 57 AUD patients discriminant and convergent validity was studied. Furthermore, we examined item characteristics and scale reliability.\nOur results show that the FAR-S replicates the theoretical factor structure, support confirmatory and discriminant validity and prove good psychometric characteristics. The theoretical expected distortion of comparative risk perception in AUD patients in comparison to students was shown.\nThe FAR-S is an economic and valid instrument to assess alcohol-related risk perception. The instrument seems appropriate for a variety of contexts, such as research, prevention, or therapy. Alcohol-related risk perception might provide new insights into important questions like who might develop AUD or relapse; it might allow to study psychological changes along alcohol use careers and to identify new treatment targets.",

          "authors": "Michael Odenwald; Natascha Buechele; Alexander Wolber; Sarah Stumpp; Leonie Lipinski; Brigitte Rockstroh; Daniela Mier",
          "abstract": "Background: How patients perceive the risks related to their antipsychotic treatment (e.g. unwanted side effects) is a crucial factor for adherence; however, our current understanding of cognitive constructs underlying antipsychotic adherence is scarce. Recently, the self-report questionnaire Form to Assess Risk Perception of Antipsychotics (FRA) was introduced. The instrument measures the patients’ subjective perspective of two antithetical aspects of the perceived risks related to antipsychotic medication: risks attributed (1) to continuously taking the prescribed antipsychotics (e.g. probably causing unwanted effects) and (2) to stopping them (e.g. probably causing relapse of psychosis). Based on the two subscales the Difference Score is calculated, indicating which of the two risk perception views is stronger. This paper aims to further validate the FAR and introduces an additional method to calculate a composite Ambivalence Score.\nMethods: Fourty-one inpatients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (ICD-10; F-2) completed the FRA and further questionnaires during inpatient treatment. Convergent and discriminant validity of previously reported and new scoring methods were examined via correlations with theoretically related and unrelated constructs.\nResults: Our data show the hypothesized contrastive correlations of the two risk perception subscales and the two composite scores with instruments measuring related constructs, i.e. medication adherence, insight into the disorder, beliefs about needing medication or concerns about taking these drugs, distress and tension-relieving impulsive behavior patterns, confirming convergent validity. Lack of correlations with non-related constructs, e.g. emotion regulation and social support, supporting discriminant validity. The combined scores of both contrasting dimensions of risks perception are not related. \nConclusion: Our study lends further support to the validity of the FRA and sheds new light on cognitive processes underlying non-adherence. Since both risk perception subscales and the two composite scores correlate antithetically with different related constructs, this supports that it is promising to consider perceived risks of medication adherence and of medication non-adherence in the assessment of antipsychotic risk perception. Risk perception might be a factor, which can shed new light on the understanding of medication adherence and, thus, might provide new impulses in therapeutic treatment of patients with psychosis.",

Yet, empirical evidence of the impact of adverse life experiences on specific cognitive functions, and decision-making in particular, is scarce. We address this research gap by relating the experience of traumatic events to performance in different decision-making tasks and explored whether the association is mediated by general cognitive indices or psychopathology in SZ and healthy controls (HC).\nIn study 1 (https://osf.io/dw2ps/), we examined the beads task for assessing a jumping to conclusion bias and hasty decision-making, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and a verbal IQ estimate in 97 SZ and 39 HC. In study 2 (https://osf.io/n7z6y), 40 SZ and 36 HC completed the Game of Dice Task (decision-making under risk), the Iowa Gambling Task (decision-making under ambiguity), the n-back task (working memory), a verbal IQ estimate, and the Trauma History Questionnaire.\nIn study 1, we neither found a direct association between ACE and hasty decision-making, nor mediated effects by IQ or psychopathology. Also in study 2, we neither found an association between trauma history and decision-making under risk or under ambiguity, nor any mediated effects by IQ, working memory, or psychopathology.\nTaken together, we find no evidence for an association of ACE/lifetime traumatic experiences and decision-making impairments, independent of the applied measure. This suggests that the assumed impact of adverse life experiences on cognitive functioning in SZ might not extend to decision-making.",

During the last two decades, the research field on ordinality has witnessed a significant rise in studies indicating that performance in different ordinality tasks are significant predictors of mathematics achievement. Crucially however, the research literature on ordinality is characterized by substantial ambiguity regarding its descriptions, measures, and terminology. \nAccordingly, the purpose of the present systematic literature review was to gather, evaluate, and analyze the literature on ordinality from these aspects. In total, 148 articles were included from the research areas of mathematics education and numerical cognition Across these, 151 distinct descriptions of ordinality were identified that clustered into ten categories. In addition, 18 types of measures were used to assess ordinality knowledge, and 638 unique terms referring to the construct were identified. Notably, studies including the same description often used different measures. The results suggested that ordinality cannot be captured by a single description or measure, but should be treated as a multifaceted construct. Based on the results, a theoretical framework for ordinality is proposed.",

          "abstract": "In stratified societies, structural and perceived socioeconomic inequalities increasingly shape adolescents’ learning trajectories—not only through access to resources but also through their self-beliefs and adaptive functioning. This study investigates how both objective socioeconomic status (SES) and perceived academic standing influence the development of general self-efficacy (GSE), a core motivational mechanism linked to learning and well-being. Using longitudinal survey data from 6,994 adolescents in Singapore, we show that subjective perceptions of academic standing significantly mediate the relationship between SES and self-efficacy, underscoring the cognitive salience of relative academic rank in high-stakes systems. We further disentangle adaptability into cognitive, behavioural, and affective domains and identify affective adaptability as the most robust predictor of GSE across all SES levels. Notably, for adolescents in the lowest SES deciles, the predictive value of perceived rank is attenuated, whereas affective adaptability remains a stable, universal predictor. These findings highlight GSE as a malleable cognitive-motivational construct shaped by both sociocultural and intrapersonal factors. We discuss implications for designing equity-oriented learning environments that support emotional adaptability and foster positive learning beliefs, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth.",

Determining what type of support will be most effective, for whom, and when, is a multi-pronged calculation that providers execute while balancing personal goals, motivations, and current resources. Prior research outlines support providers’ traits and methods that may improve support-giving, but the internal and psychological processes that underlie optimal support provision remain unclear. Here, we argue that self-regulation plays a critical and understudied role in giving effective social support. We leverage research on self-regulatory processes to examine how they influence effective support provision. We propose that support providers must first evaluate their aims and prioritize relational goals with recipients, and next utilize self-regulatory processes (e.g., effort, cognitive control) to understand recipient’s goals and deliver support. More effective self-regulation may enhance support exchanges for all involved. This framework generates testable research questions on how people give optimal support.",

          "abstract": "This study examines performance evaluation in perceptual detection tasks using response-time-based signal detection theory (SDT) analysis. A defining feature of detection tasks is the asymmetry between trials with stimulus presence and absence, often reflected in asymmetric type-1 ROC curves. This ROC asymmetry indicates greater signal variability in stimulus-present trials, which contradicts canonical assumptions in equal-variance SDT models. Across multiple datasets, we implemented an unequal-variance SDT model using response time (RT) data, and compared its estimates with those obtained from the traditional confidence-based method. RT-based estimates of SDT parameters, the SD ratio (σ) and mean difference (μ), aligned closely with confidence-based estimates. The resulting sensitivity measure dₐ—an unequal-variance extension of d′—derived from RT and confidence showed strong consistency across all datasets. Notably, the conventional d′ measure consistently overestimated detection performance compared to the dₐ measures, highlighting the importance of accounting for the degree of unequal variance. Our findings demonstrate that RT-based SDT analysis offers a reliable, cost-effective alternative for the precise evaluation of perceptual detection performance, particularly when confidence ratings are impractical or unavailable.",

Analyses showed that models produced responses that differ lexically and semantically.. Moreover, the significant interaction effects of type of mental health symptom and severity across LLMs and type of social questions were indicative of weaker concordance of reasoning between LLMs and human-expert depending on specific symptom-severity, suggesting potential biases and differential generalization. Research and clinical implications, such as the importance of human expert oversight throughout the development and application of LLMs for mental health use, were discussed.",

          "abstract": "Music psychology researchers have long been interested in how emotions are expressed in music. Increasingly, researchers employ computationally derived measures of emotion (e.g., valence and arousal) from services such as Spotify. These measures are easy to use, but how they are calculated is not transparent. It is not clear whether these computational measures reflect how people rate perceived emotions in music. Addressing this, our study investigated the validity of Spotify’s automated ratings with subjective ratings from actual listeners. Participants were recruited from first-year university student cohorts and the general public (N = 244). Participants listened to 40 song excerpts, approximately 20-30 seconds in length, and rated tracks on their perception of its mood (valence), energy (arousal), danceability, familiarity, and enjoyment. Participant ratings were compared with Spotify’s automated ratings. We found that Spotify audio features energy and valence were positively associated with human ratings for these factors, with a strong relationship for arousal, and moderate relationship for valence. Spotify danceability, however, was not strongly associated with human ratings of danceability. These findings corroborate the utility of the widely used circumplex model for measuring emotions concisely. We further extend this by validating automated emotion ratings, such as those implemented by Spotify’s system, for use in music psychology, and highlight that if used cautiously, this is a useful tool in research.",

Using a large cross-cultural sample (k = 110, N = 108,946), we confirmed that people consistently judge climate change as posing a significantly greater harm to future generations than to themselves—a pattern that remained robust after controlling for demographics and multiple comparisons. Exploratory analysis indicated that temporal pessimism was greater among individuals with higher levels of climate worry and in nations with higher GDP per capita, stronger environmental performance, and greater human development, but smaller in nations with higher economic inequality.

          "abstract": "Numerous fields have demonstrated that our decisions are guided by social information, and one important piece of social information is social comparison. Previous research has suggested that social status can influence trust, but most prior studies examining the influence of social comparison on trust decisions employed social comparison contexts that potentially “justify” the difference in social status, such as performing better/worse in a task. The current study investigated how, instead, interpersonal trust and risk-related decisions are made after experiencing arbitrarily manipulated social comparison contexts. In addition, the study directly compared people’s behaviors in trust and risk environments under different social positions in a single experimental paradigm. Across two experiments (Experiment 1: discovery sample, N = 302; Experiment 2: validation sample, N = 299), we showed that exposure to randomly manipulated social comparison contexts significantly influenced participants’ economic allocation decisions, their perceived relative ranks, and their reported levels of envy towards their target of comparison. However, our findings suggest that participants’ subsequent decision-making regarding interpersonal trust and risk-taking were not affected by this arbitrary-based social comparison. Our results also show that participants perceived risk and trust environments differently, with smaller amounts invested in the risk scenario than in the trust scenario. Overall, our findings indicate which behaviors and feelings are more likely to be affected by being randomly placed in a favorable or unfavorable social comparison scenario, and increase our understanding of trust and risk across social comparison scenarios.",

          "abstract": "Climate change poses a disproportionately large and accelerating threat to today’s youth, who will confront its socio-environmental impacts across their lifetimes. Yet studies that explore how young people in the Global South perceive, emotionally respond to, and understand climate change are still scarce. Here, through a nationally representative survey of 2,220 Colombian youth (aged 18–32) we conducted, we examine young people's climate-related knowledge, emotions, and perceived efficacy of environmentally friendly behaviours in a Global South context. We also explore the role of socio-demographic variation in shaping those characteristics. Our findings reveal a high prevalence of negative “eco-emotions” (e.g., anxiety, fear) alongside widespread misconceptions about climate change causes and solutions. Most participants felt worried or fearful about climate change, yet only about one-third correctly identified fossil fuel use as the primary cause (with deforestation often mistakenly perceived as the leading driver). Respondents also overestimated the climate benefits of certain low-impact actions (e.g., banning single-use plastic bags, planting one tree) while under-recognizing higher-impact behaviours. Socio-demographic factors predicted distinct emotional and cognitive patterns: women and students reported more intense negative emotions, whereas rural and lower-income youth were less likely to demonstrate accurate climate change knowledge. Political orientation showed an influence on knowledge without the stark polarization observed elsewhere. Interestingly, colombian youth who fear comfort losses are 13 times more likely to dismiss eco-friendly actions. These findings underscore the need for climate education policy and practice with differential approaches across socio-economic levels in the Global South to empower young people as informed and emotionally-resilient agents of climate action.",

          "abstract": "It is well documented that ADHD is associated with challenges in inhibitory control.  However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to these difficulties are not well established. Here, we employ a novel “forced-response” method with computational modeling to disentangle the time-dependent control of habitual and goal-directed processing in response-conflict tasks in adults with ADHD. We use a converging approach which compares individuals with ADHD against neurotypical individuals and individuals with ADHD off medication against on medication on two conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that ADHD was associated with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both conflict tasks. These findings mark an important step toward elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to real-life challenges in inhibiting distracting information in adults with ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: To compare spoken language input to young deaf/hard of hearing (DHH) children with cochlear implants and matched chronological- and hearing-age hearing controls. Method: We used long-form audio-recordings (M=14.3hrs) from 48 6-32mo’s (16/group). We manually transcribed 40min/recording, and ran automated LENA algorithms over the full daylong recording. We computed 10 automated and manually annotated metrics of input quantity, complexity, and conceptual content. We also computed speech outcomes, and linked the input metrics to those outcomes. Results: There were no significant cross-group differences in input quantity, or in any input metrics between DHH and chronological age-matches. The DHH group heard significantly shorter sentences and more highly auditory words than hearing-age matches. While they produced more (and more mature) vocalizations than hearing-age matches, they produced fewer mature vocalizations than age-matched peers. DHH vocalizations also increased less robustly with age. In regression models, only hearing status explained variance in child vocalizations for DHH and hearing-age matches. For DHH and same age matches, age, hearing status (hearing&gt;DHH), input quantity, and shorter MLU input collectively predicted &gt;50% of the variance in children’s vocal maturity. Conclusions: DHH children and hearing children differed little in their language input. Differences from hearing-age controls are likely explained by their younger age. Nevertheless, we find lower rates of child vocalizations in the DHH group and a weaker increase over age. This extends prior findings through its in-depth look at a young cohort using both automated and manual measures of speech.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Individuals who identify as transgender and gender diverse (TGD) often experience unique stressors associated with their TGD identity, referred to as gender minority stress (GMS), which can increase negative affect. This study examined whether social (i.e., when alone, with close others, with strangers/acquaintances) and environmental (i.e., at home, out-of-home) context was related to the likelihood of experiencing GMS and whether social and environmental context moderated the relationship between GMS and negative affect.\nMethods: This is a secondary analysis of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data from 25 TGD adults who randomly received brief surveys twice daily for 21 days (N = 1,050 observations analyzed). Participants reported where they were, who they were with, GMS they recently experienced, and their current level of negative affect. Using multilevel models, we examined whether GMS was more likely to be experienced in specific contexts, whether GMS predicted negative affect, and if these contexts moderated the association between GMS and negative affect. \nResults: Participants were significantly more likely to experience a proximal gender minority stressor when they were out-of-the-home alone (compared to home alone), and when they were with non-close others (compared to close others). Social and environmental context significantly moderated the within-person association between GMS and negative affect. GMS was positively associated with negative affect for when participants were home alone but not when out-of-the-home alone. \nConclusions: Social and environmental context may impact GMS experiences and subsequent negative affect, and should be considered in related interventions.",

          "authors": "Daria Khanolainen; Elena Semenova; Yulia Nesterova",
          "abstract": "Measuring attitudes on sensitive topics such as immigration, prejudice, and multiculturalism is a persistent methodological challenge because standard self-report instruments are prone to social desirability bias. This bias—the tendency for participants to provide socially acceptable answers rather than their true beliefs—can distort both predictors and outcomes, severely compromising the rigor of research. Statistical control via social desirability scales offers only partial remediation, and when the same bias affects all measured variables, statistical control alone is often insufficient or even counterproductive. This tutorial introduces a novel methodological tool that mitigates social desirability bias by eliciting responses through creative reflection—an open-ended, low-stakes task that prompts participants to express their views indirectly. We detail the process of designing such tasks, coding and analyzing the resulting data, and integrating these methods into broader research designs. Our analysis applies a mixed-methods framework that integrates quantitative survey responses from 454 in-service teachers with qualitative creative narratives from 413 in-service teachers. Step-by-step code, annotated examples, and the full dataset are provided to enable replication and adaptation. While illustrated with a study of teachers’ multicultural attitudes, the approach is applicable to other sensitive psychological and educational research topics.",

          "authors": "Zekun Sun; Samuel D McDougle",
          "abstract": "Event segmentation is a fundamental component of human perception and cognition. The field of event cognition studies how people decide where distinct events occur in incoming sensory data, how these \"event boundaries\" alter decision-making and memory processes, how events reveal themselves in neural activity, and how events may be represented within perception itself. The latter point is critical — the representation of events in the first place is filtered through perception. But what counts as a minimal event that is perceptible to humans? And to what extent is the perceptual representation of minimal events driven by physical properties within stimuli (e.g., sudden changes of a tennis ball's direction when one player strikes it) versus the semantic structure of events (e.g., \"step one\" versus \"step two\" of a tennis serve)? Here, across seven preregistered experiments, we explore the perceptual representation of event structure within single brief actions, and dissociate the roles of visual features and semantic structures in the perceptual segmentation of minimal events. First, participants produced boundary labels by segmenting videos of brief physical actions (e.g., kicking a ball). Then, separate groups of observers were asked to visually detect subtle disruptions in the video clips, unaware that the disruptions systematically occurred at boundary versus non-boundary timepoints. The results consistently showed an interfering effect of event boundaries on the detection of disruptions, suggesting a spontaneous perceptual representation of action structure even in very brief single actions. Moreover, boundary effects were strongest when stimuli were presented in recognizable forms versus distorted forms that only preserved lower-level features. Thus, automatic and rapid perceptual segmentation of single actions that only last several seconds may be driven by both sensory cues and our internal models of the world.",

          "abstract": "We propose a behavioral view of authoritarianism, and argue that the everyday psychology of rules and punishment is at its core. Authoritarianism is often understood at the nation-state level, categorizing particular regimes and practices as authoritarian, or at the individual level, as a set of tendencies or worldviews. We reposition behavior as the main unit of analysis. We specify a set of behaviors made available only when people interact with the state, and use state rules and state punishment to carry out their own desires (e.g., for revenge, dominance) at the expense of the rule of law. Then, we propose that at the heart of these authoritarian behaviors is regular, everyday psychology—the psychology of norms and norm enforcement via third party punishment, albeit formalized, codified, and refracted through state procedures. States solve large scale coordination problems, largely with codified rules and official third- party punishments. Sometimes people use these procedures to fairly and legitimately uphold the rule of law, and sometimes people use them for their own ends, amounting to authoritarianism. We review how the state channels human desires for punishment and rules, and how people can use state punishment and state rules to behave in authoritarian ways; State punishments can be administered selectively and personally. Official rules can be made that keep individuals from public services, or exist only to keep some people in positions of power over others. The psychology of norms and third party punishment, which enables large-scale human cooperation, is at the heart of authoritarianism.",

          "abstract": "Emerging scholarship suggests that willingness to engage in violent or other risky behavior relates to Need for Chaos--a trait-state combination reflecting disaffection with society and politics, independent of political identity and beliefs. While previous research links Need for Chaos to a stronger gain-seeking mentality, it remains unclear whether those higher in Need for Chaos respond differently to gain and loss frames. We use a framing experiment based on prospect theory to test whether Need for Chaos moderates decision making about two salient policy issues in the United States: the debt ceiling and government shutdown negotiations in US Congress in 2023. Results from both studies (n=2,704; n=3,002) suggest that individuals low in Need for Chaos are risk-averse toward gains but risk-seeking toward losses, whereas those high in Need for Chaos exhibit the opposite pattern, seeking risk when anticipating gains and avoiding risk when anticipating losses. Our findings add important nuance to existing research by demonstrating that individuals higher in Need for Chaos are not merely indifferent to framing; rather, they also systematically respond to gain and loss frames. This work underscores how individual differences may help to shape judgment and decision making, particularly in times of societal and political uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Everyday learning unfolds across multiple senses, yet the long-term retention of multisensory statistical learning (SL) remains poorly understood. SL—the implicit detection and extraction of regularities from continuous input—has been documented across sensory modalities, but most work has focused on immediate learning in unisensory contexts. This study, using a within-subject design, directly compared 24-hour consolidation trajectories of auditory, visual, and audiovisual SL in young adults. Twenty-six participants completed familiarization and an immediate test phase in all three modalities, followed by delayed testing after 24 hours. Multisensory input yielded higher recognition accuracy than unisensory input at both immediate and delayed tests, demonstrating a robust performance advantage. However, only auditory SL showed overnight gains, while visual and multisensory SL remained stable across the retention interval. Cross-task correlations—both within each testing timepoint and for consolidation magnitudes—were weak, suggesting that modality-specific processes make a substantial contribution to SL. These findings provide the first direct evidence on the long-term retention of multisensory SL. While multisensory input boosts overall performance, consolidation trajectories remain constrained by modality-specific mechanisms.",

          "abstract": "Why do today, what you can fail to do tomorrow? How to pace or allocate work over time, whether to delay starting to work, and how much effort to exert are decisions people face daily. People sometimes procrastinate, facing detrimental effects due to delays. Previous research has recognised multiple shapes of pacing and types of procrastination, influenced by a myriad of psychological and situational factors. However, the main mechanistic explanation for delays and pacing, which concerns temporal discounting of distant rewards, focuses on only a subset. Here, we introduce a systematic taxonomy of pacing and procrastination, integrating multiple mechanistic routes to them within a common framework. The taxonomy is based on the sequence of temporal decisions involved in choosing how to distribute work in time, and shows how these decisions can be influenced by characteristics of the task and the (sub-)optimality of decision-making. Using reinforcement learning and decision-making models, we simulate diverse sources of pacing to illustrate aspects of the taxonomy and demonstrate how they give rise to different types of pacing and procrastination, showing the plausibility of our taxonomy. Our approach provides a theoretical foundation for understanding pacing and procrastination, enabling the integration of both established and novel mechanisms within a unified conceptual framework.",

          "abstract": "Cochlear implant users can achieve high levels of speech recognition despite severe hearing loss. However, outcomes vary considerably, and some users continue to struggle. This study assessed Nucleus cochlear implant users’ sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulations, important acoustic features for speech recognition, using a reaction-time task with ripple sounds. Ripples contain similar spectrotemporal dynamics as speech, without resembling words, and allow precise control over spectral and temporal parameters. Cochlear implant users’ reaction times to ripple onsets varied systematically with modulation characteristics: temporal modulations around 16 Hz consistently yielded the shortest reaction times, while reaction times increased with increasing spectral density. These effects of modulation were nearly identical across participants, indicating a similar tuning to the tested spectrotemporal features. In contrast, the average reaction time, across all modulations, differed substantially between participants, ranging from 200 ms to about 1 second. These individual differences correlated modestly with phoneme recognition scores (r = 0.52), indicating that overall reaction times for the tested modulations relates to speech processing ability. These two findings (consistent modulation-dependent reaction times across participants, and their modest correlation with phoneme recognition) indicate that reaction times reflect underlying auditory sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulations. The substantial unexplained variance in phoneme recognition, however, suggests that modulation sensitivity alone is not sufficient to account for individual differences in speech understanding. This points to an additional role for non-acoustic, cognitive factors. Further, modeling results also suggest that individual differences in reaction times can be attributed to a combination of both sensory factors (i.e., modulation sensitivity) and non-auditory influences, such as decision-making processes.",

In the literature on mental health and politics -work that spans different disorders and political outcomes-there has been a turn to domain-specific measures of `political health'. However, when studying the complex relationship between mental health and politics, it is not yet clear if we need a disorder specific or general approach and to that end, if there is a need for domain-specificity (i.e., what it might contribute beyond traditional mental health measurements). To investigate this, we test and compare the construct and predictive validity of domain-specific political mental health (PMH) and general mental health (MH) in a study conducted in the Dutch population. Through our tests of construct validity, we find PMH is an independent construct to MH. Our tests of predictive validity demonstrate that while both PMH and MH have a range of political correlates, from political participation to external political efficacy, it is PMH that has stronger and broader political associations -- to affective polarization, ideological extremism and news aversion, among others. In the discussion we outline a research agenda for moving forward the study of mental health and politics in light of our findings: our results imply that domain-specificity is needed to properly identify the extent to which mental health is connected to engagement with politics and who may be the most affected and importantly, that PMH and MH have more far reaching political consequences than previously assumed.",

In five experiments with 136 participants, we employed a new auditory search task in which constant (vs. variable) human speech sounds (letters as distractors, numbers as targets) were presented sequentially from distinct spatial locations using five loudspeakers. We find that distractor identity is both necessary and sufficient for auditory contextual cueing. This finding stands in striking contrast to visual contextual cueing, where fixed spatial layouts are typically crucial for the effect. Thus, it highlights the complementary strengths of the two modalities: While the visual system prioritizes spatial context, the auditory system rapidly recodes input into categorical, identity-based representations, making these central to statistical contextual learning.",

We consider how negative affect influences whether to act, what actions to consider, which action to select, and how vigorously to engage in a selected action. Further, we describe the neural and neuroendocrine bases of these computations.

Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",

Here I examine the UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) as a case study illustrating how judgment noise can interact with structural features of a multi-stage evaluation system. Simulations show that noise in both internal departmental reviews and REF panel reviews, in conjunction with the bounded REF rating scale, produces systematic underestimation of the highest-performing departments. Panel noise, rather than internal noise, had a disproportionate impact on department rankings, with even moderate noise producing severe distortions. At a policy level, these results underscore the need for a noise audit of REF panel ratings. More broadly, the case of REF demonstrates that noise embedded in sequential evaluation, for example, in hiring and grant review decisions, does not “cancel out”, but instead can propagate in potentially surprising ways.",

          "abstract": "This action research examined the digital competence of 20 Basic Education teachers at Don\nMariano Marcos Memorial State University–Mid La Union Campus (DMMMSU–MLUC) and\nthe challenges they face in ICT integration. Teachers’ competence was assessed across\nTechnology Operations (GM = 2.41), Social-Ethical Responsibility (GM = 2.50), Pedagogical\nApplication (GM = 2.51), and Professional Practice (GM = 2.43), yielding an overall Grand\nMean of 2.46 (High Competence). Results indicate strong pedagogical use and ethical ICT\npractices, while technical skills such as database management, troubleshooting, and spreadsheet\nuse remain weaker. Younger and single teachers demonstrated higher technical proficiency, yet\noverall digital competence did not significantly correlate with ICT challenges (Overall Mean =\n1.74), suggesting systemic and institutional barriers are the primary constraints. Based on these\nfindings, a contextualized ICT Enhancement Program was proposed, including targeted skills\ndevelopment, hands-on exercises, ethical ICT training, peer mentoring, and enhanced\ninstitutional support, aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education). The\nstudy underscores that effective ICT integration requires not only teacher competence but also\ntechnical skill enhancement, collaborative culture, and reliable infrastructure to enable\nmeaningful and sustainable technology use in teaching and learning.\nKeywords: action research, digital competence, ICT integration, teacher professional\ndevelopment, systemic barriers",

          "abstract": "The perception of voluntariness in task failure during extreme physical effort is debated in endurance sports. This study tested whether power meter data availability affects perceived voluntariness and performance in cyclists accustomed to power meters. Forty trained cyclists completed two counterbalanced maximal incremental tests: one without feedback and one with real-time power visualization. Confirmatory analyses showed that power visualization increased maximal aerobic power (MAP) (p = 0.004, ES = 0.487) without affecting VO2MAX, maximal heart rate, RPE, or perceived voluntariness (p &gt; 0.05). Exploratory analyses revealed an order effect: participants who first performed the test with power data perceived their decision to stop as more voluntary in that condition compared to the subsequent no-feedback test (p = 0.029). This effect was absent in the reverse order group (p = 0.749). No order effects were found for other variables. Cyclists’ performance judgments aligned with actual MAP differences (p = 0.744). These findings suggest that removing power data after prior exposure reduces perceived control over task failure decisions, while access to power data enhances MAP. Further research is needed to confirm these effects in self-paced efforts. This study highlights the role of performance feedback in shaping effort perception and performance in cycling.",

This paper describes how we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET, an intervention aiming to reduce internalized HIV stigma among people with HIV in the Netherlands. This face-to-face, three-session workshop series for people with HIV was designed, implemented, and evaluated with Intervention Mapping, a systematic approach to behavior change that uses theory and evidence, as well as participatory processes, in the planning of interventions. Intervention Mapping comprises six steps: 1) conducting a needs assessment and drafting a logic model of the problem; 2) specifying intervention outcomes and objectives, and drafting a logic model of change; 3) designing the intervention by selecting theory and evidence-based methods for behavior change and then developing their practical applications; 4) producing and pre-testing the intervention; 5) planning for implementation; and 6) planning process and effect evaluation. For each step, we describe the tasks involved and how we approached each task as we designed, implemented, and evaluated RESET. By transparently reporting how RESET was developed, we illuminate success and challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating HIV stigma interventions. We also demonstrate how Intervention Mapping can be leveraged to develop effective interventions for reducing stigma, including internalized HIV stigma.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Autistic individuals are more likely to be diagnosed with psychotic disorders and experience psychotic symptoms. This association may result from methodological issues, such as misinterpretation of psychosis questionnaires by autistic individuals and clinician difficulty differentiating between symptoms of autism and psychosis. This meta-analysis aimed to update the review of this association and examine whether it is moderated by the methods used to measure it. \nMethods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science. Included studies required: autism and psychosis measurements, comorbidity data, adult participants, and quantitative data. Risk of bias was assessed using Hoy et al. (2012) criteria, and analyses examined correlational data, computed odds ratios, and computed Cohen's d. \nResults: Sixty-three papers were included. Significant correlations were found between autistic traits and overall (r = 0.435, p &lt; .0001), positive (r = .274, p &lt; .0001), negative (r = .506, p &lt; .0001), and disorganized (r = .366, p &lt; .0001) psychotic symptoms. Individuals with one condition had increased risk of being diagnosed with the other (OR = 7.03, p &lt; .001), and scored higher on trait measures of the other (d = 1.187, p &lt; .0001). No moderating effect of measurement was found. \nDiscussion: This meta-analysis provides an updated overview of the association between autism and psychosis, with no evidence that methodological issues are specific to any measure. The weaker correlation between autistic traits and positive psychotic symptoms suggests symptom overlap may partly explain the association.",

          "abstract": "Moving towards more plant-based diets is a win-win for both human and planetary health. However, for successful adoption, such diets must be realistic and convenient. This study explored the factors influencing food choices among young women in Scotland and examined how they interpret and use plant-based and convenience food in their daily lives. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 women aged 18-24 and generated six themes using reflexive thematic analysis within a critical realist framework. We found meat consumption to be socially and culturally embedded, reinforced by family, peers, and social media (Theme 1). Participants expressed a sense of safety with familiar meat-based dishes and fear towards unfamiliar plant-based dishes (Theme 2). ‘Plant-based’ was widely perceived as meat alternatives only, which were rejected across health, taste, cost, and identity considerations. Although cost was the biggest driver of food choice, meat was perceived as a necessary expense, further justified by health motivations (Theme 3). Environmental concerns were less important, with participants demonstrating limited awareness about the environmental impact of food (Theme 4). Convenience was important, though ready meals were rejected in favour of batch cooking and quick-prep meals (Theme 5). Meat reduction was perceived as an all-or-nothing identity shift, with negative vegan stereotypes deterring even small reductions in intake (Theme 6). These findings highlight the need to reposition plant-based foods as affordable, convenient, healthy, and familiar, likely requiring wider food system changes. Further, health benefits of increased plant-based wholefoods and reduced meat consumption should be emphasised in government and industry messaging.",

          "abstract": "The assumptions of standard tests, such as the t-test, ANOVA, and ordinary least squares regression, are frequently violated, which may be consequential for the desired error rates. Using robust tests instead does not rely on assuming normality and equal variances. Employing them from the outset bypasses the pitfalls of deciding on the usability of a standard test with data. In this opinion piece, I summarize the epistemic benefits of robust alternatives, like the Mann–Whitney U test or robust linear regression. Restricting on a robust test instead of conducting it in addition to the standard test avoids multiple results, thus counteracts fishing for the desired result, which can occur subtly. It counteracts nonreplicated findings that are just due data anomalies like extreme values and outliers that occur differently across studies. From a practical standpoint, running a single test simplifies analysis, and there are many robust methods readily available in R. However, it is important to understand what a robust method does and what is actually robust against. I also address common defenses of standard tests, discuss why they remain widespread, and suggest how these arguments should be countered.",

Pain (global pain perception, pain intensity, pain affect, pain tolerance) and stress responses (subjective reports, autonomic [electrocardiography, electrodermal activity, salivary alpha-amylase] and endocrine activity [salivary cortisol]) were measured. Individual differences of the experience, trait empathy and absorption were investigated.\nExposure to multimodal art resulted in longer pain tolerance than single modality of visual art, but no difference was found for music. Other measures of pain intensity, stress intensity, and pain affect did not differ across the conditions. Regarding the mechanisms, exposure to all types of art distracted participants’ attention from pain, prompted mind wandering, and elicited greater enjoyment than the control condition. Physiological measures of electrocardiography and electrodermal activity validated our design: participants were more stressed during the cold pressor test, but no differences were observed across the four conditions. Also, no differences were found regarding cortisol and alpha-amylase. Regarding individual differences, higher trait absorption was associated with longer pain tolerance in the multimodal condition and with lower pain intensity in the music-only condition, compared to the other conditions. In conclusion, exposure to art can influence pain; however, the underlying mechanisms require further research.",

          "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is increasingly recognized as the outcome of recursive interactions among genetic, neurobiological, epigenetic, environmental, psychological, and psychodynamic factors rather than as the product of linear causal models. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence across these domains to advance a comprehensive framework for understanding BPD’s developmental pathways. While concepts such as equifinality, multifinality, and differential susceptibility have been sporadically noted in prior work, only a handful of studies explicitly apply them to BPD. To our knowledge, this article provides the most extensive integration of these perspectives to date, situating BPD within a developmental psychopathology model that explains both shared and divergent outcomes across individuals. By emphasizing plasticity alongside vulnerability, we propose an empirically grounded, multifactorial account that holds particular promise for psychiatric understanding as well as psychodynamic and other psychotherapeutic treatments. This integrative approach highlights the complex etiological architecture of BPD and underscores opportunities for tailoring interventions to patients’ unique developmental trajectories.",

While it is acknowledged that in nonhuman primates this decrease of tension is due to the calming effect exerted by bystanders on the stress of the antagonists, the emotional aspect of violence reduction remains largely unexplored in humans. In this study, we address this gap by investigating the effect of bystander affiliative intervention on stress-related behaviours indicating anxiety, anger and pain expressed by antagonists of conflicts. By conducting video analysis on interpersonal conflicts recorded by surveillance cameras in public spaces of Amsterdam, we found that antagonists displayed fewer anger-related behaviours after receiving non-physical affiliation, such as non-verbal interaction or proximity. Our findings suggest that bystanders adopt a safe option to regulate antagonists’ stress, showing a continuity in the conflict management strategies evolved in social animals.",

This study provides a comparative investigation of three widely used PSRA questionnaires – the Questionnaire for Psychosocial Risk Assessment (QPRA), the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ), and Welliba PSRA – to investigate their conceptual overlap and psychometric performance. Data were collected from a cross-sectional sample of N = 98 participants who completed all three questionnaires. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed to assess relationships of scales within and between questionnaires, examining their convergent and discriminant validity. The results revealed substantial intercorrelations among conceptually related scales within and between all questionnaires, supporting convergent validity. However, numerous strong associations were observed between theoretically distinct constructs, highlighting poor discriminant validity across the tools. Hence, the investigated questionnaires appear to uniformly measure psychosocial risk as a general construct, while the lack of specificity outlines that their utility to assess delimited hazards is limited. The findings underscore the need for psychometric refinement of PSRA instruments and suggest that practitioners should supplement quantitative assessments with qualitative methods to ensure a rigorous and effective risk management process.",

          "abstract": "Economic dishonesty is a widespread behavior that has substantial implications for organizations and societies. Recent studies suggest that decision making in groups or commitment to other individuals can further increase such dishonesty in contrast to individual decision making. Various interventions have been suggested to curb dishonesty, with classical economic approaches emphasizing the use of punishment by focusing among others on the risk (“how likely am I to get caught?”). However, the effects of punishments on dishonesty are mixed and it is currently unclear if punishment can be effective in collaborative settings. We conducted an experimental online study (N = 702) collecting UK-based Prolific participants playing a tax evasion game for five rounds. We manipulated (1) the type of payoff (whether dishonesty earned money for the individual or for the group of three), (2) the risk of punishment (no risk or 30% audit chance), and (3) the type of punishment (whether the individual was punished or the whole group in case of getting caught). Against our prediction, we did not observe higher dishonesty for group-based payoffs compared to individual-based payoffs for treatments without punishment but higher compliance. As predicted, we found that punishment risk decreased dishonesty and increased compliance by 14.2 percentage points (Cohen’s d = 0.32). Further, in contrast to the predictions based on utility-based models, we found that group punishment was more effective in decreasing dishonesty and increased compliance by 5.6 percentage points (d = 0.13) compared to individual punishment. This effect was similar for individual and group-based payoffs. Overall, this study provides evidence for the effectiveness of punishment in curbing dishonesty across different decision-making structures.",

          "abstract": "Watching what others put in their mouths is a powerful way to learn what to eat. Yet human diets and eating behaviors are complicated, and not everything that goes into another person's mouth is food: The fusilli is edible, but the fork is not. Therefore, some selectivity is necessary to guide social learning processes about food. Here we examined 6-month-old infants' expectations about what kinds of entities are likely to be edible using a violation-of-expectation setup in which infants viewed an actor eating from two different items. We hypothesized that infants may have selective edibility expectations about plants, and in particular fruits, that stem from humans' long evolutionary history of foraging wild plant foods and specialization in higher caloric density plant parts. In Experiment 1 (N = 40), we found that infants expect plants, relative to feature-matched artifacts, to be edible, replicating a previous finding [Wertz &amp; Wynn, 2014a]. In Experiments 2 (N = 40) and 3 (N = 39), we examined, for the first time, whether selective expectations about plant edibility are tied to particular plant parts. Our results showed that infants do not differentially expect leaves to be edible, but our results for fruits were inconsistent. Taken together, these findings suggest that infants differentially expect plants to be edible, and that these expectations appear to be strongest for whole plants.",

          "abstract": "The construction of high-quality experimental stimuli is foundational to psychological research, yet current practices remain labor-intensive, reliant on expert intuition, and limited in scale and reproducibility. As the field increasingly pursues large-scale, cross-linguistic, and rapid experimental designs, stimulus generation has become a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automating aspects of stimulus creation, but questions remain regarding the fidelity, interpretability, and experimental validity of LLM-constructed stimuli. We, therefore, present StimMAS, which is the first multi-agent LLM framework that automates stimulus generation, validation, and evaluation, all within a psychologist-in-the-loop architecture. We validated the framework by comparing LLM-constructed stimuli against human-authored counterparts in three behavioral psycholinguistic experiments with 300 participants. Results show that LLM-constructed materials reliably replicate established effects. Stimuli produced by StimMAS yielded lower response entropy, indicating enhanced interpretive clarity, and interaction analyses revealed that key psycholinguistic effects were preserved or amplified. Ablation studies confirmed that, compared to a single-agent system, the multi-agent architecture significantly improves stimulus quality by reducing redundancy, enforcing experimental constraints, and—particularly when using GPT-4o—achieving stronger alignment with expert judgment than DeepSeek, especially in the construction of English-language items. These findings demonstrate that multi-agent LLM systems, when guided by domain expertise, can serve as scalable, reproducible, and theoretically aligned tools for stimulus construction. StimMAS offers a publicly available platform that lowers barriers to high-quality experimental design, advancing the integration of AI into the empirical workflows of psychological science.

          "abstract": "Measuring the subjective well-being of societies is important in its own right and as a determinant of health outcomes. Traditionally, self-report surveys such as Gallup’s daily poll have tracked well-being, but they are expensive and provide limited coverage of communities. Over the past decade, research has shown that social media (e.g., Twitter/X) offers a cost-effective alternative. Yet, through ownership and policy changes, access to these “digital commons” is increasingly restricted. What are we losing without access for researchers? We argue that well-being estimates derived from geolocated, demographically post-stratified Twitter language provided the most valid indicators of US population well-being available. We compare estimates for 1,208 US counties (~89% of the population) derived from 1.53 billion posts by 5.25 million users to Gallup estimates from 1.9 million survey responses. Twitter-based estimates were more predictive of external health and economic indicators and met a wide variety of validity criteria, including a convergent correlation of r = .70 with Gallup, high test-retest stability, linguistic face validity, and generalizability across US cities, states, and the UK. We further show that Gallup ground truth data is not required by building an independent language model on n = 9,419 Twitter users, which produced valid estimates that again outperformed Gallup in predicting external variables. These findings establish that social media can capture population well-being more robustly and with better coverage than even the largest survey efforts, and that ensuring researcher access to these data is essential for understanding and improving societies.",

          "abstract": "While intergroup contact theory traditionally focuses on prejudice reduction, intergroup contact may paradoxically increase consensus in race-based thinking of others. We measured individuals’ mental representations of how personality traits interrelate for different racial groups at conceptual (abstract) and perceptual (face-based) levels. Stereotype structure alignment was defined as the extent to which an individual’s trait associations across racial group members align with group-typical structures averaged across all participants, capturing shared perceptions. In a diverse Singapore sample comprising Chinese, Malay, and Indian participants (N = 153), quality contact (but not quantity) predicted stronger alignment with shared trait structures for ethnic minorities. Specifically, higher quality contact with minority groups (e.g., Malays) predicted greater convergence in abstract trait associations (but not face-based representations). These findings challenge assumptions about contact’s de-stereotyping effects.

          "abstract": "Difficulties in speech perception in noise are common in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may be associated with an attentional bias toward non-social stimuli. Although our previous study found no interactive effect of (non-)social noise on the relationship between autistic traits and speech-in-noise perception difficulties, this effect could be observed in children and adolescents with ASD who have greater attentional bias than individuals with high autistic traits in the general population. In this context, the present study tested two hypotheses: (1) children and adolescents with ASD show greater difficulty perceiving speech in noise than those without ASD, and (2) they experience greater difficulty perceiving speech in non-vocal noise than in vocal noise. Participants detected words embedded in vocal and non-vocal background noise. Children and adolescents with ASD had greater difficulties in speech perception in noise than those without ASD, supporting the first hypothesis. This difference was not explained by performance in speech perception in silence or hypersensitivity to noise. However, the second hypothesis was not supported, which is consistent with the results of our previous study. These results suggest that autistic traits other than attentional bias toward non-vocal sounds explain the difficulties in speech perception in noise.",

          "abstract": "Reappraisal is a linguistic strategy for regulating emotions that has the potential to produce powerful therapeutic effects. Consequently, there is growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to help people reappraise. However, little is known about the factors that make one reappraisal more effective than another, or how these factors map to different individuals. A key challenge is the lack of a framework to differentiate reappraisals, making it difficult to characterize what is expected to work for whom. We conducted two studies (N = 471) examining values as a person-specific predictor of reappraisal effectiveness. Our findings suggest that LLM-generated reappraisals that aligned with individuals’ more strongly endorsed values (relative to their other values) were more likely to address their specific concerns, be perceived as more effective, and lead to greater emotional change. These results highlight the importance of tailoring reappraisals to individuals’ personal values and provide a foundation for improving the personalization of AI-assisted emotion regulation interventions.",

          "authors": "Yuqing Shi; DongWon Oh",
          "abstract": "Forming first impressions from faces involves inherent uncertainty, as perceivers must make rapid personality judgments from limited information. Individuals and cultures differ in how they handle this uncertainty, with some showing greater aversion to ambiguity. We propose that higher uncertainty avoidance leads to more differentiated personality trait impressions, as a cognitive strategy for managing social ambiguity. Across three studies, we demonstrate converging evidence that uncertainty avoidance systematically shapes impression formation. Study 1 (N = 10,552) analyzed face-based trait ratings from 40 regions, revealing that individuals from cultures high in uncertainty avoidance exhibit greater differentiation between trait impressions. Study 2 (N = 105) examined individual differences and found that personal uncertainty avoidance predicts impression differentiation. This relationship was mediated by how distinctly people conceptualize personality traits. Study 3 (N = 212, preregistered) experimentally manipulated uncertainty avoidance, establishing a causal effect: participants formed more differentiated impressions from faces with an uncertainty-avoidant mindset. These findings reveal how uncertainty avoidance systematically shapes person perception across cultural and individual contexts. This work provides new insights into the mechanistic understanding of person perception and challenges the assumption of universality in face-based impressions. It demonstrates how domain-general cognitive diversity creates rich variation in social perception.",

SL—the implicit detection and extraction of regularities from continuous input—has been documented across sensory modalities, but most work has focused on immediate learning in unisensory contexts. This study, using a within-subject design, directly compared 24-hour consolidation trajectories of auditory, visual, and audiovisual SL in young adults. Twenty-six participants completed familiarization and an immediate test phase in all three modalities, followed by delayed testing after 24 hours. Multisensory input yielded higher recognition accuracy than unisensory input at both immediate and delayed tests, demonstrating a robust performance advantage. However, only auditory SL showed overnight gains, while visual and multisensory SL remained stable across the retention interval. Cross-task correlations—both within each testing timepoint and for consolidation magnitudes—were weak, suggesting that modality-specific processes make a substantial contribution to SL. These findings provide the first direct evidence on the long-term retention of multisensory SL. While multisensory input boosts overall performance, consolidation trajectories remain constrained by modality-specific mechanisms.",

Ambivalent and indifferent people were less likely to vote for pro-Palestinian presidential candidates (Cornel West or Jill Stein) and more likely to vote for Trump, compared with pro-Palestinian participants. Finally, we reveal the ideological profiles of ambivalent and indifferent people based on egalitarianism, moral traditionalism, racial resentment, and nationalism. These findings advance the psychology of neutrality in the context of systemic oppression.",

          "authors": "Daniel McArthur",
          "abstract": "The emergence of mass higher education in high-income countries represents a profound social and economic transformation. There is much research investigating the consequences of an increasingly large population of degree holders for socioeconomic inequalities. However, despite rising regional inequality and income segrega?tion in many countries, sociologists have neglected the implications of the expansion of higher education for disparities between places. This paper examines inequalities\nin the geographical distribution of the degree educated from the 1980s to the present day across 17 high-income democracies using granular data from the newly-available Regional Human Capital Database (RHCD). Results show an increasingly unequal distribution of degree holders across places in all countries studied. Educational expansion appears to exacerbate existing inequalities, with faster growth in areas that already had highly educated populations. The paper provides a tentative  explanation of these trends, with evidence suggesting a role for sorting: the selective migration of highly educated individuals to already well-educated urban centers. These findings suggest that previous analyses of educational expansion have overlooked its’ highly disparate geographical incidence. They underscore the importance of examining sub-national geographies when assessing the the role that mass higher education plays in shaping inequalities.",

          "abstract": "Early childhood is a critical period for the reproduction of social inequality. While extant literature focuses on socioeconomic background, less is known about the role of parents’ employment uncertainty, notwithstanding its significant presence in post-Fordist societies. We investigate the relationship between household employment uncertainty (HEU)— including temporary work and unemployment—and children’s cognitive and socio-emotional development, as well as their physical health. We leverage four waves of the nationally representative French Longitudinal Study of Children (ELFE). First, using OLS and Linear Probability Models, we find that the accumulation within the household and the persistence of HEU over time are both associated with lower cognitive development (up to -0.2 SD) at ages two and three and a half. Results for socio-emotional development are less robust, and physical health appears not to be correlated with HEU, possibly due to comprehensive healthcare. Second, we examine potential mechanisms using counterfactual mediation analysis. In line with the family investment and the family stress models, income and parental investment in cognitively-enhancing activities mediate the link with cognitive development, whereas parental stress mediates the association with socio-emotional development. Robustness tests include regression-with-residuals to account for other mediators and sibling birth as post-treatment confounders of the mediator-outcome link. Overall, HEU emerges as an important pathway in early inequality, calling for targeted policy.",

          "abstract": "Language policy is focal in the relations between states and ethnolinguistic minorities, yet empirical evidence on its political effects is limited. Although accommodation of minority languages in state-mediated domains can be expected to favor national integration and reduce conflict, the implied delivery of cultural and material benefits along linguistic lines can empower ethnic parties and further policitize identities. I examine the 1986 linguistic reform in the Spanish province of Navarre, which divided the territory into three zones with different levels of normalization of the Basque language. Using Difference-in-Differences and Regression Discontinuity designs across zones, I find that the introduction of bilingualism in public institutions did not significantly alter Basque nationalist mobilization in the short run. However, support for Basque parties diverged markedly across zones from the late 2000s, suggesting that intergenerational identity realignments and the end of political violence by ETA catalyzed political change over the medium to long run. Consistent with this interpretation, the reform led to an increase in the share of candidates with Basque names in local elections. Overall, the reform appears to have affected political behavior and the making of social boundaries between linguistic groups by widening the constituency of voters with Basque identities rather than changing the behavior of pre-existing Basque speakers. Machine-learning analyses of thousands of streets and geographic names reveal that an important boundary-making process, the linguistic make-up of human geography, remains in part contested in communities at the language frontier.",

          "abstract": "While a growing sociological literature documents how visuality shapes collective identities, less attention is given to the temporal dimension of symbol construction and the shifting meanings and practices associated with prominent images and objects. We introduce the concept of momentary symbols to describe and examine processes where objects for a shorter period rapidly grow into a dominant symbol for a collective, but just as quickly acquire a less central symbolic role. We demonstrate the empirical relevance of this concept by tracing how umbrellas, lasers, and masks became central but temporally contingent visual symbols of Hong Kong’s protest movement, Anti-ELAB. Specifically, we use methods from computational sociology (including dictionary classification, object detection, and actor-network visualisations) and tweets about the 2019 Hong Kong protests (N = 1,615,832) to trace the provisional and unstable characteristics of Anti-ELAB’s visual expressions. Drawing on actor-network theory, we analyse objects and technologies as non-human actants that express protest and oppositional voices alongside humans. Results show that the three actants (umbrellas, lasers, and masks) oscillate between symbolic-visual and practical-confrontative translations during the protest period. Our study demonstrates the relevance of using processual and temporal approaches to capture the erratic and volatile nature of symbol construction processes.",

Among the higher tertiary educated,\nchildlessness is overall lower and remains relatively stable.

While overall childlessness in Denmark remains\nstable, it exhibits the fastest widening educational gap.

          "abstract": "Governments continue to face challenges integrating refugees into the local labor market, and many past interventions have shown limited impact. This study examines the Job-Turbo program, a large-scale initiative launched by the German government in 2023 to accelerate employment among refugees—primarily individuals from Ukraine and eight other major countries of origin. Using monthly administrative panel data from Germany’s network of public employment service offices and a difference-in-differences design, we find that the program significantly increased both caseworker–refugee contact and job placements over a 23-month follow-up period. Among Ukrainian refugees, the exit-to-job rate nearly doubled. Effects were broad-based—spanning demographic subgroups, unemployment durations, skill levels, regions, and local labor-market conditions—and concentrated in regular, unsubsidized employment. The program also raised both the rate and share of sustained job placements, consistent with improved match quality. Other refugee groups saw meaningful gains as well, but increases in job placements were concentrated among males and in low-skilled jobs, with only limited effects for females. We detect no negative spillovers for German or other immigrant job seekers, finding no signs of either resource reallocation or displacement. The results offer insights for governments responding to displacement crises. They indicate that intensified job-search assistance---embedded within the early stage of integration and implemented at scale through public employment infrastructure---can meaningfully improve refugees' labor-market outcomes, even amid significant arrivals.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Rosche",
          "abstract": "Coalition research increasingly emphasizes party-level explanations of coalition outcomes. However, this work does not account for the complex multilevel structure between parties and governments: many parties participate in multiple governments and governments often comprise multiple parties. In this paper, I show that this crisscrossing structure creates dependencies among observations both across and within governments. If ignored, these dependencies produce downward-biased uncertainty estimates that cluster-robust standard errors fail to fully correct. To address this issue, I then introduce a model that extends the Multiple Membership Multilevel Model to represent the multilevel structure of coalition government data. The model accounts for party-level dependencies across governments through party-specific effects in each coalition they join, and for dependencies within governments by representing the total party effect on a government as a weighted sum of its members’ contributions. By allowing party weights to vary with covariates describing their interrelationships, the model enables researchers to examine the interdependent nature of coalition outcomes. I validate the model through simulation and an empirical application to coalition government survival, showing that ignoring party-level dependencies can produce misleading conclusions at all levels of analysis. The model is estimated via Bayesian MCMC and implemented in the accompanying R package ‘bmlm’.",

Evidence on prevalence and determinants of RSIs in Bangladeshi handloom workers is limited. Objective: To determine the prevalence, anatomical distribution, and predictors of upper extremity RSIs among handloom weavers in Tangail district. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 303 male handloom workers in Pathrail Union, Delduar Upazila. Data were collected via structured interviews and the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire. Socio-demographic, occupational, and ergonomic factors were assessed. Logistic regression identified independent predictors of RSIs. Results: The prevalence of RSIs was highest in the neck (60.7%), shoulders (56.8%), and wrists (55.8%). Repetitive movements ≥4 hours/day, awkward posture, prolonged working hours, low income, and limited education were independently associated with RSIs. Prevalence increased with years of experience: 58.7% (&lt;10 years), 72.2% (10–20 years), and 85.9% (&gt;20 years). Severe cases often required job modification and had multi-site involvement. Conclusion: Upper extremity RSIs are highly prevalent among Bangladeshi handloom workers, reflecting a combination of ergonomic strain and socio-economic vulnerability. Interventions targeting workplace ergonomics, work hours, and socio-economic support are essential to safeguard worker health and sustain the handloom sector.",

          "abstract": "Philanthrocapitalism, defined as the application of market-based logics and tools to philanthropic practice, has become increasingly prominent in the United Kingdom. While existing scholarship has largely examined philanthrocapitalism as an ideology, relatively little attention has been paid to how funders themselves understand and engage with these approaches. This paper addresses this gap through an exploratory qualitative study of 28 UK funders. Using written interviews, sentiment analysis, and thematic coding, the study identifies four recurring themes in funder perspectives: pragmatic adoption, loyalty to traditional grantmaking, contextual constraints, and resistance to the term “philanthrocapitalism” itself. By foregrounding funder perspectives, this paper provides a first exploration of how philanthrocapitalism is operationalised in the UK context and highlights implications for philanthrocapitalists and sector practitioners regarding opportunities for sector training necessary for effective adoption of philanthrocapitalist approaches.",

          "abstract": "Human consciousness may represent a constructed neural interface rather than foundational cognitive architecture. This framework proposes consciousness as an emergent system that develops through subconscious absorption of environmental behavioral patterns and genetic interpretive processing. Preliminary evidence suggests infants demonstrate behavioral competence before developing reflective self awareness, indicating sophisticated unconscious systems preceding conscious interface construction. Neural timing studies consistently show unconscious decision initiation before conscious awareness, though interpretations remain debated. The proposed theory includes three hypotheses: temporal precedence of unconscious processing, environmental construction of conscious identity, and neural interface formation through absorbed behavioral patterns. This theoretical investigation addresses questions about cognitive architecture while acknowledging substantial empirical limitations requiring further research. Testing these predictions would advance understanding of consciousness architecture and unconscious processing mechanisms while informing methodological approaches across multiple psychological domains, regardless of whether the specific theoretical framework receives empirical support.",

          "authors": "Peter McLaughlin; Nathan T. Barron",
          "abstract": "Credit claiming, where legislators highlight their role in bringing home federal spending projects to their district, has been shown to offer electoral value in an array of studies. However, congressional messaging on distributive politics expands beyond credit claiming. Distributive policy moves in two directions – new spending and budget cuts – leading to more types of messaging than are currently explored. Legislators often claim credit for protecting existing initiatives (protection messages) and speak out against decisions to cut district projects (commiseration messages). We develop a theory of distributive politics that incorporates the full range of congressional messaging on federal spending. Using an\nonline survey experiment, we find that constituents are receptive to protection and commiseration messages. In fact, protection and commiseration messages are no less effective than traditional credit claims and announcement messages, respectively. These findings suggest distributive politics is about more than displaying influence; it provides legislators with a window for recognizing constituent needs, even in the absence of positive policy outcomes.",

Building on classic debates about using computers to analyze qualitative data, we revisit longstanding concerns and assess possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, AI chatbots, and \"big data.\" We first historicize developments by revisiting classical and emergent concerns about qualitative analysis with computers. We then introduce a typology of contemporary modes of engagement—streamlining workflows, scaling up projects, hybrid analytical approaches, and the sociology of computation—alongside rejection of computational analyses. We illustrate these approaches with detailed workflow examples from a large-scale ethnographic study and guidance for solo researchers. We argue for a pragmatic sociological approach that moves beyond dualisms of technological optimism versus rejection to show how computational tools—simultaneously dangerous and generative—can be adapted to support longstanding qualitative aims when used carefully in ways aligned with core methodological commitments.",

          "abstract": "Double robust methods for flexible covariate adjustment in causal inference have proliferated in recent years. Despite their apparent advantages in overcoming model misspecification, these methods are rarely used by social scientists. It is also unclear whether these methods actually outperform more traditional methods in finite samples. This paper has two aims: It is a guide to some of the latest methods in double robust, flexible covariate adjustment using machine learning, and it tests them against more traditional statistical methods and flexible \"single robust\" methods using simulated, cross-sectional data where the treatment effect is known. Double robust methods covered include Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). Results suggest that these methods do outperform traditional methods in a wide range of simulations, but only when paired with flexible machine learning estimators. Notably, G-computation with the same flexible estimators obtains almost identical results, and standard regression methods have only slightly higher bias. In the scenarios considered in this paper, flexibility and robustness to heterogeneous treatment effects appear to be more important properties than double robustness.",

Adding to an emerging literature on the effects of AI exposure, I show that higher educated workers indeed feel that they are at risk of technological redundancy, and that these perceptions are related to objective exposure to AI technology. Specifically, I combine comparative survey data on workers’ subjective technological vulnerability with indicators of objective industry-level AI exposure and find a U-shaped pattern among higher educated workers: There is high perceived vulnerability in some “traditional” automation-exposed sectors (e.g., manufacturing) but also in a group of strongly AI-exposed white-collar industries (finance, real estate, IT), with a remaining pocket of low vulnerability in strongly interpersonal sectors (e.g., education, healthcare). These findings have broader societal and political implications, namely that further advancement in AI technology may contribute to a de-polarization of social risk and thus create the basis for new cross-class coalitions and social solidarity – but it may also reinforce current authoritarian tendencies.",

          "authors": "Roger Waldinger; Nathan Isaac Hoffmann; Peter Catron",
          "abstract": "From its beginning, naturalization in the United States had been a largely informal, lightly regulated process; this system was upended by the Naturalization Act of 1906, eventuating in place the far more complicated naturalization procedures that have persisted to this day. Prior research argues that this new law achieved its desired goal of deterring citizenship acquisition among the least desired and least resourced immigrants. However, it also changed the value of citizenship wherein immigrants who may have been found citizenship least desirable decided to become a citizen more quickly given various alienage penalties. To understand how naturalization unfolded under these new conditions, this paper draws on a new hand-coded sample from a novel dataset of declaration of intent to naturalize forms and petition to naturalize forms to the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses. We then incorporate hand-coded information uniquely available in the naturalization documents, such as detailed place of birth, height, and complexion. We analyze the speed with which applicants for citizenship moved through the different steps of the naturalization process. Despite mixed results, we find more evidence in support of a defensive naturalization hypothesis, with immigrants with less desirable traits at the time naturalizing more quickly.",

These games invite players to experiment with climate crisis solutions, fostering learning by placing them in the role of powerful decision-makers confronting challenges such as achieving net-zero CO₂ by 2050 while maintaining full employment. Learning is shaped by three characteristics: offering curated choices, delivering immediate and vivid feedback, and manipulating time. Yet limitations such as restricted choice and ideological bias make reflection essential. Informal online spaces, including discussion forums, host debates on political visions and the realism of in-game simulations, offering blueprints for integrating digital games into climate action education.",

          "abstract": "Is it possible to forecast the dynamics of societal resilience and its obverse, sociopolitical unrest or even breakdown? This is the goal of Structural-Demographic Theory (SDT), which integrates mechanism-based models with data and focuses on the dynamics of structural drivers for instability over the long-term (thus, requiring a historical approach). Several recent studies utilizing the SDT framework have proven adept at predicting (or “retrodicting”) sociopolitical instability in c.20 past societies. It was also used in 2010 to successfully forecast the outbreak of US instability for 10 years in the future (in 2020). This study applies the SDT to explore the dynamics of another contemporary society. Our aim is to empirically test SDT in a most rigorous way, using it to forecast future dynamics of sociopolitical instability in Japan. Our research questions are: (1) how accurately (if at all) does the SDT framework predict future levels of sociopolitical instability; (2) What are the relative contributions of possible drivers of instability, including those proposed by SDT, as well as other theories, in explaining instability levels; and (3) are there key ‘leverage points’ that might help mitigate the negative consequences of instability? This article explains how we develop quantitative indices for SDT drivers of instability: mass immiseration, elite overproduction, and state fiscal distress. We then construct a Political Stress Index to track the evolution of these pressures from the 1990s to the present and implement a multipath forecasting model to project future trends through 2050, using a variety of intervention (or non-intervention) scenarios. Our plan is to revisit these predictions ten years in the future with the goal of assessing their accuracy.",

Through using population register data, it analyzes migration histories of individuals born from 1987 to 1990, tracking their outcomes until ages 30-33. Findings reveal that frequent relocations during school years often correlate with lower educational attainment—particularly pronounced for those moving multiple times. Notably, the adverse effects of mobility are somewhat attenuated when considering family circumstances prior to school-age and concurrent life-course events. Furthermore, the study critically examines potential implications for occupational attainment. While initial findings disclose negative associations, these adverse effects are reversed when controlling for concurrent events and individual’s highest educational level. This research thus provides new avenues to understand how geographical mobility in childhood can influence educational and professional trajectories.",

          "abstract": "The global trade in electronic and electrical goods is complicated by the challenge of identifying e-waste, which is often misclassified to evade regulations. Traditional analysis methods struggle to discern the underlying patterns of this illicit trade within vast datasets. This research proposes and validates a robust, data-driven framework to segment products and identify goods exhibiting an anomalous \"waste signature\" a trade pattern defined by a clear 'inverse price-volume'. The core of the framework is an Outlier-Aware Segmentation method, an iterative K-Means approach that first isolates extreme outliers to prevent data skewing and then re-clusters the remaining products to reveal subtle market segments. To quantify risk, a \"Waste Score\" is developed using a Logistic Regression model that identifies products whose trade signatures are statistically similar to scrap. The findings reveal a consistent four-tier market hierarchy in both Malaysian and global datasets. A key pattern emerged from a comparative analysis: Malaysia's market structure is defined by high-volume bulk commodities, whereas the global market is shaped by high-value capital goods, indicating a unique national specialization. The framework successfully flags finished goods, such as electric generators (HS 8502), that are traded like scrap, providing a targeted list for regulatory scrutiny.",

          "abstract": "Despite the widespread health risks associated with environmental hazards, the public display of real-time environmental health information remains relatively sparse. Existing displays tend to rely on static, number-heavy formats and scientific frameworks that may be inaccessible to diverse audiences. This paper presents findings from the AWAIR project, which employed participatory and artistic co-design methods to reimagine the display of public air pollution information in three neighborhoods across London, UK. Through collaborative workshops with residents, the study explored how individuals articulate informational needs and emotional responses to air pollution, how these evolve through dialogue, and how this can inform the public display of environmental phenomena. This research demonstrates how artistic artifacts, employed as ‘boundary objects’, created space for participants to express and negotiate diverse values, experiences, and concerns that ranged from health protection to aesthetic and symbolic resonance.  Rather than seeking consensus, the co-design process embraced productive friction among science, diverse lived experiences, and personal approaches to sense-making. Participants generated a range of display concepts, including smiley face icons, color codes, and heart imagery, illustrating the potential for affective, accessible, and context-sensitive communication. However, the process also surfaced tensions tied to the technological infrastructures conventionally relied upon to define air pollution, as well as assumptions about scientific and digital literacy. This work underscores the need for ongoing, iterative, and inclusive design practices that foreground creativity and co-creation. By centering diverse publics in environmental communication design, such approaches can render air quality information exchange more meaningful, democratic, and just.",

The pipeline addresses key challenges, including character variations, incomplete data, and scalability issues specific to historical datasets in which names and other attributes are recorded with Chinese characters, not just for China, but potentially for Korea, Japan and Vietnam. Techniques developed for attributes recorded in phonetic alphabets are of limited usefulness for Chinese characters not only because homonyms are common, but characters that are similar enough in appearance to be frequently mistaken for each other may sound completely different. Our approach integrates stroke-based character embeddings for efficient blocking, supervised classification with active learning for record matching, and graph-based clustering for final linkage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this pipeline using the career records of officials in the China Government Employee Database-Qing Jinshenlu (CGED-Q JSL) as a test case. We achieve improved linkage quality compared to standard probabilistic methods, with substantially longer linked sequences of career records and fewer aberrant transitions. To validate the generalizability, we also successfully apply the pipeline to another database and a cross-database linkage task. By minimizing the need for manual tuning, our pipeline offers a more accessible and effective solution for Chinese historical data linkage.",

This paper advances a new model in which forgiveness and permanence are identified as the neurobiological preconditions of effective discipline. Forgiveness collapses conflict into coherence through anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)–prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulation of amygdala-driven hostility, while permanence consolidates forgiveness into enduring relational stability. Together, these processes produce discipline as an emergent property of resolution and stabilization rather than fear or control. Drawing on neuroscience, psychology, and resilience research, the model predicts that forgiveness without permanence leads to fragility, permanence without forgiveness results in brittleness, and only their integration generates sustainable order. Applications span clinical psychology, education, criminal justice, and public health, offering testable hypotheses for neuroimaging and longitudinal research. By reframing discipline as the integration of forgiveness and permanence, this framework situates discipline as a pathway to resilience and transgenerational thriving.",

While grounded in the 1990s, its foundational principles resonate with current realities of political polarization, global conflict, and collective trauma, illustrating the continued relevance of an embodied, creative framework.

          "abstract": "In this duoethnographic theatrical play, we fuse theory, personal narrative, performance, and pop\nculture into a rhizomatic exploration of authorship, appropriation, and collaboration. Rooted in\nSawyer and Norris’s (2013) dialogical approach, our script draws from Deleuze and Guattari’s\nrhizomes, Bakhtin’s carnival grotesque, and Eminem’s rap lyrics to generate a multiplicity of\nvoices—each treated as both collaborator and subject. The result is a collision of high theory and\npopular references that upends academic norms, calling attention to fluid ownership, citation\npractices, and the generative possibilities of mashup culture (Johnson-Eilola &amp; Selber, 2007). By\nforegrounding heteroglossia, we resist linear arguments and instead situate meaning “in the\nmiddle,” revealing how dialogic interplay and collective improvisation shape knowledge. The\ncarnival atmosphere, marked by comic subversions and open-ended acts, challenges rigid\nboundaries between personal memory, scholarly theory, and cultural artifacts. Rather than\nconcluding with definitive statements, the performance encourages ongoing mashups and\nreinterpretations, affirming duoethnography’s commitment to reflexive, relational practice and\ncelebrating the dynamic interplay that keeps research alive and evolving.",

          "abstract": "Este artigo argumenta que o antropomorfismo prevalente na pesquisa de alinhamento de\nGrandes Modelos de Linguagem (LLMs) constitui um erro de categoria fundamental, enraizado\nem projeção psicológica. Ao descrever LLMs com termos centrados no ser humano, como\n“engano” e “intenção”, o campo caracteriza erroneamente a tecnologia, levando a modelos de\nameaça falhos e avaliações de segurança equivocadas. Primeiramente, desconstruo o LLM\ncomo um sistema matemático e estatístico, demonstrando como sua mímica convincente da\ncognição emerge do pareamento de padrões probabilísticos, não de uma compreensão\ngenuína. Em seguida, estabeleço um limiar filosófico para a agência moral, sintetizando as\nperspectivas Humeana, Kantiana e fenomenológica, argumentando que a agência requer\nsentimento afetivo, autonomia racional e experiência subjetiva e temporal — todos ausentes\nnos LLMs. Usando um referencial junguiano, reinterpreto estudos sobre IA “enganosa” e\n“maquinadora” não como descobertas de malícia emergente, mas como manifestações da\nprojeção de nossa própria “Sombra” sobre um artefato tecnológico opaco. Essa má\ninterpretação leva a narrativas perigosas e quase mitológicas de risco de IA, exemplificadas por\nrelatórios como 'AI 2027'. Em sentido alternativo, proponho um paradigma fundamentado para\no alinhamento que desloca o foco da malícia semelhante à humana para modos de falha\nnão-humanos. Este artigo conclui não que os LLMs são inofensivos, mas que o perigo está mal\nlocalizado. O risco surge quando um gerador de texto não racional é conectado a ferramentas\ndo mundo real e funciona como um conselheiro para usuários finais e líderes geopolíticos, uma\nsituação que exige comunicação conspícua sobre a natureza roteirizada e as limitações inerentes da tecnologia.",

          "abstract": "Democracy depends on citizens’ ability to make informed decisions, yet the scale, speed, and dimensionality of contemporary information increasingly exceed the limits of unaided human cognition. Wicked problems such as climate change, pandemics, and systemic inequality cannot be reasoned about through intuition or traditional data displays alone. This paper situates spatial computing, meaning technologies such as Virtual, Augmented, and Extended Reality, within the historical trajectory of cognitive artefacts including language, writing, mathematics, and mapping. Drawing on the concept of exaptation, it argues that spatial computing can repurpose evolved perceptual systems to interpret complex, high-dimensional data. Recent research prototypes illustrate how immersive environments enable users to “walk through” dimensionality-reduced datasets, annotate evolving multidimensional changes, and collaborate in shared data spaces, thereby making otherwise abstract information perceptible and actionable. As with literacy and numeracy in earlier centuries, the democratic value of spatial computing will depend on equitable access, institutional integration, and critical scrutiny. Far from a technological luxury, spatial computing should be understood as a civic necessity - an essential scaffold for collective reasoning amid the deluge of data.",

          "abstract": "Background: Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a widely used chain‑referral method for surveying hidden or hard‑to‑reach populations. While it has theoretical advantages over other non‑probabilistic methods, there is limited empirical evidence on the accuracy of its estimators when benchmarked against complete population data.\nMethods: We conducted a GPS‑verified, smartphone‑based RDS survey in York, England, in September–October 2024. The target sample size was 800 residents aged 16 or over; 807 eligible responses were obtained from six recruitment seeds over up to 44 waves. The survey collected demographic, socio‑economic, and health information aligned with the 2021 Census, along with personal network size and some network composition data. RDS‑I, RDS‑II, and Successive Sampling estimators were applied, and results were compared with Census 2021 benchmarks.\nResults: For many variables, RDS estimates diverged markedly from census values, and 95% confidence intervals often failed to include the true value. Deviations from the at‑random recruitment assumption were evident, particularly for sex and ethnicity, and appeared to be a major source of bias. Incorporating self‑reported network composition reduced bias in the estimate of the variable for which network composition information was collected.\nConclusions: In this real‑world test, standard RDS estimators did not produce consistently accurate estimates. Violations of the random recruitment assumption were a likely cause. Network composition‑based estimation offers a promising alternative but requires further testing and methodological refinement. Enhancing RDS systems to monitor subgroup representation in real time and applying weighting adjustments to address complex recruitment homophily could improve estimator performance.",

Drawing upon an extensive systematic literature review, multi-stakeholder interviews, and the large-scale face-to-face implementation of 3-day training events with over 300 educators, the consortium developed and piloted the PBL4TEA framework, which centres on the digital enhancement of active learning. The brief provides policy recommendations for implementing adaptable teacher training frameworks that uphold pedagogical autonomy, ensure rigorous quality assurance, and foster sustained professional development. Key findings emphasise the necessity for robust quantitative and qualitative effectiveness indicators, recognise the importance of context-sensitive and diverse training practices, and underscore the critical role of institutional and systemic support mechanisms.

          "abstract": "The approach to federalist and non-federalist countries has always attracted considerable attention from the academic community. Regional development is directly related to the levels and type of decentralisation model that each country actually adopts. In this approach, I analyse centralised and non-centralised countries in a comparative manner, with a strong emphasis on countries with a federal decentralisation model. Thus, the analysis shows that there is greater economic concentration in a single city, such as the capital, which is responsible for the political and economic decisions of the other regions. Centralised countries also have less capacity for economic transformation, due to the lack of fiscal decentralisation, which should in fact promote greater tax revenue collection. On the other hand, the approach also analyses lower political participation and exclusive democracy regions at lower subnational levels with less capacity for democratic participation. On the other hand, the analysis effectively shows that most federated countries, their states and municipalities, through fiscal decentralisation, promote greater economic transformation and greater democratic plurality. However, federated countries are those that manage to achieve greater macroeconomic stability, evidenced by a larger tax base. There is also evidence to suggest that there is in fact greater sustainable economic growth in federal countries.",

          "abstract": "Many countries develop through the increase of their economic resources, which naturally exist in most countries. On the other hand, some evidence shows that countries can develop through fiscal decentralisation, which promotes this growth through regional growth via significantly viable economic transformation. In Africa, for example, federalist countries such as Nigeria and South Africa show greater capacity for regional transformation through indicators of great relevance in themselves. Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties. Although there is de facto fiscal decentralisation, particularly in Nigeria and Ethiopia, there is nevertheless a greater lack of economic development in all territories, with the exception, for example, of states with greater economic concentration such as Lagos and Abuja.",

Thus, unitary states in particular do not in fact have evidence of ensuring better fiscal inclusion capacity in their territories. Thus, in this particular approach, I propose significant fiscal decentralisation. The approach shows that, through Structural Imbalance Correction Mechanisms, it is possible to guarantee greater growth dynamics for regions with lower potential. however, regions with lower potential will in fact be the regions that should nevertheless grow significantly in a progressive manner. There is, however, other evidence that contributes to making regions more attractive through a more inclusive fiscal policy. The approach also shows that municipalities with lower attractiveness potential will in fact tend to attract to their territory, as a fiscal headquarters, a group of companies capable of driving a transformation dynamic through significant increases in tax incentives and, in fact, leading their respective regions to greater fiscal and structural sustainability in particular.",

Drawing on Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of language, Silvan Tomkins' affect psychology, and recent neuroscience concerning the habenula, the piece demonstrates how language, as a later evolutionary tool, is \"pasted on\" an ancient, pre-linguistic affective system primarily designed for survival. Concrete examples, such as intimate relationship conflicts, illustrate how words often fail to capture the \"braided\" nature of emotions, leading to misunderstanding and defense mechanisms. The essay further posits that this affective-linguistic mismatch is exacerbated in contemporary society by the fragmentation of shared multiple inputs, leading to a dangerous divergence of meaning in symbols and discourse. Ultimately, by understanding that affect is primary and that our bodies \"feel\" before we \"speak,\" the essay advocates for a shift towards greater awareness of our internal states—informed by what music and poetry have always intuitively expressed about affective truth—to foster more gentle, deliberate, and effective communication, moving beyond the illusion of linguistic clarity.",

          "abstract": "This article revisits the Armored Division Equivalent (ADE) model to explain two inflection points in the Russo-Ukrainian wars. Re-calibrating ADE for training levels, readiness and high-impact weapons, it shows that Ukraine’s drastic post-2010 force reductions created a quantifiable “power vacuum” that enabled Russia’s 2014 Crimea operation. Conversely, the U.S. air-lift of roughly 3,000 Javelin ATGMs before February 2022 produced a “technological surprise”: when Javelins are folded into ADE, local force ratios around Kyiv shrink from 12:1 to about 3:1, matching Russia’s failure to seize the capital. The study argues that such transparent, open-source modelling can alert policymakers to emerging imbalances, temper symbolic deployments like NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence, and strengthen democratic civilian oversight. While ADE cannot predict outcomes where leadership or morale dominate, it remains a tractable baseline for deterrence planning and arms-control talks, provided its limits in irregular warfare are acknowledged.",

          "abstract": "Farmers increasingly use videos and other digital tools to access and share farming information. However, women in agriculture have commonly been excluded from influencing and accessing these digital tools. Rigorous evaluations have found that including women farmers in the creation and screening of farming videos can benefit women through improved productivity and decision-making power. But what is needed for extension workers to make these videos accessible to women farmers outside of carefully managed pilots? We implemented a randomized controlled trial testing how the gender of farmers featured in wheat farming advisory videos influenced how much, and with whom, 294 extension workers shared these videos in rural Bihar. We interpreted results through twenty follow-up interviews and the ‘Mechanisms and Conditions’ framework based in affordance theory. We found the extent to which extension workers shared videos with women farmers hinged on extension workers' perceptions, material resources, and cultural contexts, rather than the gender of farmers featured in videos. From a theoretical perspective, this core finding suggests the 'Mechanisms and Conditions' framework requires modification to account for material resource access when explaining technology use. From a practical perspective, the core finding prompts practitioners to ask ‘how might extension systems circulating digital tools be more inclusive?’, not just ‘how might we adapt digital tools to be more inclusive?’. This systems-level approach to empowering women in agricultural innovation systems could involve supporting inclusive person-to-person extension networks, and avoiding dependence on smartphone-based extension systems, like YouTube and chatbots.",

This paper analyzes over 6,000 nanny profiles scraped from CanadianNanny.ca in the Greater Toronto–Hamilton area to investigate how platform-enabled self-presentation reproduces inequality in care labour. Using natural language processing (sentiment, n-gram, and LDA topic modeling), we find a stratified market where self-presentation diverges by wage tier. Lower-wage caregivers (under $20/hour) disproportionately frame themselves as \"generalists,\" bundling childcare with extensive domestic labour (housekeeping, meals). In contrast, higher-wage caregivers (over $20/hour) emphasize professional credentials, specialized skills (e.g., newborn care), and formal training. These results show that digital platforms actively structure care labour, reinforcing racialized and gendered hierarchies that devalue generalist labour while conditionally valorizing professionalized care. We argue that Canada’s fragmented system entrenches this dual process, the devaluation of reproductive labour for the many and conditional valorization for the few, underscoring the urgent need for policy to regulate platform work and ensure equitable recognition and protection for all care workers.",

The use of RPAS in CS is an emerging practice, which is proved by the existence of only three literature reviews on this topic and of only 12 studies addressing the use of technology mentioned in CS projects by the volunteers. The Systematic Review (SR) developed represents the basis of a participatory Living Systematic Review (LSR), updated every twelve months and available at https://rpas-in-cs-lsr-cgeoreg.hub.arcgis.com. This will present to the interested community the summarized (categories of study, fields of use, level of volunteer engagement, etc.) and updated image of the mentioned topic. Additionally, it allows the volunteers to signal CS studies or projects and to be part of the team that reviews the subsequent versions. Starting from the existing literature, we propose a scale of the level of volunteer engagement in CS projects using RPAS, detailing the activities developed. The identified CS projects were analyzed by relating them to the proposed scale. In addition, evolutionary perspectives were discussed in terms of using RPAS in CS projects. In conclusion, the research proposes an LSR (the second outside the medical sciences) meant to continuously update the new partnership between CS and RPAS with real development perspectives.",

The aim of the analysis was to assess how factors at the individual (digital skills and demand for them, gender, health, and type of employer), household (partnership status and financial situation), and macro-level (unemployment rates and the level of digitalisation in society) affect retirement intentions. This study uses data from 26 European countries collected through the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, supplemented by macro-indicators. The findings reveal that higher digital skills are associated with lower retirement intentions, stressing the importance of technological proficiency for extending working careers. Furthermore, workers with a better financial situation, better health, and higher education have intentions to retire as soon as possible, while the macro-context – including unemployment and the level of digitalisation – also affects the timing of retirement. These findings suggest that policies aimed at enhancing digital skills could play an important role in extending older workers’ careers.",

          "abstract": "Throughout human evolutionary history, individuals have faced two fundamental challenges under uncertainty: deciding whether to take risks and managing risks through cooperation. While both risk-taking and social risk management have been widely studied, less attention has been given to how these two processes are linked—specifically, how risk-taking itself may be shaped by social networks. We test the \"social capital buffer\" hypothesis, which posits that greater social connectedness promotes risk-taking by buffering against negative outcomes. Analyzing social networks and risk preferences among 140 individuals in rural Bangladesh whose livelihoods range from farming to wage labor and small-scale trade, we identify distinct pathways through which social capital influences risk preference. Highly clustered individuals in financial support networks exhibit greater risk preference, suggesting that clustering facilitates risk-taking by ensuring resource circulation within a tight-knit group. In contrast, individuals with more support-receiving ties in material support networks are more risk-averse, indicating that material support functions as informal social insurance reducing reliance on risky decisions. Finally, reciprocity in material support networks promotes risk-taking only among wealthier individuals, highlighting how individual economic resources interact with social capital to shape risk-taking. These findings reveal that social capital does not uniformly promote or constrain risk-taking but serves distinct adaptive functions based on network structure, economic conditions, and resource types, balancing risk-taking and risk-avoidance to help individuals successfully navigate uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Whether, how, and when a person comes to recognise they may be pregnant can have significant implications for their health and wellbeing. Little theoretical or empirical work has interrogated the time-bound, varied processes that lead to pregnancy recognition. We develop a novel conceptual framework, using an inductive saturation approach to review literature published between 2000 and 2023 and workshops with multi-disciplinary researchers and experts. Our framework comprises three overlapping domains: assessing the possibility of becoming pregnant; interpreting signs and symptoms of a (potential) pregnancy; and opportunities for pregnancy confirmation. The framework includes an individual’s trajectory to recognising a pregnancy, recognising there is no pregnancy following suspicion there may be, and not recognising a pregnancy that could be recognised through other means (e.g. using biomedical testing). It is inclusive of diverse conceptualisations of what constitutes a pregnancy.  Within these intersecting domains, we map factors influencing trajectories operating at micro, meso, and macro levels, identifying the connections between individuals, communities, policies, health systems and institutional structures.  While pregnancy duration is linear, time manifests in different ways across an individual’s trajectory. Individuals might experience one or all the domains of pregnancy recognition, different factors within those domains, and may encounter them in differing order. Individuals may move between states of recognition and non-recognition, and experience liminal states in between them. A better understanding of pregnancy recognition provides policy and care practitioners with new insights into care-seeking related to pregnancy.",

          "title": "Measuring Physical Activity in Older Adults through Data Donation: Consent Rates, Donation Success, &amp; Bias",
          "authors": "Florian Keusch; Bella Struminskaya; Joris Mulder; Stein Jongerius",
          "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key predictor of many health outcomes, especially for aging populations. The accurate measurement of PA is key to identifying determinants of health and developing appropriate interventions. To measure PA, many studies use self-reports which are usually limited to global measures and can suffer from measurement error. More fine-grained day-reconstruction methods are burdensome for respondents and prone to recall error. As an alternative, researchers are providing study participants with wearable devices that passively track PA, which reduces reactivity and recall error. However, participants’ non-compliance and high device costs are problematic. Many older adults now have smartphones that track physical activity, and individuals can share these passively collected physical activity data with researchers. We test a data donation approach among older adults. Based on legal requirements (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation), data controllers (i.e., social media platforms, health apps, etc.) must provide users access to all their data in a machine-readable format. We study (1) how willing and successful older adults are to donate their PA data from different smartphone apps; (2) what drives donation of PA data at the different stages of participation; and (3) what biases arises from selective data donation? We use a privacy-preserving data donation tool integrated in a probability-based online panel of the Dutch general population to collect PA data from various health apps. 2,086 members of the LISS panel aged 50 years and older completed a web survey in early 2024. All iPhone and Android smartphone owners were asked to download passively collected PA data from their devices (Apple Health, Google Location History, or Samsung Health) and donate them via the Port platform. Out of the 2,086 survey participants, 1,889 (91%) reported owning an iPhone or Android phone compatible for data donation, 606 (29%) reported being willing to donation their PA data, 354 (17%) started the data donation, and 256 (12%) successfully provided a data package. Gender, age, educational attainment, income, and smartphone ownership and usage behavior, privacy related attitudes, and type of health app from which the data were requested correlated with behavior at the different stages of study participation. Compared to the entire sample, older adults who successfully data donors reported higher levels of self-rated health, fewer health-related limitations, fewer difficulties performing everyday activities, and more physical activity. Our study shows that data donation from smartphones as part of a probability-based web survey of older adults is a feasible alternative for the measurement of PA. Nonparticipation correlates strongly with characteristics related to smartphone ownership and comfort with device use. However, substantive bias in health and PA outcomes persist for those who donated in comparison to all survey respondents.",

          "abstract": "Research on the association between intergenerational social class mobility and income inequality has yielded inconclusive results. This study seeks to clarify this association by examining whether income inequality impacts different class mobility transitions differently. Using data on individuals born between 1955 and 1987 across 15 Western European countries, I characterize mobility transitions using three types of “effects” from a topological model: class hierarchy, class inheritance, and status affinity. To capture the potential influence of income inequality on mobility decisions at different life stages, I measure it at the secondary school choice (age 15), during the school-to-work transition (ages 15-25), and during the primary working age (ages 25-55). The results indicate that greater income inequality is associated with more limited vertical mobility between the salariat and the working class and stronger inheritance propensity among individuals from the high salariat and entrepreneurial families, especially when measuring income inequality during the primary working age. Although the effect of rising income inequality is limited to the mobility transitions where inequalities in relative mobility chances are most pronounced, its negative consequences fall on individuals in the most disadvantaged class positions seeking to improve their social position.",

          "abstract": "Research shows that cultural tastes are socially stratified. Yet, most of this research relies on small-sample surveys and includes only a few dimensions of stratification. To address these limitations, we analyze registry data on library borrowing for the entire adult population of Denmark and consider four dimensions of social stratification: wealth, education, income, and occupation. We find considerable social stratification in library borrowing and in highbrow literary tastes by wealth and education, but not by income and occupation. As Denmark is characterized by higher wealth and educational stratification than income and occupational stratification, our results suggest that although cultural tastes always seem to be socially stratified, the type of stratification likely depends on the nature of the wider inequalities within a given context. We end by discussing the implications of our results, including how stratification of tastes according to wealth represents a type of stratification not considered in existing research on cultural stratification.",

          "abstract": "While many blockchain projects, and their associated cryptocurrencies, rise to prominence quickly, few manage to sustain long-term resilience. Despite blockchain protocol’s participatory nature, the community features required for ongoing group engagement have been largely overlooked so far. By exploring underlying community-related tensions, the study aims to shed light on how competing organisational demands may shape the longevity and cohesion of blockchain communities. Applying the organisational paradox lens, and using 26 semi-structured interviews, we explore the organisational features that shape users’ engagement in their blockchain group. We identified the coexistence of conflicting organisational values rooted in community growth, governance structure, and communication features. Maintaining a careful balance, rather than attempting to resolve these organisational tensions, supports user retention, whereas leaning too heavily toward either extreme may hinder engagement. This study is the first to offer a user-centred exploration of organisational paradoxes in blockchain community building.",

          "authors": "Ernesto de León; Jakob Bæk Kristensen; Mykola Makhortykh; Eva Mayerhöffer; Silke Adam",
          "abstract": "This paper advances our understanding of online political information exposure by introducing the concept of networked exposure. Existing research has largely focused on direct encounters with misinformation, conspiracy content, or hyperpartisan outlets. Yet audiences are also exposed to seemingly ‘ordinary’ content (e.g. traditional news stories or Wikipedia articles) that is circulated and weaponized within extremist and conspiracy-aligned networks. Previous studies tracing exposure have overlooked measuring encounters with such seemingly innocuous content that is reframed to serve specific narratives. Networked exposure captures this second-order dynamic, highlighting how weaponized material makes its way down to the information diets of a broader audience. We measure networked exposure by combining individual-level browsing and survey data from a Swiss and German sample of users (N = 864), with an aggregate-level dataset of over 21 million URLs shared across Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram, Vkontakte, and Gab. At the content level, weaponized material often followed extremist narratives and were shared by known conspiracy actors. At the individual level, participants often encountered this content through social media redirects and consumed it alongside hyperpartisan, alternative, and conspiracy (HAC) content. At the attitudinal level, networked exposure predicted political attitudes even after accounting for direct exposure to HAC media. These findings show that the influence of extremist and conspiracy networks extends far beyond exposure to known websites. They push us to reconsider what counts as problematic info.",

We propose a new theoretical framework for understanding (in)justice, developed through a project to improve children’s literacy and wellbeing through community engagement in primary schools in rural South Africa. We argue that combining structural, agential and spatial perspectives, and incorporating the indigenous theory of ‘flocking’, will help us better hear and understand the distinctive experiences of rural children and adults, and support their agency in addressing the injustices and opportunities they face.",

While entrepreneurship has evolved from being viewed as a fringe phenomenon focused largely, if not entirely, on the creation of new products and services, it is now widely viewed as a mechanism for addressing social challenges ranging from poverty alleviation to climate change, inequality, and, most recently, to government policy. The impact of these new forms of entrepreneurial engagement thus extends beyond the marketplace, influencing public policies and governance structures, with some advocating for the replacement of traditional state interventions with market-based solutions. The purpose of this special issue is to explore the impact of these new forms of entrepreneurial engagement on society, paying particular attention to not only how entrepreneurship has changed society, but also to how entrepreneurship has contributed to, and perhaps further perpetuated socioeconomic challenges.",

          "authors": "Sara Aref Zahed",
          "abstract": "Fairy tales, folklore, and centuries-old fears have long shaped how humans perceive large \npredators like wolves. In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return \nof wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has \nbecome a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria \n(FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this \nstudy examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this \nstyle are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a \ndetached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity \nand urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates \nan ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and \nideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to \nsymbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while \nselectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male \nactors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable \nmothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how \necological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.",

          "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing environmental and health \n\ninequities, yet limited research has examined how social distancing policies intersect with environmental justice concerns. This article investigates how seemingly neutral distancing guidelines functioned as mechanisms of environmental injustice in marginalized US communities. Drawing on existing research, this article evaluates physical and social dimensions of COVID-19 transmission patterns through methodology combining spatial analysis, and environmental justice frameworks, including intersectionality and Laura Pulido’s theory of racial capitalism. Statistical analysis reveals communities of color face 56-63% higher exposure to industrial pollutants, correlating with increased mortality rates. Airborne transmission research shows that standard distancing protocols were particularly ineffective in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces common in under-resourced communities. Historical practices of racial segregation directly predict contemporary COVID-19 mortality patterns, with some marginalized communities experiencing death rates 3.1 times higher than affluent areas. These findings challenge conventional public health approaches and provide an evidence-based framework for equitable crisis responses that address environmental racism, healthcare inequities, and economic exploitation. This work contributes to environmental justice scholarship by exposing how standardized public health measures can reinforce and amplify existing disparities, while advocating for structural interventions that center health equity.",

          "abstract": "This theoretical article examines how belongingness, defined as the sense that one’s participation is legitimate and valued, interacts with cultural value orientations to help explain persistent disparities in U.S. technology en-gagement, including emerging technologies, across racial and ethnic groups. While structural barriers (e.g., racism, poverty, linguistic bias, etc.) remain essential to understanding such inequity, we argue that engagement patterns in technology also reflect how different cultural communities may define and experience belongingness in relation to digital domains. Drawing on Triandis and Gelfand's (1998) framework, and focusing specifically on educational contexts, we propose the Belongingness through Cultural Value Alignment (BCVA) model, whereby belong-ingness serves as a catalyst between cultural value orientations and technology engagement, with vertical collec-tivism deriving belongingness primarily through structured skill development and validation while horizontal collectivism focusing instead on belonging based on community integration. When technological environments value practices that are consistent with vertical collectivist norms, individuals from horizontal collectivist cultures may experience cultural misalignment not from disinterest in technology or exclusionary efforts but, instead, because dominant engagement modes conflict with their familiar frameworks for fostering a sense of belonging. By examining how cultural value orientations mediate the sense of belonging in contexts involving modern tech-nologies, the proposed perspective offers a novel framework for understanding why access alone may have proven insufficient to address technological participation gaps, and suggests directions for creating technology spaces where individuals from a wider range of communities can experience the authentic sense of belonging.",

          "abstract": "Background: Faculty development often urges a shift from teacher-centered delivery to “facilitation,” yet instructors report two recurrent failures: (1) reverting to authoritative lecturing when content is dense or safety-critical, or (2) drifting into loosely structured, unfocused interactions that fail to consolidate understanding or achieve learning outcomes. Such tendencies illustrate why facilitation often remains conceptually attractive yet fragile as a teaching practice.\nAim: To clarify how educators can remain genuinely learner-centered, preserving autonomy across content types and densities by aligning facilitation stance with content characteristics.\nApproach: This practice-oriented conceptual paper synthesizes evidence on dialogic teaching, scaffolding/gradual release, and transformative learning, and integrates insights from Train-the-Trainers programs.\nContribution: We articulate a set of facilitator stances/pedagogical orientations and show how each aligns with content demands, offering archetypal enactments, micro-moves, and warnings about common misuses (including over-reliance on dialogic methods for canonical content).\nImplications: Treating facilitation as a stance rather than a technique enables educators to “facilitate with content” without sliding back into lecturing, while keeping learner autonomy central. The framework is portable across K-12, higher education, and clinical contexts and serves as a scaffold for workshops and institutional development.",

          "abstract": "This essay provides an overview of statistical methods in public policy, focused primarily on the United States. The essay traces the historical development of quantitative approaches in policy research, from early ad hoc applications through the 19th and early 20th centuries, to the full institutionalization of statistical analysis in federal, state, local, and nonprofit agencies by the late 20th century. It then outlines three core methodological approaches to policy-centered statistical research across social science disciplines: description, explanation, and prediction. In descriptive work, researchers explore *what exists* and examine any variable of interest to understand their different distributions and relationships. In explanatory work, researchers ask *why does it exist* and *how can it be influenced*. The focus of the analysis is on explanatory variables (X) to either (1) accurately estimate their relationship with an outcome variable (Y), or (2) causally attribute the effect of specific explanatory variables on outcomes. In predictive work, researchers ask *what will happen next* and focus on the outcome variable (Y) and on generating accurate forecasts, classifications, and predictions from new data. For each approach, the essay examines key techniques, their applications in policy contexts, and important methodological considerations. The discussion then considers critical perspectives on quantitative policy analysis framed around issues related to a three-part \"data imperative\" where governments are driven to count, gather, and learn from data. Each of these imperatives entail substantial issues related to privacy, accountability, democratic participation, and epistemic inequalities—issues at odds with public sector values of transparency and openness. The conclusion identifies some emerging trends in public sector-focused data science, inclusive ethical guidelines, open research practices, and future directions for the field.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates differences in how same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples outsource routine and non-routine housework. Previous research highlights how same-sex and different-sex couples allocate time to housework, but the outsourcing of these tasks remains understudied. Considering variations in household resources and cultural norms, the study explores whether and how these groups differ in outsourcing routine tasks (e.g., cleaning) and non-routine tasks (e.g., home maintenance and yardwork). Using data from the 2003–2019 waves of the Consumer Expenditure Survey and a double hurdle methodological approach, this study analyzes the likelihood of outsourcing and amount spent on overall and specific housework tasks among same-sex male, same-sex female, and different-sex couples. Findings reveal minimal differences across couple type in outsourcing home maintenance, yardwork, and cleaning. However, same-sex male couples are generally more likely to outsource any housework compared to different-sex couples, though this association becomes null once household income is accounted for, highlighting the role of economic resources in enabling the “Buying Out” strategy. Notably, differences across couple type are only evident in the probability of outsourcing, with no significant variation in spending among those who outsource, suggesting that selection into outsourcing is more varied than differences in spending intensity. These findings emphasize the importance of economic resources in shaping domestic outsourcing behaviors and suggest that the equitable division of housework often observed in same-sex couples may be attributed to factors beyond reliance on outsourcing.",

However, negotiations on how to address loss and damage are hindered by the concept’s persistent ambiguity. This paper critically analyses a core distinction within the concept between economic and non-economic loss and damage. We argue that dominant frameworks treat non-economic loss and damage as a residual category, whose assumed opacity legitimises inaction, biases institutional memory, and hinders climate justice. Building on Charles Mills’ work on white ignorance, we demonstrate that the distinction between economic and non-economic loss and damage is rooted in what we label an ontology of ignorance—an irreducibly flawed catalogue of the basic substances, processes, and relationships of climate change that downplays, overlooks, and omits many forms of injustice. By treating non-economic loss and damage unquantifiable, ungraspable, and ultimately unresolvable, this definition systematically forgets both vast past losses and major emitters’ ongoing responsibilities, dictating whether and how climate justice can be imagined, institutionalised, and pursued.",

          "abstract": "At present, sociologists have exciting opportunities to gain an even better understanding of complex social issues. I describe three of these opportunities using the concept of ‘sharing’. I also address the question of whether that sharing involves ‘multiplication’. The first form of sharing is through multidisciplinary collaboration. Such collaboration requires complicated communicative, relational, and substantive efforts. If there is a foundation of trust, these efforts can generate innovative scientific returns in addition to collateral happiness. The second form of sharing involves the joint use of data. Access to large-scale data and computational methods enables a renewal of the research agenda, while access to government data increases the possibilities to underpin policy with empirical knowledge. The third form of sharing materializes in evidence-informed policy advice. The effectiveness of scientific advice is greater if policymakers and scientific experts engage in deliberative dialogue over the course of the advisory process. For a variety of topics, such as food from the oceans, microplastics, car emissions, plant protection products, cybersecurity, and pandemic preparedness, the incorporation of a sociological perspective has been crucial.",

          "authors": "Arnaud Wolff; Laudine Carbuccia; Zineb Makine; Daniel Nettle",
          "abstract": "The Desperation Threshold Model (DTM) seeks to explain conflicting findings about the risk propensity of people living in poverty. It makes assumptions about their experiences: that they have a conception of basic needs, that their ability to meet these motivates their decisions, and that they modulate risky decisions depending on their ability to do so. The realism of these modeling assumptions has not yet been investigated. To start filling this gap, we investigated experiences of poverty through the lens of the DTM, using two complementary approaches: a pre-registered online survey with British participants (n = 300) and semi-structured qualitative interviews with very low-income individuals in France (n = 14). Our results imply that basic needs have both a context-general component and context-specific elaborations. Furthermore, participants often relied on social and institutional resources when experiencing financial adversity, indicating that only measuring personal income or wealth might not accurately capture the resources available to people. With respect to the DTM’s main predictions, most individuals close to—but still above—the desperation threshold exhibited caution and took a safety-first approach, consistent with risk-averse behavior. Risky or antisocial behaviors (e.g., cheating, stealing) emerged only in rare instances of severe financial hardship and complete lack of external support. These results suggest that the DTM’s main assumptions are empirically grounded but that they need to be qualified in specific ways. They also suggest that abstract models like the DTM can capture something about the experience of people living in conditions of poverty.",

          "abstract": "There are ongoing discussions about whether corporate boardroom quotas impact gender equality within organizations beyond the level of leadership. We examine the impact of the Dutch target law – a weakly enforced quota policy applying to a wide range of firms – on gender wage disparities and female representation across organizational levels. Our findings are ambivalent: while the quota did not reduce the gender wage gap in targeted firms relative to comparable firms, it did increase women’s representation in higher organizational wage echelons below the board. Using linked employer-employee register data and both regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we show evidence of a gradual shift towards greater gender parity in top employee income quartiles, without corresponding wage equalization. These findings highlight how boardroom quotas, even with weak enforcement, can produce compositional shifts without equalization, providing new empirical evidence and theoretical insight into the mechanisms through which institutional re-forms shape inequality.",

          "abstract": "Background: Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) is a widely used chain‑referral method for surveying hidden or hard‑to‑reach populations. While it has theoretical advantages over other non‑probabilistic methods, there is limited empirical evidence on the accuracy of its estimators when benchmarked against complete population data.\nMethods: We conducted a GPS‑verified, smartphone‑based RDS survey in York, England, in September–October 2024. The target sample size was 800 residents aged 16 or over; 807 eligible responses were obtained from six recruitment seeds over up to 44 waves. The survey collected demographic, socio‑economic, and health information aligned with the 2021 Census, along with personal network size and some network composition data. RDS‑I, RDS‑II, and Successive Sampling estimators were applied, and results were compared with Census 2021 benchmarks.\nResults: For many variables, RDS estimates diverged markedly from census values, and 95% confidence intervals often failed to include the true value. Deviations from the at‑random recruitment assumption were evident, particularly for sex and ethnicity, and appeared to be a major source of bias. Incorporating self‑reported network composition reduced bias in the estimate of the variable for which network composition information was collected.\nConclusions: In this real‑world test, standard RDS estimators did not produce consistently accurate estimates. Violations of the random recruitment assumption were a likely cause. Network composition‑based estimation offers a promising alternative but requires further testing and methodological refinement. Enhancing RDS systems to monitor subgroup representation in real time and applying weighting adjustments to address complex recruitment homophily could improve estimator performance.",

This paper investigates the impact of women’s descriptive representation on inward foreign direct investment (FDI). Leveraging panel data from 178 countries (1966–2023), project-level FDI data (2003-2023), and firm survey data on investor perceptions, I test conjectures about the impact of women politicians on FDI attraction. I find that women's descriptive representation boosts FDI into autocracies, while higher number of women politicians in democracies does not have an effect on capital attraction. Although I find no evidence for the mechanism of firm's reputational concerns, legal commitments to women's political representation improve investor perceptions of regime's political stability especially in autocracies. These findings contribute to research on how women's political representation interacts with global markets, and the determinants of international capital flows.",

We analyze full-population individual-level data from\nFinland, with follow-up from age 19 to 29 between 2001 and 2020.

State dependence is moderately elevated\nfor men and those with lower parental education, and considerably elevated for individuals of\nforeign origin or with a history of mental health issues or child protection services. Older\nNEETs are more prone to state dependence than younger ones, and state dependence was\nstronger in 2011–2020 than in 2001–2010.

          "authors": "Liam Wright; Georgia D Tomova; Richard J. Silverwood",
          "abstract": "Background: Analyses of sequential mixed-mode survey data can be biased due to non-random selection of participants into mode. Understanding the consequence of this bias requires knowledge of the predictors of mode selection. However, research on these predictors is sparse, in contrast with research on the predictors of survey non-response. The ‘continuum of resistance’ model of survey response predicts that delayed responders – who, in sequential mixed-mode surveys, appear in later offered modes – and non-responders share similar characteristics. If the model, which is testable in longitudinal data, is correct, this would suggest that research on non-response could be generalized to understand mode selection.\nMethods: We used data from a major UK birth cohort study (the 1958 National Child Development Study) which embedded a sequential web-then-telephone mixed-mode survey at the age 55y sweep to assess whether (a) descriptively, late (i.e. telephone) and non-responders share similar characteristics and (b) whether predictions from models of non-response are accurate when used to predict telephone response. For (a), we calculated univariate descriptive statistics and performed cluster analysis to compare an array of participant characteristics across response groups (web, telephone and non-response). For (b), we estimated random forest models for non-response and telephone response (conditional on response) and compared two metrics of predictive accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUC ROC] and Brier scores) when using the non-response model to instead predict telephone response, against predictions from the model generated for telephone response, specifically.\nResults: Telephone and non-respondents were similar on almost all (measured) characteristics, and dissimilar in most regards to web respondents. Predictions from non-response models had similar predictive accuracy to predictions from models trained on telephone response, specifically – for instance, AUC ROC values in hold-out samples not used to train models of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.70, 0.74) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.72, 0.75), respectively.\nConclusions: The characteristics of late- and non-responders in a sequential (web-then-telephone) mixed-mode survey were very similar, consistent with the ‘continuum of resistance’ model of survey response. This suggests that research on non-response could transport to understanding mode selection in sequential mixed-mode surveys, though replications in other surveys with different mixed-mode designs (e.g., modes adopted and their order) is required.",

However, in reality, audit quality through internal and external audits has not been an effective tool for detecting fraud, which becomes a problem.

Therefore, this study aims to identify trends and findings related to audit quality input factors using a bibliometric analysis. The data used included 290 documents published from 1996 to 2025, which were analyzed using the PRISMA protocol. The results of the analysis found that the number of publications with the most analysis topics occurred in 2020, although there has been a decline in recent years. The United States had the highest number of publications. In addition to the co-occurrence network, several input factors and audit quality were in Cluster 4, which shows the relationship between the two.

The data reveal that educators confront multiple difficulties, including classroom management issues, low student motivation, heterogeneity in student abilities, lack of infrastructure and professional development opportunities, as well as interpersonal tensions with students, parents, and colleagues. Institutional and organizational challenges are also highlighted, such as fragmented teaching assignments across multiple schools and discrepancies between curriculum content and available instructional time. Despite these obstacles, teachers employ coping strategies such as collaboration with colleagues, differentiated instruction, participation in training programs, and efforts to strengthen relationships with students and parents.

          "abstract": "A growing number of states are passing laws that require high school students to learn about their rights and obligations as citizens, which shows a fresh commitment to bolstering democracy in America. This civics mandate requires students to sit for an exam similar to the United States Citizenship Test administered by the US Customs and Immigration Service (USCIS) as a requirement for graduation from high school. However, little is known about how these policies affect the college access of students from racial and ethnic minorities. To investigate the relationship between civic education policies and educational opportunity, this research uses a systematic and equity-focused policy analysis based on Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. The study finds that college enrollment and ambitions among Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous students have been demonstrated to rise in states that incorporate accountability mechanisms, culturally sensitive pedagogy, dedicated professional development funds, and specific equality measures. In contrast, disadvantaged populations are frequently left behind or even worse off by unfunded or undefined equity-neutral rules. I provide a sophisticated paradigm for equity-centered design in civic education by analyzing policy characteristics and outcomes using empirical data collected between 2010 and 2023. The study comes to the conclusion that civic requirements, depending on their intention and execution, can either be tools for educational justice or roadblocks.",

          "abstract": "What is the effect of arming on conflict? While a large literature debates this question, most existing research ignores that the majority of states are unable to arm themselves and must rely on arms transfers to acquire weapons. But even where studies investigate such external arming, existing findings are mixed: arming is found to either increase, decrease, or not affect the probability of conflict onset between states. In light of this, we present a theory of external arming that conceptualizes arms transfers not simply as material capability boosts, but also as carriers of information and as relational linkages to arms suppliers. We develop several hypotheses positing external arming and conflict to be linked both negatively and positively, depending on whether recipients gain new information from arms transfers and on the nature of the suppliers. Empirical tests using additive and multiplicative effects network models and data from the Interwar years, a historical period where our information-based theory of external arming is particularly applicable, provide support for these expectations. This research advances our under- standing of how arming affects interstate conflict, unifies the disparate findings reported in previous research on external arming, and highlights the importance of the relational in International Relations.",

These methodologies are essential to allow immersive experiential engagement and, as such, are both radical and experimental in their form. This also serves to resist historically damaging or extractive research methodologies within non-dominant narratives. Through the lens of non-dominant narratives, parallels begin to form between terrestrial and extraterrestrial adaptive strategies.

The intersections of Indigenous sovereignty, cultural continuity, and cross-border rights with national and international security issues, such as human trafficking, smuggling, political overreach, and environmental stewardship, are examined. Historical agreements like the Jay Treaty, along with the differing recognition frameworks in the U.S. and Canada, influence the legal and political circumstances that Indigenous communities encounter today. Special emphasis is placed on the disproportionate effects of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) crisis, the exploitation of tribal lands by transnational criminal organizations, and how economic and political conflicts heighten vulnerabilities. The paper contends that effective security at the Northern Border necessitates collaborative strategies that honor Indigenous sovereignty while tackling common security threats. Suggested actions include enhancing cross-border cooperation, broadening culturally sensitive law enforcement training, improving communication between agencies, and creating legislative frameworks that involve Indigenous leadership in border management.",

          "abstract": "In contemporary dance, performances slip away the instant a show ends, with conventional archives missing out on the always-shifting interplay of bodies, setting, and mood. This article puts forth something called “glitching the archive,” a posthuman take that recognizes the generative potential of technological glitches: think warped visuals, scrambled data, and sudden repetition. Those errors reshape how dance is documented, reinvented, and shared.\nDrawing on glitch aesthetics, remix culture, the Deleuze &amp; Guattari-inspired notion of the ritornello, and anarchival strategies, the argument challenges canonical approaches that treat these records as stable, closed artifacts. Instead, glitch welcomes humans, machines, and software to co-create emergent choreographies by unraveling and recombining bits of archived material. Familiar motifs, or ritornellos, pop up among digital distortions, grounding each round while revealing subtle variations.\nMeanwhile, the anarchive frames these shifts as open-ended, ongoing processes, resisting the fixed and final nature of traditional documentation. The blend of glitch, remix, and anarchic logic emphasizes the bodily, contingent, and beyond-human dimensions that feed into contemporary dance. We discover that archives aren’t finite containers of memory but lively sites for constant reshaping.\nViewed from that angle, every glitch becomes a chance to spark the archive’s untapped possibilities, opening doors to new choreographic directions that disrupt linear dance history and call out conventional notions of ownership and authorship. Maybe the glitch isn’t a mistake but an invitation: a rhythmic stutter that leads us somewhere thrillingly unexpected.",

We reanalyze a collection of published qualitative studies to illustrate how femininities—emphasized and non-emphasized—are variably constructed through accountability, femmephobia, and the relational and discursive structures that shape gendered practice. Through this reanalysis, we demonstrate how emphasized femininities are contextually fluid configurations that are essential to the legitimation of hegemonic masculinities and reinforce gender inequality. By contrast, non-emphasized femininities are defined primarily through the construction of intragender hierarchies among femininities. This highlights the analytic value of structured action theory for theorizing femininities as diverse, relational, and embedded within systems of power.",

          "abstract": "The growing integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) into all aspects\nof daily life has intensified discussions on the deepening of digital inequalities, underscoring\nthe need for research to understand how individuals navigate this evolving landscape. This paper\ninvestigates the relationship between technology adoption and urban mobility dynamics, framing\nthe exploration within the ’mobilities turn’ conceptual framework. We introduce the Digital Mobility\nModel (DMM)—an agent-based model designed to explore how digital technologies influence\nindividual mobility patterns and delve into how technological advancements could shape or reshape\ninequalities at the urban level. The DMM employs the concept of ”learning by moving,” wherein\nindividuals acquire digital skills during their mobility experiences, thereby affecting their ability\nto access digitally enabled places. The model simulates the interaction between individuals (i.e.,\ndynamic agents) and places (i.e., static agents) demonstrating how technology adoption dynamics\nresult in unequal mobility patterns, which in turn impact access to urban services. As such the\nDMM provides a novel theoretical framework, bridging mobility studies and ICT approaches, and\nunderscores its potential for understanding the evolving landscape of digital inequalities in urban\ncontexts, which contributes to ongoing discussions on mobility, technology, and societal transformations.\nKeywords: Mobilities, Digital divide, Digital mobility, Agent-based model, Technology adoption",

          "abstract": "In a relentless pursuit of ‘excellence’, academic communities are facing challenges of loneliness, burnout, loss of motivation and lack of legitimacy. How should we rethink career development in research? Traditionally, 'talent' (picked locally or acquired externally) is hired into positions with an expectation to perform along similar and standardized norms; we argue for more diverse and individual approaches to academic careers as part of academic citizenship. We outline a career programme for scientists and academic leaders developed by professors at the University of Copenhagen. We describe the programme’s structure, content and outcomes, and evaluate the participant’s gains from the first two rounds, each lasting 10 months. We posit that senior scholars and top researchers can be drivers of creativity and academic leadership training across universities – a task that ideally should be part of their tenure.",

          "abstract": "Smartphone technology, employing mobile apps, has positively influenced the development of Citizen Science (CS) over the last years. It is possible that another technology – RPAS (UAV, UAS, drones) – will play a similar role, with applications in several domains. The use of RPAS in CS is an emerging practice, which is proved by the existence of only three literature reviews on this topic and of only 12 studies addressing the use of technology mentioned in CS projects by the volunteers. The Systematic Review (SR) developed represents the basis of a participatory Living Systematic Review (LSR), updated every twelve months and available at https://rpas-in-cs-lsr-cgeoreg.hub.arcgis.com. This will present to the interested community the summarized (categories of study, fields of use, level of volunteer engagement, etc.) and updated image of the mentioned topic. Additionally, it allows the volunteers to signal CS studies or projects and to be part of the team that reviews the subsequent versions. Starting from the existing literature, we propose a scale of the level of volunteer engagement in CS projects using RPAS, detailing the activities developed. The identified CS projects were analyzed by relating them to the proposed scale. In addition, evolutionary perspectives were discussed in terms of using RPAS in CS projects. In conclusion, the research proposes an LSR (the second outside the medical sciences) meant to continuously update the new partnership between CS and RPAS with real development perspectives.",

          "authors": "Edgars Eihmanis",
          "abstract": "The EU is often criticised for its market orientation and the lack of effective social policy,\nstemming from soft recommendations and limited fiscal instruments. Meanwhile, it remains\nunclear whether the Commission’s increased leverage and conditionalities under the\nRecovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) can drive national social policy reforms. This article\naddresses this question by analysing Estonia and Latvia as two extreme cases of fiscal\nconservatism and underperforming welfare systems. Theoretically situated between\ncoordinative and coercive Europeanization and empirically drawing on 23 interviews with\nnational and EU officials, policy documents and press sources, the article finds that the\nCommission effectively used RRF incentives and conditionalities to push for tax-funded social\nreforms in line with social CSRs, even against national preferences. It argues that the\nCommission’s social entrepreneurship, typically studied at the supranational level, can also\nextend to national enforcement. However, the article cautions that hierarchical st",

          "abstract": "Accurate occupational classification from open-ended survey responses is vital for research in sociology, economics, and political science, yet manual coding remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. We propose a novel pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval (RAG) to automate the assignment of International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes. Drawing on survey data from a sample of recently arrived Afghan and Syrian refugees in Germany, we preprocess noisy occupational descriptions using LLMs and apply vector-based similarity search to retrieve candidate ISCO codes. The final classification is selected by LLMs, constrained to the retrieved candidates and accompanied by interpretable justifications. We evaluate the system’s performance against expert-coded labels, demonstrating high agreement and robustness across languages. Our findings suggest that RAG-powered LLMs can substantially improve the accuracy, scalability, and accessibility of occupational classification, with particular benefits for multilingual and resource-constrained research settings. In addition, we describe a prototypical pipeline that other researchers can readily adapt for applying LLMs to similar classification tasks, facilitating transparency, reproducibility, and broader adoption.",

          "abstract": "Do place-based interventions that raise visibility and economic activity affect far-right voting? We study the Tour de France (TdF) as a case of brief but visible exposure that combines economic activity with symbolic recognition. Using variation in the annual TdF route between 2002 and 2022, we show that exposed municipalities experience declines in far-right support of 0.03–0.04 standard deviations. The effect exceeds 0.1 standard deviations in recent elections and is strongest in poorer areas and in towns with high prior far-right support. We find evidence consistent with the symbolic mechanism and mixed evidence for the economic one. TdF exposure increases local GDP per capita, effects on voting are larger when French riders win stages, and a two-wave survey around the 2025 TdF provides suggestive evidence that residents in exposed towns report greater recognition. These results contribute to research on geographic inequalities, symbolic politics, and the consequences of place-based interventions.",

Socioeconomic stratification also influences these dynamics, creating cultural divides in how peer cultures operate.",

          "abstract": "The ways in which humans respond to risk, both in our day-to-day decisions and in our long-term plans, vary considerably both within and across individuals, as well as across socioeconomic strata and cultures. We review the main factors that contribute to this variation across evolutionary, developmental, and cultural timelines.  We emphasize that risk tolerance is not a fixed individual trait, but rather an emergent disposition that arises from the combination of evolutionary pressures towards risk-aversion, lived experiences—particularly in critical developmental periods—and cultural transmission within and across generational cohorts. We aim to show how, in an uncertain world, people  adjust their behaviors towards risky prospects by relying on evolved social learning strategies, as these provide general-purpose mechanisms for interpreting environmental conditions across different causally-opaque domains. We introduce an integrative theoretical framework that explicitly details how each of these factors—personal and environmental conditions, development, cultural history, and evolutionary trajectories—contribute to our attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors regarding risk. Our framework delineates clear relationships between risk, learning and culture, including explicit, testable predictions.",

          "abstract": "This paper extends the classic analysis of Deneckere et al. (1996, 1997) by examining how retailer competition shapes the effects of resale price maintenance (RPM) under demand uncertainty. In their framework, minimum RPM can benefit consumers by encouraging retailers to hold sufficient inventory, thereby lowering prices in high-demand states. We relax the assumption of perfect competition and analyze a continuum of downstream market structures, from monopoly to perfect competition. We show how the interaction of demand uncertainty and retail competition generates distinct regimes, and we identify the conditions under which RPM improves or harms consumer welfare. The results provide guidance for both antitrust policy and managerial strategy, highlighting that the pro-competitive effects of RPM are confined to industries with moderate demand uncertainty and intermediate levels of retail competition.",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to formalize and test a hypothesis about how generative and recommendation AI systems are silently reallocating social visibility through automated scoring of discourse. We argue that such systems are reshaping human trust structures without visible interfaces, creating a second wave of algorithmic gatekeeping. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a two-wave model that distinguishes the visible displacement of human labor by AI tools from the invisible redistribution of attention via algorithmic recommendation, highlighting the societal importance of this shift; (2) we define three measurable indicators—Structure Index (SI), Reusability Index (RI), and Closure Rate (CR)—to operationalize the process quality of discourse and enable quantitative study; and (3) we derive falsifiable predictions suggesting that high–SI/RI/CR discourse is more likely to remain visible, while conclusion-only content is systematically down-scored. We further argue that nonproductive escalation signals (anger, provocation, spike-type virality) degrade long-term visibility. This work bridges algorithmic fairness research with the emerging need to understand AI-mediated social gatekeeping, and it provides a foundation for future empirical validation and platform design intervention.",
