          "abstract": "Journal editors play a key role in shaping research practices by deciding whether journals adopt policies related to open science and transparency. Despite sustained advocacy for open science, adoption of these policies remains highly variable across social science journals. This proposed qualitative study will use semi-structured interviews to examine how social science journal editors make decisions about adopting open science-related policies at their journals. Guided by the COM-B model of behaviour change, we will explore editors’ perceived capability, opportunity, and motivation to implement open science related policies at their journals. The study will investigate twelve open science policies and practices, with primary focus on data and code sharing and computational reproducibility, open content peer review, and naming the handling editor on published articles. Additional practices include open identities in peer review, materials sharing, preregistration, and publishing registered reports, null results, direct replications, and post-publication critique. Editors will be recruited through an international online community for social science journal editors, and purposely sampled to capture diverse disciplines, journal economic models, and perspectives. Interview data will be analysed using deductive content analysis informed by the COM-B model alongside inductive thematic analysis. By providing rich descriptive evidence on editors’ experiences, reservations, and constraints, this study aims to inform approaches to promoting open science policy adoption at journals.",

          "abstract": "The rigorous treatment of uncertainties in global environmental assessments is essential to characterise the scientific state of the art and to inform policy. Recognizing this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted a standardized assessment framework to promote transparency and consistency in reporting the level of confidence in its key findings — most prominently those featured in the Summary for Policymakers. However, applying this framework is challenging and often leads to confidence statements based on expert judgment rather than a transparent and replicable process. Here we recommend an updated framework for assessing uncertainties that is suitable for lines of quantitative ex-post policy evaluation evidence that inform Working Group II and III reports. The framework uses evidence synthesized from systematic reviews to support robust and transparent confidence statements and to provide a clear and traceable rationale for conclusions. Where such synthesized evidence is lacking, we offer practical guidance and outline intermediary steps for improving confidence assessments. Our approach provides a concrete and replicable pathway to enhance the level of transparency and the reliability of scientific assessments that inform climate policy.",

          "authors": "Niki Pennanen; Robin Welsch; Christian Guckelsberger",
          "abstract": "Generative AI tools for image creation are now mainstream, yet we know little about when and why observers judge them as “creative”. Previous human-robot interaction research suggests that revealing the creation process can raise perceived machine creativity and points that observer differences may moderate this effect. We take these observations from physical robots to the bigger domain of virtual text-to-image diffusion systems by manipulating perceptual evidence (PE), i.e., interface-visible cues about the generation process. We report two preregistered online experiments looking into PE and observer individual differences. Study 1 (N=298) used a within-subjects manipulation comparing Product (final image only) to Product+Process (adding a short animation of the denoising process). Study 2 (N=295) added a between-subjects tutorial (diffusion vs. control) in a 2x2 mixed design. The tutorial briefly explained how diffusion models generate images, intended to raise system-specific literacy. Contrary to previous work, confirmatory analyses found no average effect of showing Process on creativity, and no tutorial effect. Exploratory analyses revealed that general AI literacy moderated the PE contrast, i.e., at lower literacy, observing process tended to lower creativity ratings; at higher literacy, it tended to raise them. Moreover, attitudes toward AI and art interest were positively associated with creativity ratings. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses indicated potential reasons for the lack of overall PE effect. Taken together, these converging quantitative and qualitative findings indicate that individual differences systematically shape creativity judgments of text-to-image GenAI and, in our setting, exert stronger and more reliable influence than PE alone. For design, this implies that process visualizations could help some audiences more than others. Interfaces that adapt to literacy and attitudes, or that pair process views with contextual explanation calibrated to user background, could be more likely to shift judgments than one-size-fits-all depictions of generation.",

          "authors": "Yitong Lin; Jian-Qiao Zhu; Jake Spicer; Yun-Xiao Li; Nick Chater; Adam N Sanborn",
          "abstract": "People systematically deviate from rational Bayesian standards in belief updating, displaying biases such as base-rate neglect and conservatism. Two very different types of model aim to explain these biases: simple heuristics and stochastic sampling approximations of the Bayesian solution, like the Bayesian Sampler. However, neither approach alone accounts for the variety of responses. Here we explore a hybrid Heuristic-Anchored Bayesian Sampler (HABS) which integrates simple heuristics with a Bayesian sampler. In this framework, a simple heuristic provides an initial estimate, which may then be refined through a Bayesian sampling process to approximate the ideal Bayesian posterior. Behaviour thus depends on the size of the sample: if no samples are drawn, a heuristic response is produced, but adding samples will introduce noise while increasing average  judgment accuracy. Analyses of data from a new experiment (N=200) and re-analysis of data from Stengård et al., 2022  revealed that, in most conditions, this integrative approach outperformed purely heuristic or purely Bayesian models in explaining how people update their beliefs in the medical diagnosis task. Our findings suggest that people flexibly combine mental shortcuts and approximate Bayesian processes, illuminating why some responses appear purely heuristic while others reflect approximate Bayesian updating.",

          "abstract": "Men are more morally exclusive than women. When and how does this difference emerge in human development? Across four samples spanning the ages of 4 to 80 (total N = 1,842), we measure people’s moral exclusiveness toward human outgroups and non-human animals in both attitudes and related behaviour. Replicating existing findings, we demonstrate that adult men are more morally exclusive than women in both attitude and behaviour. Crucially, we identify adolescence (13–18 years) as the key window for development: older male adolescents are more morally exclusive than younger male adolescents, while there is no such difference for female adolescents. Linked to this is an increase in social dominance orientation with age in males. We further find the onset of gendered moral exclusiveness: while males are already more morally exclusive than females at the age of 6 and such gender differences persist throughout childhood and in adulthood, they are not yet evident in younger children.",

          "abstract": "Objective. This study aimed to understand the extent to which pre-conception maternal perceptions of pain are associated with future parental perception of their infant’s response to injury.\nMethods. Participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) self-reported pre-conception maternal perceptions of pain at age 18.  When they became parents, they reported their infant’s responsivity to injury (N=84) and uncomfortable procedures (dirty nappy, N=73) at 6 months old. Logistic regression examined the association between pre-conception perceptions of pain and infant responsivity to injury and uncomfortable procedures, controlling for maternal pre-conception anxiety.\nResults. Analysis indicated an almost four-fold increase in parental perception of infant reactivity to injury where parents held perceptions of pain as harmful at age 18 (OR = 5.95, p = .001). There was no evidence that parental perceptions of pain at age 18 influenced the likelihood of reporting their infant could be calmed if fussing about a dirty nappy (OR = 1.34, p = .686). \nConclusions. This study indicates that pain schemas in young adults may pose a risk of parental reinforcement of, and attention to, pain, and greater perceived infant responsivity to pain. Managing pre-conception appraisals of pain could mitigate the impact and progression of unhelpful pain-related cognitions.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Czech and Slovak versions of the brief version of the Session Reactions Scale-3 (SRS-3-B). The SRS-3-B was constructed to be used and interpreted primarily at the item level, but it yields scale and subscale scores as well. Therefore, psychometric analysis focused on both the item and scale levels. Method: Czech (N = 231) and Slovak (N = 235) samples were collected via an online survey. At the item level, item sensitivity, item redundancy, and construct and convergent validity were assessed. At the scale level, the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity were assessed. Results: The measure demonstrated reasonable item sensitivity, non-redundance, construct validity, and convergent validity at the item level. At the scale level, the measure demonstrated a bifactor factor structure that was invariant at the metric level across the Czech, Slovak, and English versions. The total scale and the subscales demonstrated reasonable reliability and convergent validity. Conclusions: The Czech and Slovak versions of the SRS-3-B are valid process measures. They can be used to elicit rich and clinically meaningful feedback from clients within the context of measurement-based care.",

Among friendship practices yet to be fully understood are group- versus dyadic-oriented friendship styles, or whether people socialize with one versus multiple friends at a time. We report two studies comparing friendship styles and relational mobility among 1674 young adults (18-35 years old) in Japan and the United Kingdom. Respondents from both countries completed the Friendship Habits Questionnaire, a new measure of dyadic- versus group-oriented friendship styles. Participants also estimated their friendship group size and time spent in friendship groups versus dyads, and completed a scale of relational mobility. Participants’ group-oriented friendship style, assessed with the Friendship Habits Questionnaire, was associated with larger friendship groups and more time spent in groups, rather than dyads of friends. Compared to Japanese, participants from the UK had more group-oriented friendship styles and were more relationally mobile. Moreover, group-oriented friendship styles were associated with higher relational mobility. These findings provide insights into models of friendship and social relationships promoted across diverse cultural settings.",

          "authors": "Mingrou GUO; Kehan ZHOU; Xiaonan L. Liu; Chuchu Li",
          "abstract": "Retrieval practice reliably enhances long-term memory across many learning domains, yet little is known about how this effect generalizes to sign languages, which require complex visual–spatial processing and coordinated motor production. Across two experiments, we investigated the roles of retrieval practice, motor enactment, and iconicity in American Sign Language (ASL) vocabulary learning among hearing adults, using both holistic and fine-grained phonological scoring. Critically, we observe a selective interaction between retrieval practice and enactment in the handshape dimension: testing improved handshape accuracy only when learners physically enacted the signs, suggesting that motorically complex articulators require the combined support of retrieval-based reinforcement and procedural motor rehearsal. In contrast, dimensions with lower motoric complexity (e.g., location, movement, orientation) showed additive or independent contributions of retrieval and enactment. Together, these findings show that retrieval practice extends to visual–manual language learning, but its effectiveness varies by phonological complexity and motor demands. The results highlight the importance of considering embodied processes in theories of retrieval-based learning and offer practical implications for optimizing sign language pedagogy.",

          "abstract": "People of all ages explore the world through looking. Recently, Raz, Cao et al. (2025) built an image-computable model (RANCH) that predicts adults’ and infants’ looking behavior to a large stimulus set, including graded responses to changes in pose, animacy, and number. This model succeeded despite having only a perceptual embedding space of stimuli. However, looking may be influenced by non-perceptual considerations. Using the same data, we found that adults’ behaviors challenge a key assumption of a perceptual-only account: since the perceptual distance between two items is symmetrical, behavior guided only by perceptual space should also be symmetrical. Yet, adults did not treat changes in different directions as mere reciprocal transformations. For instance, adults looked longer at magical appearance than disappearance. We suggest that image-computable models of looking behavior would benefit from representations of objects, in addition to perceptual features of images.",

          "abstract": "Conflict adaptation refers to the adjustment of cognitive control to reduce interference on subsequent trials. Its neural mechanisms are often studied by assessing the congruence sequence effect (CSE) in face–word Stroop tasks during neuroimaging. The present study aimed to address two key methodological issues when using standard response conflict tasks in fMRI settings: Ensuring the involvement of cognitive control in the CSE and demonstrating its temporal stability across varying inter-trial intervals. In a set of five experiments, using an adapted version of the face–word Stroop task, participants performed either a gender categorization (Experiment 3) or responded to the learned identity of four faces while ignoring the printed name (all other experiments). We specifically incorporated recent advancements in confound minimization to exclude effects of feature integration and contingency learning, included a priming component to further increase the involvement of cognitive control, and used a variable range of inter-trial intervals to test for potential applicability in fMRI research. Although a robust Stroop effect was consistently observed in all experiments, a strong CSE emerged specifically in the gender categorization task. In the confound-minimized face–word Stroop variant, a significant CSE occurred only under specific conditions (e.g., sufficiently long target presentation, bi-manual responses) and was accompanied by substantial inter-individual variability. Therefore, while we observed a reliable CSE in a confound-minimized face–word Stroop task with long inter-trial intervals, the increased methodological rigor that improves precision and interpretability also adds complexity and yields smaller and more variable effects. This trade-off constitutes an important consideration for future fMRI adaptations of the Stroop task seeking to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the CSE.",

          "authors": "Qianru Xu; Chaoxiong Ye; Weizhen Xie",
          "abstract": "Efficient use of visual working memory (VWM) is essential for storing and manipulating information to optimize moment-by-moment visual cognition under a capacity constraint. Yet, how such efficiency is achieved remains a vexing problem. For instance, when observers leverage perceptual organization to group multiple identical objects to retain more visual content, they can do so by grouping items proportional to the redundancy in perceptual inputs or by leveraging a separation-based strategy to maximize identical visual inputs from those that contain at least some discrepancy. Conventional evidence based on behavioral output or univariate event-related potentials (ERPs) could not distinguish these possibilities, motivating the current study to use a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) approach based on a published dataset to address this issue. In a VWM change detection task with scalp EEG recording, participants tried to remember visual arrays containing all-same, partial-different, or all-different orientation bars. Time-resolved decoding revealed early neural differentiation, around 200 ms after stimulus onset, between the all-same condition and the other conditions, suggesting that perceptual grouping benefits emerge early and exhibit a separation-based pattern. Cross-condition decoding further confirmed that visual arrays containing partially-different arrays were represented more similarly to the all-different arrays than to the all-same ones. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual grouping in visual working memory operates through a separation-based neural differentiation, in which full perceptual redundancy enables early compression into compact neural codes while partial perceptual redundancy preserves separable representations to reduce interference.",

This paper provides a narrative review of current evidence of dysfunction in future thinking in psychopathology, and interventions that focus on future thinking among people experiencing psychopathology. Lastly, it provides a range of suggestions for future research to further our understanding of when and how future thinking dysfunction occurs, how it perpetuates psychopathology, and how we can leverage future thinking to improve people’s mental health.",

In this paper, we examine the theoretical and methodological assumptions underlying information seeking research in communication. To explore these assumptions empirically, we compare linked self-report and digital trace data on health information seeking (HIS) over two weeks in a sample of U.S. adults (N=999). Top-level estimates of HIS were similar (39% self-report; 34% digital trace), but there was minimal overlap in those estimates. Measurement correspondence increased for high-volume seekers (≥20 searches). The present study offers an initial attempt at connecting self-reported information seeking with digital trace behavioral observations. Identifying ways to optimize the correspondence between information seeking theory and measurement, while recognizing the unique affordances and limitations of different communication traditions in such studies, should be a priority moving forward.",

          "abstract": "Secrets are on people’s minds more than they are held back in conversation. Research suggests that such mind-wandering to secrets can be problematic for well-being, yet the mechanisms behind this link are still unclear. To better understand what may underlie the harm of mind-wandering to secrets, we conducted two studies. First, in a 14-day daily diary study (Study 1, N = 240) we investigated what people think about when mind-wandering to their secrets, and how these thoughts come to mind in daily life—spontaneously or deliberately. Second, in a 7-day experience-sampling study (Study 2, N = 207) we probed the directionality of relationships between the two types of mind-wandering and affective experiences about secrets. Across studies, when secrets came to mind spontaneously, but not deliberately, people reported feeling greater negative emotion both in the moment (Study 1 and 2) and approximately 2 hours later (Study 2). Our findings point to spontaneous mind-wandering to secrets as a primary player in the well-being costs of secrecy. Further, we offer the first investigation into spontaneous and deliberate mind-wandering to the same target thought in daily life, capturing the temporal dynamics between mind-wandering and emotional well-being. By yielding insights into the way secrets weigh on people’s minds, this research suggests possible ways to manage the well-being costs of secrets, and perhaps other ongoing concerns, in everyday life.",

          "authors": "Amy Louise Atkinson; Rebecca K. Maguire; Jennifer Thompson; John Nicholas Towse",
          "abstract": "Research with adults has led to the proposal of a gating mechanism between long-term memory and working memory, with information from long-term memory entering working memory only when it is beneficial. Across three experiments, we examine functioning of the gating mechanism in children using a novel cross-modal working memory task. In Experiment 1, 7-11 year-old children and adults were presented with four images of animals paired with auditorily presented sounds. Image-sound combinations were congruent with existing knowledge (e.g. cow-moo), incongruent (e.g. cow-baa) or involved neutral pseudowords (e.g. cow-jad). After a short delay, participants were presented with a sound and asked to report the paired image. Replicating previous research, adults showed superior accuracy for congruent pairings, with evidence of no difference between neutral and incongruent pairings. Children’s performance was qualitatively distinct, exhibiting both a congruency boost (congruent &gt; neutral) and an incongruency cost (neutral &gt; incongruent). Effects were replicated in children when set size was varied (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 then increased the interstimulus interval to account for children’s slower processing speed. Here, a congruency boost was consistently observed, with some evidence that an incongruency cost emerged at the lower set size. Taken together, these findings provide clear evidence that long-term memory benefits working memory performance in children. Crucially, however, children appear more sensitive to incongruent information from long-term memory relative to adults. We argue, therefore, that any gating mechanism is not fully developed in 7-11 year old children.",

          "abstract": "Do you believe the world will come to an end within your lifetime, and does that belief change the way you see existential threats to humanity? One-third of Americans answer yes to the first question; we venture to answer the second question here. Stories about the end of the world are historically and globally prevalent and come in many flavours. End of world beliefs have been hypothesized to shape processes of risk perception and social behaviour that have implications for how societies respond to existential threats. Despite their cultural significance, current understanding of the psychology of these beliefs is lacking. In this article, we present the results of six pilot studies (N = 2,079) and one pre-registered study (N = 1,409) that establish a psychological framework for end of world beliefs. A measure of end of world beliefs was created and validated across six religious populations (Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Evangelical Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and nonreligious). We find that end of world beliefs are common, vary along psychologically meaningful dimensions, and are uniquely predictive of people’s risk perception, risk tolerance, and willingness to support extreme action to address the five most pressing global existential risks (i.e., economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal, and technological). Results are interpreted in light of current models of risk perception and the cultural evolution of worldviews. Aligning with sociological and historical analyses, we argue that belief in apocalyptic narratives—irrespective of their accuracy—is consequential for how populations confront concrete risks, including those that threaten humanity today.",

          "abstract": "The motivation intensity theory suggests that the perception of effort (PE) reflects the self-monitoring of resources and is used to self-regulate goal-directed actions. These processes are typically studied separately in the motor or cognitive domain. Here, we tested the effect of cognitive demand on PE in two psychomotor tasks (experiment 1) and we examined the effect of prescribing a target level of PE intensity on performance (experiment 2).\nIn experiment 1 (n=20), we used fixed tempo during two upper-limb psychomotor tasks (Box and Block test and pointing task) with PE as dependent variable. In experiment 2 (n=20), we used fixed PE during a self-paced pointing task with PE as independent variable. In both experiments, heart rate, respiratory rate and electromyographic signal of biceps and triceps brachii were monitored. Cognitive demand was manipulated (low, moderate, high) via a Stroop task, determining which block to move or target to reach.\nResults showed that in experiment 1, PE increased with increased cognitive demand to maintain performance in both tasks. In experiment 2, higher cognitive demand during self-paced pointing at fixed PE led to decreased performance. Heart rate proved most sensitive to cognitive demand changes among physiological variables but failed to reflect the increase in cognitive demand from low to moderate in experiment 1.\nThese results confirm the possibility of using the PE to prescribe and monitor the intensity of a psychomotor task. This study opens perspectives to investigate the unicity of effort and challenge the assumed duality of cognitive vs motor effort.",

          "abstract": "The encoding of locations in world coordinates is often called spatiotopy; it captures how we experience the layout of things around us. The visual system, on the other hand, appears to rely on retinotopic representations. The search for some critical area of the brain that recovers locations in world coordinates from the sequence of fixations as a spatiotopic map, has not met with much success. Here we review earlier suggestions that replace spatiotopic maps with the tracking or remapping of a small number of attended targets to keep their positions updated on retinotopic maps (e.g., Wurtz, 2018; Golomb &amp; Mazer, 2021). This remapping process achieves a simulation of spatiotopy – the target locations are updated and motion responses to the shift of the retinal image are suppressed and discounted. Importantly, we propose that each attended target’s identity is connected to the locations of its features in early visual cortex through a steerable autoencoder network that shifts the feature activity to the target’s new location with each saccade, explaining the many reports of trans-saccadic integration. This autoencoder process is not limited to the remapping function but is part of the overall architecture of the visual system, acting to link target properties together, even as the target or the eyes move.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: This study addresses limitations in standardized mental health measures for assessing psychological distress among Latinx and African newcomers in the United States. \nMethods: Using a longitudinal mixed methods design, we collected quantitative data from 1,188 participants across seven timepoints and qualitative interviews with a subsample of 36 participants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial analyses of NIMH-required instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, DSM-V Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure) revealed unexpectedly low distress scores, contrasting with qualitative narratives describing significant suffering. Through integrated analysis, we identified discrepancies between symptom endorsement and lived experiences, highlighting cultural and contextual factors influencing distress expression. Guided by transdiagnostic frameworks, we developed the Integrated Distress Score (IDS) by combining items from depression, anxiety, stress, and coping measures. \nResults: Confirmatory factor analyses supported a second-order model with strong fit indices (RMSEA = 0.046; CFI = 0.981; TLI = 0.979). External validity was demonstrated through associations with discrimination, social support, and economic insecurity. IDS scores differentiated subgroups qualitatively categorized as “Hidden Stressed and Distressed” versus “Stressed but not Distressed,” capturing heterogeneity in distress and resilience. \nConclusions: Findings underscore the insufficiency of universal symptom-based tools for newcomer populations and advocate for culturally responsive, transdiagnostic approaches that integrate qualitative insights. This work contributes a pragmatic measure for evaluating intervention outcomes and offers conceptual implications for moving beyond categorical diagnoses toward dimensional, context-sensitive models of mental health. Future research should refine and validate IDS across diverse newcomer groups and sociocultural settings.",

          "abstract": "The stress generation model posits that depression and other psychopathology elevates risk that individuals create or select into stressful life events. Although decades of research support stress generation theory, life stress is inherently challenging to assess and model as an outcome variable, and prior studies follow inconsistent methodological standards. Towards a vision of elevated “next generation” research, we present expert consensus methodological guidelines for conducting stress generation research. A panel of researchers with diverse expertise delineates best practice, acceptable, and non-recommended methods across six areas: stressor operationalizations, assessment, longitudinal study design (including intensive longitudinal design), statistical analysis, openness/ transparency, and avoiding stigmatizing language. For example, the review covers modeling stressors as formative variables, statistically comparing effect sizes for predicting independent and dependent stress, and using life stress interviews versus questionnaires, among other methodological concerns pertinent to stress generation research. Following these guidelines will allow future investigators to construct a research base with greater rigor, transparency, and reproducibility, providing a firmer foundation to improve understanding of stress generation.",

          "abstract": "Individuals show robust differences in where they look on a face. Some fixate closer to the eyes while others fixate closer to the mouth. While humans infer mental states and traits from specific facial regions and their expressions, such idiosyncratic gaze patterns may shape how individual features contribute to the overall impression of a face. We hypothesized that an individual’s habitual fixation behavior biases their impression of a face to be aligned more closely with the region they most often foveate. To test this idea, we analyzed fixation patterns on faces in a scene viewing task and independent perceptual judgments regarding valence, arousal, trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness for whole faces and face parts. A linear mixed-effects model confirmed that habitual fixation proximity to eyes, nose, and mouth explained individual differences in how well ratings for whole faces were aligned with those for the corresponding isolated feature. Building on this finding, we ran a second experiment to test whether individual differences in face fixations can predict diverging impressions of trustworthiness in appropriately manipulated images. Observers reported which of two consecutively presented versions of a subtly manipulated face they perceived to be more trustworthy. Consistent with our hypothesis, individuals who tend to fixate lower down or higher up were biased to prefer versions of the face with a more trustworthy bottom or top, respectively. Together, our findings indicate that individual differences in gaze systematically shape and explain our sometimes diverging impression of a face.",

          "abstract": "Determining the degree of similarity between different stimuli is central for intelligent behavior. Psychologists have long debated the nature of similarity, considering whether it is continuous and space-like or discrete and feature-like. Here, we argue that the idea that stimuli are similar to the extent that they are likely to have been generated by the same process unifies these spatial and featural accounts as special cases. We formulate this notion of generative similarity in terms of Bayesian inference over hierarchical generative processes and show how it can illuminate key ideas from the literature including the universal law of generalization, feature contrast models, exemplar and prototype theories, and metric violations in semantic organization. Moreover, just as previous work on similarity drew on connections to multi-dimensional scaling and additive clustering, generative similarity provides a new way to construct representations of stimuli by drawing on contrastive learning, a modern machine learning procedure for learning representations by pushing similar stimuli together and dissimilar stimuli apart. We show how this approach can provide a way to translate hierarchical generative processes into spatial representations that support human-like abstraction and generalization, even in complex domains that are parameterized by probabilistic programs.",

The multifactor account posits that generation improves the processing of the specific information a learner uses to complete the task, and the generation effect will be observed if the memory test depends on the recruitment of that information. Although many psychological phenomena have informed effective study practices, less is known about how the generation effect can be utilized for subject learning, despite a plethora of experimental research on the phenomenon. The proposed study aims to address this knowledge gap by testing claims put forth by the multifactor account using more naturalistic stimuli. In Experiment 1, we aim to assess whether cue-target relational processing is enhanced through self-generation in a test of cued recall for target concept words, and for their definitions. In Experiment 2, we aim to test whether recall for category membership can also be enhanced by self-generation. Two independent t-tests will evaluate our specific hypotheses outlined in Experiment 1, and a repeated measures factorial analysis of variance will test the hypotheses in Experiment 2. The aim of the proposed study is to provide further tests of the multifactor account, using more elaborate and naturalistic stimuli than previous studies, and to contribute to the limited research on the text generation effect.",

          "abstract": "During visual search for targets defined by a specific feature, a representation of this feature (an attentional template) is already activated during search preparation. This has been shown in many experiments that used the contingent attentional capture paradigm. Here, we employed this paradigm to investigate the nature of such preparatory target templates during search for conjunctively defined targets. A globally recruited sample of participants searched for targets defined by a single feature (a particular colour, orientation, shape, or size), or by a conjunction of two features from different dimensions. Search displays were preceded by cues with target-matching features, and spatial cueing effects triggered by these cues were measured to test whether a corresponding preparatory search template was active. Contingent attentional capture effects were found for all four dimensions during single-feature search. When targets were defined by a conjunction of colour and either orientation, size, or shape, capture effects were present only for the non-colour dimension, but were consistently absent for colour, suggesting that no preparatory colour templates were activated. In contrast, both shape and size cues triggered reliable and additive contingent capture effects during shape/size conjunction search. These results show that preparatory templates for target features from different dimensions can be activated independently and in parallel during conjunction search, but that colour templates may only be triggered reactively.",

          "abstract": "The ideas about the origins and role of motor variability have been revised in recent years after realizing that a strictly peripheral origin is not sufficient to explain many observed aspects of brain function. Among these, time processing is emerging as one of the least studied functions where motor variability might have a critical role. Time processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds includes the phenomenon of sensorimotor synchronization (SMS), where both sensory and motor timing processes play in parallel, likely overlapping in time. The most common and simple task to study SMS is paced finger tapping, where a person taps in synchrony with a periodic sequence of brief stimuli as in keeping pace with music. The main observable is the asynchrony, that is the time difference between every response and the corresponding stimulus along the sequence. Here we report that the variability of asynchronies in a paced finger-tapping experiment (N = 44) is correlated with the variability of the tapping force such that participants with smaller force variability have a better timing precision—but only in the absence of auditory feedback from the taps. We explain our observation by describing a potential mechanism based on empirical and theoretical results that bridges the gap between timing variability and force variability. Our results suggest that the tactile feedback in the presence of auditory feedback is mostly irrelevant in the perceptual determination of the occurrence time of the tap.",

          "abstract": "Although borderline personality disorder (BPD) is more frequently diagnosed among sexual minority individuals than heterosexual individuals, it is unclear the degree to which this disparity reflects differences in symptom expression, diagnostic bias, or some combination of the two. Among treatment-seeking adults with BPD (N = 121, Mage = 28.4; 76% female; 89% White; 57% sexual minority), we examined differential item functioning (DIF) and group differences in symptom severity using self-reported and clinician-administered BPD measures (ZAN-BPD-SR, ZAN-BPD-CR, SCID-5-PD). Although there was no evidence of DIF for any self-reported item, sexual minority participants endorsed self-injurious behaviors (B = .63, p = .01), stress-related paranoia or dissociation (B = .62, p = .01), efforts to avoid abandonment (B = .53, p = .02), and unstable relationships (B = .54, p = .03) more often than heterosexual participants on average, contributing to greater past-week total symptomatology (B = 3.88, p &lt; .01). Clinician-administered items assessing self-injurious behaviors exhibited uniform DIF and were “easier” to endorse for sexual minority participants. Further, assessors rated self-injurious behaviors for sexual minority participants more often over the past week (B = .51, p &lt; .01) and past two years (OR = 3.58, p &lt; .01) than heterosexual participants, and affective instability over the past two years (OR = 4.00, p &lt; .05). These results suggest that patients and assessors interpreted most BPD items similarly, while emphasizing the need for nuanced examination of symptomatology and cultural competence in clinical practice to ensure accurate evaluation of BPD across diverse groups.",

          "abstract": "Slider scales, a type of visual analogue scale, are commonly used as a response format in smartphone-based ambulatory assessment studies. This may be due to several advantages of slider scales, including the use of a metric scale compared to an ordinal Likert scale and the intuitive use of slider scales on touchscreens. However, research on the comparability of Likert and slider scales remains scarce, especially in the context of ambulatory assessment (i.e., intensive longitudinal data). To address this gap, we conducted a three-week ambulatory assessment study with four measurement occasions per day, in which we experimentally manipulated the response format (Likert vs. slider scales) between groups. Our final sample consisted of 21,730 measurement occasions nested in 406 participants. We tested for measurement invariance across response-format groups and compared their psychometric properties, including reliability, within-person variability, and validity. Results indicated measurement invariance across groups, with equal factor loadings at the within-person level and equal factor loadings, intercepts, and indicator-specific residual variances at the between-person level. In addition, we found no significant differences in reliability or validity and only minor differences in within-person variability. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of ambulatory assessment studies and offer recommendations for future research.",

          "abstract": "Perceptual systems adapt through individual experience across the lifespan, an ability referred to as plasticity. To understand perceptual plasticity, a promising avenue is to investigate how perception is shaped by cultural experience, as a process deeply embedded within collective practices of cultural production and social learning. The current review synthesizes findings from recent behavioral experiments investigating cross-cultural variation in rhythm perception. Specifically, these studies show that fundamental perceptual processes, such as event timing and rhythm categorization, display shared features but also systematic differences across cultural groups. Critically, these differences correlate with statistically prominent and socially relevant features of cultural production, revealing how perceptual systems are tuned to their music-cultural environments. Yet, how can cross-cultural differences in perception be related back to the collective practices that produce the diversity of cultural environments in the first place? To bridge this gap, we propose perceptual niche construction as an evolutionary approach that positions culture as both a source and a product of perceptual plasticity. That is, cultural experience tunes individual perception, yielding culturally diverse perceptual processes. These processes, in turn, create selection pressures shaping cultural production across nested timescales, resulting in diverse cultural environments. This approach presents implications for research in psychology and neuroscience, notably in proposing to operationalize culture as communities of learning and practice. Moreover, it highlights the relevance of contextually situated research, in view of accounting for the dynamic nature of culture-driven perceptual plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Of all the conceptual distinctions that humans can detect in their environment, only a limited set are encoded in grammars, with striking cross-linguistic consistency. Attributes such as numerosity,\nanimacy, and its subdivisions (e.g., sex) recur across languages, structuring grammatical systems in similar ways. This raises the question of whether human cognition is intrinsically biased toward\nlearning these contrasts and using them to organize grammar, or whether their presence can be explained by usage and cue frequency in experience. We address this question using categorization and artificial lexicon learning experiments that contrast animacy with color, a perceptually distinct attribute that is never grammaticalized. In a non-linguistic task (Exp 0), both attributes were spontaneously selected as categorization cues. Novel grammatical systems mapping exclusively onto animacy (Exp 1) or color (Exp 2) were learned equally well. In Exp 3, where cues to the two attributes were equally frequent and ambiguously related to learned words, participants selected either contrast with comparable frequency. Crucially, the two semantic oppositions interacted, with a tendency of color distinction to be encoded more robustly within the animate category. This pattern mirrors cross-linguistic tendencies, where higher-order animacy categories host richer grammatical specifications.\nThese observations reveal an implicit bias in emergent grammatical systems, in which animacy functions as a privileged organizing dimension. We suggest that this bias arises from the salience and\nreal-life frequency of animacy, which provide a reliable foundation for communicative and processing efficiency in grammar and in the broader architecture of language.",

These features heavily inform psychotherapy theories and popular framings of psychological experience. I first subject these features to a critical examination. I then demonstrate how they can obscure more critical and meaningful targets and foster unwarranted assumptions, potentially contributing to iatrogenic effects and limited treatment efficacy, suboptimal intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning, and concerns pertaining to social control and justice.\n \nKeywords: affect, emotion, valence, emotion regulation, intervention science",

          "abstract": "Background: To counter increasing youth mental health problems, it has been suggested to invest in broadly accessible parenting programs. To date, few online parenting programs exist and the majority provide universal rather than personalized advice. This preregistered randomized controlled trial tested a novel digital parenting intervention, composed of self-monitoring of parenting, a data-driven parenting report, and 6 weeks of online parenting tips to stimulate need-supportive parenting.\nMethods: This preregistered study compared post-intervention parenting (proximal outcome) and adolescent affective well-being (distal outcome) of 321 families in a control condition (100 daily diaries), with 225 families in an intervention group who additionally received a feedback report and add-on parenting tips from day 50 onwards. The report and tips were either universal (n = 107) or personalized (n = 110). This trial was registered at the CCMO: NL-009451 on 19-02-2025 [https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/57487]\nResults: Throughout the study, parents became less need-supportive, but adolescents experienced their parents as more need-supportive. Both parents and adolescents observed decreased overparenting over time. Parents in the control group reported becoming less autonomy supportive and warm (pre-post intervention) which was not found in the intervention groups. Adolescents in the universal intervention group perceived an increase in structure over time and an increase in negative affect (mainly irritability). No significant group differences were detected however (p’s &gt; .06). Hence, an additional 6 weeks of parenting tips and a feedback report (our intervention) did not outperform the impact of 100 days of self-monitoring.\nConclusions: Digital self-monitoring of parenting, combined with data-driven feedback and online parenting tips, seems to make parents more critical of their own parenting, but leaves adolescents more satisfied with the need-supportiveness of their parents. Moreover, this online parenting intervention, designed to target need-supportiveness, might counter harmful overparenting practices.",

          "abstract": "Background: Most individuals who could benefit from psychological intervention remain untreated due to limited funding, workforce shortages, and the slow implementation of scalable, evidence-based short-term treatments. Even when effective single-session interventions (SSIs) are available, Mental Health Professionals (MHPs) training remains a critical bottleneck. Recent advances in Artificial Humans and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable AI-powered clinical simulators that offer standardized, repeatable practice with immediate feedback. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel AI-supported \"triadic\" training architecture for mental health professionals learning single-session Interpersonal Psychotherapy Intervention (IPT-SSI).\nMethod: In a single-group pre–post design, MHPs (N=72) completed a two-hour blended training comprising a didactic workshop (90 minutes) and an experiential, supervised text-based AI simulation (30 minutes). Participants completed baseline and immediate post-training questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, IPT-SSI knowledge, attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy, and willingness/apprehension to deliver IPT-SSI. Post-training user experience ratings and open-ended qualitative feedback were also collected. \nResults: MHPs showed significant pre–post gains in IPT-SSI knowledge (baseline M = 1.13, SD = 0.96; post M = 3.37, SD = 0.92; t(71) = 18.38, p &lt; .001) and self-efficacy (baseline M = 2.27, SD = 1.13; post M = 3.49, SD = 0.95; t(71) = 8.90, p &lt; .001). Attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy improved (baseline M = 3.15, SD = 1.27; post M = 3.67, SD = 0.83; t(71) = 4.16, p &lt; .001, d = 0.49). Willingness to accept clients for IPT-SSI increased (baseline M = 3.22, SD = 1.48; post M = 3.60, SD = 1.08; t(71) = 2.40, p = .019, d = 0.28), whereas changes in apprehension did not reach to significance. User experience ratings were high and qualitative feedback highlighted perceived advantages in psychological safety, accessibility, and real-time guidance, alongside concerns about over-scaffolding and the limits of text-based realism. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that AI-powered clinical simulators—especially those incorporating embedded supervision—may serve as scalable, practice-forward tools to support psychotherapy training. A brief AI-supported program was associated with substantial gains in MHPs' perceived knowledge and self-efficacy and with improved attitudes and willingness to deliver IPT-SSI - key barriers to SSI implementation.",

          "abstract": "Background: The majority of mental illnesses emerge before the age of 25. It is well established that those who are most vulnerable and most in need of mental health support are least likely to access services or take part in research. \n\nAims: Adopting an intersectional lens, this research aims to elicit the experience regarding mental health of young people who feel under represented \n\nMethod; People aged 16 – 24, living in England, who were currently experiencing or had experienced poor mental health in the preceding year were recruited from both NHS waiting lists (in Oxford, Sheffield, Cornwall and Liverpool) and nationally on social media and via charities. 248 people completed an online questionnaire, of which 117 took part in an initial screening call and 81 were interviewed. Unstructured interviews that adopted a narrative inquiry approach were conducted either in person or on online, and audio recorded then transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a combination of thematic and framework analysis. Young people with relevant lived experience consulted on the implementation of the research and recruitment, and peer researchers contributed data collection and data analysis. \n\nResults: Participants engaged with unstructured narrative inquiry interviews, often anchoring their experiences either in their schooling, or in a series of adverse childhood events. Three overarching themes were extracted from the data; the impact of connection, (in)validation, proactively coping and preventive opportunities. These themes highlighted the variation in health literacy and how mental health experiences are understood, as well as whether existing services were experienced as accessible and helpful. Participants were proactive with adopting coping mechanisms in the absence of support and identified times of transition as providing an opportunity for improved support. \n\nDiscussion: There are implications for policy and practice in how mental health is talked about and recognised amongst young people. It is important that young people are empowered to talk about their experiences, and that attempts to seek help or access care are not met with invalidation. Times of transition (particularly around schooling) are opportunities where support could be better offered in a preventative way. \n\nStrengths \n-\tLarge diverse set of lived experience data \n-\tYouth-led involvement strategy for implementing the research programme\n-\tInclusive and intersectional approach \n-\tOpen methodology that enabled participants to set agenda\n\nLimitations \n-\tAbility to represent large diverse data set within existing analytic frameworks\n-\tUnstructured narrative interview methods potentially challenging for some neurodivergent people and those with communication needs.",

Although ED is theorized to develop through caregiving experiences, contextual effects on ED in developmental populations have rarely been investigated, particularly among youth who have experienced disruptions in early caregiving relationships. To illuminate the development of ED, we explored how adolescents’ momentary emotion differentiation (mED) varies across socio-emotional contexts and whether these patterns differ following exposure to severe caregiving-related early adversities (crEAs). Adolescents (N = 81; ages 10–17) with/without crEAs completed a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (4–5 surveys/day), reporting emotions and social contexts. At the trait level, no significant differences in ED emerged following crEAs after controlling for covariates. Consistent with prior research on community samples, higher anxiety/depression was associated with lower negative trait ED across groups. At the momentary level, negative mED decreased following negative parent-related contexts compared to other contexts. However, the standard deviation of these momentary emotions indicated that negative parental contexts were followed by a phasic intensification restricted to a few negative emotions. Importantly, exposure to crEAs attenuated these contextual effects. These data offer initial investigation for the complex ways in which early disruptions to caregiving relationships may shape adolescents’ emotion differentiation.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded directly into social media platforms, enabling users to request real-time fact-checks of online content. Using an exhaustive dataset of 1,671,841 English-language fact-checking requests made to Grok and Perplexity on X between February and September 2025, we provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of how LLM-based fact-checking operates in the wild. Fact-checking requests comprise 7.6% of all interactions with the LLM bots, and focus primarily on politics, economics, and current events. We document clear partisan asymmetries in usage. Users requesting fact-checks from Grok are much more likely to be Republican than Democratic, while the opposite is true for fact-check requests from Perplexity -- indicating emerging polarization in attitudes toward specific AI models. At the same time, both Democrats and Republicans are more likely to request fact-checks on posts authored by Republicans, and - consistent with prior work using professional fact-checkers and crowd judgments - posts from Republican-leaning accounts are more likely to be rated as inaccurate by both LLMs. Across posts rated by both LLM bots, evaluations from Grok and Perplexity agree 52.6% of the time and strongly disagree (one party rates a claim as true and the other as false) 13.6% of the time. For a sample of 100 fact-checked posts, 54.5% of Grok bot ratings and 57.7% of Perplexity bot ratings agreed with ratings of human fact-checkers, which is significantly lower than the inter-fact-checker agreement rate of 64.0%; but API-access versions of Grok had higher agreement with fact-checkers than did not significantly differ from inter-fact-checker agreement. Finally, in a preregistered survey experiment with 1,592 U.S. participants, exposure to LLM fact-checks meaningfully shifts belief accuracy, with effect sizes comparable to those observed in studies of professional fact-checking. However, responses to Grok fact-checks are polarized by partisanship when model identity is disclosed, whereas responses to Perplexity are not. Together, these findings show that LLM-based fact-checking is rapidly scaling, is generally informative although far from perfect, while also becoming entangled with polarization and partisanship. Our work highlights both the promise and the risks of integrating AI fact-checking into online public discourse.",

          "abstract": "What constrains working memory capacity? Classic theories place visual working memory close to perceptual systems, with fixed limits. Yet, emerging evidence shows that visual working memory capacity is increased for real-world objects compared to simple or abstract stimuli. The present study demonstrates that this memory advantage arises from semantic understanding of real-world objects – contrary to classic perceptual accounts of this cognitive system. Using counterfeit objects generated by generative adversarial networks that match real objects in terms of object form and visual similarity, we show that improvements in behavioral performance and increases in neural delay activity emerge solely for semantically meaningful, real objects.  Correlation analyses indicate that subjective familiarity ratings predict memory for real objects, whereas stimulus colourfulness predicts memory for artificial objects, suggesting distinct mechanisms support memory for different stimulus types. Thus, conceptual knowledge exerts strong effects on visual working memory, significantly extending current theories that emphasize low-level perceptual features.",

Using vignette studies, small-group videos, and actual text-based chat conversations, and including a baseline condition with no information on confrontation, we disentangled potential negative effects of serious confrontation from positive effects of humorous confrontation. Contrary to predictions, neither confrontation type reliably reduced perceptions of sexist norms (H1). However, across all three studies, humorous confrontation consistently repaired threats to women's standing (H2) while maintaining group cohesion (H3), and preserving the offender’s status. Together, these findings shift the focus from individual-level benefits and costs to group-level consequences of confrontation, broadening conceptions of effectiveness beyond norm change and personal backlash risks to include the preservation of group functioning.",

          "abstract": "Background: Much of prior literature examines potentially traumatic event (PTE) exposure as a cumulative risk, though PTEs may not have an equal impact on substance use (SU). Methods: In the current study, we test McLaughlin &amp; Sheridan’s (2016) model in a sample of 11,800 community youth (ages 9-15 years old) enrolled in the nationwide, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine the impact of PTE types on SU. We analyze concurrent associations between PTE types (physical abuse, domestic violence, community violence, emotional neglect, poverty, and institutionalization / deprivation) and substance use (pooling alcohol, cannabis, or nicotine) and prospective associations whereby exposure to different PTE types predicts SU one year later (self-medication hypothesis). Results: For concurrent associations, we find emotional neglect and physical abuse were significantly positively related to SU. In terms of prospective associations, institutionalization / deprivation, emotional neglect, and physical abuse significantly positively predicted SU. A majority of associations between PTE types and SU were accounted for by other PTE types and time-varying covariates (e.g., internalizing/externalizing symptoms). The association between PTEs and SU during adolescence varies across PTE types. PTEs categorized as physical abuse and emotional neglect are more likely to lead to SU. Conclusions: Findings suggest that surveillance for SU is especially warranted in youth experiencing emotional neglect and physical abuse relative to other PTEs. Future research should examine more types of PTEs along a wider age span to replicate findings.",

          "authors": "NA; Amanda Kay Montoya; Samantha F. Anderson",
          "abstract": "Moderated mediation models are commonly used in psychological research and other academic fields to model when and how effects occur. Researchers must choose which paths in the mediation model are moderated when specifying this type of model. While the ultimate goal is to specify the model correctly, researchers may struggle to determine whether to err on the side of including too many moderated paths (maximalist approach) or including too few moderated paths (minimalist approach). This registered report examines how the specification of moderation impacts statistical power, type I error rate, and parameter bias for the index of moderated mediation. In a systematic review of papers published using moderated mediation over the course of one year, we found that six model specifications account for 85\\% of published moderated mediation analyses and the median sample size was 285. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation study to examine the impacts of model specification on power and type I error rate, and results were analyzed using multilevel logistic regression. In reference to the data-generating process, the data analysis model can either be correctly specified, over-specified, under-specified, or completely misspecified. Over-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power to detect a significant index of moderated mediation compared to correctly specified models and relatively low parameter bias. Under-specified models were hypothesized to have lower statistical power than correctly specified models but unacceptably high parameter bias. Completely misspecified models were hypothesized to have inflated type I error rates and unacceptable parameter bias. Based on these results we recommend researchers lean more toward maximalist approaches to avoid parameter bias, but acknowledge that this comes with a cost in statistical power.",

To use advanced machine learning techniques to develop a concise and comprehensive screening and monitoring tool for psychiatric disorder risks and evaluate its reliability and validity. \nDesign, setting, and participants. We obtained three datasets of outpatient participants at a psychiatric hospital in China who completed the 567-item Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI). We used the first dataset (N=6,704) for model training, testing, and internal validation to obtain a shortened version (100 items) using the stacked generalization ensemble of several machine-learning techniques. We validated the shortened scale against two prospective pristine datasets (N=928, unpreregistered; N=484, preregistered). \nMain outcomes and measures. The Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC of ROC) to measure validity and Cronbach’s Alpha to measure reliability.\nResults. We reduced the length of the MMPI-2 by over 82%, from 567 to 100 items. The shortened scale can measure ten target conditions with at least 85% AUC and a Cronbach’s Alpha 0.97. We implemented the shortened scaleinto a mobile-friendly web application.\nConclusions and relevance. An advanced machine-learning approach can significantly reduce a long scale to a shortened one while retaining high validity and reliability.  This shortened scale can not only help alleviate pressure on healthcare systems burdened by the increased number of patients with mental health concerns but also allows for regular health monitoring or screening by individuals.",

          "abstract": "In today's increasingly interconnected world, the ability to anticipate future developments has become more critical than ever. While individual predictive abilities are often limited by cognitive biases, the wisdom of crowds—the aggregation of human judgments—has shown remarkable success in improving prediction accuracy. Group discussion can have mixed effects on this success. On one hand, it can enhance collective intelligence through information sharing; On the other hand, it may also undermine crowd wisdom by introducing social pressures that reduce independence and diversity of thought. Using data from a community forecasting site, we developed an interpretable, predictive model to investigate how structural and linguistic-psychological characteristics of discourse affect crowd accuracy. A simple model with 14 independent variables explained 28.6% of the variance in group prediction accuracy on a held-out test set. Notable predictors included a high comments-to-predictions ratio and informal language use (e.g., profanity, religious references, speech disfluencies), which correlated with increased crowd error. Emotional language also played a role, with the use of exclamation marks associated with increased prediction error, while anxiety-related language and detachment showed a modest association with decreased error rates. These findings demonstrate how discourse markers can serve as early indicators of potential crowd prediction failures, offering a practical tool for calibrating collective intelligence and enhancing forecasting accuracy.",

          "abstract": "During inflationary periods, consumers tend to focus on nominal price changes when making consumption decisions, often overlooking the changes in their real purchasing power, a phenomenon known as money illusion. What do consumers think when comparing how they and other consumers make decisions under inflation? Consumers might believe they make economically better decisions than others. However, consumers fail to realize that their choices are more distorted by money illusion than they expect others’ decisions to be. This research uncovers a consequential disconnect: the imprint of money illusion on consumers’ decisions persists despite consumers asserting to prioritize real over nominal value, more so than they believe others do. In nine studies (N = 3075), the self-other difference in the money illusion effect is examined across different decision contexts (buying, selling, salary evaluation). Results show that these self-other differences are more nuanced, varying based on (i) the type of economic decision (pronounced in buying decisions and attenuated in selling decisions) and (ii) the temporal reference point (evident when considering the inflation effect retrospectively and attenuated when considering it prospectively). This research extends the social comparison literature into the domain of inflation, with findings that inform price-setting decisions and perceptions of job appeal.",

However, there are still certain aspects that remain unclear with regard to this concept's dimensions and how it interacts with other variables. The goal of this study was to systematically review studies that analyzed predictors of perceived mental work ability, based on the theoretical framework of the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) and the European Framework for Psychosocial Risk Management PRIMA-EF. Moreover, we also analyzed whether the studies selected for evaluation addressed work ability as a unidimensional or multidimensional construct. Searches were performed in the Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycInfo and PsyArXiv databases with a ten-year limit. Of a total of 1811 potentially eligible studies, 77 were selected based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results showed that the studies conceptualized this construct as perceived work ability and did not include the term mental in their definitions. Of the variables analyzed, those related to personal resources and workplace resources predicted greater perceived work ability. Conversely, age, job demands, psychosocial risks and the absence of both personal and workplace resources were negative predictors. However, with regards to age, positive relations were found when the mental dimension of perceived work ability was analyzed separately. It is noteworthy how limited the body of research is on some personal variables (personality traits and emotional states, aptitudes and physical/cognitive performance, and psychological capital) and attitudinal variables (satisfaction and commitment), as well as certain job and workplace characteristics (industry, job type, type of contract, and type of workday). Finally, an elevated percentage of studies analyzed perceived work ability as a unidimensional construct, resulting in a less precise evaluation of this concept. Practical implications and future lines of research were also addressed.",

          "abstract": "Movement control faces a problem of redundancy. In general, there are more degrees of freedom available to solve a task than the task requires. This ‘degrees of freedom’ problem has been reframed as a ‘motor abundance’ feature (Latash, 2012), where the redundancy enables crucial flexibility. The balance between flexibility and control has been proposed to depend on synergies, which are lower-dimensional organisations of movement dynamics into systems that solve the task at hand. There are now several movement analysis methods designed to search for the signatures of synergies (the uncontrolled manifold, Scholz &amp; Schöner, 1999; tolerance-noise-covariation, Cohen &amp; Sternad, 2009, and others) and a great deal of empirical evidence that synergies feature in movement control. However, while all of these analysis methods rely on notions of ‘task’ to constrain movement solutions, they do not come with a formal theory of what a task is or how tasks are perceived. This paper proposes the hypothesis that tasks should be formalised as task-dynamical affordances, and that perceiving these via specifying information is how they constrain synergy formation (effectivities). I lay out the hypothesis, and detail a research programme to investigate the hypothesis, with reference to existing work on throwing.",

          "authors": "Chaoxiong Ye; Qianru Xu; Liu Qiang; Edward K. Vogel",
          "abstract": "Human observers remember some images more reliably than others – a phenomenon often attributed to image memorability, a stimulus-driven property that predicts consistent memory outcomes across individuals. While memorability has been studied in the context of long-term memory, recent evidence suggests that it also shapes visual working memory (VWM), potentially enhancing how visual inputs are retained over short timescales. Yet, this apparent behavioral benefit could arise from differences in perceptual processing or stimulus comparison at test, rather than from processes specific to VWM. Behavioral measures alone cannot resolve this distinction, because performance in change-detection tasks is influenced by perceptual comparison and decision-related factors at test. To isolate when memorability influences VWM, we combined a lateralized change-detection task with time-resolved electrophysiological measures that index memory-related activity during the retention interval, independent of test-related processing. Participants remembered faces with high or low image memorability while scalp EEG was recorded. Behaviorally, we replicated the memorability benefit in VWM performance. Neurally, we examined contralateral delay activity (CDA) in posterior electrodes as an index of VWM retention. Memorability modulated CDA amplitude during the early phase of retention, before signal stabilization, with only weak or no reliable differences observed later in the delay period. Importantly, variation in early CDA amplitude directly predicted participants’ improved task performance. These findings suggest that image memorability strengthens the transformation of perceptual inputs into durable VWM representations before stable retention is established. Yet, this transient encoding-related advantage does not appear to significantly change the total amount of information maintained at a fixed set size. Thus, memorability likely shapes how VWM is formed, rather than how much is ultimately retained.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Infant fussiness impacts infants, their families and their healthcare providers but the underlying causes and mechanisms are not understood.\nObjective: To identify the common genetic architecture of infant fussiness and its shared genetic pathways with concurrent conditions as well as later outcomes.\nDesign: Genome-wide association study meta-analysis of infant fussiness in the first postnatal year.\nSetting: Five European-ancestry population-based cohorts based in Norway, England and the Netherlands (total N=78128) and two multi-ancestry (Black African/mixed and East Asian) cohorts (total multi-ancestry meta-analysis including European cohorts N=156599).  The association between polygenic scores for fussiness and brain phenotype was studied in an independent cohort, the developing Human Connectome Project (N=264).\nMain outcome and measures: Parent-reported infant fussiness in the first postnatal year\nResults: Infant fussiness showed a significant SNP-based heritability (h2SNP; 8.18%; SE, 0.78%). Infant fussiness shared common genetic architecture (genetic correlation, rg) with toddler emotionality (rg, 0.40; SE, 0.08, P=1x10-6), toddler shyness (rg, 0.25; SE, 0.07, P=2x10-4), adult neuroticism (rg=0.14, SE, 0.04, P=5x10-4), adult BMI (rg, -0.12; SE, 0.03; P=2x10-4), and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (rg, 0.21; SE, 0.08; P=1x10-2). The polygenic score for infant fussiness was positively associated with both the volume of frontal white matter and volume of the medial temporal lobe in newborn infant brains (FWE P&lt;0.02). The European-ancestry GWAS identified a genome-wide significant variant on chromosome 13, rs1504440 that was mapped via chromatin interaction to SLITRK5, which is expressed in the central nervous system and involved in neuronal development. Multi-ancestry analyses identified three further genome-wide significant loci.\nConclusions and relevance: Infant fussiness is common and can be a source of concern for parents and clinicians. Our results, which show that infant fussiness is associated with genomic variation, may help both parents and healthcare providers understand this behaviour. The common genetic variation associated with fussiness is also associated with later toddler temperament, adult personality and some aspects of physical health, and with infant brain structures involved in emotional regulation.",

          "abstract": "Early literacy and numeracy are strongly related across development, but the mechanisms underlying their association remain debated. In this study, we adopted a mutualism-based framework, focusing on longitudinal couplings between cognitive and/or academic domains including word reading, mathematics, and various cognitive skills in 205 Dutch children followed across five waves from kindergarten (mean age: 5.43 years) to Grade 2 (mean age: 7.41 years). Ten domains were assessed, including phonological skills, vocabulary, symbolic comparisons, applied math, verbal and visuospatial working memory, fluid reasoning, RAN, word reading fluency, and arithmetic fluency. Growth curve analyses revealed that higher initial skill levels in several domains, including phonological skills and RAN, were associated with steeper growth rates in word reading and arithmetic. Moreover, we found positive associations between growth rates across various domains, providing partial support for what we introduce here as the ‘developmental manifold’: the notion that the rate of growth (slope) in one cognitive/academic domain is positively associated with slopes in other domains, across early childhood. Regression analyses further indicated that word reading fluency in Grade 2 was predicted by intercepts (but not slopes) in phonological skills, arithmetic and RAN, beyond the autoregressive effects of prior word reading development. Conversely, arithmetic fluency in Grade 2 was only predicted by autoregressive effects of prior arithmetic. Together, our findings demonstrate the crucial importance of longitudinal, multi-domain measurements to understand the developmental interplay between cognitive/academic domains more commonly studied in isolation.",

          "authors": "Katja Rewitz; Wanja Wolff; Maik Bieleke",
          "abstract": "Boredom is a dynamic motivational state that signals disengagement and promotes behavioral change. Despite the centrality of temporal dynamics in conceptualizations of boredom, little empirical work has examined how it unfolds over time during sustained performance and how these dynamics relate to behavioral outcomes. To address this gap, we tracked boredom throughout an incremental cycling ergometer task that was performed until voluntary disengagement. We assessed changes in boredom and examined how boredom dynamics related to perceived physical and cognitive effort and task performance. Individual boredom and effort trajectories were decomposed using functional principal component analysis (fPCA). Whereas physical and cognitive effort showed largely homogenous increases over time, boredom exhibited pronounced interindividual variability, reflecting stable individual differences in overall boredom level and temporal boredom trends. The temporal trend in boredom, but not the boredom level, was associated with performance: greater alignment with decreasing (rather than increasing) boredom trends predicted longer persistence, even after controlling for perceived physical and cognitive effort. These findings corroborate the notion that boredom is not an ‘average’ experience; rather, it is a dynamic process whose temporal unfolding varies systematically across individuals and is directly linked to task persistence. This study provides novel empirical evidence for boredom dynamics, highlighting the value of tracking dynamic subjective experiences to understand task engagement and performance, and of incorporating temporal aspects into contemporary theories of boredom.",

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning revealed that touch aligned partners’ arousal states, enhanced Receivers’ sensitivity to emotional cues, and strengthened prefrontal inter-brain synchrony (IBS).\nCrucially, mediation analyses showed that, prefrontal IBS predicted Receivers’ arousal estimates, which in turn predicted their emotional sensitivity ($d'$), unveiling a touch-specific indirect pathway mediated by arousal alignment.\nTime-resolved analyses  revealed that neural activity in the Sender's prefrontal cortex, particularly inferior frontal gyrus, preceded Receiver neural responses by approximately 16 s. \nThese findings reveal a neural mechanism by which embodied contact sequentially aligns emotional states through prefrontal coupling. \nBy elucidating how touch embeds emotional meaning within a shared neural space, our findings advance an embodied account of human communication and provide a biological foundation for developing emotionally attuned, socially embedded artificial intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how the brain combines object information from vision and touch is essential both for theories of multisensory perception and for designing perceptually coherent interactive displays. While vision often dominates object perception, haptic input provides direct access to three-dimensional object structure. However, the object features encoded by vision and touch at any one time are often not congruent raising the issue of how the senses combine object information into a coherent representation. We used visuo-haptic shape conflict paradigm in an object categorisation task, which was implemented in virtual reality (VR), to address this question. Participants freely categorised novel 3D-objects explored using vision and touch in which an image of the 3D-object was presented in a virtual environment during haptic exploration. We introduced a shape conflict in which the shape of the virtual object parametrically differed from the shape of the physically explored version across six levels of similarity. We found that participants maintained stable category representations across all levels of conflict. However, category decisions relied predominantly on information encoded through haptics with increasing shape conflict. This dominance might reflect a modality appropriateness bias or reduced sensory reliability of visual cues to object recognition in VR. Sensory dominance led to consistent categorisation performance rather than trial-by-trial cue reweighting. These findings have implications for understanding cross-sensory conflict on object categorisation and for predicting the perception of objects in VE and augmented reality displays.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1980s, neuroscientific studies of volition have examined participants’ subjective experience of when the intention to move arises. A common approach involves participants watching a fast-rotating clock, performing a spontaneous movement (e.g., a button press), and then reporting the clock position when they experienced the onset of intention (W time). However, previous evidence suggests that W times might be inferred rather than reflect the true onset of conscious experience. We tested 240 participants in an online version of the clock task using an order (O) mode of recall. After each movement, a stationary clock hand appeared at a predetermined position, and participants indicated whether they had decided to move before, after, or right now relative to the displayed time. Crucially, participants in the deception group were told that the stationary hand reflected an AI system’s prediction of their decision, whereas those in the control group were told the clock position was random. Participants in the deception group selected right now more often than those in the control group, indicating that W reports can be easily biased and may not correspond to a distinct introspective event. This effect was strongest when the bias was small (75 ms) and positive (i.e., when the clock hand appeared slightly later than the participants’ “veridical” W estimate), which we interpret as a symptom of shortcomings of the clock method in general. Overall, our findings suggest that participants can adopt deceptively biased cues, supporting the interpretation that W times are, at least in part, inferred judgments rather than direct readouts of conscious intention.",

          "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to increasingly strong claims about\ntheir human-level linguistic competence and, by extension, their relevance for understanding natural\nlanguage and cognition. While a growing interdisciplinary literature has used behavioural tests and\npsychometric tools to assess LLM performance, particularly in linguistics, such comparisons raise\nsubstantial conceptual and methodological concerns. This paper examines what current semantic\nlimitations in LLMs reveal about the nature of meaning in natural language. Drawing on empirical\nfindings from psycholinguistics, the analysis shows that, despite fluent surface-level performance,\nLLMs systematically lack core aspects of semantic competence, including real-world grounding,\ncommunicative intent, and stable grammatical judgment. These limitations are then situated within\nbroader theoretical frameworks from the philosophy of cognitive science, focusing on Miracchi’s\nreformulation of the Frame Problem and the Relevance Realisation framework. Together, these\napproaches highlight the central role of embodied agency, environmental embeddedness, and socio-\ncultural context in human meaning-making, and clarify why current computational architectures\nstruggle with semantic relevance. The paper concludes by arguing for a bio-cultural conception of\nlanguage, suggesting that the semantic gaps observed in LLMs are not merely technical\nshortcomings but rather reflect fundamental differences between algorithmic systems and human linguistic\ncognition.",

          "abstract": "Gratitude interventions are known to increase subjective wellbeing. However, it has also been suggested that not everyone experiences equivalent benefits of engaging with gratitude activities, and there have been calls to better understand the moderators of such effects. In Study 1, we explored the effects of writing a gratitude letter, relative to a neutral letter, on changes in positive and negative affect, and observed that the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect was exacerbated in participants with elevated life satisfaction. Study 2 sought to replicate the findings of Study 1 whilst minimising demand characteristics, but failed to observe the moderating effect of life satisfaction. In Study 3, we sought to investigate whether these mixed findings could be explained by demand characteristics. We observed that priming participants with information about the benefits of expressing gratitude ameliorated the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but life satisfaction did not moderate this priming effect. On the basis of the findings from these three studies, we conclude that life satisfaction does not moderate the effect of gratitude writing on positive affect, but further work should be undertaken to better understand the conditions under which gratitude writing is most effective. Further, we suggest that demand characteristics are an important consideration for both researchers and interventionists delivering gratitude interventions.",

We aimed to identify central factors influencing the network, as well as bridging nodes connecting personality dysfunction and hostility biases. Results revealed that the intrapersonal dimension of personality functioning—reflecting difficulties in self-perception and self-regulation—was the most central factor, strongly associated with neurotic narcissism, gelotophobia, and hostile attributions, particularly in ambiguous relational contexts. Bridging nodes included hostile attributions in relational situations with different levels of in ambiguity, gelotophobia, and both neurotic and antagonistic narcissism, highlighting the interconnected nature of cognitive biases and maladaptive personality traits. Clinically, the study pointed out the importance of targeting intrapersonal functioning to reduce hostility in personality pathology.",

In addition to the desired effects, such as intensifying or prolonging the high, or counteracting unpleasant effects, polysubstance use also entails risks. To provide polysubstance users with user-centered measures to support health promotion and safer-use, a differentiated understanding of the diverse forms of this consumption practice is required. In an online cross-sectional study, recreational drug users (N= 649) were asked about sociodemographic data and their consumption behavior, with a particular focus on polysubstance use. A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify different types of polysubstance users. The clusters obtained were then tested for diversity using chi-square tests. The cluster analysis revealed three polysubstance use groups that differed in the frequency of mixed use, underlying motivations, and the presence of risk-minimizing strategies. The study showed that consumers who use multiple substances do not constitute a homogeneous group and differ in various characteristics. Taking these individualities and diversities into account must serve as the basis for health promotion to address consumers in a targeted manner.",

Hierarchical planning offers an elegant solution by dividing problems up and conquering them through distributing computation across state spaces and time. However, hierarchical representational abstraction comes at a cost—it can discard information necessary for optimal decisions, reflecting a fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and solution quality. We formalized the adaptive meta-control of this trade-off using a meta-decision-making framework. Applied to a novel navigation task, our model predicts the circumstances under which the benefits of hierarchical planning outweigh the costs. We confirmed our predictions by means of two preregistered human experiments: participants adaptively shifted toward hierarchical planning when (1) the task space was larger, (2) the task horizon was longer, (3) available computational resources were limited, and (4) the environment contained uncertainty. This adaptive adjustment of planning strategy was manifest not only in initial planning choices, but also in the temporal distribution of computations, evidenced by reduced decision quality and longer reaction times at subtask boundaries. The adjustment was accurately captured by our meta-decision-making model. Our findings indicate how humans dynamically adapt their planning strategies in response to environmental demands, uncovering the resource-rational principles governing adaptive hierarchical abstraction in human planning.",

Importantly, we argue that this indirect pathway is contingent upon job insecurity, which heightens the perceived threat of resource loss and intensifies affiliative motivation. Across a three-wave field study of 495 employees in China. We found support for a moderated mediation model: despotic leadership indirectly increases prosocial behavior via communion striving, with this effect amplified under high job insecurity.

The Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) offers a promising dimensional framework to understand psychopathology, but its developmental applicability and the placement of eating disorders (EDs) within it remain unclear. This study aimed to map the hierarchical structure of youth psychopathology, with a specific focus on EDs, across late childhood into early adolescence. \nMethods. We used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, to conduct exploratory (BassAckward) and confirmatory factor analyses on symptoms of 13 mental disorders at ages 9-10 (baseline; N=11,867), 11-12 (2-year; N=10,972), and 13-14 (4-year; N=8,355). We examined the hierarchical factor structure and tested for sex invariance at each timepoint.\nResults. A higher-order structure with Internalizing and Externalizing factors was identified across timepoints. However, the lower-order structure showed developmental differences. EDs consistently emerged as a distinct lower-order factor nested within the Internalizing spectrum. The phenotypic association between ED and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) factors was notable (r ≈ .45–.50). While some specific factors such as oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and OCD were identified, the composition of anxiety-related factors changed across timepoints. Notably, the derived factor structures demonstrated measurement invariance across biological sex at each timepoint.\nConclusion. Our findings support a developmentally sensitive HiTOP model in youth, where ED constituts an Internalizing subfactor by late childhood, with stronger symptom associations in early adolescence. The hierarchical approach captured both stability and meaningful developmental differences, underscoring the importance of integrating a developmental perspective into structural models of psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a statistical method that allows researchers to quantify how well the hypothesized factorial structure of a psychological measure fits the associated data. Fit indices are statistical measures that evaluate the factorial structure by quantifying the degree of model/data fit or misspecification. Researchers generally use traditional or fixed cutoff values of fit indices to judge the appropriateness of their CFA models. However, many authors have discussed the limitations of using these cutoffs, given that they cannot be generalized to all models. Recently, McNeish and Wolf (2023) developed the Dynamic Fit Index (DFI) approach, which generates cutoff values of fit indices that are tailored to the characteristics of a specific model. In this tutorial, a CFA of the Attainment of School Achievement Goal Scale (A-SAGS) was conducted using the lavaan package in R. Next, cutoff values for the fit indices were generated using the dynamic package in R. The model fit of the A-SAGS was mostly satisfactory when interpretations were based on fixed cutoff values. However, the hypothesized model did not reach the dynamic cutoff values, prompting a more thorough investigation into the possible sources of model misspecification. The DFI approach is easily implemented, highly promising, and offers researchers valuable insights as they attempt to improve the construct validity of a given psychological measure.",

Psychologists tend to measure curiosity via behavioural tasks or\nvia self-report personality trait questionnaires, and each measurement method has particular strengths\nand findings related to curiosity’s predictors, putative mechansims, and outcomes. Although behavioural and self-report trait measures of curiosity have rarely been assessed within the same study, recent years have seen the beginning of such an endeavour, and this integration could permit cross-pollination of ideas and hypotheses for future research. After providing a brief review of behavioral and self-report measures of curiosity, I summarise how current evidence supports only mild overlap between the two measurement methods, with positive relations depending on the particular task measure and particular facet of trait curiosity chosen. Divergence between task and trait measures could suggest different cognitive/emotional mechanisms supporting the need to know. Employing multiple personality trait measures with behavioural tasks can help to gain an understanding of the boundaries, inconsistencies, and similarities between different measurements of curiosity.",

          "abstract": "Background: The field of behavioral addictions (BA) research addresses activity domains such as excessive gaming, gambling, and other online behaviors that influence public health policies. A failure to embrace open science practices may lead to concerns about the trustworthiness and reliability of its research outputs. This study explored the current use of open science practices among BA researchers, focusing on the adoption, underlying motivations, concerns, and support needs across seven specific open science practices.\nMethods: We distributed an exploratory survey through professional networks, conferences, and social media and received a final N = 83 (early career researcher (ECRs) N= 41). The survey covered six domains: general use, frequency, importance, engagement, concerns, and support needs related to open science practices.\nResults: Most respondents reported positive attitudes toward open science, with preregistration (75% of total N) and data sharing (65% of total N) as the most commonly used practices. Descriptively, ECRs placed greater importance on these practices than their established counterparts, suggesting a potential generational shift. ECRs primarily reported concerns about insufficient knowledge and fear of errors, while established researchers emphasized workload and a lack of incentives. Both groups highlighted the need for increased time, resources, institutional support, and training.\nDiscussion: Although our findings are descriptive and limited by self-selection and sample bias, they offer initial insights into how open science is perceived and practised in the field. Sustained progress \nrequires coordinated action from individuals, institutions, and professional societies in terms of knowledge transfer and incentives to ensure inclusive and equitable adoption of open science practices.",

          "abstract": "People spend up to half of their waking life spontaneously wandering alone through a vast landscape of thought, recalling past experiences and recombining them to peer into an uncertain future. These spontaneous thoughts are not merely breaks from our otherwise goal-oriented lives. Instead, they may serve important functions. Here, we focus on the function thoughts may play in people’s emotional lives. We test whether expansive thought dynamics, in which thoughts move broadly across conceptual space, support emotional change. Across two studies, we measured if stable or state-dependent expansive dynamics predict how well an individual will recover from a negative mood. Participants in Study 1 (N = 759) underwent a negative or positive mood induction via memory-recall and then verbalized their spontaneous thoughts for 10 minutes. Participants in Study 2 (N = 233) verbalized their spontaneous thoughts for 5 minutes on 21 consecutive days, with an average of 4 days preceded by a negative mood induction. To quantify the expansiveness of thought streams, we computed four complementary measures that characterize how thoughts relate to one another and unfold over time: structural expansiveness, novelty, divergence in subsequent thought similarity, and momentum away from the recalled memory. Results revealed that more expansive thought dynamics predicted greater improvements in emotion, specifically when people were in negative emotional states. Expansive thought dynamics were associated with more frequent transitions into, and greater persistence within, emotionally neutral states. Together, these findings suggest that expansiveness operates as a homeostatic mechanism, helping people return toward their emotional equilibrium.",

          "abstract": "Open science practices provide early-career researchers in special education with resources, mechanisms, and infrastructure to mitigate structural barriers that have constrained research that is critical for providing equitable educational support for bilingual and multilingual students. Bilingual and multilingual children in U.S. schools are at increased risk for misdiagnosis and, consequently, misallocation of special education services due to limitations in our understanding of language development across heterogeneous multilingual profiles and a lack of linguistically appropriate and culturally responsive assessment tools. In this article, we examine how open science practices can help address these disparities by improving transparency, accessibility, and \ncollaboration in basic and translational research involving multilingual populations. We discuss the barriers faced by early-career researchers working in this area and describe how openly available resources can address these challenges while facilitating replication, innovation, and cross-study comparisons. By improving access to data from historically underrepresented linguistic communities, innovative analytic procedures, and multilingual assessment tools, open science enables more accurate identification of language disorders, earlier intervention, and more equitable academic outcomes for bilingual and multilingual children.",

Person-oriented approaches allow analysis of heterogeneous profiles of learners. The purpose of the proposed work is to (a) describe latent profiles of language and literacy skills in Spanish-English bilinguals and (b) determine how age and educational context predict profile membership.\nMethod: We administered assessments of English decoding and semantics (Assessment-to-Instruction; A2i, Connor et al., 2022) as well as parallel experimental assessments of Spanish decoding and semantics (Authors, 2021) to 855 Spanish-English bilingual children in PreK to second grade. A multilevel LPA model was fit with differing numbers of latent classes. The fits of the models were compared using information criteria and approximate likelihood ratio tests to determine the optimal number of latent classes.\nResults: The LRM-LRT and VLMR-LRT indicated that, for kindergarten and first grade, a 3-class model was optimal. Classes seem to be ordered in their means, with Class 1 having the lowest means, Class 2 having slightly higher means in at least one language, and Class 3 having the highest means. For 2nd grade, a 5-class model with more differentiation between high and low performers was the best fit.\nConclusion: Bilingual children’s English and Spanish skills developed primarily in tandem, suggesting cross-linguistic sharing of knowledge across domains. Educational context was related to skills in both languages, with children in dual language education tending to cluster into higher-performing profiles.",

To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted two complementary studies. Study 1 tested whether engaging in a game, compared with a non-game interaction, influences how same-sex strangers perceive each other’s value and relational closeness across repeated encounters. Although both constructs changed over time, gaming did not produce stronger or faster shifts than the comparison activity. Study 2 used an agent-based evolutionary model to explore the conditions under which gaming could spread in a population as a tactic for ally selection. The simulations indicated that gaming is favored when players possess above-average skill and when environmental risk coevolves with population skill; otherwise, gaming tends to drift or disappear. Together, these studies suggest that the social effects of gaming are context-dependent and may not emerge uniformly across game types or interaction settings. The modeling results highlight that risk, skill, and reliability of performance cues are key parameters for understanding the potential evolutionary role of gaming in alliance formation. Future work should integrate long-term interactions, participants’ skill levels, and different game ecologies to clarify when gaming strengthens social bonds and when it does not.",

          "abstract": "Gender minority stress theory is the premier theoretical framework for understanding the health and well-being of transgender and non-binary people. However, a theoretical disconnect exists within this field: the Gender Minority Stress and Resilience Measure (GMSRM), widely used to assess gender minority stress, is rooted in latent variable theory, assuming that different stressors (represented as items on the GMSRM) are statistically unrelated, once their given latent variable is accounted for. However, gender minority stress theory proposes that these stressors cause one another, specifically, that distal stressors cause proximal stressors. To address this inconsistency between theory and measurement, we interrogated the assumptions of latent variable models and considered a relatively new measurement framework psychometric network analysis. Our analysis of GMSRM data from 1006 trans* individuals revealed that the GMSRM is better represented by a psychometric network, rather than multiple latent variables, uncovering complex, direct associations among items across its subscales. These findings highlight the need to align measurement approaches with theoretical assumptions to better understand how social stressors impact transgender and non-binary populations.",

          "abstract": "Individuals engage in a variety of coping behaviors, both positive and negative. Coping affects mental and physical health, including immune function. Data from the National Couples’ Health and Time Study (NCHAT) found differences in coping patterns by sexual orientation, which may have implications for health disparities. The current analyses expand upon these findings to examine immune correlates of coping in a subset of 653 NCHAT participants in the Stress Biology sub-study (NCHAT-BIO). Assays for inflammatory markers [interleukin(IL)-6, C-reactive protein(CRP)] and cellular immune function (Epstein-Barr virus antibody levels) were conducted. Group differences were observed in positive coping, with gay/lesbian respondents reporting the highest levels, followed by plurisexual and heterosexual respondents. Differences in negative coping were also observed, with the highest levels among plurisexual respondents, followed by gay/lesbian and heterosexual respondents. Controlling for age, BMI, sex, and health conditions, negative coping was associated with higher CRP with no moderating effects by sexual orientation. These data provide novel evidence linking greater negative coping with inflammation, per higher CRP, with similar magnitude of association regardless of sexual orientation. Although no significant group differences in inflammatory markers were observed in relation to sexual orientation within this sample, greater negative coping among sexual minority adults could contribute to such effects at the population level. Improving coping via intervention has the potential to benefit not only psychological well-being, but also physiological functioning, particularly among individuals with greater negative coping patterns.",

          "abstract": "Music listening induces a pleasurable urge to move, termed groove, which the active inference framework explains as a motivation for bodily movement that emerges to refine beat and metrical predictions under rhythmic uncertainty. If this is the case, does bodily movement modulate the groove sensation? We asked 42 participants to rate urge-to-move and pleasure after withholding movement or tapping on the onbeat or offbeat within a four-beat meter while listening to melodies with three degrees of syncopation. At the low degree of syncopation, urge-to-move and pleasure ratings were higher in both the onbeat and offbeat tapping conditions compared with the no-tapping condition. Furthermore, relative to the offbeat and no-tapping conditions, onbeat tapping increased groove-related ratings by enhancing neural and behavioral entrainment to the beat, as reflected in the steady-state evoked potentials in electroencephalography and intertap interval variability, respectively. These findings support the active inference account, which posits that bodily movement enhances groove sensation by refining beat and meter predictions.",

Participants read 40 bisyllabic French words selected to maximise vowel-duration contrasts. Vowel durations were extracted using an automatic alignment tool and manually verified. A linear mixed-effects model assessed group differences in word-level PVI while adjusting for demographic and linguistic covariates. Prevalence estimates were based on a clinical cohort of 52 patients. The model showed significant effects of Group and Age. Participants with AOS produced lower word-level PVI values than both CTRL and non-AOS patients. Age was positively associated with PVI. The estimated prevalence of AOS among patients with acute left-hemispheric stroke was 15%. The findings indicate that the word-level PVI captures reduced durational contrast in French-speaking patients with post-stroke AOS. These results support research on the PVI as a complementary acoustic measure in early post-stroke assessment.",

We describe the test’s theoretical framework, item construction, and psychometric validation based on a representative sample of Polish adults (N = 400). The assessment utilizes functional texts (e.g., medical leaflets, job ads) with items tackling comprehension and was calibrated using a two-parameter logistic (2PL) Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Results confirmed the tool’s unidimensionality and high reliability (α = .88). Using Gaussian mixture modeling and external criteria (e.g., self-reported reading difficulties), we established empirically derived cutoff scores that effectively distinguish struggling readers from those with functional proficiency. Findings demonstrate that reliable, unproctored online assessment of low-literacy adults is feasible using ungoogleable items.

We triangulated moral dilemmas, attribution questions, and direct questions about the relationship between consciousness and moral status. Contrary to many theoretical accounts, although moral status was strongly associated with consciousness attributions, consciousness was not perceived as either necessary or sufficient for moral consideration. Instead, our findings suggest that shifting the focus to the relative contribution of consciousness to moral status might be more beneficial. Integrating these insights into current discussions is important for fostering decision-making processes that are transparent, democratic, and mindful of the plurality of public attitudes.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Neural drug cue reactivity (DCR) is a central paradigm in addiction neuroscience for probing how drug cues acquire excessive motivational salience in substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the field faces challenges in clinical translation, replicability, and within-group designs are susceptible to visual confounding due to stimulus matching. A complementary approach is to examine case-control contrasts to identify SUD-specific neural architecture while mitigating effects of task-design variability. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search and an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to identify convergence effects in the contrast drug &gt; control cues between SUD and control groups. ALE results were supplemented by assessing behavioural domains, meta-analytic connectivity profiles, robustness to publication bias, and study-level modulators using penalised logistic regression. Results: The ALE analysis revealed one reliable convergence cluster in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), associated with reward, reasoning, and social cognition. Penalised logistic regression indicated that contributions to this cluster were less likely in alcohol DCR studies and were sensitive to matching conditions for human content. vACC DCR effects contrasted with neutral control cues were invariant across abstinence periods, whereas DCR contrasted with natural reward cues declined with longer abstinence. Conclusion: This meta-analysis replicates context-sensitive SUD-specific DCR convergence in vACC regions intersecting reward pathways and the default-mode network yet limited support for striatal centredness. The review recapitulates these results by discussing current challenges in balancing personalisation and standardisation, the use of motivationally inert versus salient comparators, and argues for careful deliberation when inferring evidence for hyperreactive reward responses.",

To examine the involvement of action imagery and verbal rehearsal, participants completed the Final Position Judgement Task once in a baseline condition and once under articulatory suppression in a within-subjects design. The involvement of action imagery and verbal rehearsal was evaluated based on self-reported strategy use, associations with working memory components and behavioral measures of action imagery ability, as well as task performance. Accuracy in final position judgements was related to visuospatial sketchpad capacity but unrelated to phonological loop capacity. Most participants relied on visual rehearsal, whereas verbal rehearsal served a supporting role but did not benefit performance in final position judgements. Articulatory suppression appeared to impair action imagery rather than enhancing its use. Together, these findings support the use of the Final Position Judgement Task as an objective measure of action imagery ability, provided open-source alongside the manuscript.",

However, these methods are not always feasible to use and have their own share of problems. In the current study, we systematically investigated how the choice of response scale for subjective reports affects the validity and reliability of participants’ responses. We designed a computer task in which we manipulated the degree of objective control that participants had across trials. Participants reported their experienced sense of control after each trial. Across five experiments, we compared responses on five scales: a linear visual analogue scale (VAS), a percentage VAS, a 7-point Likert, a 4-point Likert, and a binary scale. In two additional experiments, we compared the directionality of the linear scale. The results were remarkably similar for all except the binary scale: participants demonstrated the tendency to underestimate their level of control, especially for intermediate levels of objective control, and the between-block reliability of responses indicated a very high level of reliability. In addition, we propose that our task can be used as a measure of individual differences and developed metrics that can be extracted from participants’ responses. Our findings demonstrate that contrary to the dominant opinion, explicit reports are characterized by high reliability, and we provide practical recommendations for the choice of a scale for measuring sense of control.",

A total of 211 participants completed the CDQ, with 111 of them also completing the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour – Temperament Questionnaire, Revised Version. Analyses included statistical methods, artificial neural networks, and cluster analysis. Character profiles were consistent with CTC's theoretical assumptions. Most CDQ scales showed good reliability (α &gt; 0.7), except for endodynamism (α = 0.561). Analysis supported accurate prediction of dynamism levels based on character profiles. However, results related to age were inconsistent. Temperament correlated with dynamism only partially and with low to moderate strength. The findings support CTC's assumptions, distinguish it from temperament traits, and indicate that the CDQ is a generally reliable tool. Further refinement of the endodynamism scale and investigation into the link between dynamism and age are needed.",

          "abstract": "Cash transfers are a common poverty alleviation intervention, yet qualitative reports of recipients’ lived experiences are limited. To address this gap, we analyzed 77 in-depth interviews with cash transfer recipients and their household members in rural Malawi and Lesotho. Using reflexive thematic analysis, we created four themes: 1) cash transfers help address basic needs but are not enough for structural change, 2) grandmothers share cash transfers within intergenerational networks of care, 3) cash transfers bring psychological relief and restore dignity, but difficulty and uncertainty in obtaining them create stress, and 4) stigma and jealousy arise from community perceptions about the deservingness of ‘sky-falling’ and ‘satanic’ money. Recipients consistently noted improvement in food security, while effects on mental health and social relationships were more mixed. We argue that recipient-centered reports complement and strengthen quantitative evidence about the impacts and mechanisms of cash transfers. We discuss specific policy recommendations, such as larger and more predictable payments, better communication, and sensitive disbursement options, gender-sensitive support, and more active monitoring of psychosocial and community effects in order to mitigate potential negative impacts. Finally, we argue there is a need for a more ambitious focus on development as the key path to poverty eradication.",

          "abstract": "Procrastination—a voluntary delay of an intended action despite the expectation of negative consequences—is a widespread phenomenon. Previous research has mainly focused on procrastination in specific situations and has rarely examined stability and change in procrastination over long periods of time. In the present study, we conducted an 18-year longitudinal study of procrastination. We report on stability and change in procrastination as well as its associations with conscientiousness and neuroticism, and long-term correlates using self-reports starting from high school graduation, in a large sample of young adults (N = 3,023) in Germany. We found that procrastination was slightly less stable than the Big Five, tended to decrease with age, and that higher procrastination was associated with delayed entry into the workforce. Procrastination overlapped with but was distinct from conscientiousness and neuroticism. We also found strong links between changes in procrastination and changes in conscientiousness and neuroticism over time. Finally, both initial levels and trajectories of procrastination predicted consequential long-term correlates up to 18 years after the first measurement, including academic, workplace, relationship, health, and pandemic-related outcomes. In sum, this long-term longitudinal examination of procrastination highlights patterns of stability and change in procrastination and demonstrates its relevance for important life outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: Coherent speech remains focused on the topic at hand, avoiding irrelevant or tangential comments. Discourse coherence often declines with age and this has been linked to declines in cognitive control processes that regulate activation of knowledge and ideas. The present study tested whether external topic reminders could improve coherence by reducing reliance on internal control processes.\nMethods: 77 young and older adults produced spoken discourse in response to topic prompts. In the baseline condition, the topic prompt was removed when the participant began speaking. This was compared with conditions where a reminder was presented on screen, either throughout their response or only during the last 30 seconds.\nResults: Both age groups produced more coherent, topic-focused responses when they had access to a topic reminder. Late reminders had an additional proactive impact on participants’ speech, increasing its coherence even before the reminder appeared. This proactive effect was short-lived in the older group but more sustained in the young group.\nDiscussion: When speaking, people must maintain the current discourse goal (i.e., intended topic), in order to prioritise relevant information and inhibit irrelevant ideas. Topic reminders boost activation of the discourse goal, reducing the need to maintain this through internal control. Furthermore, people proactively strengthened goal activation when they anticipated a later reminder, but older people were less effective at maintaining this throughout their response. Together, these results suggest that internal maintenance of discourse goals is less effective in older people, though they do benefit from external cues that support topic maintenance.",

          "abstract": "Shape processing is crucial for higher-level visual functions such as object recognition. Yet, isolating high-level vision from low-level shape influences remains challenging. Typically, studies rely on simple, symmetric stimuli and labor-intensive psychophysical measurements to control for perceptual shape similarity. However, natural objects are often asymmetric, and researchers currently lack efficient methods or validated stimulus sets for these complex shapes. Here, we present an image-based method that autonomously generates perceptually uniform shape sets composed of novel, asymmetric, animal-like shapes. We focus on circular shape spaces, where the angular distance between two shapes corresponds to their perceived similarity. Our method employs a search for circular arrangements of shapes that maximize perceptual uniformity according to ShapeComp, an image-computable shape similarity metric based on 100+ descriptors that is highly predictive of human shape similarity for naturalistic shapes. Through multi-arrangement experiments, we validated that our method produces circular shape sets that align with human similarity judgments. By comparison, uniform and circular shape sets according to alternative shape spaces (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks or Radial Frequency patterns), but not according to ShapeComp, were not necessarily perceived as uniform and circular. We provide five newly validated circular shape sets derived from intricate naturalistic shapes, along with MATLAB code facilitating the generation of an unlimited number of sets that can be tailored to experimental needs beyond circular configurations. By offering efficiency and adaptability, our method allows to systematically explore higher-level influences on object perception while minimizing the time and resources required to construct controlled, complex shape stimuli.",

This relation is in contrast with the view that both statistical power and reliability depend similarly on the measurement error. In this view, robust but unreliable phenomena can be considered as a reliability paradox. The mathematical relation and possible independence of statistical power and reliability have been discussed in the statistical literature for decades. A common misconception related to the relationship between statistical power and reliability is that absolute reliability (measurement error) is often confounded with relative reliability (ratio of the true score variance and the total score variance). The present work reviews and discusses how measurement error and individual differences influence the relative reliability and robustness of a phenomenon. It discusses why relative reliability and robustness are partly related and why they are generally independent. Following these considerations, it is summarized how measurement error and group heterogeneity can be potentially manipulated to optimize for the reliability and robustness of a measured phenomenon.",

          "abstract": "People who view food-wasting behaviour as immoral tend to waste less. This observation raises the question of whether appealing to moral values can shift how individuals think about food waste and how willing they are to address it. The present preregistered experiment (N = 1006) tested this possibility by examining whether persuasive video messages grounded in the Morality-as-Cooperation framework influence psychological responses to food waste. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of seven value-based appeals: highlighting Family, Group, Reciprocity, Heroism, Deference, Fairness, or Property concerns; or one of two control conditions. Each moral message was presented in both positive and negative framing and delivered by one of two actors.\nOutcomes included judgments of the wrongness of food wasting, intentions to reduce waste, support for policy measures, and willingness to learn more or engage in related actions. Preregistered analyses showed no overall effects of the moral messages. However, mediation analyses showed a consistent pattern of opposing effects. Across outcomes, moral appeals were associated with lower perceived message relevance, which in turn predicted weaker moral concern, policy support, and behavioural intentions. At the same time, when controlling for perceived relevance, several moral messages—particularly those grounded in Family, Deference, Heroism, and Property concerns—exerted positive direct effects on outcomes.\nOverall, the findings show that moral appeals in food waste communication can be a double-edged sword. Moral messages have the potential to motivate stronger responses, but only when people find them personally relevant. When they do not, the same appeals may undermine their own effectiveness. This emphasizes perceived relevance as a key ingredient in successful moral communication about food waste.",

It is well established that those who are most vulnerable and most in need of mental health support are least likely to access services or take part in research. \n\nAims: Adopting an intersectional lens, this research aims to elicit the experience regarding mental health of young people who feel under represented \n\nMethod; People aged 16 – 24, living in England, who were currently experiencing or had experienced poor mental health in the preceding year were recruited from both NHS waiting lists (in Oxford, Sheffield, Cornwall and Liverpool) and nationally on social media and via charities. 248 people completed an online questionnaire, of which 117 took part in an initial screening call and 81 were interviewed. Unstructured interviews that adopted a narrative inquiry approach were conducted either in person or on online, and audio recorded then transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a combination of thematic and framework analysis. Young people with relevant lived experience consulted on the implementation of the research and recruitment, and peer researchers contributed data collection and data analysis. \n\nResults: Participants engaged with unstructured narrative inquiry interviews, often anchoring their experiences either in their schooling, or in a series of adverse childhood events. Three overarching themes were extracted from the data; the impact of connection, (in)validation, proactively coping and preventive opportunities. These themes highlighted the variation in health literacy and how mental health experiences are understood, as well as whether existing services were experienced as accessible and helpful. Participants were proactive with adopting coping mechanisms in the absence of support and identified times of transition as providing an opportunity for improved support. \n\nDiscussion: There are implications for policy and practice in how mental health is talked about and recognised amongst young people. It is important that young people are empowered to talk about their experiences, and that attempts to seek help or access care are not met with invalidation. Times of transition (particularly around schooling) are opportunities where support could be better offered in a preventative way. \n\nStrengths \n-\tLarge diverse set of lived experience data \n-\tYouth-led involvement strategy for implementing the research programme\n-\tInclusive and intersectional approach \n-\tOpen methodology that enabled participants to set agenda\n\nLimitations \n-\tAbility to represent large diverse data set within existing analytic frameworks\n-\tUnstructured narrative interview methods potentially challenging for some neurodivergent people and those with communication needs.",

To prevent avoidable harm to patients, including adverse effects and withdrawal effects, it is important to understand potential overprescribing of antidepressants. This study aims to explore how primary care prescribers rationalise antidepressant prescribing and deprescribing decisions, and which contextual factors influence these decisions. \nMethod\nWe interviewed 16 primary care professionals, general practitioners (GPs) and mental health practitioners, across England. Semi-structured interviews consisted of discussing prescribing and deprescribing vignettes, followed by questions exploring participants approaches to antidepressant decision making. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. \nResults\nFour main themes emerged around antidepressant medicines optimisation: patient characteristics, illness factors, prescriber characteristics, and healthcare service factors. Patient characteristics encompassed aspects of the patient, their life and ideas that could contribute to prescribing choices. Illness factors included consideration of depression symptoms, associated symptom risks and previous treatment experiences. Prescriber characteristics involved expertise, guideline adherence, risk aversion and decision fatigue arising from prescribing. Healthcare service factors captured constraints of the services format and availability of alternative treatments.\nConclusion\nOur findings suggest that prescribing decisions are impacted by a combination of psychosocial and environmental factors. Decision biases like risk aversion and decision fatigue can also impact prescribing practice. Health service constraints were perceived as limiting decision freedom through misaligned demand for and availability of non-pharmacological treatments, and insufficient decision support for deprescribing.

Negative consequences of AUD are particularly severe in these groups, yet research on their specific treatment barriers is lacking. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the Barriers to AUD Treatment Questionnaire (BAT-Q) and  exploratorily examine differences in reported barriers among 112 cisgender men, 154 cisgender women, and 98 transgender individuals who had considered AUD treatment in the past five years. Exploratory factor analysis identified seven reliable domains of barriers: social stigma, comorbid problems and negative care experiences, limited care accessibility, fear of limited inclusivity and discrimination, limited social support, socioeconomic constraints, and negative expectations of care. While comparisons among groups yielded preliminary insights these findings should be interpreted with caution, as confirmatory factor analysis have not yet been conducted. However, transgender individuals reported higher barriers than both cisgender men and women across all domains except socioeconomic constraints. Both cisgender women and transgender individuals experienced greater stigma-related barriers than cisgender men. Higher alcohol and drug use severity predicted greater overall treatment barriers in all groups. Notably, poorer perceived socioeconomic status and low social support were more strongly associated with barriers among women than among cisgender men or transgender individuals. These findings underscore the need for gender-affirming and accessible AUD services. The BAT-Q provides a promising new tool for identifying and addressing specific barriers to treatment, although further validation of its structure is warranted to strengthen the interpretation of group differences.",

Turn-taking—the organisation of who speaks when—is the fundamental mechanism of communicative interaction, and has been found to be remarkably fast and robust across different groups of speakers. We build on the only previous study of turn-timing in conversations between autistic adults, while also conducting the first within-speaker comparison of turn-timing across different conversational contexts. We recorded 18 autistic and 28 non-autistic speakers in matched dyads, conversing in three sequential conversational contexts. We analysed 10,251 turn transitions using the measure of Floor Transfer Offset (comprising silent and overlapping transitions). Bayesian inferential modelling was used for statistical analysis. Our results show longer silent gaps 1) in autistic speaker pairs and 2) in the task-based conversational context. The finding of longer silent gaps in autism does not align with the only previous study on conversations between autistic adults. We discuss the importance of investigating naturalistic, face-to-face interaction and question the idea that there is a single, fixed target for conversational turn-timing. We argue that speaker pairs skilfully adjust their turn-taking rhythm to match both interpersonal and situational factors.",

          "abstract": "Adaptive cognition requires determining when previously stored information must be re-engaged to guide behavior. Prevailing accounts of working memory and cognitive control propose that contextual change cues the retrieval or reactivation of relevant information, reinstating stored representations into working memory when the task model changes. Here, I show that reactivation depends not on change per se, but on the stability of the change. In an EEG experiment, participants performed visual memory tasks using repeatedly presented items. The task rule was either repeating or consistently varying across trials. While contralateral delay activity (CDA) declined with memory repetition, reflecting reduced working memory engagement, this reduction was unaffected by whether the task rule consistently changed or repeated. Thus, when variability itself was consistent, it was learned as a stable context, no longer prompting reactivation. Reactivation, therefore, is not triggered by change itself but by the failure of contextual stability, revealing that consistent variability is learned as a stable context.",

          "abstract": "Cultural and educational contexts, particularly within positive psychology, have traditionally conceptualized happiness in terms of well-being, emphasizing the pursuit of positive affect through the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of negative affect. This orientation risks pathologizing normative emotions such as sadness, implicitly discouraging their expression. A paradigm shift may therefore be warranted in which psychological health is defined not by the predominance of positive emotions, but by emotional flexibility, the capacity to experience, regulate, and integrate a full range of emotions in accordance with situational demands.\nWithin this framework, sadness is conceptualized along two distinct dimensions: state sadness, a context-dependent and transient response that mobilizes adaptive processes supporting reflection, attachment-related signaling, and socio-emotional learning; dispositional sadness, a stable temperamental propensity characterized by pervasive dejection, diminished affective recovery, and reduced contextual sensitivity. While state sadness is functionally embedded within the attachment system and facilitates proximity-seeking and relational repair following loss or separation, dispositional sadness represents an inflexible emotional style associated with increased vulnerability to internalizing psychopathology. Recognizing sadness as a potentially adaptive and developmentally salient emotion, rather than as a priori evidence of dysfunction, has important implications for clinical practice and caregiving contexts, helping to mitigate the premature medicalization of emotional suffering.",

As evidence for overall efficacy has accumulated, the field has increasingly shifted toward understanding for whom, and through which delivery formats PIIs are most effective. These questions are pressing in non-Western contexts, where access to professional services is limited, culturally appropriate interventions are needed. This RCT, one of the largest of its kind in China, addressed this gap by comparing two scalable delivery formats of a culturally adapted social communication program (speech-language therapist (SLT)-led online groups vs. flexible Self-study format) and examining differential intervention responses and sustained engagement.\n\nMethods A total of 112 Chinese-speaking autistic children aged 24–60 months with limited spontaneous expressive language were randomized to a 20-week SLT-led or Self-study intervention. Autism severity, social functioning, and communication skills were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 12 months after baseline. Parental stress, competence, and strategy use were also measured. Child, parent, and family characteristics predicting differential outcomes and engagement were examined. \n\nResults Both formats improved children’s expressive and receptive language and enhanced parental self-efficacy while reducing stress. Individualized analyses indicated greater benefits of the SLT-led format for children from lower-income families and those with greater developmental needs, whereas families with stronger baseline functioning showed comparable gains in the Self-study format. Attrition was higher in the Self-study format and was associated with lower child engagement and reduced parental capacity for independent implementation.\n\nLimitations The study was powered primarily to detect within-format effects, which may have limited sensitivity to identify subtle between-format differences. Parental strategy use was measured using a general interaction coding scheme rather than intervention-specific behaviors. Higher attrition in the Self-study format warrants cautious interpretation, although sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of findings.\n\nConclusions: This study provides evidence for a culturally grounded PII that improves developmental outcomes in autistic preschoolers while enhancing parental self-efficacy and reducing stress. While both formats were effective, SLT-led support appeared particularly beneficial for families with greater needs, whereas the Self-study format was better suited to families with stronger baseline capacity, underscoring the importance of tailoring intervention formats to family characteristics.",

This study examined whether young carers have poorer mental health than peers and explored inequalities by gender, ethnicity, special educational needs (SEN) status, income, parental composition, and support systems.\n\nMethods: We used the COVID Social Mobility and Opportunities cohort study, 2021-2023, a probability sample of &gt;13,000 young people aged 16-18 in England, we assessed self-reported young caring and mental health outcomes, including psychological distress, anxiety, depression and chronic mental illness. Modifiers were ethnicity, gender, household income, special educational needs (SEN) status, parental composition, perceived school support for mental health, peer support and social support. \n\nResults: Young carers reported 1.69 higher odds of chronic mental illness (95% CI: 1.35-2.12), and more depressive (B=0.20, 95% CI: 0.07-0.33) and anxiety symptoms (B=0.15, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.29). Associations did not vary by gender, ethnicity, SEN status, parental composition or income. Young carers with high peer support had more depressive symptoms than young carers with low peer support. Young carers with high social support had lower odds of a mental illness than young carers with lower social support. No differences were observed by school support.\n\nConclusions: Young carers had poorer mental health which did not vary across key axes of inequality. Addressing their mental health is crucial to prevent a cycle of care need. Increasing societal awareness, and fostering empathy and support may help improve young carers’ mental health.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known algorithm used to assess the similarity between signals of varying lengths. Initially developed for automatic speech recognition, DTW has found applications in psycholinguistics, particularly in analyzing gesture form similarity. An open question in this domain is how effectively DTW captures gesture form similarity. Here, we validate DTW against human annotations of gesture form similarity across two multimodal interaction corpora and explore its utility as an automatic, continuous measure of gesture form similarity. Our findings reveal weak to moderate correlations between DTW distance and the number of gesture features---such as hand shape, movement, orientation, and position---suggesting that DTW serves as a useful proxy for gesture form similarity. Additionally, we highlight the importance of qualitative analysis of raw data and DTW predictions in enhancing DTW's predictive accuracy. Our study offers a rigorous validation of DTW as a measure of gesture form similarity and presents a detailed framework for preprocessing motion tracking data and calculating DTW distance. While none of the methods is perfect, the combination of automatic and manual measures provides a comprehensive approach to understanding and measuring gesture form similarity.",

          "authors": "Arkady Zgonnikov; Merijn van Niekerk; Yke Bauke Eisma; Joost de Winter",
          "abstract": "Merging onto a highway is a safety-critical task resulting in a large number of traffic accidents; fundamental research into merging behavior of human drivers can help reduce this toll. Two cognitive processes critical to merging, attention allocation and decision making, have been extensively studied in real-world and simulated driving scenarios. However, how these processes interact during highway merging remains poorly understood. While the relationship between attention and decision making has been widely examined in cognitive science, this work has largely relied on simple decision-making paradigms involving choices between static items on a computer screen, which limits the understanding of more dynamic and naturalistic decisions such as in driving. To address this gap, we investigated the relationship between attention and decision making in a simplified highway merging task. In a video-based experiment, participants (N=24) repeatedly made merging gap acceptance decisions based on the dynamic information about the distance and time-to-arrival to the end of the merging lane and the gap to the target-lane vehicle available in the front view and the side mirror, respectively. Participants' decisions, response times, and eye movements were recorded. We found that decisions to accept a gap were considerably faster than decisions to reject a gap. Decision outcomes and timing depended on the distance to and time-to-arrival of the target-lane vehicle, but also on the time pressure due to approaching the end of the merging lane. Most importantly, under high time pressure, a greater proportion of time spent looking at the side mirror was associated with a lower probability of accepting the gap. This finding indicates that differences in visual information sampling can be closely linked to decision outcomes when time budgets are constrained. \nOur results provide initial empirical insights relevant for future cognitive modeling of the interplay between decision making and attention during highway merging; this may help inform early-stage exploration of driver monitoring and support systems for partially automated driving.",

ChatGPT completed the same survey. Articles from the scoping review and experts’ open-ended responses were analyzed using natural language processing techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, word clouds) alongside qualitative categorization.\nThe findings revealed a wide range of predictions, spanning from utopian to dystopian scenarios. Utopian visions emphasized interdisciplinary, multimethod, and evidence-based research with strong societal and political impact, leveraging advanced technologies to support personalized learning as well as mental health and social-emotional development. Dystopian scenarios expressed concern that educational psychology and quality education could become marginalized, politically constrained, inaccessible to many learners, or replaced by automated systems. Experts also identified concrete action points aimed at fostering desirable developments and preventing unfavorable futures.",

          "abstract": "Parental lying to children, for example, to influence children’s behavior and emotions, is common and linked to more child lying and maladjustment. Existing research mainly relies on retrospective parent- or child-reports of parental lying, does not differentiate between types of lies, and uses cross-sectional designs. This longitudinal population-based cohort study (N = 801) tested a novel systematic coding scheme to observe parental lying to children at age 3 during three structured behavioral control tasks in the laboratory. This study then examined prospective associations with observed child lying at age 4 (n = 537), and parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 5 (n = 729), and callous-unemotional traits at age 9 (n = 563). We reliably observed four types of parental lies to influence children’s behavior (i.e., instrumental lies) and parental lies to foster imagination or fun. Most parents (94%) told at least one of these lies, whereas only few lied often. Prospective associations were examined for the four types of instrumental lies. None of the parental instrumental lies were associated with child lying or internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Parental instrumental lies involving false promises or exaggerated positive consequences were related to fewer callous-unemotional traits. This study shows the feasibility of using structured observations to measure different types of parental lying to children and demonstrates that the casual parental lies we observed were not associated with harmful child development and, in some cases, may even be associated with positive developmental outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Online surveys and browser-based behavior experiments rest on a simple inference: careful, coherent responding is taken as evidence of human participation. I argue that this inference is no longer safe. Autonomous AI agents—and participants who use generative AI as a writing or decision aid—can now produce responses that pass many (and sometimes nearly all) conventional quality checks, yielding data that look human-generated while embedding systematic, model-shaped distortions. Drawing on emerging evidence, I describe how even modest contamination can shift estimated public opinion, compress attitudinal extremes, and create self-reinforcing feedback loops in which AI-influenced “human” data become inputs to future models and future measurement. Because detection is an asymmetric arms race that researchers are structurally positioned to lose, I recommend a shift from bot-hunting to infrastructure redesign: contamination-aware inference and sensitivity analyses, clearer distinctions between exploratory convenience samples and high-assurance confirmatory sampling, and journal/platform incentives that treat data authentication as shared scientific infrastructure in an AI-saturated research ecosystem.",

This so-called human self-domestication hypothesis (HSD) has been used to explain the parallel sophistication of language through a cultural mechanism, including the early emergence of rudimentary grammars capable of combining single words, with these compounds being perhaps extensively used for derogatory purposes in replacement of direct physical aggression. Complex language is a tool for achieving technological advancements, since it enables a more efficient transmission of know-hows to others. In this opinion paper, we hypothesize that this noticeable swearing behaviour might have contributed in direct and indirect ways to the improvement of human technology. Directly, because swearing has been shown to enhance dexterity and fine motor skills. Indirectly, because decreased stress levels and reduced anxiety, as typically resulting from swearing, enable one to engage in more efficient deep thinking, more efficient language use, and more productive work within a community.",

Although the Prolific sample closely aligned with census estimates for age and sex, and approximated on race/ethnicity and region, the sample was more highly educated, more liberal, and reported more experiences with AI than the nationally representative sample—among other general differences. In terms of AI attitudes, two important differences were that Prolific users expressed less moral concern for AI and lower perceived risks from AI even after controlling for demographic effects.",

          "abstract": "Maladaptive social behavior can be considered both a cause and effect of pathological anxiety. These difficulties may arise from both the cognitive demands of social interaction, such as managing uncertainty, and the distinctively social demands of interactions, such as managing social friction. Previous work has linked generalized anxiety (GA) to reduced learning from aversive events, particularly under uncertainty, and social anxiety (SA) to fear of negative evaluation. However, these distinct hypothesized effects have not been previously dissociated within a single experimental framework. In the current study, we used a novel task, the Asymmetric Social Exchange (ASE) game, to study how people reason under uncertainty about the hidden intentions of others and weigh the real personal costs and benefits of accepting interpersonal inequality, a major source of social friction. In a large sample of online participants (N = 723), we tested the hypothesis of a double dissociation between anxiety subtypes in behavior. Behavioral and computational modeling supported this: GA, not SA, was specifically related to perturbed learning under uncertainty through aversive overgeneralization. By contrast, SA, not GA, was related to increased sensitivity to social friction, increasing acceptance of unfair, disadvantageous outcomes. Our study combined a novel social decision-making task with computational modeling to identify dissociable cognitive mechanisms underlying GA and SA phenotypes.",

          "authors": "John J. Clement",
          "abstract": "This chapter first consolidates a set of important heuristic strategies used for constructing\ninnovative scientific models from three books, including studies in the history of genetics and\nelectromagnetism, and an expert think-aloud study in mechanics. Twenty-four strategies are identified,\nmost of which are field-general. Patterns in their use suggest a partially organized hierarchy of\ninterconnected strategies and substrategies, contrary to the view that heuristics are simply tried in random\norder. Strategies at four different size and time scale levels are described, including larger Modeling Cycle\nPhases of model generation, evaluation, and modification, each of which can utilize many smaller Tactical\nHeuristics as substrategies, e.g., analogy, or testing predictions from the model. These in turn can utilize\nGrounded Imagistic Processes, such as imagistic mental simulation, an important alternative to deduction\nfor evaluating a model by running it. The framework links higher level, serially organized processes with\nlower level, imagery-based processes. Its intermediate degree of organization is neither anarchistic, nor\nfully algorithmic. Possible benefits of organization are narrowing the search space involved and balancing\nsources of model construction and criticism for productive creativity. Unorganized, spontaneous processes\nare also discussed, along with their possible benefits.",

          "abstract": "Theory of mind (ToM), or mentalization, is a core aspect of social cognition that enables individuals to infer the mental states of others. Brain activity underlying ToM has been extensively studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with a primary focus on the Default Mode (DM). We investigated the interplay of multiple cognitive modes (i.e., cognitive processes eliciting distinct fMRI-derived spatiotemporal patterns) engaged during ToM, extending beyond but still including the DM. We analyzed a large-scale fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project Social (HCP) Cognition task, where participants (n=500) evaluated whether movements of animated shapes depicted social or random interactions. Six cognitive modes were retrieved using constrained principal component analysis (CPCA): (1) Multiple Demand (MD), (2) Default Mode B (DM-B), (3) Auditory Attention for Response (AAR), (4) Focus on Visual Features (FVF), (5) Language (LAN), and (6) Re-Evaluation (RE-EV). The functions of these cognitive modes have been characterized based on analyses of their task-induced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) changes over many tasks, but in the context of the HCP Social Cognition task, their BOLD changes were interpreted as: (1) mentally projecting into social narratives (DM-B), (2) allocating external attention to task-relevant components (MD), (3) processing non-verbal communication (LAN), (4) focusing on visual features of the social stimuli (FVF), (5) suppressing auditory attention due to increased visual attention (AAR), and (6) re-evaluating for possibly missed social patterns (RE-EV). Thus, our results confirmed the activation of DM during ToM, but also specified the contributions of five additional cognitive modes. An application of this work is that the six sets of mode-aligned functional patterns can serve as separate inputs for machine learning algorithms aimed at subtyping patients with psychiatric conditions to advance toward precision psychiatry.",

          "abstract": "Scientific communication faces a dual crisis: exponential publication growth overwhelms human readers, and fragmented research practices block automated synthesis. AI-assisted writing exacerbates the volume problem, producing papers faster than they can be read. Behavioral and social sciences in particular suffer from incomparable stimulus databases, jingle–jangle measurement fallacies, and demographic blindness that conceals effect heterogeneity. Current AI tools aid comprehension and summarization yet cannot aggregate findings from incommensurable studies and risk amplifying biases when trained on unstructured, unverified text. We propose restructuring scientific papers for dual audiences: front-loaded narratives for time-pressed human readers, paired with machine-readable appendices containing executable code, standardized metadata, and ontologically mapped constructs. This design turns papers into queryable research environments where readers can interrogate data and rerun analyses, and where structured appendices enable automated verification of statistical methods and AI-assisted peer review grounded in executable rather than narrative claims. Such papers become nodes in continuously updated evidence networks: each publication automatically contributes effect sizes to real-time meta-analyses, with corrections and retractions propagating through dependent analyses. Widespread adoption will require institutional recognition of structured documentation as essential scholarly output and computational infrastructure that serves both human comprehension and machine analysis.",

Today, people are increasingly struggling to be empathetic to others in their communities and in society more broadly. In the current research we (a team of academic researchers and practitioners) attempt to tackle this problem of decreasing empathy by testing and evaluating a school-based intervention program developed by Narrative 4 in American high school classrooms (N=380, 10th and 11th graders) using an experimental approach (i.e., comparing Narrative 4 programming to a control condition). This 10-session program focused on building empathy, perspective taking, and active listening skills (among other skills) through narrative storytelling exercises. Results indicated the program was successful in promoting students’ reported empathy, perspective taking, curiosity to diverse ideas, and active listening skills as compared to the control condition. Additionally, this greater empathy led participants to report more pro-sociality (e.g., greater willingness to be civically engaged, more respect for others in their classroom and community more broadly) and less affective polarization towards those who disagree with them on politics. At the end of the program, participants also reported positive experiences with the program. Taken together, this research highlights the merits of Narrative 4 programming for promoting empathy and pro-sociality among high school students, the merits of academic and practitioner partnerships, and a promising narrative-based intervention for promoting empathy in society.",

I also include recommendations for the APA and other psychological institutions, such as creating more formal professional practice guidelines for psychological work with undocumented immigrants and providing more explicit material support to practicing psychologists who engage in justified and ethical civil disobedience when ethics and law come into conflict. While this article is by no means a complete collection of considerations, and is in full transparency written by a first year doctoral student with limited clinical experience, I hope it can serve as an initial guide and jumping off point for researchers and practitioners to develop more fleshed out guidelines.

However, there remains a limited phenomenological account of how autistic adults experience their attention in their everyday lives. This is important for developing an understanding of autistic attention which is not based only on comparisons to neurotypical benchmarks. \n\nMethods: Thirteen autistic adults took part in semi-structured interviews, making use of photo elicitation to explore their experiences around attention. Participant responses were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis\n\nResults: Three Group Experiential Themes (GETs) were developed: Interruption is Devastating, Interest Engagement as a Sanctuary, and Attentional Normativity. Participants described their attention as a sequential, deeply engrossed process. They reported that interruptions, especially from other people, were profoundly challenging, often leading to a collapse of their focus and an exhausting state of vigilance (GET1). Time spent deeply focused on interests was described as a sanctuary, providing both joy and replenishment of cognitive resources depleting through navigating inaccessible environments (GET2). Participants described navigating entrenched normative expectations about how attention should function which particularly impacted their experiences in employment (GET3).\n\nConclusion:  This work provides rich, contextualised insights into the phenomenology of autistic attention. We highlight elements across themes which resonate with the monotropism theory of attention. We consider how creating inclusive environments, particularly in the workplace, requires challenging normative expectations around attention.",

          "abstract": "Co-speech gestures, which are spontaneous hand movements speakers produce when they talk, strongly enhance listeners’ cognitive processing of the spoken messages across development. Yet, the mechanisms by which gesture supports memory processing, particularly in interaction with speech, remain poorly understood, limiting the intentional use of gesture to improve learning outside of lab settings. Here, we ask whether certain gestures are consistently better remembered across people, independent of prior experience with the stimuli (the memorability effect), and if so, what semantic meaning and visual form features explain this effect. We created 360 10-second audiovisual stimuli by video recording 20 actors producing natural, unscripted speech and gestures while pretending to explain Piagetian liquid conservation to a child. Online participants completed a study–test memory task with video-only, audio-only, and audiovisual versions of the stimuli. Participants showed memory consistencies in all three conditions, and memorability for gesture+speech (audiovisual stimuli) was predicted by the memorability of both its gesture and speech components. We then quantified features of the gestural stimuli using 3 methods: trained coders, automatic computational analysis, and online crowdsourcing. Gestures are more memorable when they convey more information, and are most memorable when originally produced with memorable speech. Together, these findings reveal nuanced interactions between gesture and speech during memory processing, providing new insights into the memory mechanism underlying gesture’s benefits on learning and communications.",

Eligible studies employed an experimental design with a control group and outcome measures targeting prejudice (e.g., attitudes, stereotypes, intergroup bias) or intercultural competence (e.g., empathy, knowledge, culturally appropriate behaviour).

Effects were most consistent for collaborative and player–character interaction and embodiment game designs; by contrast, the impact of games with bias-related content depended on their moral framing, and comparisons of games with text suggested that interactive formats can have positive effects but demand careful experimental control.

Across multiple independent datasets (total N = 392), DMPM yields robust, generalizable predictions of positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA). Feature analysis indicated that affectivity is reflected not only in the content of thoughts, but also in transition dynamics, with self-relevance as a key organizing dimension. Furthermore, higher DMPM-predicted positive affectivity was associated with lower salivary C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting a link between thought dynamics and inflammation. Together, these findings establish a scalable, interpretable approach for quantifying spontaneous thought dynamics and relating them to transdiagnostic affective traits and potential physiological correlates.",

          "abstract": "Geometry is often considered the paradigmatic model of abstract thought, and great thinkers since at least Plato have sought its origins. Particular, modular “languages of thought” have been invoked to explain humans’ unique cognitive achievements in certain domains, including geometry. Contrary to this hypothesis, I propose the Wanderers Hypothesis for Geometry, which states that: Human geometry is largely rooted in navigation-like mental processes that approximate Euclidean geometry and are shared by humans and nonhuman animals. Humans uniquely may access this geometry with natural language and use it flexibly in novel contexts, ultimately supporting our capacity for formal learning. In explaining geometry’s cognitive origins, we refine our understanding of the mind in general.",

          "abstract": "Background: Peer support for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) holds promise to support recovery and reduce distress, but few BPD peer support programs have been developed or evaluated. We describe the design and implementation of a novel stakeholder-driven initiative to build a peer-led online support group for people with BPD. \n\nMethods: This manuscript does not present a traditional research study or follow an implementation science framework. Instead, it documents a radical, community-led model of care development—one that expands the possibilities for stakeholder-led innovation in mental health services. People with BPD and their families recognized an unmet need and co-created an intervention; researchers later joined to help assess program outcomes and capture impact. We describe support group design, peer facilitator training, and adaptation to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic using narrative format. We quantify changes in attendance over time (one-way ANOVAs) and participant demographics and satisfaction (n=598 survey respondents). \n\nResults: A two-year peer-driven process identified core principles and designed a peer-led support group. In the first 26 months, 138 peer-support sessions met (1383 total attendees) with significant increases in registered participants, program attendance, and waitlists. Participants were geographically diverse, likely to attend one session (72%), and reported high satisfaction. Many had never received BPD treatment (44%) or met someone else with BPD (48%).\n\nConclusions: This program demonstrates an example of stakeholder-led design of a sustainable program for people with BPD. The sustained demand we observed underscores the need for accessible empowering support for people with BPD.",

Phenomenological control is an evolved capacity to deceive ourselves so as to support socially useful beliefs. It allows one to strategically construct subjective experiences that misrepresent reality despite contradictory evidence in order to meet goals. It is so good at its evolved function that researchers of it have often found themselves being deceived: The participants in their studies feel energies, special states or parts of themselves that are taken to be constitutive of the mechanism of construction rather than what the mechanism constructs. \n\nKey points:\n\n•\tHypnosis is just one context in which phenomenological control is used; others include spirit possession, many spiritual experiences, esoteric martial arts, everyday experiences and psychology experiments\n\n•\tPhenomenological control is a metacognitive trick one plays on oneself: No other abilities are gained nor lost\n\n•\tFor example, hypnosis does not improve memory, strength, nor attentional capacity\n\n•\tIt can nevertheless be clinically useful in, for example, making pain go away by itself, precisely because it involves the motivated transformation of subjective experience\n\n•\tNo special state is needed to explain how or when phenomenological control is used\n\n•\tThere are enduring individual differences in the capacity for phenomenological control that have yet to be explained",

          "abstract": "Alternating treatments designs (ATDs) are single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) characterized by the rapid alternation of conditions, with the sequence of conditions typically determined at random. Outcomes in ATDs are often recorded as count data with repeated measurements nested within cases. Although generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) have been systematically examined for analyzing nonnormal outcomes in multiple-baseline designs, their application and statistical properties for ATDs remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a large-scale Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of GLMMs in terms of bias, mean square error, coverage rate and type I error rate for estimating immediate effects and trend changes in two prototypical ATDs. In addition, we present two empirical demonstrations using real ATD datasets with a focus on illustrating design-matrix coding, interpretation of parameter estimates, and reporting practices that jointly consider immediate effects and trend changes. Finally, we provide recommendations for analytic procedures for applied researchers based on findings from the simulation study and empirical demonstrations. We hope this article equips SCED researchers with essential guidance for appropriately analyzing count data from ATDs using GLMMs and outlines directions for future methodological work exploring the full potential of GLMMs and their extensions for the analysis and meta-analysis of ATD data.",

          "abstract": "On average single individuals commonly report worse mental health outcomes than partnered individuals. With the population of single adults quickly growing it is important the mechanism that relates singlehood to worse mental health outcomes is better understood. We conducted a scoping review to summarise the literature on the relationship between singlehood and mental health, and to evaluate the extent to which ultimate level perspectives are included in the current research. Of the 181 papers, from the PsycINFO databases, included in this review the consistent finding was that single individuals reported worse mental health oucomes. An inductive thematic analysis of these sources was used to identify patterns within the literature, with four clusters of commonly associated data items reflecting different singlehood identities (Widowed &amp; Lonely Women, Never-Partnered &amp; Childless Women, Male Involuntary Singles and Low-Socioeconomic Status Single Parents). Similar mental health outcomes were found for single men and women but the factors influencing this relationship were sexually differentiated in ways consistent with evolutionary theory. Childlessness and age were found to be more important in the outcomes of single women, compared to sexual access and voluntariness of singlehood in the outcomes of single men. With only a small number of exceptions, the literature broadly ignores ultimate levels of analysis and evolutionary explanations for the negative impacts of singlehood and accompanying sex differences. We provide a detailed discussion of how evolutionary theory could be used to shed light on the extant literature and call for future research to consider ultimate as well as proximate perspectives.",

This study introduces and evaluates the Health Equity Decisional Balance (HEDB) scale. Eighty-eight health professionals completed the scale of ten proposed items assessing perceived pros and cons of engaging with health and healthcare equity work, along with a measure of Anti-Racist Efficacy (ARE) (Eschmann et al., 2023). Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to test the latent structure of the scale and its predictive validity. A two-factor model retaining eights items with correlated pros and cons showed excellent fit (χ²(25)=32.98, RMSEA=.061, CFI=.982). Pros and cons were strongly and inversely related (r=−.90, p&lt;.001), consistent with decisional balance theory. When modeled as latent predictors, pros showed a strong positive association with anti-racist self-efficacy (ARE) (β=.82, p=.037), whereas cons was not significant. Together, the factors accounted for 20% of variance in efficacy. The HEDB scale provides a brief, psychometrically sound measure of health professionals’ readiness-related beliefs about health and healthcare equity work.",

          "authors": "Irene Pagliai",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a cross-linguistic idiom norming study based on 150 pairs of Italian and English idioms with similar meanings. Idiom pairs are categorized as lexical (LL), semi-lexical (SL), and post-lexical (PL) based on translatability (Beck, 2020), and annotated to indicate shared syntactic constituents. The variables explored include familiarity, meaningfulness, and objective knowledge (Experience-Based Variables, EBVs), alongside literal plausibility, decomposability, and transparency (Content-Based Variables, CBVs; Hubers, Cucchiarini, Strik, &amp; Dijkstra, 2019). The aims of the present work are multifaceted. First, a replicability check is intended, verifying if idioms show consistent correlational patterns across Italian and English. Second, it examines whether a correlational continuum exists for each CBV, with LL idioms expected to show stronger correlations than SL and PL ones. Finally, the study deepens the comparative perspective on CBVs through exploratory statistical modeling of cross-linguistic rating differences. Results show that correlational patterns are largely replicated between Italian and English, also for variables notoriously difficult to assess. The cross-linguistic correlational continuum is found for all CBVs, and model results show that the difference between Italian and English CBV ratings increases from LL to PL idiom pairs for each CBV, confirming the translatability continuum. Notably, syntax does not significantly impact the difference between Italian and English CBV ratings. Future research avenues are outlined to further explore the relationships between idiomatic variables and expand the comparative study of cross-linguistic idioms.",

          "authors": "Jonathan Kelly; Michael Dorneich; Stephen Gilbert",
          "abstract": "Cybersickness remains a persistent challenge limiting the usability of virtual reality (VR), yet commonly used subjective measures such as the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and the Fast Motion Sickness (FMS) scale are often difficult to interpret in terms of user outcomes. In particular, there is limited guidance on how specific values on these scales relate to user tolerance or the likelihood that users will discontinue a VR experience due to discomfort. This work addresses this gap by calibrating cybersickness severity interpretations against early termination of a VR experience. In Study 1 (N = 183), participants played an immersive VR game for up to 20 minutes and were free to terminate the experience at any time. Using a Behavioral Risk Banding (BRB) framework, logistic regression linked a modified 0-10 version of the FMS (FMS-10) and post-exposure SSQ scores to dropout probability, yielding behaviorally grounded risk severity bands (mild, moderate, severe, extreme). Survival analyses then showed how these bands mapped onto tolerance over time, revealing a transitional region marked by heightened individual variability. Study 2 (N = 304) evaluated the robustness of these categories across variation in VR content and mitigation context by applying the Study 1 thresholds without re-estimation. Although absolute dropout risk varied, the ordering and behavioral meaning of severity categories were preserved. Together, these results provide a practical, behaviorally grounded framework for interpreting cybersickness ratings in terms of user tolerance and usability across VR contexts.",

It delineates three core steps—awareness, evaluation, and regulation of emotions—together with the requisite competencies: emotion knowledge, norms and values, and a repertoire of regulation strategies. Early in development, caregivers assume primary responsibility for these processes through co-awareness, co-evaluation, and co-regulation. From a transactional perspective, the model delineates how specific caregiver practices shape children’s situated emotional experience and behavior and support the gradual transition from co-regulation to self-regulation of emotions. While the model receives initial empirical support, it also identifies key avenues for future research, including the need for culture-sensitive extensions of positive development.",

          "abstract": "A common belief is that we only truly appreciate things or people when we are about to lose them. This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the research in support of crisis management programs that target PK-12 students with disabilities who display challenging behavior in educational settings. We conducted database searches, ancestral searches, and website searches of organizations that produce crisis management programs to identify published and unpublished studies evaluating the programs. Our search process yielded just six studies evaluating five of 23 commercially available crisis management programs. Given the scarcity of supporting studies, none of the programs meet currently established thresholds for evidence-based practice in special education. Our review identifies a critical need for rigorous research on these programs to inform practice and policy, ensuring student safety and wellbeing.

Our analysis shows that the field is dominated by proof-of-concept studies and marked by substantial heterogeneity in design, implementation, and outcome measures, which hampers the assessment of efficacy and applicability of NF-MED. While NF-MED has been shown to consistently modulate neural activity, evidence for corresponding improvements in behavior, phenomenology or transferable meditative skills remains limited. Additional research is thus essential for determining whether NF-MED can help practitioners overcome common meditative barriers, such as anxiety and self-doubt, and whether NF-MED can accelerate meditative development across the training spectrum from novice to advanced meditators.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive coding theory, perception arises from the interplay between top-down expectations and bottom-up sensory input. In the auditory domain, this interplay can lead to illusory experiences—for instance, when phonetic similarities between languages cause listeners to mishear foreign lyrics as familiar words in their native language. This study investigated how linguistic priors influence auditory perception during song listening. Participants read sentences in English or Italian before hearing English song excerpts, then rated how well the lyrics matched the text. Crucially, some of the Italian sentences were phonologically similar to the English lyrics, resulting in a cross-linguistic auditory illusion in which listeners reported the content of the lyrics matched that of the Italian text. EEG analysis showed that two neural markers of surprise—P200 amplitude and gamma-band activity—were heightened while listening to songs that were not perceived to match the preceding text, reflecting the violation of expectations. In contrast, these markers were attenuated in illusory trials, suggesting reduced prediction error despite the lack of semantic match. Time-frequency analysis revealed an early gamma response followed by beta-band dominance in the illusory condition, consistent with initial sensory mismatch followed by top-down assimilation. Together, these findings show that phonologically plausible but false linguistic priors can induce auditory illusions and modulate predictive processing during song perception.",

          "abstract": "People differ in their ability to distinguish visually similar items, a domain-general ability known as o (Richler et al., 2019). While o typically involves extracting invariant object properties, we investigated whether it also relates to long-term memory for episodic information extrinsic to object identity, specifically, object location. We further examined whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus meaningfulness, a factor known to enhance long-term memory, by using both high- and low-meaning stimuli. Participants completed a location memory test, a series of visual object-recognition tasks assessing o, and other cognitive covariate measures. Results showed a positive correlation between o and location memory, which was stronger for high-meaning than for low-meaning stimuli. This suggests that semantic content may enhance the link between object recognition and episodic location memory. Importantly, these effects remained after controlling for age, gender, low-level visual perception, working memory, and general intelligence. Our findings indicate that domain-general object recognition ability contributes to episodic memory by supporting the binding of meaningful objects to their spatial context. This challenges traditional cognitive boundaries by integrating current knowledge about individual differences in perception and memory, with semantic meaning acting as a significant moderator.",

Nevertheless, given that what is important and salient in individuals’ lived experience might be changing over time, this raises the question about the long-term usefulness of ‘off-the-shelf’ dictionaries developed decades ago. In the current study we used a bottom-up approach to create a large population-specific lexicon of personality terms. We subsequently examined the overlap and sensitivity to extract implicit personality of this dictionary compared to an established trait dictionary in the same language. Overall, we found that the two dictionaries only showed limited overlap with a pronounced divergence in emotionality (Neuroticism) and social aspects (Agreeableness) of personality. In addition to this, we found that while the implicit personality extracted from self-descriptions using the established dictionary showed alignment with participants self-rated personality, especially in Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, the population-specific dictionary showed a significantly greater alignment between implicit and self-rated personality. In summary, our current study highlights the need to extend our thinking about the psycholexical hypothesis, moving away from assumptions of time invariant language encoding to more explicitly recognizing the temporal dynamics underpinning the expression and use of personality trait terms.",

Recent advances in Artificial Humans and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable AI-powered clinical simulators that offer standardized, repeatable practice with immediate feedback. In this study, we developed and evaluated a novel AI-supported \"triadic\" training architecture for mental health professionals learning single-session Interpersonal Psychotherapy Intervention (IPT-SSI).\nMethod: In a single-group pre–post design, MHPs (N=72) completed a two-hour blended training comprising a didactic workshop (90 minutes) and an experiential, supervised text-based AI simulation (30 minutes). Participants completed baseline and immediate post-training questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, IPT-SSI knowledge, attitudes toward IPT-SSI efficacy, and willingness/apprehension to deliver IPT-SSI.

User experience ratings were high and qualitative feedback highlighted perceived advantages in psychological safety, accessibility, and real-time guidance, alongside concerns about over-scaffolding and the limits of text-based realism. \nConclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that AI-powered clinical simulators—especially those incorporating embedded supervision—may serve as scalable, practice-forward tools to support psychotherapy training. A brief AI-supported program was associated with substantial gains in MHPs' perceived knowledge and self-efficacy and with improved attitudes and willingness to deliver IPT-SSI - key barriers to SSI implementation.",

          "authors": "Maura Nevejans; Jamie Cummins; Jan De Houwer; Emiel Cracco; Jan R. Wiersema",
          "abstract": "Relational Frame Theory (RFT) proposes that a specific type of relational responding, namely “deictic” relating, is critically involved in perspective-taking and Theory of Mind (ToM). Therefore, it has been proposed that presumed ToM difficulties experienced by individuals with autism may be attributed to difficulties with deictic relating. However, rigorous studies testing whether altered deictic relating is associated with autism are lacking. To this end, we conducted two experiments (Nexp1 = 134, Nexp2 = 120) in which we tested the relationship between autism traits and performance on different types of relational responding, including deictic relating, in a general population sample. In Experiment 1, we investigated the relationship between autism traits and performance on eight types of relational responding via an improved version of the Relational Abilities Index (RAI). In Experiment 2, we adjusted the deictic relating scale to include stimulus functions more directly relevant to perspective-taking. Contrary to our predictions, deictic relating did not correlate significantly with autism traits. Moreover, none of the other RAI subscales correlated reliably with autism traits. These findings question the claims made by RFT about the relationship between autism and relational responding and warrant a reassessment of the accuracy of this position.",

          "authors": "Yonatan Vanunu; Kristin Donnelly",
          "abstract": "Consumers often encounter products featuring assorted components, such as bags of flavored popcorn or flower bouquets. How do they judge the quantity of each component to form overall preferences? Across twelve pre-registered studies, this article shows that spatial positioning significantly shapes judgements of relative quantity. The findings reveal a proximity-to-center bias: When evaluating products with assorted items, consumers tend to perceive a given type of item as more numerous when it appears closer to the center of the display, even when actual quantity is lower. This bias impacted both hypothetical and real choices. Consumers preferred products where the packaging positioned more of the type of item that they liked most, such as a specific popcorn flavor, closer to the center. Remarkably, this preference persisted even when the actual quantity of their favored type was lower. These results suggest that these biases are rooted in selective attention, specifically to the center of the product display. This research highlights the intricate relationship between spatial positioning, quantity judgments, and consumer decision-making, offering valuable insights for product design and display strategies.",

          "abstract": "This paper aims to develop a phenomenology of the experience of self and its transformation through the interrelated experiences of form, substance, and essence. The objectives are two fold: (1) to articulate a structural vocabulary for describing how selfhood is lived, fragmented, and transformed, and (2) to demonstrate how this framework might illuminate and facilitate the resolution of identity conflict. The paper integrates relevant philosophical and psychological theory to articulate the experiential dynamics of self. This analysis yields a tripartite model composed of form (the physical and/or social dimension of identity), substance (the affective and psychological dimension), and essence (the integrative foundation of human meaning). In this model of selfhood, transformation occurs by integrating form and substance with essence. The analysis yields a phenomenological structure for understanding both intrasubjective and intersubjective reconciliation. An illustrative application of the model to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict demonstrates how collective identity fragmentation mirrors individual division and how transformation can emerge through renewed mutual recognition. The model emphasizes that transformation is not the elimination of conflict but its transfiguration through deeper relational awareness. By providing a conceptual vocabulary and analytic framework, this approach contributes to psychological theory on identity, selfhood, and the resolution of both internal and collective conflict.",

          "abstract": "Retrieval practice is a well-established strategy for enhancing memory retention. However, its effectiveness in authentic educational settings—particularly in mathematics and with respect to content transfer—remains understudied. We estimated the causal impact of retrieval practice on student performance in higher education, focusing on task-specific learning gains and content transfer (near vs. far). Participants were three cohorts of first-year business administration students in a gateway mathematics course (n1 = 636 in 2022/2023; n2 = 584 in 2023/2024; n3 = 571 in 2024/2025). Students completed weekly online retrieval practice exercises, with randomized assignments to different problem sets. Performance was assessed through three quizzes and a final exam. We estimated the local average treatment effect (LATE) using an instrumental variable approach combined with individual fixed effects. Retrieval practice improved quiz performance by 4–5 percentage points. Effects were strongest for isomorphic problems, then near-transfer problems, and only limited for far-transfer problems. On the final exam, retrieval practice yielded an 8-percentage-point LATE in one cohort, with smaller, nonsignificant gains in the others. The temporal distance between retrieval practice and quizzes did not systematically moderate outcomes. Our findings provide causal evidence that retrieval practice enhances mathematical learning in higher education by promoting a deeper conceptual understanding and facilitating near, and, in some cases, far content transfer.",

          "abstract": "Intensive longitudinal data (ILD) are increasingly used to study affect dynamics such as intraindividual variability and inertia. These parameters are often interpreted as substantive individual differences, yet they may be biased by stable response style tendencies, in particiular extreme response style (ERS). In the present study, we investigated whether ERS is systematically associated with affect dynamics estimated from multiple experience sampling method (ESM) datasets (total N = 1,254). Using a joint Bayesian IRTree–location–scale modeling approach, we estimated person-specific ERS alongside affective variability and inertia across multiple ESM datasets and synthesized study-level associations using a meta-analytic approach. We find that higher ERS is consistently associated with greater intraindividual variability. In contrast, we find no evidence that ERS was related to affective or emotional inertia. These results suggest that commonly used measures of intraindividual variability may partly reflect systematic response behavior rather than solely genuine affective fluctuations. Ignoring ERS may therefore bias variability estimates obtained from location–scale and related multilevel dynamic models. Overall, this study highlights the importance of accounting for response styles when modeling affect dynamics and interpreting person-specific variability parameters in ILD research.",

We found that statistical conclusions (i.e., rejection of H0 given α=.05) are robust to randomized data exclusion (RDE) if the reported two-sided p-value ≤ .01, and to selecting the best of ten subsets after selective randomized data exclusion (SRDE) if the reported two-sided p-value ≤ .001. A small portion of articles reported sample sizes per group before (1.3%) and after data exclusion (2.6%) among 76 independent samples t-tests, complicating direct robustness analyses. Of the statistically significant t-test results reported in the articles, 71% was robust to RDE and 56% was robust to SRDE.

While national strategies address regulation, little is known about local authority-led vaping prevention initiatives. This study synthesised information on existing local approaches to identify their scope, strengths, and areas for improvement. \n\nMethods \nA survey developed by the University of Bristol, in collaboration with Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and Improving Performance in Practice (iPiP), was distributed to 130 local authorities in England. The survey collected data on initiative type, delivery, target age group, supporting evidence used, evaluation, and challenges. Respondents were encouraged to share supporting materials, which were then reviewed by experts to assess the initiative content, supporting evidence, and evidence of evaluation. Additionally, publicly available resources were found through online searches.  \n\nResults \nFifty-seven local authorities responded (44% response rate), with 52 reporting at least one vaping prevention initiative, and 41 reporting multiple initiatives, totalling 169 initiatives. The most common initiative types were school-based campaigns and online information resources, primarily targeting ages 11-16 years. Only 9 local authorities provided information about the effectiveness of their initiatives, and 4 had been adapted based on feedback or data collected. Common challenges included limited engagement from schools, inconsistent messaging about vaping, lack of resources, and absence of national guidance. Some materials contained outdated information or misinformation. \n\nConclusions \nLocal authorities are implementing a diverse range of vaping prevention initiatives, though few are evaluated. Clearer national guidance and regular review of resources are needed to ensure consistency, accuracy, and effectiveness in youth vaping prevention efforts.",

          "abstract": "In contemporary digital environments, visual storytelling has emerged as a central strategy through which brands communicate meaning and build relationships with audiences. Instagram, as a predominantly visual social media platform, offers a unique context in which imagery, narrative structure, and consumer psychology converge. This paper explores how narrative imagery on Instagram shapes brand perception by influencing emotional responses, perceived authenticity, trust, and consumer engagement. Drawing on psychological theories of narrative processing, visual persuasion, and affective response, the study examines how cohesive visual narratives, symbolic elements, and sequential imagery contribute to the construction of brand identity. The analysis suggests that strategically designed visual storytelling not only enhances attention and memorability but also fosters deeper cognitive and emotional associations with brands. These associations, in turn, play a significant role in shaping consumer attitudes, purchase intentions, and long-term brand loyalty. By situating Instagram-based visual narratives within established psychological frameworks, this study highlights the strategic value of narrative imagery as an effective branding tool in contemporary digital culture.",

This study examined physical activity professionals’ felt needs related to climate change, as expressed through lived professional challenges and dilemmas, and explored key competencies and educational strategies for training.\nMethods: A qualitative design was employed. Fifteen (7 females) physical activity professionals practicing in the province of Québec, Canada, participated online in (i) a 1h Climate Fresk game, a gamified collaborative workshop on climate change, followed by (ii) a ~45 min focus group. Thematic analysis was conducted following a structured six-phase analytical framework. \nResults: The physical activity professionals were French speaking; 80% of them had been practicing for ≥5 years in the public (n=5, 33%) or the private (n=10, 67%) sector. Eight key themes emerged, categorized into three overarching sections: (1) barriers and dilemmas in practice, (2) required competencies to adapt practice, and (3) educational design and delivery strategies. Physical activity professionals identified environmental and logistical constraints, ethical and safety concerns, and social pressures as key barriers affecting their ability to promote safe practice. They emphasized the need for climate-specific knowledge, adaptive and communication skills, and supportive, non-judgmental attitudes. Educational recommendations centred on the behaviour-oriented, and reflective learning approaches, encouraging both professional adaptability and environmental responsibility. \nConclusion: These findings offer a guide for integrating climate change–related competencies and pedagogical approaches into physical activity professionals’ education and training programs to support climate-resilient physical activity practice.",

          "abstract": "Bilingualism can be thought of as an intensive mental gym for language control. However, the moderators that underlie bilingual adaptations are a matter of ongoing investigation. Degree of similarity in mental, linguistic representations between the languages of a bilingual has been argued to differentially condition recruitment of control mechanisms and, as such, would embody a contributing factor to relevant neurocognitive adaptations. While ample evidence exists for this claim, its empirical coverage is limited because testing in cognitive science disproportionally represents communities that speak big, Indo-European languages, thus potentially providing a biased view of bilingual cognition. In this work, we assess the role of language distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank, and tapping into different levels of linguistic granularity. Aggregating data from 56,173 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect at the population level. Certain language pairs stand out as promising hosts for bilingual adaptations, but their representation in the sample is not robust enough to enable strong conclusions, attesting to the need to employ more representative samples. Our results suggest that language distance is a complex variable that has the potential to address the perennial question of what makes bilinguals distinct.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation and disinformation are increasingly used to deceive individuals online. Identifying such deception can be particularly challenging for older adults. It is therefore crucial to understand how older users navigate online spaces. Despite the development of several interventions aimed at enhancing people’s ability to detect misinformation, their effectiveness among older adults remains underresearched. This systematic-narrative review identified interventions which target the psychological mechanisms contributing to online vulnerability and focused on their effectiveness among adults aged 50+. Searches were performed across PsycINFO, ERIC, Academic Search Ultimate, MEDLINE, Scopus, Google, and Policy Commons. Of the 1058 results retrieved, 16 articles were eligible for inclusion. Data regarding the implementation and outcome of interventions were extracted, enabling us to perform a narrative synthesis analysis. Aligning with previous research, three primary intervention types were identified: bunking, boosting, and nudging. Interventions provide mixed effectiveness among older adults but bunking programmes appear to be the most effective by facilitating discernment of both true and false content. Several interventions contributed to negative side-effects among older adults, such as an overconfidence in detection ability and decreased sharing of true information. Overall, psychological interventions provide a promising mechanism to support digital deception detection, but age-specific approaches are necessary to protect older users from the harms of false information online.",

          "abstract": "People who view food-wasting behaviour as immoral tend to waste less. This observation raises the question of whether appealing to moral values can shift how individuals think about food waste and how willing they are to address it. The present preregistered experiment (N = 1006) tested this possibility by examining whether persuasive video messages grounded in the Morality-as-Cooperation framework influence psychological responses to food waste. Participants were randomly assigned to view one of seven value-based appeals: highlighting Family, Group, Reciprocity, Heroism, Deference, Fairness, or Property concerns; or one of two control conditions. Each moral message was presented in both positive and negative framing and delivered by one of two actors.\nOutcomes included judgments of the wrongness of food wasting, intentions to reduce waste, support for policy measures, and willingness to learn more or engage in related actions. Preregistered analyses showed no overall effects of the moral messages. However, mediation analyses showed a consistent pattern of opposing effects. Across outcomes, moral appeals were associated with lower perceived message relevance, which in turn predicted weaker moral concern, policy support, and behavioural intentions. At the same time, when controlling for perceived relevance, several moral messages—particularly those grounded in Family, Deference, Heroism, and Property concerns—exerted positive direct effects on outcomes.\nOverall, the findings show that moral appeals in food waste communication can be a double-edged sword. Moral messages have the potential to motivate stronger responses, but only when people find them personally relevant. When they do not, the same appeals may undermine their own effectiveness. This emphasizes perceived relevance as a key ingredient in successful moral communication about food waste.",

          "authors": "Hao Qin; Rafael C. Gonçalves; Courtney Michael Goodridge; Natasha Merat",
          "abstract": "Partially automated driving (PAD) systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in consumer vehicles. While drivers are obliged to monitor the roadway and the system during PAD, they do not always comply with this requirement and may engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs). Literature has emphasized the detrimental effects of visual–manual NDRTs on drivers’ capability to takeover control from PAD while reporting negligible effects of non-visual NDRTs (e.g., hands-free phone calls) and cognitive load. However, most studies focused on alerted scenarios, with takeover requests lowering drivers’ reliance on anticipation and cognitive load, masking the effects of cognitive load. Related work also examined PAD conditions alone, neglecting the combined effects of automation and cognitive load on drivers’ responses. To address the gaps, we conducted a driving simulator study examining the influence of cognitive load, induced by a 2-back task, on driver-initiated responses to urban traffic hazards (e.g., crossing pedestrians, oncoming vehicles) during both manual driving and PAD. The timing and quality of driver-initiated responses were analyzed separately for each hazard with detail. Results showed that (i) cognitive load effects manifested most when drivers encountered hazards with lower perceptual salience (e.g., a pedestrian gradually approaching the roadway); (ii) driver-initiated responses during PAD were less proactive and relied more on cognitive control; and (iii) this shift led to higher situational criticality and heightened susceptibility of responses to cognitive load during PAD. Together, these findings underscore an elevated safety risk associated with cognitive load during PAD, especially in scenarios requiring cognitively demanding, driver-initiated intervention.",

It is a prime instance of a class of tasks where eye movements are coordinated for the purpose of comprehension. Existing theories explain either eye movements or comprehension during reading, but the critical link between the two remains unclear. Here, we propose resource-rational optimization as a unifying principle governing adaptive reading behavior. Eye movements are selected to maximize expected comprehension while minimizing cognitive and temporal costs, organized hierarchically across nested time scales: fixation decisions support word recognition; sentence-level integration guides skipping and regression; and text-level comprehension goals shape memory construction and rereading. A computational implementation successfully replicates an unprecedented range of findings in human reading, from lexical effects to comprehension outcomes. Together, these results suggest that resource rationality provides a general mechanism for coordinating perception, memory, and action in knowledge-intensive human behaviors, offering a principled account of how complex cognitive skills adapt to limited resources.",

          "abstract": "Figurative and prior knowledge can each connect unfamiliar concepts to familiar experience to support learning, yet how they jointly shape real-time concept learning remains underspecified. The prior-knowledge scaffolding account predicts that learners primarily recruit domain-relevant semantic associates, whereas embodied-cognition accounts predict that figurative language promotes learning by eliciting sensorimotor simulations of a source domain and drawing attention to grounded information. We tested these competing hypotheses and their predictions in a visual-world eye-tracking study in which 104 Mandarin-speaking adults learned novel science concepts from spoken explanations that were either literal or figurative. Participants viewed three competitors per trial: a prior-knowledge associate, a sensorimotor-rich synonym linked to the figurative source, and an unrelated distractor. Learning outcomes were assessed with immediate and delayed judgments. Gaze time courses were analyzed across interest periods and linked to decision processes via hierarchical drift-diffusion modeling. Literal explanations elicited a sustained fixation advantage for the prior-knowledge competitor, consistent with the prior-knowledge scaffolding hypothesis. Figurative explanations produced a distinct temporal signature: attention shifted toward the sensorimotor synonym when the source domain was introduced, and later reflected concurrent engagement of sensorimotor and prior-knowledge information, reflecting an online interaction. Individual-differences analyses indicated that stronger figurative sensorimotor engagement at source-word onset predicted better learning outcomes and more efficient evidence accumulation, whereas sustained late reliance on figurative information predicted poorer performance. These findings show that abstract concept learning is supported by dynamically coordinated knowledge sources rather than a single mechanism. Instructionally, the results suggest that figurative language is most effective when it is used to initiate learning and is then paired with cues that promote integration with relevant prior knowledge.",

The quality of confirmatory testing depends critically on reliable fit index cutoffs that control type I and type II errors during hypothesis testing. However, conventional cutoffs developed by Hu and Bentler (1999; HB cutoffs) are inflexible and are vulnerable to sample and model characteristics, creating a demand for more flexible dynamic fit index (DFI) cutoffs that can be adapted to researchers’ specific designs. In this study, we attempted to develop a DFI algorithm for Gaussian graphical models, a widely implemented network model, and compared the performance of DFI cutoffs with HB cutoffs\nin terms of their specificity and sensitivity to misspecifications. In simulation studies based on both synthetic and empirical networks, DFI provided more flexible cutoffs with a transparent, fixed power/specificity to detect correctly specified models and was often more sensitive to misspecifications, especially in empirical networks. The DFI for network models provides a more reliable and flexible criterion for confirmatory network analysis, thereby marking an essential advancement in theory and hypothesis testing in network research. The algorithm has been implemented in an open-source, user-friendly R package, netDFI.",

          "abstract": "Network models in time-series and panel data have been powerful tools to investigate the dynamical relations among variables. A common goal of empirical research is to compare the networks of different groups, such as treatment and control, to understand how the dynamical relations are shaped by grouping variables. However, existing methods for comparing n = 1 idiographic networks are restricted to global tests, which lack the capacity to identify the precise location of edge heterogeneity. Furthermore, there is a lack of easily applicable methods to compare networks from panel data where just a few time-points are available per person. We therefore present the invariance partial pruning (IVPP) approach, which first evaluates heterogeneity globally with the network invariance test, and then determine the exact locus of heterogeneity at the edge level with partial pruning. Through simulation studies, we discovered that network invariance test based on Akaike Information Criterion performed well. Bayesian Information Criterion performed similarly well but also showed insufficient power to detect smaller true differences at small sample sizes, and the Likelihood Ratio Test was prone to false discovery. Comparison with the fully constrained model revealed superior performance than comparison with the fully unconstrained model. Partial pruning successfully uncovered specific edge difference with high sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that IVPP is an essential supplement to the existing network methodology by allowing the comparison of networks from both time-series and panel data, and also allowing the test of specific edge difference. We implement the algorithm in the R-package IVPP.",

          "authors": "David Brian Rompilla; Connor Bazar; Savannah Dod; Valerie Lu; Takashi Yamauchi",
          "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is widely viewed as adaptive. Yet this control-based emotion regulation may carry hidden costs when individuals encounter personally meaningful reminders of past adversity. The present study examined these tradeoffs in a naturally occurring subsample of undergraduates with a history of parental divorce. Within a larger experiment, participants viewed sad film clips, including an unexpected divorce-relevant reminder, completed a movement-based Stroop task, and later reported the extent to which the reminder reactivated negative feelings from their own experience. As predicted, instructed reappraisal conferred short-term functional benefits on the Stroop task. However, at a longer timescale, individuals who reported habitually relying more heavily on reappraisal showed evidence of preserved reminder-evoked distress. In contrast, individuals higher in habitual acceptance showed a more normative pattern, such that those with divorces further in the past reported faint to no distress in response to the reminders. Together, these findings point to a central tradeoff in emotion regulation: reappraisal helps people maintain composure in the moment, yet repeated reliance on it keeps emotional echoes of past adversity alive. The divergent effects of these two emotion regulation strategies—reappraisal and acceptance—are discussed through cybernetic and comparator-based models of emotion regulation, where cognitive appraisal acts as a feedback process involving reference signals, error monitoring, and corrective adjustments while acceptance involves release of control.",

          "abstract": "Background: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing disease. An automated recovery support system using personal sensing and machine learning may help identify when individuals are at elevated lapse risk. Cellular communication sensing may detect dynamic changes in lapse risk and can be contextualized with self-reported, risk-relevant information about contacts. \n\nObjective: We evaluated a machine learning model predicting next-day alcohol lapse among individuals in early recovery from AUD using contextualized cellular communication data and baseline demographic and AUD characteristics. \n\nMethods: A total of 144 participants (49% male; mean age=40; 87% non-Hispanic White) with a goal of abstinence provided cellular communication data and alcohol use reports via a 4x daily EMA for up to three months. Models were trained and evaluated using repeated k-fold cross-validation. \n\nResults: The best-performing model used an elastic net algorithm and retained 13 features (median posterior auROC=0.68, 95% Bayesian credible interval (CI; [0.64, 0.71]). A baseline comparison model including only baseline features retained five features and demonstrated nearly identical performance (median auROC=0.68, 95% CI [0.64, 0.71]). \n\nConclusions: Cellular communication data capture some risk-relevant signal for alcohol lapse but do not provide incremental predictive value beyond baseline measures. Several communication features were retained in the final model with moderately sized coefficients, suggesting that aspects of social communication may be important for understanding lapse risk. Although, limitations inherent to cellular communication as a sensing method may outweigh their added value.",

We describe the design and implementation of a novel stakeholder-driven initiative to build a peer-led online support group for people with BPD. \n\nMethods: This manuscript does not present a traditional research study or follow an implementation science framework. Instead, it documents a radical, community-led model of care development—one that expands the possibilities for stakeholder-led innovation in mental health services. People with BPD and their families recognized an unmet need and co-created an intervention; researchers later joined to help assess program outcomes and capture impact. We describe support group design, peer facilitator training, and adaptation to online format during the COVID-19 pandemic using narrative format. We quantify changes in attendance over time (one-way ANOVAs) and participant demographics and satisfaction (n=598 survey respondents). \n\nResults: A two-year peer-driven process identified core principles and designed a peer-led support group. In the first 26 months, 138 peer-support sessions met (1383 total attendees) with significant increases in registered participants, program attendance, and waitlists. Participants were geographically diverse, likely to attend one session (72%), and reported high satisfaction. Many had never received BPD treatment (44%) or met someone else with BPD (48%).\n\nConclusions: This program demonstrates an example of stakeholder-led design of a sustainable program for people with BPD. The sustained demand we observed underscores the need for accessible empowering support for people with BPD.",

          "authors": "Andrea Grabovac; Nickolas Grabovac; Winson F.Z. Yang; Molly Haggerty; Malcolm Wright; Matthew Sacchet",
          "abstract": "This paper presents the Insight Development Process (IDP), a theoretical framework of propositional insight development to facilitate its scientific investigation. This framework formulates three empirically-testable propositions: transience, self-lessness, and incongruence, each defined as a perceptual mode that individuals report during advanced insight meditation. These propositions parallel classical Buddhist descriptions of the “three characteristics,” but are articulated here in a form suitable for empirical investigation and ontologically neutral analysis. The IDP differentiates two forms of insight in relation to these propositions: (1) momentary insights, defined as brief pre-reflexive shifts in perception in which experience appears consistent with one or more propositions, (2) integrated insights, defined as more durable shifts in perception, cognition, or behavior that reflect an intuitive and implicitly accessible sense of one or more propositions. Based on these formulations, we hypothesize that increasing access to these perceptual modes constitutes the primary mechanism enabling momentary insights to arise. Drawing on descriptions of Theravada Buddhist insight meditation stages in classical texts, modern practice manuals, and first-person accounts across contemplative and non-contemplative contexts, we delineate eight insight stages, each specified in terms of its characteristic patterns of momentary insights and associated experiential features. Criteria are proposed for evaluating degrees of integrated insight. We outline temporal dynamics describing how momentary insights unfold and change across the eight stages. The IDP provides operationalizable constructs suitable for empirical research, supporting hypothesis generation about the cognitive, affective, and neural mechanisms of propositional insight, and the ways in which advanced insight meditation shapes consciousness and well-being.\n\nKeywords: advanced meditation, meditative development, insight stages, meditative endpoints, Insight Development Process, propositional insight",

          "abstract": "The present research adopts a mixed-methods approach to examine the boundaries between two anger variants: an anger perceived as moral, appropriate, and justified; and an anger considered wrong and unjustified. In Study 1, we analyze participants’ narratives about their past experiences of justified and unjustified anger using qualitative thematic analysis, closed-vocabulary, and open-vocabulary text processing methods. In Study 2, we use a prototype approach to differentiate justified and unjustified anger experiences across ten theory-driven dimensions. The results reveal crucial differences in cognitive and emotional components, as well as interpersonal outcomes associated with these anger types. Participants often considered their anger to be justified when a target’s actions were perceived as immoral, unfair, harmful, or violating norms. They viewed the target’s behavior as reflecting poor moral character, expressed absolutist judgments in their writing, and experienced concurrent hostile emotions. In contrast, participants perceived their anger as unjustified when it stemmed from unrelated frustrations, misunderstandings, or overreactions to trivial offenses. Unjustified anger narratives were often reflective, and demonstrated retrospection and self-directed emotions (e.g., guilt and embarrassment). The two anger types varied considerably in their relational impact: Justified anger commonly led to strained or severed relationships, while unjustified anger prompted efforts to repair bonds. Additionally, justified anger had a stronger overlap with hate and contempt appraisals. We discuss the implications of these findings for constructing theories capable of explaining diverse anger experiences as well as developing interventions to address the maladaptive behaviors associated with anger.",

          "abstract": "Sacred moments are characterised by the five qualities of boundlessness, deep\ninterconnectedness, transcendence, ultimacy, and spiritual emotions, experienced at one moment\nin time (Pargament et al., 2014). These moments have been associated with improvements to\nwell-being in numerous ways. Benefits to well-being as a result of attending concerts have also\nbeen well documented, as concerts have become increasingly popular in recent years. The goal\nof the present study was to investigate how sacred moments manifest during rock concerts, and\nthe extent to which sacred moments contribute to the improvements in well-being experienced\nfrom concert attendances. Thus, the present study involved a questionnaire to examine the\nprevalence of experiencing sacred moment qualities at rock concerts (N = 87). Semi-structured\ninterviews were also used to explore the lived experience of these qualities, along with the\nelements that made the concert impactful (n = 3). The results of the questionnaire revealed that\nparticipants were likely to experience sacred moment qualities during at least one or few concerts\nthey have attended. Religious belief, age, gender, and frequency of rock concert attendance\ngenerally did not have an effect on the frequency of experiencing sacred moment qualities at\nconcerts, except for ultimacy, which had a slight negative correlation with age only.\nInterpretative phenomenological analysis on the in-depth interview data uncovered two group\nexperiential themes: “The Singular and Unique Experience of Live Music,” with Literally\nSingular, and Figuratively Singular; Unique and Extraordinary as subthemes, and “Live Music\nis a Sensory and Physical Experience,” with Physicality and Moshing, The Visual Experience,\nThe Auditory Experience, and Physical Realness as subthemes. Notably, every sacred moment\nquality experienced at concerts was described by the participants as exceedingly enjoyable and\nresulted in improved well-being, though the longevity of these effects had limited evidence. The\nhypothesis that sacred moment experiences could be a mechanism through which live music\nexperiences improve people’s well-being was supported by the findings. Limitations and\nimplications for future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Recent debates on violent video game (VVG) effects highlight the importance of analytical robustness and transparency in longitudinal research. Teng and Bushman (2026) reanalyzed our prior study (Lacko et al., 2024), identifying several methodological concerns and arguing that our conclusions were unwarranted. In this response, we critically evaluate their reanalysis and demonstrate that their conclusions rely on a narrow set of analytical decisions that do not adequately capture the complexity of the data. We show that many of their criticisms are either unsupported or reflect analytic preferences rather than validity threats. Through comprehensive robustness checks available on OSF, we address concerns regarding model specification, missing data, measurement decisions, and time constraints. We further examine the unexpected empathy–aggression association and alternative VVG operationalizations. While some inconsistencies emerge across different specifications, none consistently support General Aggression Model (GAM) interpretations, confirming our original conclusion that evidence for GAM processes in this dataset is weak. We identify transparency issues in Teng and Bushman's findings reporting, data processing and inconsistent interpretation of effect sizes. We also argue that the current debate reveals a fundamental theoretical problem: without precise specifications of mechanisms, developmental patterns, and falsifiable predictions, GAM risks unfalsifiability when contradictory findings can all be accommodated as supporting evidence. We advocate for formal modeling approaches to enhance theoretical rigor and predictive specificity in violent media research.",

To increase PBI accessibility, we developed The College Parent Guide (CPG), an AI-driven chatbot providing research-based guidance on student drinking, parent communication, and risk reduction. This study evaluated expert perceptions of CPG. Method: Seventeen PhD-level experts specializing in alcohol/substance use, parenting, and/or adolescent/emerging adult health, completed an online survey and input four preselected prompts to CPG. Responses were assessed on whether they would have provided a similar response, accuracy, clarity, appropriateness, and potential benefit or harm. Participants provided overall impressions of CPG’s performance and indicated whether modifications were needed. Results: Sixteen experts agreed CPG would provide reliable and safe information to parents of college students. Two participants believed one response could be harmful. One participant identified multiple concerning responses. Fourteen experts recommended CPG could be supplemental to PBIs with minor updates. Two suggested no updates, while one suggested major revisions. Conclusions: CPG appears to be a promising, scalable tool that may provide parents with reliable guidance on college student drinking. Before CPG is used in a PBI, further research is required to identify how parents engage with CPG, evaluate its effectiveness, and ensure its guidance supports safe and constructive parent–student communication.",

          "authors": "Hari Srinivasan",
          "abstract": "Growth mindset has reshaped how educational psychology explains persistence under challenge by showing that self-change beliefs influence how students interpret difficulty and respond to setbacks—particularly when learning conditions make improvement feasible. For disabled and neurodivergent learners, however, effort and strategy often cannot fully remove high-impact barriers, raising questions about how motivation operates under enduring constraint. This article introduces possibility mindset as a complementary construct for understanding motivation in such contexts. Possibility mindset is defined as a learner’s context-specific appraisal of “room to move,” grounded in three belief dimensions: self-change beliefs (can I develop in ways that matter here?), environment-change beliefs (will this setting adapt reliably in practice?), and pathway-flexibility beliefs (are there multiple legitimate routes to valued goals?).\nAlthough especially salient for disabled and neurodivergent learners, the framework applies more broadly to educational contexts where effort alone cannot reliably secure access. The central claim is one of translation: self-change beliefs sustain engagement most reliably when learners also expect environments to respond and pathways to remain viable. The article specifies predicted belief configurations, outlines a staged research agenda for measurement and incremental validity testing, and proposes “aligned” interventions that combine psychological messages with visible structural flexibility. Drawing on attributional traditions, the contribution is not to displace existing motivation theory, but to specify how attributions about systems—rather than solely about the self—shape motivational decisions under enduring constraint.",

While fluid intelligence and political ideology offered limited predictive power, IH consistently predicted accuracy, particularly in volatile domains. High-IH individuals engaged in a self-correcting cycle: they updated predictions more frequently and calibrated uncertainty intervals more effectively. Crucially, and challenging “wisdom of crowds” models, exposure to diverse peer predictions did not improve accuracy; diversity without metacognitive scaffolding provided no benefit. Automated topic modeling confirmed that accurate forecasters focused on base rates and uncertainty, whereas inaccurate ones defaulted to generalized pessimism. Thus, in complex domains, metacognitive discipline predicts foresight more than intellect or information access alone.",

          "abstract": "The semantic processing generating the N400 event-related potential (ERP) could be an inhibition preventing information from being placed into working memory (WM). This predicts that the amplitude of the late positive potential that follows, the LPP, should decrease. Conversely, when N400s are small, less inhibition would occur, LPPs should be larger and the WM content richer. This was observed in Sinha et al. (2023): when N400s to equivocal story endings were as small as those for univocal endings, LPPs to equivocals were larger and their ambiguity, detected. Here, to further test such LPP predictions, the half of their 101 participants who had similar or smaller N400s to equivocals than to univocals (the SN4s) were separated from the half having larger such N400s (the LN4s). As predicted, LPPs of SN4s were larger for equivocals than for univocals, while LN4s had smaller such additional LPPs. These LPP differences were distinct from N400 ones: equivocality interacted with time-window and the subtractions of the ERPs to univocals from those to equivocals revealed two peaks. Complementarily, in Sinha et al. (2025a), N400s were found a bit larger for equivocals than for univocals. There, LPPs were only a bit larger for the former than for the latter. Here, the same separation of 50 SN4s from 50 LN4s and the same subtractions led to similar results: two peaks having distinct scalp distributions. We thus report further support for the N400 inhibition hypothesis framework and a method for detecting the semantic processing strategy occurring in each participant.",

Across two studies, an initial pilot experiment (N = 39) and a pre-registered follow-up experiment (N = 80), we employed modified versions of the Inequity Game to test implicit sensitivity and explicit response decisions to various disadvantageous offers in groups of 2- and 4-year-old children. Across experiments, both age groups showed evidence of sensitivity to disadvantageous offers that provided them nothing while their partner received resources (e.g. 0 vs. 3). However, only 4-year-olds were willing to forgo offerings involving personal gain (e.g., 1 vs. 3) to protest unfair treatment, a hallmark of disadvantageous inequity aversion. These findings suggest that sensitivity to disadvantageous offers emerges as early as the second year of life, but this sensitivity develops into disadvantageous inequity aversion over subsequent years.",

          "authors": "Ulrich Schroeders; Jonas Walter",
          "abstract": "Matrix reasoning tasks are widely used measures of fluid reasoning. Despite variation in construction principles, four difficulty components recur across tests: the number of elements, the number of rules, rule type, and perceptual organization. Among these, rule type is particularly central and can be formally classified into unary, binary, and ternary operations. Accordingly, we introduce BOLT (Boolean Operations and Logical Thinking), a matrix test grounded in Boolean algebra as the formal framework for item generation. Across two online pilot studies (Study 1: N = 473, 45 items; Study 2: N = 430, 42 items) and one operational administration (Study 3: N = 7,150, 39 items), we estimated Rasch item difficulties and examined feature-based explanations of these estimates. Study 1 confirmed that the number\nof binary rules was the primary driver of difficulty, whereas unary and ternary rules showed no consistent effects. For Studies 2–3, we combined cross-validated LASSO feature selection with linear logistic test models (LLTMs) to quantify contributions of structural features (number of elements, number of rules, rule types) and perceptual-organizational indices that were extracted from stimulus files. Item difficulty could be predicted with sufficient accuracy (LLTM R² = .75 in Study 2; R² = .57 in Study 3). Overall, binary operations and perceptual organization emerged as converging determinants of item difficulty in BOLT items. Future work should replicate and extend the finding that image-derived computer-vision indices make an incremental contribution beyond rule-based predictors and integrate these indices into models of matrix-item difficulty.",

          "abstract": "Research has shown that rest is beneficial for memory consolidation. However, periods of\nrest are also prone to evoke mind wandering (MW) episodes, which have been observed to be an\nobstacle to learning. As such, an apparent paradox arises from these observations: individuals\nbenefit from rest to consolidate memories, but those periods of rest are likely to elicit MW episodes,\nwhich are seen as impeding consolidation. Using the caught probe paradigm, we measured the\neffect of MW frequency over performance in two dot pattern classification tasks after two types of\nperiods of rest: rest in silence and rest with preferred music. We found that MW and rest conditions\ninteract to predict accuracy in a Novel or Old categorisation task, but not in a Category Classification\ntask. Although rest with music was predictive of better post-rest task performance in the Novel or\nOld task, MW frequency was related with higher accuracy only when participants rested in silence.\nWhat is more, we found that participants’ attitudes towards music reliably moderated the effect of\nMW over the Novel or Old task accuracy. Together, these results show that MW during rest is\npotentially beneficial for short-term memory consolidation and does not necessarily interfere with\nit.",

          "abstract": "Music is a cultural universal, yet the conceptual boundary between “music” and “non‑music” remains theoretically unsettled. This study used behavioral measures to examine the perceptual judgments of listeners from Brazil, China, and the United States as they classified short sound excerpts and rated their perceived musicality. Participants (N = 103) completed an online survey featuring 24 two‑second stimuli drawn from 11 sound categories, including traditional music from 130 societies and non‑musical sounds from established auditory taxonomies. Descriptively, the mean proportion of “music” classifications was 0.51, with substantial category‑level variation: traditional vocal and non‑vocal music received the highest endorsement rates, whereas speech and environmental sounds received the lowest. Musicality ratings showed a parallel pattern. Inter‑participant agreement, quantified using Krippendorff’s α, was moderate at the aggregate level (α = .73) but generally low within categories.\n\nTo complement these descriptive patterns, mixed‑effects models were used to assess whether sound category or country predicted responses while accounting for participant‑ and stimulus‑level variability. Both models revealed large, reliable effects of sound category: the two traditional music categories were far more likely to be judged as music and received substantially higher musicality ratings than all other categories. No other category differed significantly from the reference, and country effects were small or nonsignificant. Together, the descriptive and inferential results indicate that listeners share strong intuitions about prototypical musical sounds, but judgments become highly heterogeneous for ambiguous cases, suggesting that the concept of music may be graded and context‑dependent rather than sharply bounded.",

Eight databases were searched for peer-reviewed studies reporting interventions targeting youth resilience or coping with adversity. The inclusion criteria focused on resilience-building interventions for youth exposed to adverse life events. Data were narratively synthesised. \nResults: Twenty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. Promising intervention features included CBT-informed intervention ingredients delivered in a group format, tiered school models, and peer-support. Improvements were observed in emotion regulation, self-esteem, prosocial behaviour, and psychological flexibility. Effects on core mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety were inconsistent. Co-design, facilitator training, and cultural grounding were inconsistently addressed across studies. \nConclusions: Significant heterogeneity characterised how different intervention programmes defined and operationalised resilience, leading to variability in outcome variables and measures. Greater consistency in defining and measuring resilience, alongside attention to implementation quality and cultural context is essential to strengthen the evidence base and inform future interventions and building cumulative evidence base in the field.",

          "abstract": "Background. Music performance anxiety is a common and debilitating problem among musicians. Biofeedback interventions have been increasingly investigated as non-pharmacological approaches to reduce anxiety and enhance musical performance; however, evidence regarding their effectiveness, training characteristics, and outcome specificity remains fragmented. Aim. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the effects of biofeedback techniques on musician's mental health and performance. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted across Scopus, PsycINFO, and PubMed. Studies investigating biofeedback interventions targeting anxiety, performance, or physiological outcomes in musicians were included. Study selection followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included electroencephalography (EEG) - based neurofeedback, autonomic biofeedback, and multimodal biofeedback approaches, with durations ranging from single-session protocols to multi-week and multi-month training programs. Anxiety-related outcomes were most consistently improved by autonomic and multimodal biofeedback, whereas EEG neurofeedback more frequently yielded improvements in expert-rated musical performance. Physiological modulation, including changes in EEG activity, reductions in muscle tension, and improvements in heart rate variability, was observed across intervention types. Conclusions. Biofeedback interventions represent a promising non-pharmacological approach for reducing performance anxiety in musicians. Future studies should standardize outcome measures, define optimal intervention dosage, and directly compare different biofeedback modalities to inform evidence-based implementation in musical performance contexts.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, spending on political campaigns has surged dramatically. This paper introduces and examines “party-defiance ads,” a novel type of political advertisement in which candidates explicitly criticize their own party and take a position typically associated with the opposing party. Given the importance of party loyalty, defiance ads appear counterintuitive and risky. Why would candidates air ads in which they criticize their party? Across eight main studies and nine supplemental studies (N = 12,626)—including an analysis linking real-world ad content to voting outcomes in recent elections—we investigate how consumers react to the use of defiance ads. Past research on political polarization predicts that defiance ads will have negative consequences for candidates. In contrast, we argue and present evidence that defiance ads can result in positive consequences for candidates (a “defiance premium”). We examine the defiance premium in the context of both general elections and primaries and specify when and why it emerges. Our findings examine a previously undocumented advertising strategy, introduce electability as an important construct for research at the intersection of political marketing and consumer psychology, and provide practical insights for managers interested in deploying defiance ads without triggering backlash for doing so.",

Yet there are no existing self-report scales for measuring the process of decision-making in individual dilemmas (as opposed to general moral attitudes or beliefs about moral decision-making). We address this gap by devising new self-report measures of several of the processes by which people make moral decisions and validate them using realistic moral dilemmas, including six new vignettes that we developed. The resulting 12-item Decision Process Scale (DPS) can be used to measure how much people rely on rules versus cost-benefit reasoning and how much they rely on intuition versus deliberation in the specific moral dilemmas they face in a laboratory experiment or in the real world.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Aphasia rehabilitation increasingly emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms and ingredients underlying behavioral interventions. Semantic Feature Analysis (SFA) is a commonly-used intervention for anomia in aphasia but there is little evidence directly examining its active ingredients. Using within-trial responses during SFA, we sought to explore how generating semantic features might facilitate naming improvements. \n\nMethod: A retrospective analysis evaluated data collected from a clinical trial focused on intensive SFA treatment for individuals with chronic aphasia. The study included 44 adults with chronic aphasia following left-hemisphere stroke. A pre-trained semantic model was used to estimate the semantic relatedness between  features and targets.\n\nResults: Participants were 2.6 (95% CI: [2.16, 3.12]) times more likely to correctly name target words after engaging in feature generation. Each additional feature generated was associated with a three percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.2, 0.4]) in the probability of a correct response at the end of the trial; a one standard deviation increase in semantic similarity (i.e., feature quality) was associated with a six percentage-point increase (95% CI: [0.4, 0.10]). Model comparison favored semantic similarity over feature generation count in predicting final response accuracy.\n\nConclusions: Findings provide converging evidence that semantic feature generation is an active ingredient in SFA treatment, emphasizing the importance of feature quantity and semantic quality, consistent with a spreading activation account of SFA’s benefits. Further research is warranted to validate relatedness values from semantic model embeddings, and to explore the relationship between within-trial feature generation and generalization to semantically related but untreated words.",

          "abstract": "People are lazy. According to the law of least effort, people generally prefer to exert less rather than more effort to achieve the same reward. However, this research often isolates individuals from social influences, overlooking the fact that we are inherently social beings whose behaviour is shaped by the norms and information we gather from others. Here, we examine whether individuals conform to both high-effort and low-effort norms equally, or whether the strength of normative influence on effort choices depends on the direction of the norm. Across twelve studies (N = 2,084), participants completed a demand-selection task where they repeatedly chose between a hard or easy task. While people generally avoid effort, results revealed that participants exerted significantly more effort after learning that previous participants consistently chose the harder task, compared to a control group who received no information about others' choices. Participants who were informed that others typically opted for the easier task, however, did not exert less effort than the control group, and in fact exerted more effort. Even after increasing the acceptability of low effort—by enhancing the value of low effort and the psychological closeness to past participants—individuals still opposed the low effort norm, exerting no less effort than the control group. These findings suggest that while others' behaviour can inspire us to work harder, individuals show resistance to lowering their effort below what they would typically exert. While we consistently found conformity to high-effort norms, effort preferences were not influenced when hearing about others completing an unrelated task, pointing to a possible boundary condition for norm effects.",

But, although research might never reach the generalizability of the globe, it does not mean we can not move closer. In this article, we map a framework for moving closer towards true generalizability of human subjects research. It starts with drawing cluster random samples using countries as clusters, drawn proportional to their populations. Then, through Big team Science, reaching out and building connections at those sites for participation. Finally, correcting treatment effects for nonresponse bias at the cluster (country) level through country-level indicators. This framework starts to bring us closer to random sampling of the globe while correcting for nonresponse bias at the cluster level. Future work can refine this procedure and make further steps towards generalizable human sciences.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cognitive theories on trauma memory postulate that trauma-related intrusions are associated with more data-driven and less contextual processing. However, contextualisation can be enhanced via verbalization, suggesting that verbalizing traumatic material should reduce the number of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms and processes. Methods: In this experimental study, participants watched different trauma films and were instructed to verbalize the contents of each film clip, to visually imagine them, or to let their mind wander freely. Intrusions were measured via a diary and an intrusion provocation task applied three days after film presentation, and general trauma-relevant symptoms were assessed with the Posttraumatic Symptom Checklist (PCL-5). Thought suppression was measured twice, i.e., before and after the experimental manipulation. During a memory processing task, participants were asked to recall the film clips, and their performance was evaluated based on the number of details they accurately remembered as well as the time it took them to do so. Results: No group differences emerged regarding the number of intrusions, PCL-5 scores, memory processing task outcomes, levels of thought suppression or data driven processing. Exploratory correlational analyses revealed that intrusion frequency (i.e., diary intrusions, provoked intrusions, PCL-5) was positively correlated with thought suppression pre- and post-manipulation. Conclusion: The verbalization task did not result in a reduction of intrusions and other trauma-relevant symptoms. However, results further underline the relationship between thought suppression and intrusions.",

          "abstract": "Background: Short-form video platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) have experienced unprecedented growth globally, with particularly rapid adoption in South Asian developing economies like Nepal. However, concerns regarding algorithmic exposure to inappropriate content and mental health impacts remain understudied in these contexts, where digital literacy and regulatory frameworks are still evolving.\n\nObjective: This study provides the first comprehensive multi-platform comparison of public discourse surrounding explicit content exposure, age-related concerns, and mental health implications of short-form video platforms. We address the content-specific research gap identified by Nguyen et al. (2025) through large-scale secondary data analysis, with particular attention to the unique challenges facing developing digital economies like Nepal where English serves as the primary digital lingua franca.\n\nMethods: We collected 221,764 user-generated records from five sources: Google Play Store reviews (160,000), Apple App Store reviews (12,086), Reddit posts (48,606), Trustpilot reviews (800), and YouTube comments (18,539). After relevance filtering and deduplication, 8,435 records mentioning content concerns, age-related issues, or mental health were analyzed using VADER sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling.\n\nResults: Analysis revealed highly polarized sentiment (45.0% negative, 42.3% positive, 12.7% neutral) with platform-specific variations. Instagram exhibited the most negative sentiment (M = −0.096), while TikTok showed slightly positive sentiment (M = 0.025) despite receiving the most discussion (49.6% of relevant content). Five dominant themes emerged: (1) child safety and parental concerns, (2) algorithmic content recommendation issues, (3) personal usage experiences, (4) account moderation and banning, and (5) mental health and attention span concerns.\n\nConclusions: Our multi-platform comparison reveals significant platform-specific variations in user sentiment, with Instagram exhibiting the most negative discourse (M = −0.096) despite TikTok dominating discussion volume. These findings align with and extend Nguyen et al.'s (2025) meta-analytic findings on short-form video's cognitive and mental health correlates. The results highlight the need for platform-specific content moderation strategies, transparent algorithmic practices, and age-appropriate safeguards—particularly critical in developing economies like Nepal where digital adoption is outpacing regulatory and educational infrastructure.",

We conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment (N = 2,189) to test a fully online 3-week mindset-based goal achievement intervention designed to strengthen both adaptive interpretations of stress and the behavioral capacities required to enact them in everyday learning activities. Compared with five active and passive control conditions, the intervention produced greater improvements in academic adjustment, reflected in higher academic effort and self-esteem immediately after completion, and the advantage in effort remained detectable at follow-up. Mediation analyses showed that increases in subjective vitality and value-aligned action, rather than changes in stress mindset alone, accounted for gains in adjustment, underscoring the role of behavioral and resource-based mechanisms in translating mindsets into adaptive academic adjustment. Among participants who reported official examination scores, the intervention also yielded higher Mathematics scores, but not Politics or English scores, suggesting that psychological support may be most consequential in disciplines where performance depends on sustained deliberate practice. These findings show that rigorously evaluated psychological interventions can support students during high-stakes academic preparation and may represent a scalable pathway toward greater educational equity.",

Here, we examined whether strong or weak social memories are more prone to updating when violated. Participants viewed well-known characters’ emotional reactions to food items either repeatedly or only once. They then studied new events where some characters exhibited unexpected emotions to the same food items, violating initial memories. We found that when violated, strong existing memories, compared to weak memories, led to worse learning of new information, suggesting the resistance of strong memories to updating. Further, using a novel behavioral metric, we assessed the mechanistic role of memory reactivation in the updating of strong and weak memories. We showed that when encountering conflicting information, instead of reflecting their relative encoding strength, reactivation of weak memories reached a level similar to that of strong memories. Meanwhile, strong memories that were more reactivated showed higher likelihood to incorporate new information.",

          "authors": "Jefferson Pooley",
          "abstract": "This paper traces the history of the U.S. behavioral sciences movement: a self-understood vanguard of U.S. social scientists—all the mainline disciplines except economics—forged in shared World War II service, maintained through funder-enabled networks of the early Cold War, and characterized by a mix of nomothetic confidence and aspirational scientism, until the movement’s decline in the mid-1960s. The behavioral sciences, the paper argues, were a social and intellectual formation with a mission—a movement, in other words. They were U.S. sociologists, political scientists, psychologists, and anthropologists, joined by a small number of like-minded economists. Most them had worked alongside one another in the World War II propaganda and morale bureaucracy, and were soon brought back together in the early Cold War by foundations and the military funders. They defined themselves against what they saw as a pre-scientific, speculative, meliorist social science, and—to a significant if lesser extent—against the emerging mainstream of postwar economics. Their aim was to promote an alternative vision for social science, one characterized by scientific rigor, nomothetic theory-building, and a broadly empiricist picture of knowledge accumulation. They aspired to fold mathematics into their methodological toolkits. They embraced the view that team-based interdisciplinary projects centered on applied problems could contribute to theoretical progress. They were a small, tight-knit community of American social scientists, clustered at elite institutions and in relative generational synchrony. Their movement, owing to shifts in patronage, the scale of the U.S. university system, and revelations about clandestine ties to the U.S. national security state, was in sharp decline by the mid-1960s.",

We examine the implementation of this model in a sociology course co-led by a faculty member, a community leader, and a staff member with project management expertise. The course equally emphasized academic learning, relationship building, and community-based work, balancing student outcomes with the community partner’s vision. Findings suggest enhanced student learning, deeper social justice engagement, and tangible community outcomes, although course organization, and continuity remained challenges.

More specifically, we test whether serious games can influence individual opinion formation on complex issues, such as the energy transition, arguing that the immersive nature of a serious game may be more effective than conventional information treatments in triggering learning effects and ultimately influencing opinion formation. Based on our results, we show that playing the game did not, on a general level, produce any significant effects on either efficacy or policy support. However, the game led to varying reactions among players and influenced support for expanding specific energy sources in accordance with the game’s implications. In light of these nuanced results, we discuss implications for researches and stakeholders.",

          "abstract": "Mixed-origin individuals constitute a key group in assimilation theory, but their socioeconomic attainments are curiously under-researched in the quantitative assimilation literature. Drawing on population-wide Norwegian register data, we analyze how children of mixed origin fare in education compared to children of two immigrant parents, using their native majority peers as a reference. When it comes to educational achievements, we find that children of mixed origin are located between a disadvantaged second generation and the native majority. However, once parental SES is accounted for, the second generation exhibits significantly higher achievements, revealing an advantage that is absent among children of mixed origin. When it comes to educational ambitions, the second generation is advantaged in both absolute and relative terms and, once again, we find no such advantage among children of mixed origin. There are essential variations across country backgrounds. Still, the overall pattern suggests that while children of mixed origin ‘catch up’ to natives in terms of educational achievements, they lose their ‘edge’ vis-à-vis the second generation, particularly in terms of ambitions. This conclusion has important implications for theoretical models of how assimilation processes unfold and warrants further research into patterns of assimilation among the growing mixed-origin population.",

          "abstract": "Data donation studies are increasingly used to enrich survey data with digital behavioral data, but evidence on who participates - and who does not - remains mixed and difficult to generalize. This study explores the potential of enriching an election survey with donated Google Search data during the 2025 German federal election. Using a Bivariate Probit Model with Partial Observability, we model participation as a two-stage process, examining both willingness to participate and actual completion. We further test whether explicitly naming Google in the invitation affects participation.\nIn line with prior work, younger individuals were more likely to opt in and complete the study. Gender differences were limited to willingness, and no systematic variation by education was observed. Naming Google in the invitation affected willingness, but not completion. Notably, we examine participation by party vote, contributing to a better understanding of participation by political leaning. Voters of the Green Party were more willing to participate and together with FDP voters, also more likely to complete the donation, controlling for age, gender, and education. This may indicate a political skew in donated data, as these voter groups tend to be younger, more liberal, and possibly more trusting of science.",

          "abstract": "Robotic surgical systems have advanced from assisted devices to semi-autonomous platforms capable of independent procedural actions. Yet healthcare organizations continue to manage these systems as conventional capital equipment, creating a widening gap between technological capability and administrative readiness. This paper argues that the dominant bottleneck in realizing value from surgical robotics is not clinical capability but managerial unpreparedness. Drawing on socio-technical systems theory, high-reliability organization principles, and dynamic capabilities frameworks, we propose that surgical robotics should be conceptualized as a complex adaptive system requiring coordinated governance across six interdependent domains: strategic oversight, financial management, workforce configuration, operational integration, risk and liability structures, and data governance. We introduce the Robotic Surgical Administrative Readiness (RSAR) framework to guide organizational assessment and strategic planning. Synthesizing recent literature on surgical robotics integration, the paper concludes that failures in robotic surgery will increasingly be managerial failures, and that healthcare technology management must evolve from a support function to a strategic governance role. We outline a research agenda for empirical validation and discuss policy implications for accreditation and capital oversight.",

          "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.",

          "authors": "Mike McLeod",
          "abstract": "The UK grassroots music venue sector faces an existential crisis, with venue numbers declining from 960 in 2014 to 810 by 2025, representing a 16% contraction over just eleven years. Whilst sector-specific reports document this decline through economic metrics and policy analyses, such fragmented approaches obscure the systemic nature of the crisis. This paper applies Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework to integrate longitudinal data from Music Venue Trust annual reports (2014–2025), parliamentary inquiries, and case studies into a comprehensive diagnosis of system vulnerability. The analysis reveals that venue fragility emerges not from isolated market failures but from cross-subsystem interactions: insecure property rights (93% tenancy with 18-month average leases) interact with gentrification pressures and noise complaint enforcement to create reinforcing feedback loops driving accelerating decline. Two critical feedback mechanisms are quantified: (1) a gentrification death spiral where cultural venues attract residents, raising property values and rents until venues close, eliminating the cultural amenity; and (2) an arena substitution effect where venue loss reduces touring route viability, concentrating performances in large venues and further eroding grassroots revenue. System dynamics modelling projects critical thresholds: below approximately 700 venues, regional touring becomes unviable; below 600 venues, the national touring circuit collapses entirely. The sector approaches these thresholds within 5–10 years under current trajectories. Governance analysis against Ostrom's design principles reveals fundamental institutional failures, scoring just 46% compliance, with critical gaps in proportional benefit-sharing (Principle 2: 0.5/3) and rights recognition (Principle 7: 0.5/3). Scenario modelling demonstrates that whilst financial interventions (levy, VAT reduction) provide necessary relief, only structural governance reforms—particularly community ownership models, statutory Agent of Change protections, and collective-choice arrangements—can shift the system from degradation to recovery pathways. This integrated SES analysis reveals leverage points invisible in sectoral studies and provides strategic guidance for adaptive governance interventions before irreversible tipping points are reached.",

          "abstract": "This paper presents a formal methodological framework for diagnosing and addressing challenges within urban music ecosystems, with a focused application to small venue resilience. Building upon the integrated ecological framework for popular music studies established in Waxing Ecological (McLeod, 2024), this work translates ecological theory into a structured analytical protocol. I adapt and operationalise Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework—including its core subsystems, multi-tiered variables, and design principles for commons governance—to model the complex interdependencies characterising urban music ecologies. The methodology integrates insights from Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory to account for non-linear dynamics, emergence, and feedback. It provides researchers and policymakers with a replicable, stepwise process for system mapping, variable identification, resilience assessment, and the design of adaptive, polycentric governance strategies. While demonstrated through the critical problem of small venue sustainability, the framework is designed as a flexible diagnostic toolkit for a wide range of problem sets within cultural ecosystems, moving decisively from ecological metaphor to rigorous socio-ecological analysis.\n\nA companion paper (McLeod, 2026) demonstrates the full empirical application of this six-phase protocol to the UK's grassroots music venue ecosystem using Music Venue Trust longitudinal data (2014–2025).",

          "abstract": "The October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks against Israel (10/7) represented the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. However, almost immediately after the attacks, celebrations of the pogrom and protests against Israel broke out in cities around the Western world. The author argues that the upward sweep of antisemitism witnessed since 10/7 cannot be satisfactorily explained in terms of radicalization or simplistic stage models. By definition, radicalization is an increase in extremist attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions relative to default societal norms. Thus, the radicalization hypothesis implies that the output of radicalization (in this case, antisemitism) is not normalized. This is unambiguously contradicted by evidence collected from Jewish victims of antisemitism before and after 10/7. Taken together, the evidence indicates that antisemitism has been renormalizing long before 10/7 and it is that process which set the preconditions for its explosive rise witnessed after 10/7. There is a danger in misattributing the current wave of antisemitism to radicalization as such explanations can inadvertently serve to minimize the breadth and severity of the problem.",

          "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention. While MAHA espouses some positions supported by peer-reviewed research (e.g., ultraprocessed foods are harmful to health) it simultaneously promotes scientifically dubious claims (e.g., vaccines are dangerous). How can social scientists make sense of these incongruent positions surrounding public health, science, and risk? To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration. It finds that key MAHA actors root their claims in a “populist science” that speaks the language of science while claiming to disembed knowledge systems from corrupt institutions that harm ordinary people. By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics. Rather than democratize risk governance, MAHA substitutes one set of institutional authorities for another. The paper demonstrates how science populism functions as a governance strategy that reconfigures the boundaries of legitimate expertise to align with nationalist and anti-regulatory politics.",

This Article introduces an analytical and diagnostic framework that distinguishes primary vulnerability, defined as observable care needs, from vicarious vulnerability, defined as the cumulative exposure borne by caregivers when care is weakly shared or institutionally buffered. Using harmonized cross‑national indicators, we construct transparent indices of primary vulnerability, vicarious vulnerability, and societal capacity to sustain care, and map their alignment across countries. The results reveal systematic mismatches between care needs, caregiver exposure, and institutional capacity, with caregiver burdens more frequently exceeding what existing systems absorb. The contribution is diagnostic rather than causal: by rendering caregiver exposure statistically visible, the framework provides tools for comparative research on productivity, inequality, and institutional design, and for identifying structural vulnerabilities that remain hidden in standard economic and development metrics.",

Mirroring real-world debates that pit stricter climate protection against economic prosperity, we assess mutual affect between individuals on either side of this division, and estimate polarization across the full attitudinal spectrum. Across all countries, we find significant affective polarization with a clear asymmetric pattern: pro-climate citizens express clear in-group warmth and out-group coldness, whereas pro-growth citizens show little affective opposition and in some cases even evaluate climate-oriented individuals more positively than their own group. Moreover, affective polarization among pro-climate respondents is not associated with reduced political tolerance. These findings suggest that mass affective polarization over climate action is less entrenched than elite discourse implies.",

          "authors": "Fabio Anobile; Alberto Costantiello; Carlo Drago; Massimo Arnone; Angelo Leogrande",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the connection between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors and the risk of geopolitics, as defined by the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) index. The concept of geopolitical risk is conventionally defined as the direct result of political incidents, war, and international tensions. The current study argues that the concept should be understood in a more structural and sustainable manner, relating to the underlying forces driving geopolitical risk. The main research question is whether and how the three pillars of the ESG factors contribute to the explanation and understanding of cross-country and over-time variations in geopolitical risk. In an effort to avoid the information losses associated with the aggregate nature of the ESG index, the three factors are considered separately and the three pillars are analyzed individually. The empirical context is a balanced cross-country panel data set including 42 countries over the 2000-2023 time period. The data for the three factors is obtained from the World Bank dataset in an effort to standardize and compare the data in a cross-country and cross-time manner. The GPR index is used to measure the level of geopolitical risk and is defined by Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello. The GPR index captures the level of geopolitical tensions based on the analysis of media signals. The combination of the three sources allows for the direct connection and correlation between the three factors and the internationally recognized GPR index. The paper uses an integrated methodological approach that combines the results from three different approaches. The first method uses panel data analysis in an effort to identify the average marginal effects while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The second method uses the technique of clustering in an effort to identify structural patterns and divide the countries into groups based on their unique characteristics and risk profiles. The third method uses machine learning regressions and nonparametric analysis in an effort to capture the complex relationships and interactions in the data. The three-step method is used for each pillar in an effort to ensure consistency and comparability. The results suggest that the three factors contribute to the GPR index in a unique manner. The environment and energy structure contribute to the GPR index as a risk multiplier, the social factor is related to the exposure to instability, and the governance factor is a central stabilizing factor. The paper makes a unique contribution to the literature by defining the concept of the three factors and their relationship to the GPR index in a unique and sustainable manner.",

          "abstract": "Comparable questionnaire translation is essential for drawing valid conclusions in cross-cultural survey research. Sound translation methodology, including the use of adequate personnel, is seen as crucial for reaching this goal (Harkness 2003). Recommended methodology should be empirically backed and stay tuned to latest developments, such as machine translation. Against this backdrop, to investigate the potential effect of varied translators’ backgrounds and machine translation on the statistical properties of surveys, we conducted an experiment in which an English questionnaire was translated into German by 16 professional translators and 16 social scientists; translations were subsequently fielded in web surveys. We introduced two translation conditions: translation from scratch and post-editing (machine translation corrected by a human translator). To investigate the quality of the survey data from these 32 translation versions (approx. 250 responses each), we use standardized mean distance and Cohen’s d with the official translation as a benchmark. We have four key findings: First, the resulting statistical means of the survey items vary, sometimes substantially, across translations. Second, post-editing is associated with a reduced gap between the survey data from the experimental questionnaires and the official translation, and it also lowers the variability among different translations. Third, when translating from scratch, social scientists are more likely to produce translations leading to statistical outliers of survey data. Fourth, post-editing can lead to systematic bias for both social scientists and professional translators if translation errors made by the machine are not identified and corrected. This study highlights to what extent decisions concerning the choice of translators and the integration of machine translation can impact the statistical properties of survey data. We offer evidence to implement recommendations for good practices in translation protocols to enhance data comparability in cross-cultural studies.",

          "abstract": "This study presents a structured taxonomy of 72 distinct arguments opposing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, organized into 9 categories and derived through a systematic, Large Language Model-assisted methodology. It distinguishes between substantive arguments, addressing moral and political claims, and institutional arguments, focused on governance, legality, and policy outcomes. Drawing primarily on Canadian academic case studies, the paper analyzes how different types of arguments influence success or failure in campus debates. The taxonomy offers researchers, policymakers, and advocates a comprehensive framework for understanding and evaluating anti-BDS reasoning in academic and organizational contexts.",

          "abstract": "Whether natural hazards raise redistributive demands remains poorly understood. I argue that the distinction between taking from the rich and giving to the poor is essential to understand the impact of disasters. I expect natural disasters to not spark demands to “soak the rich” because their unfair advantage is less visible than is the case after other economic shocks. I theorize natural hazards raise demands to redistribute to the poor because these events force close experiences with socio-economic others. Combining variation in exposure to Japan’s 2011 devastating earthquake with representative panel data, results are consistent with my propositions. Even though beliefs in the role of luck increased across the board, demands to redistribute from the rich decreased after the disaster and demands for pro-poor redistribution increased in affected areas. These findings set natural hazards apart from other types of economic shocks such as job loss, financial crises, or mass warfare.",

          "authors": "Joshua Konstantinos",
          "abstract": "Prior studies of young adult sexlessness have reached conflicting conclusions: GSS-based \nanalyses found rising male sexlessness, while NSFG-based studies found no male-specific trend. \nThis study reconciles these findings through three innovations: (1) distinguishing virginity \n(delayed sexual debut affecting both genders symmetrically) from dry spells (zero partners \namong the sexually experienced, which diverged by gender); (2) identifying and explaining a \nmeasurement anomaly in the 2017-2019 NSFG wave using stock measure analysis; and (3) \ndocumenting the distributional mechanism underlying the gap. Using difference-in-differences \ndesigns applied to the General Social Survey (GSS) and National Survey of Family Growth \n(NSFG), both yield convergent evidence of a post-2012 widening of the male-female partnership \ngap. The GSS shows a 10.6 percentage point increase in the male-female sexlessness gap for 18\n24 year-olds (p = .024). The NSFG shows a 6.2 percentage point widening in dry spells among \nthe sexually experienced (p = .014). The 2017-2019 NSFG wave shows an anomalous \ncompression of this gap, but analysis of lifetime partner counts—a stock measure that should not \nshow wave-to-wave reversals—reveals this reflects reporting bias rather than a true behavioral \nchange; digit heaping analysis confirms this interpretation, showing a male-specific reduction in \nreports at round high numbers (p &lt; .001). Within-wave timing analysis shows the gender gap \ninverts during peak #MeToo intensity (Oct 2017–Mar 2018: −5.5 pp) before recovering in late \n2018–2019 (+2.3 pp). The methodological difference between surveys (GSS uses self\nadministered questionnaires; NSFG uses face-to-face interviews with exclusively female \ninterviewers) explains why this reporting artifact affects NSFG but not GSS. Among never\nmarried adults aged 25-34, the male “moderate middle” (3-5 lifetime partners) collapsed by 8.8 \npercentage points while women’s distribution remained stable, with men bifurcating into \nexclusion (1-2 partners) and modest concentration (6-9 partners).",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how emotions shape the psychological processes underlying the correction of political misperceptions and how the source of corrective information interacts with these emotional dynamics. Using two scenario-based survey experiments conducted in the US and UK (N=3,610), we examine the effects of corrective information about the anthropogenic causes of climate change when delivered by either experts or citizens’ assemblies. We find that corrective information consistently elicits heightened negative emotions (e.g., anger, frustration, anxiety) and suppresses positive emotions (e.g., happiness, enthusiasm). Importantly, only two discrete emotions—anxiety and empathy—significantly predict greater willingness to revise misperceptions. Contrary to expectations, the source of corrective information does not produce differential emotional or behavioural effects. These findings advance understanding of the emotional mechanisms influencing misperception correction, highlight the nuanced role of specific emotions in shaping corrective behaviour, and contribute to the literature on citizen-centred political institutions and their public influence. Our results have broader implications for research on the emotional foundations of political beliefs and opinion formation in polarized contexts.",

We then use fMRI-based physiological measures to validate that our interventions elicit the intended cognitions. Finally, using randomized assignments of treatments as instruments for cognitions, we identify the causal effects of cognitions on choice using a 2SLS approach. We show that endowment-driven valuation shifts explain default nudges, suggesting that policy designs should leverage this mechanism.",

          "authors": "Axl Kokubun",
          "abstract": "The paper analyses the breakup of Yugoslavia, the escalation of the Bosnian war, and the evolution of international peace diplomacy, in order to clarify the political and military conditions that led to the 1995 Dayton Accords. It argues that Yugoslavia’s collapse stemmed not from a simple state breakup but from the interaction of complex ethnic configurations, deep economic crisis, and nationalist mobilisation by political elites, especially hardline Serbian nationalism which shattered federal cohesion and made Bosnia and Herzegovina’s multiethnic landscape a focal point of violent contestation and international concern. Comparing Slovenia and Croatia, where ethnic homogeneity, limited territorial objectives, and early international recognition facilitated relatively short conflicts, with Bosnia, where highly mixed populations and overlapping territorial claims produced protracted, all‑out war, the paper shows why Bosnia required full‑scale external intervention. Humanitarian and strategic crises such as the Sarajevo siege, the Srebrenica massacre, and mass displacement exposed the powerlessness of traditional UN peacekeeping and the ineffectiveness of diplomacy without credible force. The study then traces how fragmented and militarily unsupported early initiatives by the UN, EU, and the United States gradually gave way, under the pressure of changing battlefield dynamics, sanctions, domestic politics in Western states, and U.S. congressional pressure to a more unified Western strategy that combined military pressure with coercive diplomacy. It highlights the decisive role of active U.S. engagement, which shifted from conflict management to conflict resolution and leveraged the interests of Milošević, Tuđman, and Izetbegović to push negotiations forward. Overall, the thesis concludes that the Bosnian conflict was structurally produced by intertwined domestic and international factors, and that an effective peace settlement became possible only when military and diplomatic instruments were aligned under a strategy capable of exerting clear coercive leverage, offering broader lessons about the possibilities and limits of international intervention in civil wars.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the underexplored impact of violence against politicians on citizens’ acceptance of violence and their willingness to engage in politics. By focusing on citizens, it addresses a critical gap in research, which has largely emphasized how violence affects politicians rather than the public. While existing studies demonstrate that political violence influences politicians’ behavior and discourse, impacting representative elements of democracy, there is limited insight into how such incidents shape citizens’ engagement after learning about violence. Although citizens generally condemn violence against politicians in the abstract, it remains unclear whether their own political engagement is impacted and varies based on the target of the incident. We theorize that the impact of violence against political figures on political engagement varies by (1) partisanship; (2) political role (elite or activist) and (3) the gender of the victim. Additionally, we examine the potential mediating roles of fear and anger on political participation. Based on a survey experiment in both Belgium and the Netherlands (n = 3.139) we find no demobilizing effect of learning about political violence. In fact, we find a small mobilizing effect when the target belongs to the political in-group of the party. This mobilizing effect is likely to be mediated by anger.",

Dynamics of safety net usage among first-time mothers are well-documented, but little is known about how new mothers coordinate work and public benefits together. In this research, we study population-level employment and social safety net program participation among new mothers by linking birth records in Oregon between 2016 and 2017 to wage and program enrollment data from 2014 through 2019. Following new mothers for two years before and after their childbirth, we find a significant decrease in mothers’ employment in the quarters surrounding childbirth with a corresponding surge in reliance on safety net benefits. We also find that education, marital status, and income level were key determinants of shaping work and safety net usage patterns among first-time mothers. These shifts were especially pronounced among low socioeconomic status women, who demonstrate greater responsiveness in employment and safety net utilization around the time of birth. Our findings point to the importance of integrating both work and safety net program participation and demonstrate gaps where additional work-supports and safety net engagement would promote economic security.",

          "authors": "Bernard Koch; David Peterson",
          "abstract": "Evaluation systems are central organizing institutions in science that coordinate consensus and drive epistemic trajectories. Scientific fields have traditionally relied on \"organic\" evaluation systems (e.g., peer review, citation) where consensus emerges gradually across multiple epistemic values. This paper highlights artificial intelligence research (AIR) as a potent counterpoint to this model. Drawing on interviews with key actors, computational analyses, and archival materials spanning AIR’s history (1956–2021), we examine how AI evolved from a discipline with weak organic evaluation into a field driven by benchmarking, a “formal” evaluation system that defines progress quantitatively as state-of-the-art accuracy on commercial tasks. We demonstrate that benchmarking came to dominate through an intricate symbiosis with deep learning: benchmarking rewards accuracy, which large-scale deep learning uniquely excelled at, while deep learning’s opacity made organic evaluation increasingly difficult. This symbiosis restructured the field organizationally, epistemically, and materially into a “monoculture” dedicated to scaling. While enabling breakneck progress, monoculture discouraged exploration of alternatives with different epistemic strengths. As AI spreads to other knowledge fields (from science to law to art) benchmarking will accompany it. Our findings thus highlight the risk that formalization of evaluation can lead to monoculture in other creative domains.",

          "authors": "Roberto Garrone",
          "abstract": "This paper situates contemporary geopolitical discourse within the political economy of uncertainty. It examines how fear, identity mobilisation, and narrative simplification function not merely as distortions of rational policy-making, but as instrumental resources through which institutions legitimate authority, mobilise resources, and coordinate behaviour under conditions of perceived systemic transition.\n\nDrawing on political psychology, international relations theory, and strategic studies, the analysis proceeds in three steps. First, it identifies recurrent cognitive and social patterns that tend to become salient under uncertainty, including worst-case reasoning, in-group consolidation, narrative dominance, and ambiguity reduction. Second, it examines how these patterns may be amplified to serve specific institutional objectives, such as emergency legitimation, deterrence signalling, and the normalisation of structural change. A contemporary illustration drawn from transatlantic tensions over Greenland is used to clarify how cross-domain linkage between security and economic instruments can accelerate these dynamics within alliance systems.\n\nFinally, the paper advances a theoretical synthesis spanning classical and contemporary war theory. It proposes that while the political nature of war identified by Carl von Clausewitz remains analytically relevant, its dominant mode of operation has increasingly shifted toward what is termed cognitive governance: the management of fear, expectations, and legitimacy at the population level. The paper concludes by outlining analytically derived, policy-relevant conditions under which institutions may preserve strategic realism while reintroducing reversibility into fear-based governance, thereby mitigating long-run risks of institutional erosion and permanent emergency politics. The paper does not provide empirical testing, causal estimation, or predictive claims; its contribution is analytical and conceptual.",

          "abstract": "International education research often emphasizes economic, academic, or structural factors shaping student mobility, yet such approaches insufficiently capture the psychological meanings students attach to prestigious foreign institutions. This qualitative study examines how Korean undergraduate and graduate students construct self-concepts and future-oriented identities when deciding to pursue higher education in the United States. Drawing on identity-based motivation theory, self-concept and possible selves, and consumer identity perspectives, the study conceptualizes elite U.S. universities as prestige brands that carry symbolic value beyond academic instruction. Based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with Korean students enrolled at U.S. universities, thematic analysis reveals that participants understood university choice as a means of enacting aspirational elite or global identities, signaling social status, and securing social recognition and belonging. Seven interrelated themes capture how educational decisions were shaped by relational self-concepts, collective family expectations, prior academic and cross-cultural experiences, perceived career security, desires for autonomy and meaningful learning, negotiations over cost and sacrifice, and the branding power of U.S. institutions as signals of global competence. The findings suggest that international higher education functions as an identity-driven practice embedded in cultural expectations, social comparison, and symbolic hierarchies. This study contributes an integrative perspective that advances understanding of motivation, stratification, and identity in international higher education decision-making.\n\nNote: This is a preprint version.

This study examines their distributional effects using individual asset data from the DNB Household Survey and cross-country portfolio information from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey.

Counterfactual simulations indicate that inequality remains stable under the Dutch status quo. However, rising returns or increased return heterogeneity amplify inequality, particularly if participation gaps persist. Broadening financial market participation mitigates these effects and reduces long-term uncertainty in wealth inequality trends. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)",

This study examines the cost–benefit dynamics of investing in occupational safety programs relative to the financial burdens associated with workplace injuries. Using quantitative analysis, industry benchmarks, and an applied case study, the research evaluates the return on investment (ROI) of proactive safety interventions. Findings demonstrate that comprehensive safety programs reduce the frequency and severity of workplace injuries while generating measurable financial benefits, including lower insurance costs, reduced absenteeism, and improved operational efficiency. Although safety initiatives require upfront investment, the results show that proactive interventions consistently outweigh injury-related costs and deliver substantial long-term economic advantages. The study further highlights the strategic importance of integrating safety management into organizational decision-making, emphasizing its role in enhancing economic performance, workforce sustainability, and organizational resilience.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This article explains why fertility has remained persistently low across heterogeneous\nsocieties despite policy interventions.\nBackground: Across heterogeneous late-modern societies, fertility has converged to sub\nreplacement levels. Existing explanations emphasize shifting values, gender norms, social policy,\nor diffusion mechanisms, but they pay less attention to how non-parenthood becomes both\ncommunicatively legitimate and structurally probable. Luhmannian systems theory offers tools\nto analyze how increasing functional differentiation reshapes the conditions under which\nreproduction is decided and coordinated.\nMethod: The article develops a conceptual model informed by Luhmannian systems theory. It\nexamines how intimate interaction systems are structurally coupled with economic, educational,\nlegal, political, and medical systems, and how these couplings generate temporal\ndesynchronization between individual reproductive windows and institutional time. The analysis\nsynthesizes demographic trends and policy debates to illustrate the argument.\nResults: Functional differentiation decouples intimacy from multifunctional family roles and\nmakes reproduction structurally optional. As temporal misalignments deepen, the probability of\nsuccessful coordination for childbearing decreases, especially under high educational and career\ndemands. Because family policies operate as programs within other systems’ binary codes, their\nimpact remains modest and context-dependent and cannot fully re-synchronize divergent time\nstructures.\nConclusion: Persistently low fertility emerges from system autonomy and temporal\nmisalignment across function systems, which helps explain why durable fertility rebounds are\nunlikely under current structural conditions.",

          "abstract": "We introduce a new source for the study of the kinship networks and careers of local officials in China in the late Qing, that is the late 19th and early 20th century. These officials constituted a local bureaucratic and educational elite, but compared with elite officials, relatively little is known about their characteristics, including their family backgrounds and kin networks. To study them, we have constructed a new dataset from Tongguanlu rosters of officials that include their resumes, degree or other qualifications and rosters of their kin and are available for officials in a variety of locations in China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Information for officials includes not only the names and degrees held by patrilineal father, grandfather, and great-grandfather commonly recorded for elite examination degree holders that have been studied previously, but detailed information about uncles, great-uncles, male cousins, sons, and nephews, and basic information about female kin including mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers, daughters. In contrast with other sources that only include holders of elite exam degrees, Tongguanlu include holders of purchased Jiansheng and Tribute (Gongsheng) degrees, low-level prefectural degrees Shengyuan, and other qualifications. We provide background on the Tongguanlu as a source, describe how we constructed the dataset, summarize its contents, and then present results on the posts, qualifications, and kin networks of local officials. We show that holders of purchased degrees and low-level Shengyuan examination degrees were less likely than holders of higher degrees to come from families with a history of holding degrees, and that officials with regular appointments were more likely to have kin with degrees than officials with acting appointments, or who were expectant officials.",

          "title": "Releasing a Trojan Horse: How Government Parties Use Social Media to Influence the Opposition’s Agenda in Parliament",
          "authors": "Daniel Sandvej Eriksen",
          "abstract": "Agenda setting is pivotal to democratic politics and remains in constant flux. With the rise of social media, many argue that political communication has increasingly migrated to these platforms, overshadowing traditional venues like parliament. However, the interplay between social media and the parliamentary venue remains poorly underswtood, even though understanding this relationship is crucial for grasping behavior in both contexts. In this paper, I argue that agendas initiated on social media can find their way into parliamentary discussions. However, while discussion in parliament is among opposition actors’ prime means of confronting the government with its ideas, such discussions carry higher stakes for government actors, making parliamentary talk less cheap for them. This dynamic creates an unexpected opportunity: Government parties can leverage social media to initiate new agendas that opposition parties subsequently introduce into parliamentary debates. In contrast, opposition parties cannot similarly employ social media to force government responses in parliament. Utilizing an original dataset of over 5.5 million tweets by parties and politicians, 400,000 parliamentary questions, and 750,000 news articles from the United Kingdom and Denmark (2015–2022), I employ state-of-the-art automated content analysis techniques. The findings support the proposed ideas. Together, these insights underscore the dynamic interplay between digital platforms and the legislative venue, calling for a renewed understanding of agenda setting in a hybrid communication environment where the boundaries between social media and parliament are increasingly blurred.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms play a central role in shaping today’s information ecosystem, yet access to both their internal data and even publicly visible content remains tightly restricted for academic researchers. This stands in sharp contrast to other industries such as food and pharmaceuticals where researchers can independently study product ingredients and effects. As a result, academic research on social media faces an unprecedented dependency on industry-controlled data, increasing the risk of bias and potentially distorting the evidence needed for effective regulation and policymaking. Drawing on research from other disciplines, we examine how industry influence operates and how researchers’ reliance on platforms for data may amplify industry influence. We identify four challenges in collaborations between researchers and social media platforms: restricted data access, selective funding, hard-to-detect influence, and institutional entanglements. These challenges risk undermining the independence and transparency of research in a field of growing societal relevance. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to regulate data access, as illustrated by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates data access for vetted researchers while safeguarding user privacy. In addition, new independent funding mechanisms could help ensure that research agendas remain free from platform interests. In parallel, the social science community must adopt stronger ethical standards and invest in “research on research” to detect and mitigate potential biases in policy-relevant research. With a dual approach – policy reforms and critical academic debates – we can ensure that research on social media platforms serves the public interest rather than platform priorities.",

          "abstract": "Climate change has often been characterized as humanity's greatest threat. However, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) may cause technological risks to materialize more rapidly than many climate impacts. This raises fundamental questions for the climate community. How should climate professionals address the potential for AI systems to automate cognitive tasks? How might dramatic technological transformation over shorter timescales affect the relative value of near-term versus long-term research priorities? Drawing on recent developments in AI capabilities, expert forecasting, and risk assessment, I suggest three broad scenarios to guide our thinking about AI development and its implications for climate research. Rather than advocating for any single response, I explore how climate professionals might thoughtfully prepare for multiple possible futures while maintaining commitment to addressing the climate crisis. The analysis considers potential adjustments to research communication, graduate education, and collaborative engagement with the AI safety community, while acknowledging the significant uncertainties inherent in technological forecasting. These questions have no easy answers, but they warrant serious consideration as the climate research community navigates unprecedented technological change alongside ongoing environmental challenges.",

          "authors": "Ibrahim Said Arinc",
          "abstract": "This article examines critical mineral supply chains through a geo-economic and governance-oriented lens, drawing on Global Value Chain (GVC) theory and insights from asymmetric interdependence. It argues that supply vulnerabilities extend beyond geological endowment and extraction, increasingly reflecting coordination failures across transnational value chains, particularly at midstream and downstream stages involving refining, processing, logistics, certification, and regulatory alignment. While existing scholarship has largely treated hydrocarbon corridors and critical mineral supply risks as separate domains, limited attention has been paid to corridor-based governance arrangements capable of coordinating extraction, transit, processing, and market access across Eurasia.\nThe study adopts a qualitative, policy-oriented methodology combining conceptual analysis, review of institutional and policy frameworks, and an embedded case study of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC serves as an institutional reference to examine how geographically connected actors, including Central Asian producers, Azerbaijan, Türkiye, and European markets, have managed asymmetric interdependence through long-term cooperation, intergovernmental frameworks, and coordinated state and commercial participation.\nBuilding on these insights, the article develops a corridor-based governance perspective for Eurasian critical mineral supply chains. It conceptualizes the Eurasian Critical Minerals Corridor not as an existing institutional structure, but as an analytical framework for examining how variable-geometry cooperation can structure interdependence, reduce exposure to value-chain vulnerabilities, and support more resilient supply arrangements. In doing so, the article advances a governance-centered interpretation of critical mineral supply chains and demonstrates how institutional lessons from energy corridors can inform policy debates on critical mineral security and the political economy of the energy transition.",

          "abstract": "Personal networks influence health and mortality at the individual level, but less is known about how population-scale social network structure relates to mortality. This study examines how US county-level social network structure relates to mortality disparities. Using measures from 21 billion Facebook friendships, we investigate how two structural features of population social networks – cohesiveness and diversity – are associated with age-standardized and age-specific mortality rates. Bivariate results show that measures of social network structure rival smoking rates, median income, and educational attainment in their association with mortality rates. Social network structure remains predictive of mortality even after controlling for traditional measures like socioeconomic status and rural/urban classification. Network diversity is\nassociated with lower mortality in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Network clustering is associated with higher mortality bivariately, but this association reverses after controlling for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, revealing a protective effect masked by confounding. Age-stratified analyses further complicate this picture, showing that clustering predicts lower mortality among adults aged 15-64 but higher mortality among those 70 and older. These findings highlight social network structure as an important dimension of place-based health disparities, one not fully captured by conventional measures of socioeconomic composition or spatial segregation.",

Ökonomisch betrachtet ist Journalismus ein Gut mit ausgeprägten positiven Externalitäten, da sich ein erheblicher Teil seines gesellschaftlichen Nutzens nicht in der individuellen Zahlungsbereitschaft widerspiegelt. Empirische Forschung, insbesondere zu sogenannten „Nachrichtenwüsten“, zeigt, dass der Rückgang von (lokalem) Journalismus mit geringerer Wahlbeteiligung, steigender politischer Polarisierung, sinkendem politischen Wissen sowie schwächerer politischer und wirtschaftlicher Kontrolle einhergeht. Dieser gesellschaftliche Nutzen entsteht in wesentlichen Teilen durch positive Externalitäten und führt zu einer Unterversorgung mit Journalismus. Die Digitalisierung hat dieses Problem verschärft, da sie traditionelle Erlösmodelle (insbesondere durch Werbung und Anzeigen) untergräbt und die wirtschaftliche Verwertbarkeit journalistischer Inhalte erschwert.

          "authors": "Joshua Konstantinos",
          "abstract": "The majority of the widely-discussed “sex recession” reflects a symmetric rise in virginity \naffecting both genders equally. A companion paper, however, documented an additional \nasymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the \nsexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that \nasymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on \nnever-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated \nmeaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and \nrestricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in \nbroader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital \nselection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the \nshare of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) \nbetween 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category \n(exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. \nThe upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting \nconcentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. \nBecause this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme \nupper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to \nanalyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather \nthan upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes \nevenly into exclusion and concentration.",

          "authors": "Max Reichert; Alzbeta Bartova; Tom Emery",
          "abstract": "This study examines when parents across Europe begin using formal childcare and how the timing of entry is socially stratified by socioeconomic resources, employment, and informal care availability.  Childcare services are central to work–family reconciliation and gender equality. Existing research focuses primarily on whether families use childcare, largely overlooking when they do so. But timing matters because institutional entitlements only translate into real opportunities when households can convert them into use at specific points after childbirth. Using harmonized EU-SILC data from 22 European countries (2003–2020), this study estimates age-specific probabilities of formal childcare use during the first four years after birth. An analysis with matched longitudinal data complements thus study to assess the stability of childcare use once initiated. Formal childcare use rises steeply with child age but displays pronounced social stratification. Higher maternal education, stronger labor-market attachment, and higher household income are associated with substantially earlier entry into formal care. Informal childcare acts as a key substitute, delaying formal entry. Cross-national differences in usage levels and timing are large. Longitudinal results show that once families enter formal childcare, exit is rare. Inequality in childcare use is fundamentally temporal. Advantaged parents convert institutional entitlements into earlier and longer use, while less resourceful households enter later, reinforcing cumulative inequalities in employment trajectories and early childhood environments.",

While these developments have loosely defined what constitutes the modern subfield of evolutionary archaeology, we argue that many of its premises fail to sufficiently engage with insights from fields such as ethnoarchaeology or explore theoretical and methodological consequences dictated by the nature of the observational data that archaeologists deal with. Here, we critically review the field of evolutionary archaeology, highlighting the relevance of under-discussed behavioural processes and inferential challenges and question what its critical self-consciousness can lead to.",

Despite the presence of ETP equipment in almost all textile industries in Bangladesh, many factories do not operate them regularly because of high maintenance and operational costs (Rahman &amp; Islam 2020). Rapid industrialization has intensified environmental pollution through the discharge of untreated toxic waste (Islam Rahman and Akter 2021). On the other hand, increasing industrialization is contributing to severe pollution of the environment by poisonous waste discharge. The liquid effluents from industries are causing major havoc to the environment, ecology, agriculture, aquaculture, and public health since the development of textile industries in the country. It had become a prerequisite to set up ETP in each industrial establishment, particularly at dyeing industries that were discharging immense amounts of liquid waste to the rivers every day. However, for the successful implementation of ETPs, industry owners will need to be socially responsible. At the same time, the government should provide factory owners with logistical support and a relaxed timeframe to set up ETPs.",

Three weeks before election day, we sent 1,822 candidates links to two high-quality research briefings on the same immigration reform and tracked which evidence they selected. Partisan-aligned selection is concentrated among extreme parties: far-right Freedom Party candidates disproportionately choose aligned evidence, while centrists show more balanced patterns. A contemporaneous survey of citizens shows that far-right supporters approve of elites’ selective attention to evidence, highlighting alignment between elite behavior and mass preferences. These results identify evidence selection as a key stage in policymaking and suggest that rising far-right strength may amplify reliance on supportive information, increasing the risk of ill-informed policy.",

Leveraging the exogenous variation in waiting time for naturalization generated by those two reforms, we find that immigrants who benefited from less restrictive conditions to become citizens developed a stronger national identification with Germany, both after and during their waiting time for naturalization. The effect was particularly strong for women and for those immigrants that were older at the time of their arrival. A higher attachment to Germany seems to have been mainly driven by psychological and socioeconomic mechanisms: a more liberal regime reduced subjective concerns about discrimination, heightened immigrants’ social and political participation, and fostered their use of the German language.",

          "abstract": "The growing use of algorithm based systems to manage employees has transformed how work is organized and controlled in contemporary organizations. Commonly referred to as algorithmic management, this approach relies on automated decision making to allocate tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate employee outcomes. While such systems are often adopted to enhance efficiency, their implications for human work remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the relationship between algorithmic management and key employee outcomes, with a particular focus on employee autonomy, job satisfaction, and performance.\nUsing a quantitative research design, data were collected through an online survey from employees working in algorithmically managed environments. Established measurement scales were employed to assess the study variables, and statistical analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicate that algorithmic management is negatively associated with employee autonomy and job satisfaction, while demonstrating a significant relationship with employee performance. These results suggest that algorithmic management may improve performance related outcomes but can also constrain employees’ sense of control and satisfaction at work.\nThe study contributes to the growing literature on digital and technology-mediated management by highlighting the dual effects of algorithmic management on human work. From a practical perspective, the findings underscore the importance of designing algorithmic systems that balance organizational efficiency with employee well-being. The study also offers directions for future research on the evolving role of algorithms in shaping the future of work.",

          "abstract": "This qualitative research investigates the constitutive role of communicative framing in the production and internalization of economic poverty among urban poor residents in Manila, Philippines. Anchored in the framing theory and situated within a communication-centric analytic paradigm, the study utilizes semi-structured interviews to examine how macro-level discursive formations emanating from state, media, and institutional actors are translated into micro-level interpretive schemas through which marginalized subjects perceive economic deprivation, agency, and futurity. The analysis demonstrates that participants’ narratives are permeated by hegemonic frames of dependency, passivity, and moralized deservingness, which operate as symbolic constraints that delimit perceived economic agency and normalize structural exclusion. The study contends that communication functions not merely as a descriptive or mediating apparatus but as an infrastructural dimension of economic inequality itself, actively configuring the conditions of possibility for economic action. To deepen the paper’s theoretical portability, we introduce the Communicative Architecture of Governed Exclusion (CAGE) as a mid-range framework specifying how poverty is reproduced through 1) classification (what counts as poverty and who counts as poor); 2) access control (administrative and informational gatekeeping), 3) governance through discourse (moralized narratives of deservingness and dependency), and 4) exclusion effects (internalized passivity, “waiting orientation,” and self-limiting economic agency). CAGE clarifies how framing effects become durable social infrastructure—an architecture that governs inclusion and exclusion through everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "What is the relationship between global and local identification, and how is it linked to political conflict? These questions are central to scholarship on contemporary electoral politics, which has linked the radical right’s rise to a new dimension of political conflict separating tolerant, globally minded voters from exclusionary, locally oriented ones. This cleavage, variously described as universalist–particularist, cosmopolitan–parochial, or globalist–nationalist, implies that collective identification is polarized along a global–local axis and helps drive political mobilization. Yet little is known about how different territorial identities compete with or reinforce each other, let alone how their configurations shape political preferences. Using latent class models and survey data from 35 countries, I find that most Europeans are pluralists, who identify across a range of territories and support mainstream parties. A subset of countries, however, exhibits a division between particularists, who emphasize proximal identities, and expansivists, who emphasize distal ones. Remarkably, both groups converge in their strong attachment to the nation. This division overlaps with educational and geographic divides and separates radical-right supporters from those of new left parties like the greens. The findings demonstrate how collective identities reinforce new electoral divisions while challenging influential accounts of the scope and structure of identity-based polarization.",

          "authors": "João Henrique Santana Stacciarini",
          "abstract": "Desde el descubrimiento de la penicilina por Alexander Fleming en 1928, el sector farmacéutico se ha expandido aceleradamente hasta convertirse en uno de los segmentos más poderosos de la economía global, con una facturación anual cercana a US$ 1,5 billones y corporaciones valoradas en cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Aunque los avances científico-tecnológicos y las transformaciones socioeconómicas han impulsado la investigación y el desarrollo de medicamentos, la literatura crítica ha señalado prácticas controvertidas de influencia corporativa — aquí sintetizadas como “Influencia, Desvíos y Excesos”— que favorecen la rentabilidad y la consolidación del poder, en ocasiones en tensión con el interés colectivo y la salud pública. En este contexto, el artículo adopta un diseño exploratorio-descriptivo y un enfoque mixto, basado en la triangulación de datos públicos, documentos institucionales y revisión crítica de la literatura internacional, con el objetivo de mapear los principales mecanismos de influencia corporativa en el sector farmacéutico a partir de ocho ejes: (i) lobby y financiación electoral; (ii) influencia en organismos de regulación y fiscalización; (iii) influencia en organizaciones de pacientes; (iv) participación en la elaboración de guías clínicas; (v) manipulación, promoción y ocultamiento de investigaciones y ensayos clínicos; (vi) escritura fantasma; (vii) estrategias de ampliación diagnóstica y promoción de enfermedades; y (viii) financiación y provisión de beneficios a prescriptores e instituciones, incluyendo dimensiones psicosociales y formativas. Los resultados muestran que la influencia corporativa opera de manera multiescalar y simultáneamente visible y difusa. En el plano político, el lobby y la financiación electoral se consolidan como instrumentos centrales para moldear el entorno normativo y regulatorio. En el ámbito regulatorio, la recurrencia de conflictos de interés y la circulación de profesionales entre agencias públicas y empresas privadas evidencian vulnerabilidades a la captura institucional. En el campo científico, el patrocinio industrial se asocia a sesgos que afectan el diseño de los ensayos, la publicación selectiva de resultados y la credibilidad de las evidencias, incluyendo prácticas como el ghostwriting. Asimismo, se identifica la actuación de la industria en la ampliación diagnóstica y la medicalización de la vida cotidiana, con efectos sobre la invisibilización de determinantes sociales y alternativas no farmacológicas. En la práctica clínica, los pagos y transferencias de valor a profesionales e instituciones se vinculan a cambios en los patrones de prescripción, incremento de costos y favorecimiento de medicamentos promovidos, incluso mediante beneficios de bajo valor mediados por sesgos cognitivos.",

          "authors": "Emanuele Fedeli; Solveig Topstad Borgen; Moris Triventi",
          "abstract": "A longstanding debate in research on peer effects concerns whether exposure to high-achieving classmates enhances or depresses students’ academic performance. While normative models emphasize positive spillovers, social comparison theories highlight negative contrast effects, and empirical evidence remains mixed. Moreover, it is unclear whether peer effects operate similarly across institutional contexts. This study addresses these issues through a comparative analysis of Italy and Norway, two educational systems that differ markedly in competitiveness, tracking, evaluation practices, and gender norms. Using harmonized, population-wide administrative register data, we follow three full student cohorts from Grade 5 to Grade 8. This longitudinal design allows us to control for prior achievement—an advantage unavailable in international assessments such as PISA, TIMSS, or PIRLS. We estimate value-added school fixed-effects models that exploit within-school, across-cohort variation in peer composition. Across both countries, higher average peer achievement is associated with lower individual performance, consistent with social comparison mechanisms. Exposure to top-performing peers has negative effects, while exposure to low-performing peers has positive effects. These patterns are similar across countries and do not vary systematically by gender, suggesting that peer comparison processes are remarkably stable across institutional contexts.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Davis; Hieu Quoc Vo; Thang Le; Dat Cao; Chau My Thi Le; Trung Cao",
          "abstract": "Demand for tiger parts has contributed to a global decline in tiger populations. Tigers are extirpated entirely from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and are severely threatened in extant populations in Southeast Asia. Across the region, tiger farms have been established with the main intent of supplying tigers for consumer demand, e.g. tiger bone glue for medicine. Tiger farms are known to operate within Vietnam and within Nghe An province, the focal area of this study. We interviewed 16 former tiger farmers to understand how they obtained their tigers, how they farmed tigers, why they farmed tigers, why they stopped farming tigers, and their beliefs around environmental policy, tiger conservation, and tiger reintroduction. Tiger cubs were trafficked in from Laos and raised by the tiger farmers to adulthood, at which point the tigers were sold to other individuals who slaughtered the tigers for their parts. We found that most of our sample were aware that tigers are in decline globally, and extinct from Vietnam. Farming was perceived as “easy” and lucrative; however, our sample were no longer raising tigers due to fears of fines and jail time. Our sample were ambivalent about the current environmental policy around farming, but were supportive of reintroduction and stated their desire to see tigers in Vietnam again. While tiger farms do still operate in Nghe An, we find it heartening that proactive enforcement appears to be discouraging individuals to continue farming. Our study illustrates the importance of government commitment to policy in driving conservation impact.",

Notably, institutions rarely cited external resources from professional bodies, suggesting underutilisation of available support.\n\nThe study proposes developing a 'Skills Portfolio' methodology with a standardised 'living skills ontology' to provide verifiable mechanisms for demonstrating technical expertise.

          "abstract": "Recent advances in digital technologies create opportunities to support circular economy strategies for mass-produced consumer and industrial goods. Building on the CE-RISE project, this study evaluates how Digital Product Passports (DPPs) and related digital innovations can improve circular outcomes across selected value chains. We combine secondary data analysis of production and trade statistics with a PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence. The empirical scope covers heat pumps, PV panels, printers, ICT equipment, and batteries. We report baseline material flows and circularity indicators for Europe (2010-2023), highlight differences between the EU27 and non-EU Europe (CH/NO/TR), and quantify a DPP scenario with confidence intervals. For the EU27 in 2023, current circularity is 15.5% and the DPP scenario implies 45.6% (95% CI: 29.2-62.0), corresponding to potential savings of 52.3 Mt and EUR 64.7 bn (95% CI: 23.8-80.8 Mt; EUR 29.5-100.0 bn). We also provide a proxy estimate of refurbishment-related employment exposure based on Eurostat production value per employee in NACE J. The paper provides an evidence-informed baseline for estimating DPP-enabled gains and for monitoring future policy impacts.",

          "abstract": "Preprinting has become an increasingly important component of the scholarly communication system, facilitating rapid open dissemination of scientific knowledge. This study investigates the adoption of preprinting over time, focusing on how it varies across scientific disciplines and geographical regions. We analyzed bibliometric data on 4M preprints and 105M peer-reviewed outputs in the period 1991-2023. Peer-reviewed outputs were linked to preprints using data from Dimensions, OpenAlex, and Crossref, resulting in 2.2M peer-reviewed outputs linked to a preprint. Our findings indicate a strong growth in preprinting, with a nearly threefold increase in the number of preprints published between 2017 and 2022. The adoption of preprinting is highest in the physical and mathematical sciences, particularly among researchers in the Americas and Europe. In recent years, preprinting has also increased notably in the information and computing sciences and the life and medical sciences, driven primarily by researchers in North America and Western and Northern Europe. Preprinting remains relatively uncommon in the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences. Asia demonstrates low preprint adoption, with Eastern Asia showing a modest increase in recent years. Preprint adoption in specific disciplines varies significantly across regions, showing that preprint adoption is shaped by the interplay between disciplines and regions.",

          "authors": "Viyaleta Korsunava; Boris Sokolov",
          "abstract": "Non-probability web surveys offer several advantages over face-to-face (F2F) interviews—they are cheaper, faster, more accessible, and reduce interviewer effects and desirability bias. As such, they are increasingly popular in both academic and commercial research. However, they often yield demographically biased samples, raising concerns about the accuracy of the resulting public opinion estimates. Most studies on web surveys focus on developed countries, with limited attention to non-WEIRD contexts. Addressing this gap, we compare data from the Values in Crisis (VIC) survey (2020–2021, opt-in online panels with quota sampling) and the 7th wave of the World Values Survey (WVS; 2017–2022, probability-based multi-stage stratified sampling) across nine countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Germany, Greece, Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. We assess differences in demographic coverage and national mean scores on 15 attitudinal items, including trust, national pride, religiosity, life satisfaction, postmaterialism, and support for gender equality and reproductive freedom. WVS samples more closely match national demographics, though VIC performs comparably in some cases. Substantively, web surveys show higher (up to 20–30 p.p.) acceptance of gender equality, abortion, and homosexuality and lower religiosity, national pride, and life satisfaction. These differences persist even after adjusting for demographic imbalances and restricting WVS samples to internet users.",

          "abstract": "Value-driven governance is a prominent topic in AI regulation, with both state actors and tech companies professing a commitment to values like fairness and safety. Despite this seeming agreement, we know little how normative principles are interpreted, operationalized, and assigned responsibilities within particular contexts. This study compares the values invoked within the European Union’s AI Act with policy documents of five major AI companies—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Meta AI, and Mistral AI. Through a combination of frequency analysis and inductive keyword-in-context analysis, we identify prioritized values and map how they are specified in public legislation and corporate policies. Both public and private actors largely invoke the same values (accuracy, authenticity, control, improvement, privacy, safety, and security) but sometimes differ in their specification. While values like privacy, security, and safety typically mean the same thing in policy discourses, we found stark differences in the understanding of improvement, tensions between technical and normative operationalizations of values, and shifts of responsibilities for upholding values from one stakeholder to another. Value specifications surface the politics of values in AI regulations, exposing how private actors employ polysemy to claim alignment with the public interest while avoiding substantial accountability. When it comes to value-driven governance, the devil is in the details.",

Results show a high mean similarity between both tools (cosine: 0.7766, Pearson: 0.5478, Euclidean: 16.59) indicating that the proposed methodology is able to search and combine different online resource types efficiently and with enough quality.  In addition, the application of filters has reduced the average similarity between both tools by up to 15.33%. We publicly release topSEARCH's code to support future research.

          "abstract": "The Hodges–Lehmann estimator (HL) is widely described (in statistical terms) as a nonparametric, robust, consistent and efficient estimator of central location. While this characterization is correct under standard assumptions—continuous, unimodal distributions on a meaningful metric scale—its application to ordinal grading data such as university marks is problematic. Using explicit counterexamples, we show that the HL estimator can exhibit severe jump discontinuities: minimal changes in the sample leads to large, discrete changes in the HL estimate. This behavior persists under sample size inflation by replication. This shows that the HL should not be used to represent a central location in ordinal grading data as frequently present at universities.",

          "abstract": "Individualism, the prioritization of personal distinctiveness over group conformity, is theorized to increase with economic development. This study tests this hypothesis over a century (1900–2022) across 95 French départements, using name uniqueness as a behavioral proxy. We first validate this proxy at the subnational level, showing that name uniqueness correlates with regional survey-based individualism indices (World Values Survey), even after controlling for immigration rates. Using complete civil registry data (N ≈ 79 million) and a bootstrapped name uniqueness score, we then analyze its relationship with economic development across space and time. Our analysis yields three key findings. First, longitudinal analysis reveals a strong positive association: as GDP per capita increased nationally over the 100-year period, name uniqueness rose significantly across all départements. Second, after removing shared temporal trends by standardizing variables within each year, effectively treating départements (n = `r nobs(norm_model_boy)`) as small, culturally and socially identical countries, GDP per capita continues to predict higher name uniqueness. Third, we uncover nuanced patterns: the relationship was moderated by gender, particularly during the World Wars, and rising economic inequality between regions was accompanied by growing divergence in naming practices, suggesting that development drives both cultural individualism and cultural stratification. Together, these results provide robust, fine-grained evidence that economic development fosters a cultural shift toward greater individualism.",

In a context of increasing social, mental, and physical vulnerability, there is wide agreement on the need to address health and social needs in an integrated manner. Yet, considering such “complexity” remains a pervasive challenge for professionals in social and health care, especially due to a lack of operational definitions. This scoping review aims to map existing definitions of complexity in social and health care and to identify shared assessment tools that support interprofessional and coordinated intervention. Methods and analysis. The review will follow the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (Tricco et al., 2018) and updated guidance (Peters et al., 2020). Literature search will be conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL (EBSCO), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), SocINDEX (EBSCO), Social Services Abstracts (ProQuest), and Cairn.info databases using appropriate keywords, index terms and search equations. All selected study bibliographies will undergo manual screening (\"snowballing\"). Studies will be selected based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, screened by title and abstracts. Data from full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria will be extracted independently by three authors. Evaluation discrepancies will be resolved through consensus. Results. Findings will be presented in descriptive tables and summarized narratively in relation to the review’s objectives and questions. Conclusion. This scoping review is expected to contribute to the development of an operational definition of complex situations in integrated social and health care and to identify tools that support professionals in assessing these situations in practice.",

          "authors": "Sarah Grajdura; Matthew Palm; Collin Yarbrough; Qian He; Dana Rowangould; Chen Chen; Tara Goddard; Karl Kim; Stephen Wong",
          "abstract": "As climate-related hazards intensify, transportation systems play a central role in shaping who is exposed to risk, who can respond, and who recovers mobility and access after disruption. This scoping review synthesizes 88 studies to assess how transportation and hazards research has engaged equity and justice frameworks, what outcomes are used to evaluate inequity, where findings converge or diverge across hazards and disaster phases, and what conceptual gaps constrain progress. We find that the literature is effective at documenting disparities in exposure, evacuation, adaptation, and recovery, largely through population-based comparisons and novel mobility datasets. However, equity is most often treated implicitly, with unequal outcomes reported absent explicit normative or theoretical grounding. As a result, differences are frequently described without clarifying when and why they constitute inequities, limiting comparability across contexts and policy relevance. Evidence is strongest for inequities in transportation-mediated exposure, particularly for extreme heat and access loss driven by network failure, indicating a maturing understanding of transportation systems as active producers of vulnerability. Findings on evacuation disparities are less consistent, reflecting methodological limitations and contextual variation, while recovery outcomes show greater convergence, with marginalized communities experiencing slower or incomplete mobility restoration. Across domains, mismatches persist between commonly used mobility metrics and lived disaster needs, and mechanisms producing inequity—such as disinvestment, governance capacity, caregiving constraints, disability access, labor precarity, and information asymmetries—are often underexamined. We argue that greater engagement with explicit justice frameworks is necessary to move beyond documenting disparity toward explaining inequity and guiding equity-oriented transportation decisions under growing risk and uncertainty.",

          "authors": "Andrew J Shapiro",
          "abstract": "Despite the Third Reich's efforts to rewrite German history, post-WWII scholars and activists have worked valiantly to unearth the inspiring legacies of Magnus Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee (WhK) before Nazi takeover. But by lionizing Hirschfeld, these same scholars/activists have too often erased (1) WhK’s limitations, (2) other, less savory competitor groups like the masculinist Community of the Self-Possessed (GdE) and collaborationist Human Rights League (BfM), and (3) surprisingly generative critiques put forth by these latter groups. In a comparative-historical analysis of WhK, GdE, and BfM organizers, I suggest that fin-de-siècle German capitalism inculcated an illusory proximity to power that limited organizers' insights into bourgeois heteronormative German society and their precarious place within it. Despite criticizing some particulars, all of these activists nonetheless identified with and demonstrated adherence to classist models of normative Germanness by excluding other gender- and sexually-nonconforming people. WhK medicalists constructed themselves as upright, learned \"homosexual\" professionals against criminalized \"pseudohomosexual\" sex workers; GdE masculinists constructed their Hellenistic literary circle of enlightened \"homoerotic\" against crude, hypersexual, effeminate decadents. BfM homonormatives constructed themselves as respectable, everyday middle-class citizen-subjects against perverse, pathological, in-your-face activists. These attempts to gain inclusion at one another’s expense undermined their ability to work together and with other oppressed groups. Apart from a brief rapprochement, these competing groups constantly distinguished themselves from and denigrated one another. Hidden beneath this impulse is, to borrow from current discourse about Trump supporters, a sense of being “temporarily embarrassed elites\" that obscured friend from foe and obscured their extreme vulnerability to the coming storm of fascist reaction. I conclude by bringing the strengths and limitations of these three groups to bear on the current fascist, genocidal moment, suggesting that learning from their mistakes and capitalizing on their strengths is essential for bringing about a non-fascist movement, society, and world.",

          "abstract": "The Karo of North Sumatra, Indonesia, have long expressed a preference for matrilateral cross-cousin (impal) marriage, yet the practice has declined sharply over the past century. To identify the demographic and sociocultural factors underlying this change, we applied an epidemiological approach to cultural evolution, using a case-control design coupled with structural equation modeling (SEM). Ethnographic data from 176 married individuals across 62 villages were analyzed to assess the effects of demographic, alliance, religious, cosocialisation, and modernisation variables on the likelihood of impal marriage. The model fit was strong (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.04), revealing significant direct and indirect effects. Marrying an impal was positively associated with the number of marriageable impal and with arranged or strategically motivated unions but negatively associated with reported religious conflict between spouses. Indicators of modernisation such as schooling and infrastructure were non-significant. These results indicate that the decline of impal marriage reflects demographic contraction and the weakening of alliance-based strategies rather than a rejection of the cultural norm itself. Framed within an epidemiological model of cultural transmission, the findings demonstrate how social practices may fade when the ecological and demographic conditions sustaining them erode, even as their normative value persists.",

We frame this phenomenon through the lived experiences of minimally and nonspeaking autistics whose multimodal communication profiles challenge the speech-centered defaults of current AI pipelines. “Nonspeaking” is not a single condition or an absence of language but a spectrum encompassing users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), from text to gesture, rhythmic movement, and partial vocalizations. Communicative profiles vary across time with fatigue, anxiety, sensory load, and motor planning demands, yet design abstractions erase this variability. By tracing exclusionary mechanisms across speech recognition, text-to-speech, plain-language generation, and interface design, we identify how inequities are structurally produced and propose measurable designed dignity metrics for evaluation and governance. We argue that accessibility must be treated as a core dimension of AI ethics—on par with fairness, privacy, and safety. Re-engineering AI for designed dignity requires systems that recognize embodied, multimodal, and state-dependent forms of communication, expanding what counts as valid signal and responsible innovation.",

          "authors": "Billy Southern",
          "abstract": "Accurately delineating urban and suburban space has become increasingly difficult. Identifying each setting has long relied on capturing where population density and commuting flows differ, with research and policy often operating with binary measures to separate city from suburb. But as urban and suburban spaces expand, age, and reshape, places emerge that do not definitively fit this binary imagination. The uncertainty this generates creates complexities in claims made about urban and suburban space, but it is rarely addressed within empirical classifications. \n\nThis research focuses on the uncertainty that dichotomous categorizations of place hide. Through a comparison of seven extant definitions of urban and suburban, I identify places that sit reliably in one category or another; but I also highlight the areas of uncertainty and instability. Results demonstrate that there are ‘stable’ urban and suburban areas, but a spatially uncertain transitional space exists where the nature of the landscape is unclear. By delineating these transitional spaces as a third category, I support research and policy that aims to speak clearly about changes in urban and suburban places, while also opening a conversation about how places might move between these two canonical definitions.",

          "authors": "Shantanu Gupta; Mohamad Nabil Oueida; Xiangxi Zhang; Ajith Krishnan Muralidharan; Kevin Zhan",
          "abstract": "Most, if not all, multiplayer games have a huge imbalance of teamwork and individualism that contribute very highly to the player experience. This aims to aid in understanding the cooperation and player behavior within a cooperative multiplayer game known as “Gambit’s Gauntlet,” which was designed with this study in mind. Our primary focus is to examine how players in cooperative games can be affected by player behavior and Level Design that affects the balance of Power Dependency (Emerson, 1962) between players when working in a team and whether they can be affected by categorized cooperative sections between levels, team dynamics based on personality types and player skills. The game pushes and tests players on their tolerance for working as a team, and we aim to study this through our qualitative and quantitative tests that would involve analyzing gameplay recordings, surveys, and personality assessments. Our goal is to learn and observe patterns that can affect cooperation, frustration, conflict, and player motivation, which can be an insightful start to creating the perfect game environment by testing all these factors. We also learn about the elements required in cooperative gameplay and how cooperative gameplay can be hindered. We decided to look at Power Dependency, specifically Power Dependency Imbalances (Emerson, 1962) in a dyadic relationship or Cooperation. Our Methodology consists of pre and post-surveys to a playtest testing Power Imbalances and Power Dependency (Emerson, 1962) between unfamiliar participants via our Capstone Cooperative Game “Gambit’s Gauntlet.” The levels used for our playtest were designed to create a power imbalance between players to help us understand how unfamiliar players respond to each other and how they would react when switching the power dependency between them. These behaviors were measured via annotating play sessions by tracking Behavioral Markers (Farah et al. 2022) that we find during gameplay. This playtest had a total of 16 male participants, with ages ranging from 18-30, who were all based around the Boston area, with a mix of university students and young professionals from multiple cultural backgrounds. Thanks to our research and our playtest, we were able to find that power dependency Imbalance done via Level Design encourages communication and cooperative behaviors between players since they will take on the imbalance and accommodate each other for the sake of completing the common goal, which is beating a cooperative game that demands both their involvement and cooperation.",

          "authors": "Ibrahim Said Arinc",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes Türkiye's natural gas market reform through the lens of institutional path dependence, demonstrating the failure of textbook liberalization strategies in a system marked by embedded support structures and geopolitical constraints. The delayed restructuring of BOTAŞ and the absence of a clear segmentation framework prevented the emergence of a well-functioning domestic market, constraining price formation and liquidity, and ultimately hindering Türkiye's hub potential.\nTo address this structural gap, this study proposes a unique hybrid institutional pathway operationalized through a novel Dual-Ring Model. This model segments gas supply between a regulated Guardian Ring (for vulnerable consumers) and a market-based Competitive Ring, fostering traded liquidity and authentic benchmark pricing. Drawing on the \"second-best\" institutional approach and the principle of \"embedded autonomy\", the framework argues against full liberalization. The AggregateTR procurement mechanism coordinates strategic state bargaining power, notably leveraging the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover period, with transparent competitive allocation. Two original Structural Market Indicators (SSDI and TVR) monitor support targeting and traded liquidity.\nScenario-based analysis demonstrates how disciplined segmentation and phased support recalibration, including the strategic release of Sakarya Domestic Gas Production into the Competitive Ring, progressively balance supply security, affordability, and benchmark credibility. This framework provides a resilient hybrid gas market architecture grounded in Türkiye's structural context, offering actionable insights for the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover window and the subsequent post-2030 market design. The approach offers replicable lessons for other gas import-dependent emerging economies, reconciling liberalization with strategic state coordination.",

          "abstract": "The growing use of algorithm based systems to manage employees has transformed how work is organized and controlled in contemporary organizations. Commonly referred to as algorithmic management, this approach relies on automated decision making to allocate tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate employee outcomes. While such systems are often adopted to enhance efficiency, their implications for human work remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the relationship between algorithmic management and key employee outcomes, with a particular focus on employee autonomy, job satisfaction, and performance.\nUsing a quantitative research design, data were collected through an online survey from employees working in algorithmically managed environments. Established measurement scales were employed to assess the study variables, and statistical analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The findings indicate that algorithmic management is negatively associated with employee autonomy and job satisfaction, while demonstrating a significant relationship with employee performance. These results suggest that algorithmic management may improve performance related outcomes but can also constrain employees’ sense of control and satisfaction at work.\nThe study contributes to the growing literature on digital and technology-mediated management by highlighting the dual effects of algorithmic management on human work. From a practical perspective, the findings underscore the importance of designing algorithmic systems that balance organizational efficiency with employee well-being. The study also offers directions for future research on the evolving role of algorithms in shaping the future of work.",

While both forms are positively related to national identity, they affect attitudes towards immigrants in different ways. Nationalism is positively associated with discriminatory intentions, while patriotism is negatively associated with them. Both effects cancel one another out.",

Building on the concept of Culinary Home Economics Capital (CHE Capital), domestic cooking is understood as a relationally embedded, value-generating practice. Through processes of visualization, narrativization, and platformization, CHE Capital becomes legible within contemporary regimes of visibility and evaluation, generating recognition, identity, and hierarchical effects. This paper situates CHE Capital in dialogue with Bourdieu's theory of cultural capital, care ethics, and affect theory, highlighting both its continuities with and distinctions from these frameworks. The analysis contributes to cultural sociology, everyday aesthetics, and feminist political economy by offering a framework for understanding how intimate, relational practices enter public circuits of evaluation and recognition.",

          "abstract": "Personal networks influence health and mortality at the individual level, but less is known about how population-scale social network structure relates to mortality. This study examines how US county-level social network structure relates to mortality disparities. Using measures from 21 billion Facebook friendships, we investigate how two structural features of population social networks – cohesiveness and diversity – are associated with age-standardized and age-specific mortality rates. Bivariate results show that measures of social network structure rival smoking rates, median income, and educational attainment in their association with mortality rates. Social network structure remains predictive of mortality even after controlling for traditional measures like socioeconomic status and rural/urban classification. Network diversity is\nassociated with lower mortality in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. Network clustering is associated with higher mortality bivariately, but this association reverses after controlling for county-level demographic and socioeconomic factors, revealing a protective effect masked by confounding. Age-stratified analyses further complicate this picture, showing that clustering predicts lower mortality among adults aged 15-64 but higher mortality among those 70 and older. These findings highlight social network structure as an important dimension of place-based health disparities, one not fully captured by conventional measures of socioeconomic composition or spatial segregation.",

          "abstract": "Prior studies of young adult sexlessness have reached conflicting conclusions: GSS-based analyses found rising male sexlessness, while NSFG-based studies found no male-specific trend. This study reconciles these findings and documents a post-2012 increase in male exclusion from partnership formation. The key innovation is distinguishing virginity (delayed sexual debut affecting both genders symmetrically) from dry spells (market dysfunction among the sexually experienced, which diverged by gender). Using difference-in-differences designs applied to two national data sources measuring sexual partnering directly—the General Social Survey (GSS) and the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG)—both yield convergent evidence of a statistically significant widening of the male-female gap in the post-2012 period. The design identifies differential changes in male versus female outcomes but cannot isolate app-specific causality from other post-2012 changes. The GSS shows a 10.6 percentage point increase in the male-female sexlessness gap for 18-24 year-olds (p = .024). The NSFG, using a novel measurement approach that distinguishes virginity (delayed sexual debut) from dry spells (market dysfunction among the sexually experienced), reveals a 6.2 percentage point widening in the gender gap for dry spells (p = .014). Age-stratified falsification tests across both surveys show effects concentrated exclusively in the youngest cohorts most exposed to app-mediated dating. This study provides convergent evidence of a post-2012 increase in male exclusion from partnership formation, consistent with increased concentration among a subset of men, though alternative mechanisms (e.g., shorter relationships, reporting changes) cannot be ruled out with available data—an empirical pattern that prior work was unable to detect or disentangle. App-mediated matching architectures are a plausible contributing mechanism because they uniquely align with the timing, cohort specificity, and gender asymmetry of the observed shift.",

          "authors": "Huabo LIU",
          "abstract": "Interdisciplinary research is frequently conceptualized as an integrative endeavor that synthesizes disciplinary perspectives to yield more holistic explanations of complex phenomena. Although this integrative paradigm has yielded valuable outcomes, it often frames disciplinary differences principally as barriers to be surmounted. Drawing on insights from science and technology studies (STS), this article advances an alternative epistemological framework by reconceptualizing disciplines not as repositories of accumulated knowledge but as historically stabilized methodological apparatuses that actively constitute explanatory objects and practices. Building upon this reconceptualization, the article develops an interventionist epistemology that positions disciplinary differences as generative epistemic resources rather than impediments. The proposed framework delineates a three-stage mechanism—interpretive juxtaposition, cognitive friction, and methodological reflexivity—whereby the deliberate and sustained co-presence of incommensurable explanatory logics disrupts the naturalized authority of any single disciplinary method, thereby fostering reflexive scrutiny of underlying epistemic commitments and normative implications. Through illustrative cases from climate policy modeling, management research, and evidence-based medicine, the analysis demonstrates how interpretive juxtaposition manifests across diverse institutional contexts, generating cognitive friction that prompts methodological reflexivity without necessitating premature synthesis or resolution of differences. These examples illustrate that prolonged exposure to plural explanatory regimes can productively intervene in epistemic assumptions, thereby reshaping the conditions of legitimate judgment and knowledge production. The article concludes by elaborating the implications of reframing interdisciplinarity as epistemic intervention rather than integration, and by identifying promising directions for future empirical inquiry within STS, including investigations into the institutional conditions that enable or constrain such reflexive dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Kathmandu valley’s spatial characters are constantly changing, and as such, its urban morphology can be\nobserved as a frequently altered palimpsest. Developing on the trade route of Tibet and India, settlements\nof Kathmandu valley can be traced back to more than three thousand years. The foundation of the earliest\nsettlements were laid out by Kirats in 300 BC or before that. The settlements expanded first under the\nsucceeding Lichchhavi ruling house who applied Vedic town planning principles and later the Mallas\nexpanded the settlements further with Astamatrika and Dashmahavidya concepts affiliated to Shakti-\ncult. After the unification of Nepal in 1769, Kathmandu Valley became the capital of politics, economy\nand administration, however the political centralization can be vividly observed only after the 1950's. After\nthe dethroning of the autocratic Rana Regime in 1951, the monarchical government had the authoritative\ngrip in government and development. The political turmoil did not stop until the 1990s, which brought two\nbig changes in Nepal, when the re-establishment of Democracy and wave of globalization brought\nunprecedented change in the urban form of Kathmandu Valley. However, the democratization of Nepal did\nnot go well; the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) declared a civil war that lasted for a decade till 2006\njeopardizing the baby local government (Decentralization) and causing massive migration to urban core\nfrom rural regions, especially to Kathmandu Valley. The mass movement of April 2006 changed the\ngoverning landscape, turning a democratic monarchical nation into a federal republic, with an expectation\nto loosen valley’s centripetal grip of economy and administration, if not politics. The era of federal republic\nof Nepal has witnessed the political chaos of more than a decade, in terms of urban policy and development\nstrategy. The paper reviews the spatial changes of Kathmandu Valley from the perspective of the political\neconomy of Nepal till date. It is observed that the political system and social structure have defined the\nchanges in the urban landscape of Kathmandu valley. The paper takes into account the regime changes over\nthe period and the planning strategies carried out in the period along with the political economics behind it.\nThe spatial changes of Kathmandu valley inferential to its political economy is also significant to\nunderstand the growth pattern of other growing cities in Nepal, which are largely influenced by political\ndecisions in Nepal.",

Mediante análisis comparativo de dos encuentros recientes con Trump – el caso fallido con el presidente ucraniano Volodímir Zelenski (febrero 2025) y el caso exitoso con el alcalde de Nueva York Zohran Mamdani (enero 2026) – este estudio identifica patrones psicológicos que determinan resultados en negociaciones con líderes narcisistas en contextos de asimetría de poder. Empleando metodología cualitativa de análisis de caso comparativo basada en el modelo de narcisismo patológico de Kernberg y Kohut, y marcos teóricos sobre toma de decisiones en contextos asimétricos, se analizan transcripciones de encuentros públicos, declaraciones oficiales, y reportes periodísticos detallados. Los hallazgos sugieren que el narcisismo patológico de Trump crea vulnerabilidades específicas que pueden ser navegadas exitosamente mediante estrategias que eviten activar rabia narcisista mientras permiten al líder narcisista \"salvar face\" y declararse ganador.  Se argumenta que la estructura de personalidad de Petro – caracterizada por narcisismo ideológico más que patológico – puede constituir ventaja táctica si es adecuadamente movilizada mediante recontextualización del pragmatismo como coherente con identidad revolucionaria. Se identifican siete principios psicológicos generales para negociaciones asimétricas con narcisistas patológicos: (1) priorizar evitar activación de rabia narcisista, (2) permitir \"salvar face\" como necesidad estructural, (3) reconocer que la narrativa de \"ganar\" puede superar el contenido sustantivo, (4) validar selectivamente sin adulación, (5) reconocer diferencias sin insistir en ellas, (6) crear oportunidades para magnanimidad, y (7) reconocer asimetría de poder implícita pero no explícitamente. Se formulan recomendaciones estratégicas específicas organizadas en tres fases: preparación pre-encuentro (reencuadre mental, identificación de triggers, preparación de propuestas ganar-ganar), tácticas durante la reunión (apertura constructiva, manejo de provocaciones, uso estratégico de validación), y comunicación post-encuentro (narrativas para audiencias múltiples). El estudio tiene implicaciones para diplomacia en contextos de personalidades incompatibles, gestión de crisis con líderes autoritarios, y comprensión de cómo factores psicológicos individuales interactúan con asimetrías estructurales de poder en relaciones internacionales.",

          "abstract": "A popular view holds that declining housing affordability stems from regulations that restrict new supply, and that deregulation will spur sufficient market-rate construction to meaningfully improve affordability. We argue that this ‘deregulationist’ view rests upon flawed assumptions. Through empirical simulation, we show that even a dramatic, deregulation-driven supply expansion would take decades to generate widespread affordability in high-cost U.S. markets. We advance an alternative explanation of declining affordability grounded in demand structure and geography: uneven demand growth – driven by rising interpersonal and interregional inequality – is the primary driver of declining affordability in recent decades. For cost-burdened households, trickle-down benefits from deregulation will be insufficient and too slow.",
