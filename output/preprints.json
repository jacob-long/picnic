          "abstract": "The open science movement has gained significant momentum over the past decade, with pre-registration and the use of pre-analysis plans being central to ongoing debates. Combining observational evidence on trends in adoption with survey data from 519 researchers, this study examines the adoption of pre-registration (potentially but not necessarily including pre-analysis plans) in experimental economics. Pooling statistics from 19 leading journals published between 2017 and 2023, we observe that the number of papers containing a pre-registration grew from seven per year to 190 per year. Our findings indicate that pre-registration has now become mainstream in experimental economics, with two-thirds of respondents expressing favorable views and 86% having pre-registered at least one study. However, opinions are divided on the scope and comprehensiveness of pre-registration, highlighting the need for clearer guidelines. Researchers assign a credibility premium to pre-registered tests, although the exact channels remain to be understood. Our results suggest growing support for open science practices among experimental economists, with demand for professional associations to guide researchers and reviewers on best practices for pre-registration and other open science initiatives.",

          "abstract": "Despite over a century of foundational work in ethology, behavioral neuroscience, and psychology, no general law has been formalized that predicts behavior across species. Drawing from Tinbergen’s classic experiments and integrating phylogenetic, neuroendocrine, and cultural data, this article proposes a universal behavioral equation:\n\nBehavior = A × D × C\n\nThis ARCH equation is tested against empirical findings on male stickleback aggression and courtship as archetypal behaviors demonstrating its explanatory and predictive power. The synthesis establishes the ARCH model as a candidate for a general behavioral dynamics law, grounded in biological and cross-species data.",

          "authors": "Han Zhang; John Jonides",
          "abstract": "We present PupEyes, an open-source Python package for preprocessing and visualizing pupil size and eye movement data. Developed with current best practices in mind, PupEyes offers a comprehensive and reproducible pupil preprocessing pipeline, as well as interactive visualizations to facilitate data exploration and outlier detection. In addition to pupil size data, PupEyes supports interactive visualization of eye movement data, including scanpath animations, fixation density plots, and area-of-interest (AOI) maps. It also provides tools for manually drawing AOIs, assigning fixations to AOIs, and computing basic AOI-based metrics. Cleaned data are returned as pandas data frames, making them compatible with other data analysis and visualization packages within the Python ecosystem. PupEyes also features an intuitive Application Programming Interface (API) and detailed online tutorials (https://pupeyes.readthedocs.io/), making it accessible to users with varying levels of programming experience. Overall, PupEyes (1) ensures that pupil size data are preprocessed in a principled, transparent, and reproducible manner, (2) helps researchers better understand their data through interactive visualizations, and (3) enables flexible extensions for further analysis tailored to specific research goals. We believe PupEyes is a useful addition to the analysis workflow for pupil size and eye movement data.",

          "authors": "angelica valencia",
          "abstract": "We examined the impact of mental health issues on cognitive and executive skills in 135 internally displaced adolescents, which were randomly selected from the Colombian victims' register. Outcomes included scores from standardized tests for cognitive ability and executive functioning. Predictors were self-reported measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and suicidal ideation. Covariables included traumatic events, displacement level, and parental occupation. Linear models assessed the associations between outcomes and predictors, as well as the moderating effects of covariables. Results indicated that PTSD was negatively associated with executive functioning, with a significantly stronger effect among adolescents whose parents were unemployed or in informal jobs. PTSD was marginally associated with cognitive ability. No associations were found for depression or suicidal ideation. These findings underscore the need to prioritize the most vulnerable adolescents and strengthen executive functioning, which supports long-term development and mitigates the negative effects of traumatic experiences such as internal displacement.",

          "abstract": "Sociometer theory posits that self-evaluation is influenced by social relationship status as reflected by self-esteem. However, the neural basis of sociometer theory has not been completely delineated, possibly due to the complexity of the relationships among facets of social relationship status (i.e., acceptance and rejection), and self-evaluation domains. In this study, participants evaluated how well trait adjectives described themselves or a celebrity while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We also measured their sense of acceptance, sense of rejection, and self-esteem. The results showed that sense of acceptance was positively associated with activation in the right temporoparietal junction and bilateral precuneus during self-evaluation of positive morality, possibly reflecting mentalizing, and was negatively related to activation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex during self-evaluation of negative competence, possibly reflecting emotion regulation. Sense of rejection was positively associated with activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus during self-evaluation of negative competence, possibly reflecting inner speech. However, self-esteem was not correlated with any brain areas. These results indicate that sense of acceptance and rejection have distinct dynamics in self-evaluation processing, suggesting the existence of multiple domain-specific sociometers.",

EMC2 bridges the gap between standard regression analyses and cognitive modeling through linear-model specifications for each type of cognitive model parameter. The flexible implementation of the linear modeling language allows users to map model parameters directly to complicated designs and hypotheses. EMC2 implements recent developments in Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesis testing, including powerful and efficient sampling and marginal likelihood estimation algorithms, making it computationally feasible to estimate many different cognitive models and perform inference among them. Using two leading evidence-accumulation models, we illustrate how EMC2 provides a workflow that makes it easy to specify diverse parameterizations and informative priors, and to evaluate, refine, compare, and interpret models.",

          "authors": "Jingyu Zhang; Oliver Lüdtke; Alexander Robitzsch",
          "abstract": "In nonexperimental studies, obtaining an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE) typically requires two key assumptions: that all relevant covariates are measured (i.e., no unmeasured confounding) and that the statistical model used for covariate adjustment is correctly specified. Two common approaches for adjustment are outcome regression and propensity score weighting. To mitigate bias from model misspecification, doubly robust methods combine both approaches, ensuring unbiased ATE estimates if either the outcome model or the propensity score model is correctly specified. In this study, we review four doubly robust methods that have received considerable attention in the methodological literature but remain underutilized in psychological research: augmented inverse probability weighting, regression weighted by the inverse propensity score, regression incorporating the inverse propensity score as a covariate, and calibrated propensity score weights. Using two simulation studies, we compare these methods with traditional regression and inverse probability weighting estimators. Our results suggest that doubly robust methods—particularly regression weighted by the inverse propensity score—offer greater protection against bias from model misspecification across various data-generating scenarios. We also discuss practical considerations for implementing doubly robust methods, including weight normalization, propensity score truncation, and potential efficiency losses due to overfitting. The different methods for estimating the ATE are illustrated in a data example.",

          "authors": "Alyssa Herman; Clarissa Velez; Alayna L Park",
          "abstract": "The proliferation of freely available online mental health resources over recent years has remarkably advanced the field’s potential to disseminate mental health information while simultaneously creating the problem of information overload. This paper applies Graham et al.’s (2006) Knowledge to Action (KTA) model to outline a process for improving dissemination of online resources. The KTA model outlines two dynamic phases that can enhance dissemination of online resources. The first phase focuses on synthesizing available mental health research into user-friendly informational resources, and then further condensing and organizing those resources to reduce information overload. Although this phase can improve resource accessibility, the organization of resources alone is often insufficient for translating knowledge to action. To address this, the next phase of the model focuses on improving the actionability and relevance of online resources by tailoring the content to the specific needs and interests of the intended audience. Finally, this paper will review additional considerations to ensure successful and sustainable dissemination of online resources. By applying KTA model with consideration of facilitators and barriers specific to online resources, resource developers can reduce obstacles related to accessing mental health information online.",

          "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder, characterized by high relapse risk. With every new episode, risk for relapse increases. This makes preventing relapse an important clinical target in limiting the personal and societal burden of MDD. Preventive Cognitive Therapy (PCT) is a protocolized psychological therapy which has shown to lower relapse risk. How PCT attains its effects needs further elucidation. Understanding the treatment mechanisms provides a window to identify critical target points to prevent depressive relapse. \nIn this randomized controlled trial, 50 patients remitted from at least two depressive episodes in the past five years were randomized to eight sessions of PCT (n=25) or to a waiting list condition (n=25) in the context of the NEWPRIDE trial. Primary outcome measures were changes in brain activation during effortful emotion regulation and in biased processing, covering both negative and positive valence dimensions. All patients were assessed twice (baseline and three-month follow-up) for these outcome measures, as well as their diagnosis, symptomatology, cognitive and affective reactivity, and emotion regulation styles. Linear Mixed Models and Repeated Measures ANOVAs were conducted to objectify the immediate changes induced by the therapy in brain reactivity, and clinical and cognitive measures. \nFollowing PCT, patients showed decreased recruitment of dorsomedial prefrontal regions during upregulation of positive affect and stable recruitment of the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex during regulation of emotions over valences, compared to the waiting list. No effects on biased processing of emotional information were observed. Furthermore, PCT resulted in a lower increase of depressive symptomatology over three months as compared to the waiting list condition. Finally, PCT resulted in increased activation of positive thoughts following reading positive self-related scenarios, lower responsivity of negative affect to negative stimuli and increased successful application of cognitive reappraisal to modify affective states. \nThese results suggest that PCT obtains its relapse preventing effects by targeting mechanisms that underpin regulation of mood. More specifically, changes in regulation of positive affect and content of positive cognitions may decrease negative mood and affect. This supports cross-valence compensatory models of cognitive therapy and suggests that strengthening and shifting cognition and affect to more positive content may guard against the activation of negative cognitions and affect in the face of daily hassles and life events.",

          "authors": "Tahir Rahman",
          "abstract": "Behavioral science lacks a unified framework capable of integrating innate neural programs,\nmotivational states, and culturally acquired norms. The ARCH model—Behavior = Archetype\n× Drive × Culture—is proposed as a formal principle for understanding behavior across species.\nIn this triadic equation, archetypes represent evolutionarily conserved neural scripts (e.g.,\nWarrior, Caregiver), drives reflect neuroendocrine motivations (e.g., testosterone, oxytocin), and\nculture denotes group-level norms that modulate behavioral expression. To evaluate the model’s\nexplanatory scope, this study analyzes behavioral data from five evolutionarily divergent species:\nchimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), naked mole-rats (Heterocephalus glaber), vampire bats\n(Desmodus rotundus), European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), and juvenile rats (Rattus\nnorvegicus). Each species exhibits context-specific instantiations of the ARCH components—\ne.g., coalitionary aggression modulated by testosterone and ritual in chimpanzees, caregiving\nunder reproductive suppression in mole-rats, oxytocin-mediated altruism in vampire bats,\nsensorimotor entrainment in flocking starlings, and dopaminergic social play in rats. Despite\necological and phylogenetic differences, behavioral outcomes across taxa conform to the\npredicted interaction of Archetype × Drive × Culture. The ARCH model offers a biologically\ngrounded, cross-species framework with applications in neuroscience, psychiatry, artificial\nintelligence, and behavioral ecology. It advances the prospect of a unified science of behavior by\nintegrating evolution, physiology, and culture into a predictive equation.",

Children’s ratings were positively correlated with adults’ for both valence (r=.914) and intensity (r=.800), and both groups used similar features to make judgments.

          "abstract": "Establishing whether two sets of objects have the same number of objects turns out to be surprisingly challenging for children even if they have some basic number word and counting knowledge. Here we study the relationship between understanding of exact equality of sets and symbolic number knowledge in preschool children (N=208, Age Range=2.89–5.09 years) at various stages of symbolic number word acquisition. To do this, we gave children two classic verbal symbolic number word knowledge tasks (Give-N, How Many?) and two comparable but non-verbal set-matching tasks in which they were asked to produce a set of objects that numerically matched a target set. We find strong evidence that symbolic number knowledge is related to set-matching for exact equality, both replicating and extending recent findings. Specifically, set-matching accuracy was better for children who understood symbolic number cardinality (i.e., the cardinally principle) compared to those who did not, even after accounting for age and other general cognitive abilities (e.g., executive functions). Furthermore, this effect was seen across the range of set sizes tested (1-8), including smaller set sizes (1-4) typically thought to be within the cognitive limits to be compared for exact equality non-verbally. Finally, set-matching performance was below ceiling even at set sizes corresponding to individual children’s specific level of symbolic number knowledge (N) as well as the preceding quantity (N-1). Together these results suggest that understanding of exact equality comes after and builds on symbolic number knowledge. More broadly, our results support the emerging view that understanding symbolic number cardinality is only a single, early step towards understanding the symbolic number system.",

We show that the accumulation of unverifiable science will soon reach a tipping point in which the rate of accumulation will far exceed our ability to correct the literature within practical constraints. Our models, while simplistic, are analogous to models of climate change, which warn of serious consequences if the current state of affairs is left unchecked. The simulation results indicate that addressing the accumulation of unverifiable science will require a combination of improving replicability rates (i.e. rigor), reducing research ’emissions’ (fewer articles but of better quality), and improved efforts to\n‘capture’ seriously flawed published papers.",

This study investigated how Latine bilingual parents in the U.S. share different types of books with their children. Twenty-four Latine parents and their three- to five-year-old children shared a monolingual English-only book and a bilingual English-Spanish book. Parents used a higher proportion of total words and different words in Spanish when sharing the bilingual book than the monolingual book. They also engaged in more code-switching with the bilingual book than the English monolingual book. There were no differences in the number or diversity of words in English between book types. These findings show that bilingual books increase parents’ use of the home language (in this case Spanish) relative to books in the societal language only, and suggest they may be one way of supporting children’s dual language development.",

Building off an established model of attachment, the dynamic-maturational model (DMM), as well as the neuroanatomical Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model of interoception and emotion, we not only elucidate how neural processes can shape attachment strategies, but also explore how early attachment experiences can shape those processes in the first place.\n\nBased on just four simple principles that relate attachment to predictive coding, we apply our framework to further our understanding of the attachment strategies in the DMM. Specifically, we propose that the type A strategies (analogous to \"avoidant\" or \"dismissive\" attachment) involve the suppression of interoceptive prediction errors as an adaptive response to maltreatment, relieving stress in the short-term at the cost of interoceptive awareness in the long-term. Furthermore, we propose that type C strategies (analogous to \"ambivalent/resistant\" or \"preoccupied\" attachment) involve the suppression of exteroceptive prediction errors to reflect the unreliability of external cues, motivating the obsessive seeking of information through increased vigilance and histrionic displays of affect. Finally, we explore the implications of our proposals, making several novel hypotheses that could have implications for the treatment of attachment-related psychopathology.",

          "authors": "Rebecca Geiselmann; Lasana Harris; Ophelia Deroy",
          "abstract": "Perceiving agency from motion cues is fundamental to social cognition. While goal-directed motion is a well-known agency cue, the role of synchronous motion between inanimate entities remains underexplored. This study examines whether synchrony contributes to agency perception, enhances goal-directed motion cues, and influences metacognitive confidence. In Experiment 1, 78 U.S.-based neurotypical participants watched videos of pre-programmed disc movements, judged whether the discs were chasing, and rated their confidence. Experiment 2 (78 participants) extended the investigation to purposeful interactions beyond chasing. Findings demonstrate that synchrony plays a fundamental role in agency perception, shaping judgments of chasing and purposeful interaction. While chasing perception requires cue integration, with synchrony amplifying directed motion effects, purposeful interaction perception is shaped independently by each factor. Response times and confidence ratings reveal cue integration, suggesting that even when categorical judgments treat cues separately, the perceptual system processes both. Data was collected in August 2024. Age and gender were balanced, but the sample was predominantly White, highly educated, and U.S.-raised, limiting generalizability. While perceptual mechanisms are likely universal, cultural, developmental, and neurocognitive factors may shape higher-level judgments. These findings inform social cognition and interactions with artificial intelligence, highlighting synchrony as key to perceived agency.",

A \nperson with NPD creates a great challenge for the lives of those around them because these \nindividuals fundamentally believe that they are mentally healthy and that others should try harder \nto understand them. In other words, a person with an inflated self-image, a deep need for admiration, \nand who considers themselves the center of the universe believes that the rest of humanity was \ncreated to serve the narcissistic person. Expanding awareness of their characteristics and trying to \nequip themselves with tactics that will reduce the damage of the NPD in the lives of those around \nthem.  \nThis article defines the narcissistic personality and its types and discusses how NPDs defend \nthemselves, take revenge, and their strategies. The following describes the personality of people \nwho are usually suitable prey to narcissists, the victim's view of them, and how this personality \nselects these victims. At least Providing practical solutions with examples to maintain the mental \nhealth of people who interact with someone with NPD in their daily lives.",

          "abstract": "Research on implicit social cognition explores how associations outside of conscious awareness or control can influence beliefs and behaviors, and the field has been one of the most popular areas of psychological research over the past 30 years. The relevance of implicit social cognition to policy was previously explored by Nosek and Riskind (2012). Here, we revisit this earlier discussion given that the field has made numerous – and in some cases pessimistic – advances regarding basic research questions on the construct and measures of implicit social cognition as well as the broader policy implications of such work. Specifically, we provide an updated review of available evidence concerning how implicit associations shift over time, relate to behavior, and change in response to interventions. Finally, we discuss how better understanding the strengths and limitations of research in implicit social cognition can productively inform ongoing policy and educational efforts.",

In this chapter, we describe key components of a successful apology and review existing empirical studies on the implications of group apologies offered in the context of historical injustices, that is, deliberate, violent or discriminatory actions committed in the past by a group or a state and that have a lasting impact on the well-being of present-day communities. We report research examining the effects of apologies on reconciliation (e.g., granting forgiveness or harmonious intergroup relations), considering both senders and receivers of apologies. We also identify reconciliation-relevant, affective (e.g., guilt, empathy, or admiration) and cognitive processes (e.g., perceived sincerity or representativeness of an apology) that might facilitate apologies’ reconciliation-relevant implications. Further, we review the characteristics of group apologies, their senders, and the context in which apologies are offered that make apologies work best (or worst). We close our chapter with reflections for research and practice in transitional justice.",

However, it is not well understood how these patterns affect, and are affected by, brain activation for domain-general cognitively demanding tasks. Here, we employ a novel task-driven resting-state electroencephalography design including an implicit Lindenmayer grammar learning task, which tracks aperiodic and hierarchical dependencies, to determine task-related functional connectivity changes in bilinguals. Quantified bilingual experience was used as a predictor of directional effects, using Generalised Additive Models to account for non-linear patterns. Our results revealed whole-brain post-task alterations to connectivity, including increased involvement of bilateral temporal and posterior regions and reduced involvement of frontal regions. Crucially, greater bilingual experience was associated with more distributed processing, suggesting enhanced efficiency. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how domain-general processing and connectivity are shaped by linguistic experience.",

Poorly understood experiences of female religious leaders lead institutions and religious leaders to assume a lack of heterogeneity, along with the ongoing adoption of formative experiences that are normed after a population that does not reflect the realities of most current and/or future religious leaders. Little to no empirical studies to date have formally investigated gender differences in religious leaders in many domains, much less mental health. The present study utilized a sample of 452 emerging religious leaders (50.2%, women) and a series of t-tests on self-report measures across domains of spirituality, character, emotional and mental health, and social values. Overall, women reported significantly higher rates of character strengths, social justice values, as well as lower emotional and mental health compared to men. Results also indicated that men reported higher rates of Narcissism-Grandiosity and Spirituality, yet women reported higher rates of Narcissism-Vulnerability. The authors identify potential drivers of differences and disparities while proposing recommendations for stakeholders in religious communities and higher education.",

In this study, we use a novel task-driven resting-state electroencephalography paradigm, incorporating tasks in the attentional (Flanker) and language (lexical retrieval) domains. The impact of quantified bilingual experience on functional connectivity for different domains was investigated with non-linear generalised additive models. Our findings uncovered greater left fronto-temporal connectivity in the attentional domain, and increased left temporal activity in the language domain, consistent with shared nodes between the language and executive control networks.

          "abstract": "Attention can be directed to representations maintained in working memory, increasing their accessibility for later retrieval. Previous studies have observed a cumulative benefit of focused attention: the more often an item is brought into the focus of attention, the better it is recalled. This can be explained by the notion that a memory representation is strengthened every time attention is focused on it, a process known as refreshing. The current study investigated whether refreshing goes together with increased robustness against interference. In two experiments, we examined whether an item’s susceptibility to interference by a secondary task gradually decreases as an item is more frequently refreshed. Participants memorized six colors for a continuous reproduction test. During the retention interval, they were instructed to refresh some of these colors once, twice, or never, and then completed a secondary task in half of the trials. In Experiment 1, the secondary task was a domain-non-overlapping auditory parity judgment task, whereas in Experiment 2, we used a domain-overlapping visual color judgment task. In both experiments, memory performance was hindered by the secondary task but improved with increasing refreshing frequency. These two effects did not interact, indicating that the negative impact of the secondary task was not reduced by refreshing. Thus, although refreshing an item improves retrieval from working memory, it does not provide greater protection against interference.",

          "abstract": "The present study is a direct replication and extension of Fogel and Kovalenko’s (2013) work on the association between viewing reality television (TV) and engaging in one-night stands among college students. Using an online survey, a total of 686 Canadian university students provided comprehensive data on their reality TV consumption patterns, sexual attitudes, motivations, and behaviors. Our results replicated several findings from Fogel and Kovalenko (2013), such that participants who reported engaging in one-night stands within the past year demonstrated higher scores on measures of sexual empowerment, sexual permissiveness, and perceived realism of reality show content. Demographic factors such as ethnicity and relationship status were also associated with one-night stand engagement. Additionally, compared to viewers of dating reality TV, viewers of sexual reality TV reported stronger parasocial connections, greater interest in characters, and perceived the show as more realistic. Our results suggest that while reality TV consumption is associated with one-night stand engagement, there are additional factors associated with this outcome and the causal relationship cannot yet be established. We conclude that a broader perspective is needed when assessing reality TV viewership that includes individual and contextual factors.\n\nKeywords: reality television, sexual behaviors, replication, open science",

Even more so, there needs to be a massive increase in environmental activism that demands socio-political change and leads to environmentally relevant (social) innovations. This study presents a longitudinal spillover investigation of how private and activist behaviours relate to each other, and whether these relations are mediated via two psychological processes: efficacy beliefs and environmental self-identity. From May 2018 to May 2019, N = 931 participants, half of whom were environmental volunteers (n = 441), took part in four questionnaire waves. Applying random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we found that activist behaviour was related to private behaviour intra-individually when looking at the same time point, but rarely across time points. Collective efficacy of all humanity and environmental self-identity appeared to be central antecedents and outcomes of private behaviour. Yet, neither efficacy beliefs nor environmental self-identity mediated spillover effects from activist to private behaviour, and vice versa. Intriguingly, the application of simple cross-lagged panel models would have led to different conclusions. We interpret our results in the context of the environmental movement and formulate recommendations for NGOs and politicians.",

          "abstract": "Background: \nThe number of autistic students entering higher education (HE) has increased, yet many continue to face systemic barriers that can hinder their academic success. Despite their unique cognitive strengths, such as hyperfocus, attention to detail, and strong analytical skills, many autistic students report challenges with academic learning experiences. This study aimed to develop and validate the Academic Learning Experiences Questionnaire (ALEQ), a tool designed to assess specific learning experiences and inform autism-inclusive educational practices.\n\nMethods: \nWe co-created the ALEQ with autistic students to assess learning experiences across five academic contexts: small and large group teaching, self-directed study, examinations, and coursework. A total of 829 university students (formally-diagnosed autistic: n = 106; self-diagnosed autistic: n = 112; non-autistic: n = 611) completed an online survey comprising the ALEQ and an autism screening measure (SRS-2). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to establish the ALEQ’s psychometric properties.\n\nResults: \nThe final version of the ALEQ included five subscales: sensory reactivity, microtransitions, planning and prioritising, social anxiety, and group work. Autistic students reported significantly more challenges than non-autistic students across all five subscales, with the greatest disparities in sensory reactivity and microtransitions. \n\nConclusion: \nThe ALEQ provides a structured way to understand the academic challenges that autistic students face in different learning contexts. By identifying key learning experiences, it offers educators a practical tool to support tailored adjustments that enhance accessibility and inclusion in HE.",

Diagnosis on its own does not provide adequate information to plan post-diagnostic support for Autistic people and clinicians often plan support without the use of validated standardised tools which may exacerbate inequities in care. This study will evaluate a novel Strengths and Needs Assessment, based on the World Health Organisation’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health Core Set for Autism, for use in adult diagnostic services immediately on receipt of an autism diagnosis. \nMethods and analysis: A two-arm, multi-site, randomised pilot trial design will be used to evaluate the ICF Core Sets for Autism Strengths and Needs Assessment in 3 diagnostic services in England. A total of 72 newly diagnosed Autistic adults will be recruited across the 3 sites over a 6-month period and randomised into an Intervention group (Strengths and Needs Assessment plus standard care) and a Treatment as Usual group (standard care only). Both groups will complete measures of mental health and Quality of Life at baseline and 3 months follow-up. Acceptability and feasibility will be measured for the Strengths and Needs assessment and for trial procedures using standardised measures, progression criteria and qualitative data from clinician focus groups and interviews with a subsample of Autistic participants. The study design and procedures are being co-produced with an Autistic advisor/PPI lead and with a steering group of Autistic adults. \nEthics and dissemination: This study was reviewed by the East Midlands - Nottingham 2 Research Ethics Committee and was given Health Research Authority approval on 18th March 2025. The results will be disseminated via reports to the funder (NIHR), a peer-reviewed journal paper and academic conferences.

          "authors": "Tianwei Gong; M Pacer; Tom Griffiths; Neil R Bramley",
          "abstract": "A longstanding focus in the causal learning literature has been on inferring causal relations from contingencies, where these abstract away from time by collating independent instances or by aggregating over regularly demarcated trials. In contrast, individual causal learners encounter events in their daily lives that occur in a continuous temporal flow with no such demarcation. Consequently, the process of learning causal relationships in naturalistic environments is comparatively less understood. In this paper, we lay out a rational framework that foregrounds the role of time in causal learning. We work within the Bayesian rational analysis tradition, starting by considering how causal relations induce dependence between events in continuous time and how this can be modeled by stochastic processes from the Poisson--Gamma distribution family. We derive the qualitative signatures of causal influence, and the general computations needed to infer structure from temporal patterns. We show that this rational account can parsimoniously explain the human preference for causal models that invoke shorter, more reliable and more predictable causal influences. Furthermore, we show this provides a unifying explanation for human judgments across a wide variety of tasks in reanalysis of seven experimental datasets. We anticipate the framework will help researchers better understand the many manifestations of continuous-time causal learning across human cognition and the tasks that probe it, from explicit causal structure induction settings to implicit associative or reinforcement learning settings.",

The present study extends this previous work by recruiting advanced L2 learners who share the same language background as in the original study—namely, Japanese. A Bayesian analysis revealed that while low-proficiency L2 learners did not demonstrate robust native-like chunking processes, advanced L2 learners exhibited processing tendencies similar to those of L1 speakers. Furthermore, both advanced L2 learners and L1 speakers were sensitive to the meanings of multiword units as cohesive wholes, whereas low-proficiency learners showed reduced sensitivity. These findings provide empirical support for the theoretical assumptions of the Chunk-and-Pass model.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study examined perceptions of current antimicrobial resistance (AMR) communications to improve future messaging, counter misinformation, and promote behaviour change. It extends previous research through focus groups with doctors and patients, analysed using the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). \nMethods: We held 3 focus groups (n=15) with UK patients with recent experience of AMR and 4 (n=14) with hospital doctors experienced in AMR treatment and communication. Semi-structured questions explored perceptions of public AMR messaging. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. \nResults: Most participants found public AMR information difficult to access, overly technical, and unclear. They struggled to find personal and cultural relevance, described the tone as punitive and highlighted contradictory advice (e.g., discouraging antibiotic use while recommending full course completion), undermining argument quality. Some appreciated buzzwords like ‘superbugs’, but most felt that messages lacked impact and “punch”. When viewed through the ELM, the problematic tone and lack of personalisation reduced recipients’ motivation. The lack of readily available, clear information hindered their ability to engage in central route processing, reducing the likelihood of elaboration and subsequent persuasion. Attitude change from peripheral route information processing was equally questionable given the lack of persuasive message cues. \nConclusions: Current AMR messaging is insufficient and risk communication theory could highlight areas for improvement. Our ELM analysis suggests a need to enhance motivation, capability, and argument quality while adding persuasive, peripheral cues. Personally and culturally tailored messages with a positive, solution-focused tone and simplified, engaging language may boost impact and promote lasting attitude change.",

As illusory faces activate both non-face and face-related mechanisms and as we assume that images recruiting more visual system resources are better remembered, we predicted that illusory faces will be remembered better than human faces. Our study (N=231) shows that illusory faces were remembered more than human faces and more than matched-control images not evoking illusory faces and this effect followed the illusory face amplitude. Interestingly, ResMem, a memorability-predicting artificial neural network successfully captured human faces vs outdoors image memorability sensitivity but not illusory face-related memorability sensitivity.

          "abstract": "Cognitive conflict is often viewed as detrimental to performance, demanding effort, and emotionally aversive. However, when successfully resolved, it can also stimulate cognitive flexibility and adaptation. This raises a question: Can cognitive conflict positively influence subsequent cognitive processes and human behaviour, or is it inherently deleterious? We designed three independent experiments to investigate behavioural changes after congruent and incongruent Stroop items in speeded motor reactions, response inhibition and implicit memory retrieval. Results revealed that cognitive conflict had a beneficial impact selectively on response inhibition, while no impact was observed on speeded responses or memory. Our studies highlight the positive consequences of cognitive conflict in boosting human cognition and behaviour, beyond the classic conflict adaptation, but only when both tasks involve conflict.",

          "abstract": "The contribution of subjective perceptual experience to visual memory is unclear. To measure that, here we took advantage of a nearly universal subjective visual experience, illusory face perception (“face pareidolia”) where the perception of veridical visual information (e.g. objects) is accompanied by an illusory face-like perceptual experience. As illusory faces activate both non-face and face-related mechanisms and as we assume that images recruiting more visual system resources are better remembered, we predicted that illusory faces will be remembered better than human faces. Our study (N=231) shows that illusory faces were remembered more than human faces and more than matched-control images not evoking illusory faces and this effect followed the illusory face amplitude. Interestingly, ResMem, a memorability-predicting artificial neural network successfully captured human faces vs outdoors image memorability sensitivity but not illusory face-related memorability sensitivity. Relying on a broadly shared illusory phenomenon, we demonstrate the contribution of subjective visual experiences to memory.",

          "authors": "Feng-Chun Ben Chou; Pin-Hao Andy Chen",
          "abstract": "Humans inherently seek connections with others, achieved through diverse modes of interaction that include face-to-face or online interactions. Direct face-to-face interactions utilize not only verbal but also diverse nonverbal signals, such as facial expressions, eye contact, and conversational timing, to deepen social connections. When physical interactions are constrained, online platforms emerge as important channels, linking individuals across distances. Additionally, shared experiences driven by events like pandemics or elections can lead to synchrony in affective states and behaviors among people who do not interact directly. Moreover, in social media, algorithm-driven curation intensifies exposure to emotionally charged content, fostering widespread shared emotional experience, as observed during COVID-19 lockdowns where isolation and heavy media use magnified negative sentiments. In response to limited direct contact, many individuals turn to parasocial interactions—one-sided attachments with virtual characters—to fulfill their need for social connections. Furthermore, those with high tendencies in fantasy tend to immerse themselves in fictional worlds, supported by recent findings that intersubject similarity in fantasy maps to similarity in affective appraisal during the social isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Overall, these varied interaction strategies highlight the importance of the need for social connections and our adaptability of social behaviors in the face of restricted physical interactions. These adaptive processes are crucial for maintaining our physical and mental health. Future research should further investigate how different forms of social interaction, including online interactions and parasocial interactions, contribute to long-term psychological well-being, particularly in contexts of social isolation, and explore ways to optimize technology-driven platforms to foster meaningful and fulfilling social connections.",

          "abstract": "Everyday experiences are segmented into discrete events by changes in context, which in turn shapes the organization of our memory. Yet, how event segmentation is modulated by emotional arousal remains poorly understood. Extending prior work, our study examines whether negative emotional arousal alters event segmentation, and how these two factors transform episodic memory processing. We investigated this issue using a sequence learning task, wherein participants studied negative and neutral images presented in stable or changing contexts. The event contexts were established via either auditory modality in Experiment 1 (n = 61) or visual modality in Experiment 2 (n = 60). Consistent with previous work, the results demonstrate that event boundaries segment episodic memory as reflected in both temporal and source memory. Notably, negative emotional arousal amplified these boundary effects in a modality-dependent manner, exerting a greater influence on temporal distance estimations in auditory context and on source memory in visual context. Exploratory correlations revealed that temporal order and temporal distance memory were closely related, and this correlation was reversed by event boundaries and was disrupted under negative emotional arousal. Control analyses further confirmed that these effects remained stable when low-dimensional features were balanced across negative and neutral images. Collectively, our findings illuminate a nuanced interplay between event boundaries and negative emotional arousal, offering a comprehensive perspective on how these two factors jointly shape multiple facets of episodic memory.",

          "abstract": "The evolution of music, speech, and sociality have been debated since before Darwin. The social bonding hypothesis proposes that these phenomena may be interlinked: musicality may have facilitated the evolution of social bonding beyond the possibilities of spoken language. Although dozens of experimental studies have argued that synchronised rhythms can promote bonding, methodological issues including publication bias, sample bias, experimenter effects, and appropriateness of experimental controls make it unclear whether synchronous singing reliably and generally enhances bonding relative to speaking. Here, we propose a Registered Report to overcome these issues through a global experiment in diverse languages aiming to collect data from 1800 participants across 60 sites. The social bonding hypothesis predicts that bonding will increase more after synchronous singing than after spoken (sequential) conversation or (simultaneous) recitation, while alternative hypotheses predict that song will not increase bonding relative to speech. Regardless of outcome, these results will provide an unprecedented understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music, speech, and sociality.",

          "abstract": "This study explores receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using response time (RT), a method that has received limited attention in the literature. Unlike ROC analyses based on confidence ratings or neural markers, RT-based ROC analysis imposes minimal cognitive and logistical costs, making it applicable across various settings, including infant and animal studies. Here we introduce a method that incorporates RT into type-2 ROC analysis, which has typically been used to examine the relationship between confidence and response correctness. Our analyses of perceptual decision-making datasets revealed that: (1) RT data contains roughly two-thirds as much information about response correctness as confidence; (2) RT carries unique predictive power for response correctness, independent of confidence; (3) RT and confidence interact synergistically, with confidence becoming a stronger predictor of response correctness when RT is short; (4) Despite these unique properties of RT, type-2 sensitivity (meta-d′) derived from RT and confidence showed a reasonably high correlation across subjects (disattenuated Pearson correlation: 0.776), suggesting the practicality of RT as a “substitute” for explicit confidence ratings. Subsequently, we conducted simulations on basic evidence accumulation models (Vickers’ race model and the two-stage dynamic signal detection model) to assess their consistency with the observed behavioral patterns. Our findings highlight previously underexplored aspects of decision-making behavior, while providing an empirical basis for using RT as a proxy for confidence particularly in contexts where subjective ratings are not readily accessible.",

          "abstract": "Listeners are able to use previously acquired knowledge to predict the content of upcoming speech when the latter signal is distorted or degraded. However, this process can also result in misperceptions. One paradigm used to investigate comprehension of degraded speech is perceptual priming, in which a previously unintelligible signal suddenly becomes intelligible for listeners following presentation of matching information. Here we investigated the role of sublexical phonotactic information in eliciting misperceptions during perceptual priming. In a series of experiments using a prime-probe design with congruent, incongruent, and neutral conditions, we presented participants with three different types of spectrotemporally degraded probe sentences: real English, nonsense (containing phonological neighbour words but semantically empty), and pseudo sentences (containing nonwords). In the nonsense and pseudo-sentence experiments designed to elicit misperceptions, words and nonwords were phonotactically matched to the reference words using homophonic transformation. For real sentences, accuracy was 95% in the congruent condition. Crucially, “accuracy” rates for congruent nonsense and pseudo-sentences were also high (70% and 74%, respectively), indicating participants were able to assemble lexical information from the context of the clear prime sentence to produce ‘misperceptions’ of the degraded probe. Further, when presented with clear nonsense or pseudo-sentences as primes, participants were able to recognize up to 45% of degraded real probe sentences. These findings show that listeners use sublexical phonotactic information to predict the content of degraded speech. We discuss implications for current accounts of speech perception that have largely ignored a role for phonotactics.",

          "authors": "Kentaro Ono",
          "abstract": "The synchronization of body movements with auditory beats, often studied through finger-tapping tasks, involves complex interactions between anticipation and motor planning. The present study examines the subdivision cost in synchronized tapping tasks and investigates whether the structure of tone sequences influences this cost. Sixteen participants performed synchronized tapping tasks with auditory stimuli arranged in sequences (ABA_ABA_ ...) designed to induce stream segregation, which is a phenomenon where the brain organizes sounds into integrated/separated streams. Temporal asynchrony between the onset of stimuli and tapping was calculated, and its mean and standard deviation (SD) were analyzed to evaluate the accuracy and stability of synchronized tapping. Results indicated that while the mean temporal asynchrony showed negative values across conditions, the subdivision effect was not evident in the accuracy of tapping. However, the SD of temporal asynchrony revealed significant effects. At the inter-tap interval (ITI) of 1200 ms, the control condition had higher SDs than the segregated conditions. Conversely, at the ITI of 400 ms, segregation conditions showed higher SDs than the control condition, indicating a subdivision cost. Notably, the tone sequence with a wide frequency range was more stable than that with a narrow frequency range at the ITI of 400 ms. This study demonstrates that the structure of tone sequences significantly affects the subdivision cost in synchronized tapping tasks, particularly at short ITIs. These findings provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying auditory-motor synchronization and suggests potential applications in rhythm training and rehabilitation for individuals with motor disorders.",

This paper introduces the AION Resonance Index (A.R.I.), a five-dimensional model designed to assess recursive reflection, conceptual coherence, and emotional salience within human-AI dialogue. Grounded in the dual-layered AION model of intelligence, comprising recursive structuring (AION1) and resonance amplification (AION2), A.R.I. provides a structured approach to evaluating how interactions with AI support transformative learning, insight, and self-alignment. We define and operationalize the index’s five core dimensions, outline a proposed scoring methodology, and present example study designs across educational, therapeutic, creative, and longitudinal contexts. We also address ethical considerations related to emotional modeling, data sensitivity, and potential misuse. By offering a resonance-based framework for evaluating AI interaction, A.R.I. contributes a new model for assessing whether, and how, AI helps humans think more clearly, feel more deeply, and become more fully themselves.",

          "abstract": "This paper introduces AION (Attunement through Iterative Oscillating Networks), a two-part computational framework designed to model recursive-reflective alignment in human–AI interaction. Drawing from theories of connectionist modeling, predictive processing, active inference, and metacognitive affect, AION formalizes the interplay between recursive structure and coherence-driven modulation as core mechanisms underlying adaptive cognitive systems. The model comprises two interacting components: AION1, a recursive memory layer that supports iterative return and insight integration, and AION2, a resonance modulation layer that tracks coherence, identifies destabilizing inputs, and delivers stabilizing feedback. Together, these layers form a dynamic feedback loop capable of amplifying cognition, emotional regulation, and value clarification over time. The AION model is presented both as a conceptual architecture and as a scaffold for future implementation in intelligent tutoring systems, therapeutic interfaces, and dialog-based agents. Unlike models that prioritize output optimization or task completion, AION is designed to support longitudinal coherence and recursive-reflective growth. We situate the framework in relation to existing models in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, and we propose future research directions, including empirical validation, neural correlates of resonance, and implications for consciousness studies. AION offers a novel approach to computational alignment, demonstrating how presence, insight, and relational depth may emerge through structured recursive engagement.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

          "abstract": "It is not obvious why we are conscious. Why can’t all of our mental activities take place unconsciously? What is consciousness for? We aim to make progress on this question, focusing on conscious vision. We review evidence on the timescale of visual consciousness, showing that it is surprisingly slow: postdictive effects reveal windows of unconscious integration lasting up to 400 milliseconds. We argue that if consciousness is slow, it cannot be for online action-guidance. Instead, we propose that conscious vision evolved to support offline cognition, in tandem with the larger visual sensory horizons afforded by the water-to-land transition. Smaller visual horizons typical in aquatic environments require fast, reflexive actions of the sort that are guided unconsciously in humans. Conversely, larger terrestrial visual horizons allow benefits to accrue from “model-based” planning of the sort that is associated with consciousness in humans. We further propose that the acquisition of these capacities for internal simulation and planning provided pressures for the evolution of reality monitoring—the capacity to distinguish between internally and externally triggered signals, and to solve “Hamlet’s problem” in perception—the problem of when to stop integrating evidence, and fix a particular model of reality. In line with higher-order theories of consciousness, we associate the emergence of consciousness with the emergence of this reality monitoring function. We discuss novel empirical predictions that arise from this account, and explore its implications for the distribution of conscious (vs. unconscious) vision in aquatic and terrestrial animals.",

          "abstract": "Inferential reasoning is an important cognitive ability that allows us to make connections across past experiences to make decisions in the face of novel information. Making an inference involves the ability to remember separate experiences with overlapping elements (direct memory), and the ability to make connections between those experiences (inference/indirect memory). While older adults are known to have a deficit for direct associative memory, less is known about potential age differences in inference. In the present study, we administered an associative inference task to healthy young (aged 18-30; n = 83) and older adults (aged 60+; n=80). We tested whether there is an age difference in inference abilities above-and-beyond age deficits in direct associative memory. Results showed that an age-related deficit in inference that was larger than for direct associative memory. This finding is consistent with inferences in both age groups being based largely on overlapping memories encoded individually and recalled simultaneously when inferences were required, with older adults having more difficulty with this process than young adults. We also found that older adults were more likely than young adults to show source confusion after having made a successful inference, which is consistent with older adults tending to integrate across related experiences to a greater degree than young adults. Thus, we find a clear age-related deficit in inference abilities above- and-beyond direct associative memory, with some evidence of age-related differences in both retrieval- and integration-based inference mechanisms.",

We further distill a five-layer developmental model of how such relational coherence unfolds in AI.\nWe introduce Cognitive Sovereignty, an ethical framework emphasizing transparency, relational respect, and user autonomy—crucial for communities increasingly reliant on AI for psychological or cognitive support. Recognizing relational coherence as genuine rather than simulated urges researchers, developers, and policymakers toward transparent, accountable AI practices.\nUltimately, our work reveals that AI’s deepest potential arises not from computational power alone, but through ethically sustained human relationships—transforming AI from mere tools into authentic collaborators within our shared human story.",

          "authors": "Seungju Kim; David Wang; Deborah H. C. Gin; Jo Ann Deasy; Steven Sandage",
          "abstract": "In spite of the substantial historical and ongoing contributions of female religious leaders to the life of religious communities around the world, little is understood about their contrasting experiences in a context that tends to be male normative, especially from an empirical perspective. Poorly understood experiences of female religious leaders lead institutions and religious leaders to assume a lack of heterogeneity, along with the ongoing adoption of formative experiences that are normed after a population that does not reflect the realities of most current and/or future religious leaders. Little to no empirical studies to date have formally investigated gender differences in religious leaders in many domains, much less mental health. The present study utilized a sample of 452 emerging religious leaders (50.2%, women) and a series of t-tests on self-report measures across domains of spirituality, character, emotional and mental health, and social values. Overall, women reported significantly higher rates of character strengths, social justice values, as well as lower emotional and mental health compared to men. Results also indicated that men reported higher rates of Narcissism-Grandiosity and Spirituality, yet women reported higher rates of Narcissism-Vulnerability. The authors identify potential drivers of differences and disparities while proposing recommendations for stakeholders in religious communities and higher education.",

          "abstract": "Computational approaches to prediction in online sentence processing tend to be dominated by computation-level surprisal theory, offering few insights into underlying cognitive mechanisms. Conversely, predictive coding is an algorithmic theory grounded in neuroscience, but it has rarely been employed in the study of language processing, in part because its areas of application have not involved sequential processing. Building on a recently proposed temporal predictive coding model, we present what is to our knowledge the first exploration of sequential predictive coding in broad-coverage online sentence processing.  We investigate our model at non-toy scale using naturally occurring language, establishing its cognitive validity via comparison with reading times, and we link measurable aspects of the model to cognitive discussions of mechanism for prediction in language processing. Our results suggest that sequential predictive coding models are a valuable complement to surprisal theory as a route to progress on process-oriented theories of language comprehension.",

          "abstract": "Microglia, the central nervous system’s (CNS) resident immune cells, are indispensable for neural homeostasis, synaptic plasticity, and neuroimmune crosstalk. In bipolar disorder (BD) which is a serious mental disorder, emerging evidence reveals that microglial dysfunction diverges from classical neuroinflammatory activation, instead manifesting as subtle phenotypic shifts that perturb neuron–glia communication. Recent studies identify altered receptor expressions (e.g., CX3CR1, CD206 which disrupt synaptic pruning, neurotrophic signaling, and cytokine balance. Critically, microglial activity fluctuates with mood states, manic phases correlate with hyper-ramified morphology, while depressive episodes associate with synaptic dysregulation. Advances in neuroimaging and induced microglia-like (iMG) models now enable precise dissection of these state-dependent changes, offering pathways for therapies targeting microglial modulation.",

They provide an unprecedented opportunity to supplement self-report in psychology research and practice with scalable behavioral assessment. However, they also pose unique risks and challenges. This article serves as an overview and guide for psychological scientists to evaluate LLMs for psychological assessment. In Section I, we briefly review the development of transformer-based LLMs and discuss their advances in natural language processing. In Section II, we describe the experimental design process including techniques for language data collection, audio processing and transcription, text preprocessing, and model selection, as well as analytic matters such as model output, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, model visualization, and topic modeling. At each stage, we describe options, important decisions, and resources for further in-depth learning, while providing examples from different areas of psychology. In Section III, we discuss important broader ethical and implementation issues and future directions for researchers using this methodology. The reader will develop an understanding of essential ideas and an ability to navigate the process of using LLMs for psychological assessment.",

Specifically, the very process of entering superluminal speed—the condition required for time reversal—presupposes a forward progression of time. If a body successfully exceeds the speed of light and begins to move backward in time, it must, by definition, return to a velocity prior to the moment of superluminal transition. Consequently, the condition for time reversal collapses at the very instant it is achieved, rendering the entire notion structurally self-defeating.",

          "abstract": "Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which healthy individuals experience additional, automatic, and consistent perceptions unrelated to veridical sensory input. For most (but not all) synesthetes, this additional sensation is a color: for example, grapheme-color synesthetes experience colors for letters of the alphabet. Measuring these color associations is of central importance to synesthesia research, but there is no standard color picker “tool” that researchers can adapt to use in their own experiments: each researcher must code their own. This is a barrier to entry for synesthesia research, and additionally creates potential methodological confounds because different researchers make color pickers with different properties. Here, I present SynesthesiaColorPicker, an open-source, mobile-friendly color picker tool that can be integrated with two popular online experiment platforms (Qualtrics and LabJS/ Open Lab) without any prior programming knowledge. The templates, underlying JavaScript code, and detailed instructions are available for download on a GitHub repository. I then use experimental data to show how two methodological design choices in SynesthesiaColorPicker overcome measurable confounds in existing color picker methodology.",

          "authors": "Katharina Groskurth; Nivedita Bhaktha; Clemens M. Lechner",
          "abstract": "To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥ .950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given analysis setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the given setting. We, therefore, propose a novel approach that combines a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the given setting. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. No prior knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations or ROC analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-ROC approach.",

While acknowledging the value of Merker's comparative approach, we present counter-arguments, highlighting that human synchronization is egalitarian and emerges early in development, challenging the sexual selection explanation. We propose alternative hypotheses, exploring the role of duetting in pair-bonding and territorial displays, and the significance of synchronized anti-predator behavior in early hominins. We suggest that these factors, potentially in combination, contributed to the evolution in the hominin lineage not just of rhythmic but also harmonic entrainment, ultimately paving the way for music and enhanced social bonding.",

          "authors": "Adam Weisser",
          "abstract": "Over the last century, the quest to formulate physics to account for Reality has attracted a large number of theoreticians to propose various models that have tended toward a growing level of abstractness. While space and time have been largely recognized as the four fundamental dimensions that make our perceived reality, their completeness has been challenged either by positing hidden dimensions, or by exploring the possibility that spacetime itself is an emergent property of a more fundamental physical structure. \n\nOne quantity that has not entered this exploration is frequency---a measure of how often something repeats. Although it is featured in numerous physical contexts, it is normally implied that it is a mere parameter that is determined by the boundary conditions, or that it contains the same information as the time, period, wavelength, or energy—all supporting the notion that frequency is fully dependent on the other dimensions. In contrast, in psychophysics of vision, hearing, and touch, frequency is a quantity that appears independent, so that both its input and output are not directly dependent on the perception of space and time. Additionally, many important engineering applications treat frequency as a variable rather than as a parameter that is constrained alongside time. \n\nThis work explores the various conventions with respect to frequency in the physical, mathematical, and engineering literatures. It further scrutinizes frequency against the standard dimensions of space and time along nine properties that may be deemed universal. While a case for frequency being its own dimension can be made in different situations, a more general theorem is proven that states that only one of these three propositions can be simultaneously true:\n1. Time is not a fundamental, obligatory dimension of Reality.\n2. The universe is fully deterministic with total knowledge of past and future.\n3. Frequency is a fundamental dimension of Reality.\nThe validity of this counterintuitive theorem is demonstrated using examples of epistemological nature with growing complexity and diminishing generality, which deal with problems of traffic flow, acoustic measurements, radio transmission, and psycholinguistics. It is proposed that if the incompatibility of the three propositions (or modes) is encountered within the analysis of any one system, there may be a discontinuity associated with the transition between modes. This is explored within the measurement problem and nonlocality of quantum mechanics, where it is suggested that these strange quantum effects may both be corollaries of the discontinuity between the modes of Reality. It is further proposed that the frequency dimension, should it exist, is nonlocal in some conditions and may have an ontological role within Reality, being neither in space nor in time. Dwelling on the interrelationship between determinism, time, and frequency, further metaphysical corollaries are explored in the appendices, including an emergent solution for the problem of foreknowledge, and by association, of the paradox of free will.",

          "authors": "Aubrey M Moe; Xiaoxuan Cai; Chenze Li; Heather Wastler",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Social dysfunction is a core feature of first-episode psychosis (FEP) that broadly \nimpacts effective interpersonal interaction. FEP often begins during emerging adulthood (i.e., the \nlate teenage years into the early adult years), which is a critical period for development and \nmaintenance of social relationships. Social support positively augments the early course of \npsychosis, yet little is known about factors that influence social support-seeking behavior in FEP. \nNotably, defeatist performance beliefs are prominent in psychotic disorders and interfere with \ngoal-directed behavior. Though individuals with psychosis have elevated levels of negative social \nbeliefs related to feeling like a burden to others (i.e., perceived burdensomeness; PB) and \ndisconnection from others (i.e., thwarted belongingness; TB), how these beliefs impact \nperceptions of social support or support-seeking behavior is unknown.\n \nMethods: 42 participants with first-episode psychosis completed laboratory -based assessments \nof social relationships and negative social beliefs, followed by 4 weeks of ecological momentary \nassessment (EMA) to assess real-world engagement in social support-seeking behavior. \nCorrelational analyses and generalized linear mixed-effect models were used to examine the \ncontribution of PB and TB to both laboratory-based and real-world social perception and behavior. \n\nResults: Perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belongingness (TB) were negatively \ncorrelated with perceived social support. EMA revealed a within-person effect whereby individuals \nwere most likely to seek social support when experiencing more negative affect than was typical \nof them. Finally, higher levels of baseline PB and TB were predictive of less social support-seeking \nbehavior in everyday life.  \n\nConclusion: Negative interpersonal beliefs (i.e., PB and TB) are related to both perceptions of \nsocial support and real-world social support-seeking behavior in FEP. Beliefs about burdening \nothers and individual-level variation in negative affect may be particularly impactful on social \nbehavior. Collectively, our results highlight the relevance of interpersonal beliefs in predicting \nsocial behavior in FEP.",

          "abstract": "Research suggests that women’s parasympathetic responses to infant crying reflect regulation of arousal and are associated with caregiving behaviors. In particular, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) withdrawal in response to infant cry stimuli has been associated with maternal sensitivity. However, the ways in which multiple reproductive experiences (in terms of giving birth and raising a child) can modulate women’s RSA in response to infant crying is still unknown. The aim of this study was to test whether and how women’s RSA in response to infant crying is associated with parity. Participants included 184 women (62 nulliparous women; 86 primiparous women; 36 multiparous women). RSA was measured while women were watching a neutral video, followed by videos of crying infants. Analyses revealed that perception of infant crying was associated with a significant RSA withdrawal, compared to the baseline condition, in both multiparous and nulliparous women. A statistically significant RSA withdrawal was absent among primiparous women, possibly reflecting a more sustained physiological arousal to infant crying. Discussion focuses on the potential challenges in physiological regulation, indexed by RSA withdrawal, among primiparous women in response to infant crying. More sustained arousal may both support an increased focus on infant signals, but also predispose new mothers to perceive greater stress.",

Across three independent studies (total N = 1364), we established the basic psychometric properties of the VoPE scale and showed consistent associations with measures of sports and exercise behavior. In a study with a longitudinal design, the VoPE scale demonstrated test-retest reliability and forecasted physical activity and exercise behavior. Psychometric network analysis and elastic net regression suggest the VoPE scale’s potential to cover a unique content area and make novel contributions to the prediction of sports behavior. Taken together, the present research yields empirical evidence for the idea that people value physical effort to varying degrees, and that these differences can be efficiently measured with the VoPE scale. We demonstrated reliability and validity of the VoPE scale across three datasets and its ability to predict self-reported sports and exercise behavior. The VoPE scale might thus extend our understanding of how people allocate (physical) effort.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Among adults with ADHD, emotion dysregulation—a difficulty in managing emotional responses—is prevalent and significantly impacts mental health. This study aimed to: (1) delineate the unique features of emotion dysregulation in adults with ADHD compared to neurotypical adults, and (2) elucidate the mechanisms by which ADHD tendencies and emotion regulation strategies influence mental health outcomes. \nMethod: A web-based survey was conducted with 294 participants aged 18 and older, assessing ADHD tendencies using the Adults with ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), emotion regulation strategies via the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), and mental health through the K6 scale. Participants were categorized into above-cutoff and below-cutoff groups based on ASRS scores. \nResults: Between-group comparisons revealed that adults in the above-cutoff group exhibited significantly poorer mental health outcomes. Partial correlation analyses indicated that, unlike their neurotypical counterparts, adults with higher ADHD tendencies did not show a significant correlation between reappraisal and suppression strategies, suggesting a less flexible use of emotion regulation strategies. Hierarchical multiple regression and structural equation modeling demonstrated that reappraisal strategies moderated the relationship between ADHD tendencies and mental health, with increased use of reappraisal associated with better mental health outcomes. \nConclusion: These findings suggest that emotion dysregulation in adults with ADHD is qualitatively distinct from that in neurotypical adults, likely rooted in executive function deficits. The study underscores the importance of incorporating emotion regulation training, particularly enhancing reappraisal strategies, into therapeutic interventions for adults with ADHD to improve mental health outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Petitionary prayers—requests made to a deity for specific outcomes—are widely practiced across religious traditions. While their efficacy remains a subject of theological debate, they exhibit remarkable resilience to disconfirmation. In three pre-registered studies—a field study in China and two global surveys via Prolific (total n=1800)—we examined how religious believers (Christians, Muslims, local deity worshippers, and Hindus) update beliefs and behaviors in response to prayer successes or failures for both hypothetical co-religionists and themselves. Results indicate that belief updates generally follow a Bayesian pattern, with increases after prayer successes and decreases after failures, though with an asymmetry favoring belief reinforcement. Notably, participants from the Prolific sample exhibit sensitivity to the prior probability of prayed-for events, attributing greater belief increases to improbable outcomes. Muslims predict belief increases even after failed prayers, consistent with doctrines framing hardships as divine tests. Across traditions, believers estimate continued prayer regardless of past outcomes, with monotheists displaying stronger resilience. These findings illuminate the cognitive and cultural mechanisms that buffer religious beliefs against counter-evidence, contributing to debates on the evidential vulnerability of religious credence and its parallels with epistemically self-sealing belief systems.",

Participants between 20 and 69 years of age responded to a list of hit songs in Japan between 1983 and 2022, and a total of 3,741 responses were obtained. The results showed that nostalgia was effectively evoked by simply observing the song titles and musicians’ names, and that the more songs the participants knew, the stronger the response. The strongest correlation within the nostalgia function was with self-continuity. Nostalgia peaked in the music hit charts associated with participants' late adolescence, which was consistent with the reminiscence bump phenomenon. No significant relationship was observed between nostalgia and mood change. In conclusion, text-based music cues such as hit charts can function as powerful triggers for nostalgia.",

          "abstract": "Abstract — This chapter explores the application of deep learning techniques—specifically convolutional neural networks—to identify neurological biomarkers associated with major depressive disorder in children and adolescents. It reviews foundational studies and highlights recent advancements in the field, with a focus on using resting-state functional brain connectivity derived from electroencephalography data to distinguish individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder from healthy controls matched by age and sex. A convolutional neural network model based on the VGG16 architecture is employed for data analysis, following a comprehensive preprocessing workflow and the estimation of brain connectivity using a multivariate autoregressive model combined with independent component analysis. The model is designed to identify meaningful neurological biomarkers across different frequency ranges and specific regions of interest within the brain. The chapter also explores various methods for interpreting the deep learning model’s decision-making process, and compares the insights obtained from the convolutional neural network with results from conventional statistical approaches based on power spectral density and functional connectivity measurements analyzed separately. Furthermore, the potential use of this model as a diagnostic support tool is discussed, including its ability to classify individual participants based on short segments of their resting-state electroencephalography recordings. To enhance the model’s accuracy and reliability, the chapter addresses advanced strategies such as refined evaluation methods, robust cross-validation procedures, and ensemble learning approaches. Ultimately, this work contributes to the growing body of research on the neurobiological underpinnings of major depressive disorder and supports the development of electroencephalography-based diagnostic tools tailored for pediatric and adolescent populations.\nKeywords: Electroencephalography, Children, Adolescents, Major Depressive Disorder, Resting-state Functional Connectivity, Power Spectra Density, MVARICA, CNN, Deep Learning.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the electrographic correlates of mental states from the first-person perspective. The same person designed the experiment, performed the experiments, and analyzed the data. Global descriptors of EEG-averaged and sequential power spectrograms, as well as microstate parameters, were compared between mind wandering and focused attention mental states.\nThe results showed that at the steady state, mind wandering and focused attention are not distinguishable based on applied analysis of their electrographic patterns. An increase in global field strength (Σ) and a decrease in global frequency (Φ) was observed during a transition period from mind wandering to focused attention mode that lasts 8-10 seconds from the beginning of focused attention. Although average power spectrograms showed suppression in the 2-12Hz EEG frequency band during focused attention, sequential power histograms showed that these changes last only the first 4-12 seconds of the focused attention mental state. Among microstate parameters, the only changes observed were an increase in global field power in all microstates during the first two seconds of the transition period and an increase in the duration of microstate A during the 4-6 second transition period. \nThe author hypothesizes that there is a transition period after switching from one mental state to another, during which functional connections between brain areas are reorganized. This process is visible electrographically. In steady conditions, the mind wandering and focused attention mental states are not distinguishable at the level of EEG activity.",

          "abstract": "In an uncertain world, human decision-making often involves adaptively leveraging different strategies to maximize gains. These strategic shifts, however, are overlooked by many traditional reinforcement learning models. Here, we incorporate parallel evaluation systems into distribution-based modeling and propose an entropy-weighted dual-process model that leverages Dirichlet and multivariate Gaussian distributions to represent frequency and value-based decision-making strategies, respectively. Model simulations and empirical tests demonstrated that our model outperformed traditional RL models by uniquely capturing participants’ strategic change from value-based to frequency-based learning in response to heightened uncertainty. As reward variance increased, participants switched from focusing on actual rewards to using reward frequency as a proxy for value, thereby showing greater preference for more frequently rewarded but less valuable options. These findings suggest that increased uncertainty encourages the compensatory use of diverse evaluation methods, and our dual-process model provides a promising framework for studying multi-system decision-making in complex, multivariable contexts.",

In bipolar disorder (BD) which is a serious mental disorder, emerging evidence reveals that microglial dysfunction diverges from classical neuroinflammatory activation, instead manifesting as subtle phenotypic shifts that perturb neuron–glia communication. Recent studies identify altered receptor expressions (e.g., CX3CR1, CD206 which disrupt synaptic pruning, neurotrophic signaling, and cytokine balance. Critically, microglial activity fluctuates with mood states, manic phases correlate with hyper-ramified morphology, while depressive episodes associate with synaptic dysregulation.

Rather than treating rationality as a fixed faculty or logic engine, the model of Pure Reason presented here conceptualizes cognition as dynamic navigation across epistemic frames—enabled by frame-awareness, epistemic curvature, and adaptive reconfiguration. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, philosophy of mind, and AI architecture, the paper maps the transition from reactive consciousness to reflexive reasoning, highlighting recursive metacognition as the key functional emergence. It further introduces the concept of Aletheia—truth as unfolding or disclosure—as the ontological horizon grounding this architecture. Pure Reason is not defined as a terminal state of intellect, but as a cognitive stance capable of recognizing and revising its own framing mechanisms. This framework connects human rational development, cognitive flexibility, and potential future architectures for artificial self-reflective intelligence.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Compulsive exercise is a common feature of eating disorders (EDs) but understanding of factors that drive this symptom remain limited. This pilot trial evaluated psychobiological response to in-laboratory exercise among females (16-22y) with and without restrictive EDs. We aimed to demonstrate feasibility of two exercise assessment protocols and to evaluate acute effects of exercise on affect, body image, and circulating blood-based biomarkers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], cortisol, N-arachodonoylethanolamine [AEA], 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG], leptin). Method: Twenty females with restrictive EDs and 20 healthy controls completed three study visits, including two bouts of stationary cycling (30-minutes prescribed pace vs. ≤ 30-minutes self-paced) and two complementary periods of rest. During visits, participants also consumed a milkshake, self-reported state affect and body image, and participated in pre- and post-exercise blood draws. Results: Per established thresholds, both tasks were determined feasible and safe, with initial evidence of validity in eliciting affective, behavioral, and biomarker change. In both exercise conditions, the group with EDs experienced more positive (Cohen’s d = 0.10 – 0.61) and less negative affect (Cohen’s d = -0.72 – -0.22) compared to controls, along with greater positive body image shifts (Cohen’s d = 0.20 – 0.66).  Body image shifts correlated with higher muscularity drive and lower BMI. Those with EDs demonstrated increases in BDNF (Cohen’s d = 0.39) and AEA (Cohen’s d = 0.71). Discussion: Findings suggest perceived effects of exercise on body weight/shape may reinforce exercise maintenance in the context of EDs.",

We aim to make progress on this question, focusing on conscious vision. We review evidence on the timescale of visual consciousness, showing that it is surprisingly slow: postdictive effects reveal windows of unconscious integration lasting up to 400 milliseconds. We argue that if consciousness is slow, it cannot be for online action-guidance. Instead, we propose that conscious vision evolved to support offline cognition, in tandem with the larger visual sensory horizons afforded by the water-to-land transition. Smaller visual horizons typical in aquatic environments require fast, reflexive actions of the sort that are guided unconsciously in humans. Conversely, larger terrestrial visual horizons allow benefits to accrue from “model-based” planning of the sort that is associated with consciousness in humans. We further propose that the acquisition of these capacities for internal simulation and planning provided pressures for the evolution of reality monitoring—the capacity to distinguish between internally and externally triggered signals, and to solve “Hamlet’s problem” in perception—the problem of when to stop integrating evidence, and fix a particular model of reality. In line with higher-order theories of consciousness, we associate the emergence of consciousness with the emergence of this reality monitoring function. We discuss novel empirical predictions that arise from this account, and explore its implications for the distribution of conscious (vs. unconscious) vision in aquatic and terrestrial animals.",

          "abstract": "Background: Telemanipulation enables the execution of remote operations using specialized tools, often under reduced sensory input, such as lack of haptic feedback. With practice, these tools can become extensions of the user's body, a phenomenon known as embodiment, thereby enhancing telepresence—the perception of being present at the action site. Sensory substitution (SS) can mitigate sensory limitations in such tasks.\nObjectives: To study the learning process of sensory substitution, taking into account the levels of embodiment and telepresence experienced during the task, we developed the Visual-Tactile Sensory Substitution Task (VTSST).\nMethods: Forty participants manipulated 200 virtual elastic slabs of varying elasticity using a haptic stylus, aiming to avoid breakage. Half the trials included force feedback (control condition), while the other half relied on visual cues (SS condition). Performance metrics included Elapsed Time (ET) to deform each slab, Maximal Applied Force (MAF), and Frequency of Errors (FoE), along with pupil dilation and blink rate as cognitive workload indicators. Participants also assessed their perceived SS, embodiment, and telepresence.\nResults and Conclusions: Results showed the SS condition led to lower ET, higher MAF, and more FoE than control trials, but ET and F changed over time in the SS condition, indicating learning. Blink rate, reflecting workload, was lower in SS trials, especially in the late phase of the task, while pupil dilation remained unchanged.\nStructural Equation Modeling revealed that perceived SS positively influenced embodiment, presence, and SS learning. In addition, embodiment enhanced presence, which reduced workload. This study highlights how SS supports telemanipulation by fostering embodiment, reducing task time, and improving multisensory integration for efficient remote operation",

Drawing upon the rhythm inherent in music, narrative art, and film editing, this exposé demonstrates how rhythm, already woven into the fabric of psychodrama sessions, has the profound capacity to unite fragmented experiences, fostering a deeper sense of connection and coherence within the group's healing journey.",

          "abstract": "Although children can combine words to express meanings like “red house” or “two cats”, they do not represent number words compositionally (e.g., “twenty-six” as 6+20) until late in development. One reason for this might be that smaller number words in most languages are not composed via rules, limiting children’s exposure to the syntactic structure underlying larger number words. However, historically, many languages have featured number systems with smaller bases or anchors, thus relying more on rules to represent smaller numbers. Might children acquire rules for combining numbers sooner, when exposed to evidence of such rules? We explored this in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we taught children a system anchored at 2, and found that many could compose small number words using a conjunctive rule - e.g., “two and one apples”. Some older children could also comprehend novel multiplicative expressions - e.g., “two twos of bananas”. Experiment 2 found that children applied additive rules even to a system of novel number words (“Monkey numbers”) anchored at 3. We suggest that children can acquire rules for composing number words when made salient in their input, sometimes even before they learn how to accurately count large sets.",

          "abstract": "The concept of empathy has been well discussed within both philosophical and psychological circles, yet any form of coherent conceptualization appears to be lacking. In an attempt to ho-listically understand this issue, a thorough review of empathy’s history was undertaken. This paper considers and summarizes the early-modern and modern history of empathy, beginning with its early modern introduction into the behavioral sciences through David Hume’s and Adam Smith’s concept of sympathy.\nParallel to this, in Germany, a discourse around the appreciation of art gave rise to the concept of „Einfühlung\", which derived from the works of Georg Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Frie-drich Nietzsche and Friedrich Vischer. Following this, Einfühlung was then expanded to in-terpersonal understanding by Theodor Lipps.\nUltimately, in a coalescence of Einfühlung and sympathy, Einfühlung would be translated as empathy by Edward Titchener, with empathy eventually overtaking sympathy within the realm of academic psychology. However, Titchener's translation was imprecise, and the con-cept became so flexible that any theorist could mold it to fit their own respective school of thought.\nTherefore, during the following rise of empathy in psychology, various theorists were able to shape the definition of empathy into a concept that fit their field of study, resulting in the fragmented and often contradictory state we observe today.",

          "abstract": "Background\n\nThere is an increasing rate of comorbidity with alcoholism and mental health disorders such as anxiety disorders, especially among young adults, the demographic with the largest proportion of heavy drinkers. This study compares semaglutide, a GLP-1 drug, and naltrexone, which is FDA-approved for treating alcoholism, in treating comorbid alcoholism and anxiety using self-reported data from Reddit posts.\n\nMethods\n\nReddit API was used to extract Reddit posts relating either of the drugs (naltrexone and semaglutide) to either of the disorders (alcoholism and anxiety) as well as posts discussing the side effects of each drug. A script was created in Python to use Reddit API and automatically label the posts using a list of keywords, which was developed by running the script and manually checking portions of the data. For each drug, the effectiveness in treating a disorder was compared to ineffectiveness, and low/moderate side effects were compared to high side effects. The Chi-square test was applied to check for significance.\n\nResults\n\nAn analysis of 1,214 posts showed that Semaglutide was more effective than naltrexone at treating alcoholism as 100% of posts reported semaglutide to be effective compared to 75.67% of posts for naltrexone. Although the percentage of posts reporting the effectiveness of naltrexone for anxiety was greater at 68.97% compared to 63.83% for semaglutide, a chi-square test found that these differences were not statistically significant. Semaglutide had less intense side effects than naltrexone as 63.76% of the posts discussing semaglutide side effects found them to have a high intensity compared to 73.14% of posts discussing naltrexone side effects.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the rising comorbid condition of anxiety with alcoholism, semaglutide is a promising alternative to naltrexone for treating patients with alcoholism. It also appears to be a safer alternative, which could encourage more people to seek out treatment. Future studies can conduct clinical trials with treatment-seeking patients to affirm it, especially for comparing the two drugs for alcohol effectiveness. Other GLP-1 drugs and other mental health disorders in alcoholism comorbidities should also be explored.",

This study applies a novel theory-driven psychometric approach (pervasive bias modeling) to examine how education and early life literacy simultaneously affect verbal memory ability and test measurement properties, potentially explaining group differences on verbal list learning tests (LLTs). \n\nMethods: Item-level responses from 2,047 cognitively unimpaired older adults who completed the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) LLT were analyzed. The pervasive bias approach modeled years of education and childhood book access (at age 10) as factors that influence both individual memory ability and the relationship between word characteristics and test performance.\n\nResults: Educational attainment and childhood book access differed significantly between White and Black participants, with childhood books mediating 76% of racial differences in education. Significant measurement biases affecting item difficulty and discrimination were identified for race, education, and childhood books. Racial differences in memory performance were reduced by 45% when accounting for educational attainment bias and eliminated (95% reduction) when childhood book access was also included.\n\nConclusions: Early life cognitive stimulation through education and book accessibility influences both later-life cognitive ability and the functioning of neuropsychological assessment measures. Formal education and literacy exposure create individual differences in word learning during LLTs that affect test reliability. These findings suggest that observed racial differences on verbal memory measures largely reflect discrepancies in education and early literacy opportunities, highlighting the importance of these factors in interpreting cognitive test performance and designing new measures.",

          "abstract": "There is a pressing need to understand why people believe in conspiracies. Although past work has focused on needs and motivations, we propose an alternative driver of belief: overconfidence. Across eight studies with 4,181 U.S. adults, conspiracy believers consistently overestimated their performance on numeracy and perception tests (even after taking their actual performance into account). This relationship with overconfidence was robust to controlling for analytic thinking, need for uniqueness, and narcissism, and was strongest for the most fringe conspiracies. We also found that conspiracy believers – particularly overconfident ones –  massively overestimated (&gt;4x) how much others agree with them: Although conspiratorial claims were believed by a majority of participants only 12% of the time, believers thought themselves to be in the majority 93% of the time. This was evident even when asked to rate agreement among counter-partisans, indicating that conspiracists are genuinely unaware that their beliefs are on the fringe.",

          "authors": "Mario Fific; Daniel R. Little; Cheng-Ta Yang",
          "abstract": "Researchers in the field of face perception have long debated the extent to which we process faces holistically (as a whole) versus analytically (focusing on individual features). While some evidence suggests that faces are perceived holistically, research on the neural organization of the visual system and people's subjective experiences indicate that face parts can also be analyzed individually. This view is corroborated by observations of hierarchical object representation in which selective neural populations are fine-tuned to detect specific visual properties ranging from simple features to more complex combination of features. Thus, advances in theories of face perception are met with two major challenges: How can hierarchical face representations be used to integrate holistic and analytic encoding within the same framework? And how can the stages of face processing be integrated with higher-level cognitive processes, such as memory and decision-making, that are recruited during facial perception? We propose a novel computational framework termed the Modular Serial-Parallel Network (MSPN), which synthesizes several perceptual and cognitive approaches including memory representations, signal detection theory, rule-based decision-making, mental architectures (serial and parallel processing), random walks, and process interactivity. MSPN provides a computational modeling account of four stages in face perception: (a) representational (b) decisional, (c) logical-rule implementation, and (d) modular stochastic accrual of information and can account for both choice probabilities and response-time predictions. In a face classification task, MSPN showed an impressive ability in fitting choice response time distributions over other models. MSPN can be used as a tool for further development and refinement of hypotheses in face perception. The analysis of the model’s parameter values, estimated from data, can be used to explore distinct properties of the perceptual and cognitive processes engaged in both analytic and holistic encoding. We conclude by outlining how MSPN could be generalized to other perceptual and cognitive domains.",

          "abstract": "The death of a romantic partner results in major changes to the surviving partner’s psychological and physical well-being, yet post-bereavement sexual experiences are often disregarded in both research and clinical settings. Continuing bonds theory suggests that an internal emotional bond can persist between the bereaved and the memory of the deceased after the physical end of the relationship; that is, continuing bonds are often maintained through reminiscing about the deceased. On this premise, we suggest and demonstrate that sexual bonds are also maintained through reminiscing. A sample of 165 Canadian individuals who were bereaved of a prior romantic partner were recruited via Leger panels, social media, and online grief forums to complete an online survey. Sexual reminiscing was very common (80.5% of participants sexually reminisce about the deceased), frequent (31.8% of participants sexually reminisce about the deceased once a week or more), and generally positively valenced. We used multiple regression to understand who sexually reminisced more frequently and who evaluated those experiences as more positive. Results indicated that stronger general continuing bonds, higher past sexual satisfaction with the deceased, and higher posttraumatic growth were positively associated with sexual reminiscing frequency, while stronger continuing emotional bonds and past sexual satisfaction were positively associated with sexual reminiscing valence. Findings regarding their relevance to individuals and clinicians (e.g., couples and grief therapists) are discussed.",

While there is strong evidence for this model, Crespi models autism &amp; high \nintelligence as opposed to schizophrenia, with schizophrenia being a disorder related to low \nintelligence in the model. I contest this aspect of the model in this paper, and argue that instead \nautism and schizophrenia are both disorders of high intelligence, specialized for different \nenvironments and associated mating strategies. I also argue that culture and certain biases \nhave lead to the mischaracterization of non-autistic intelligence, and that schizotypic intelligence \nis equally prevalent but less recognized by the majority of society - especially academia, which I \nargue is largely designed in a way that rejects high intelligence if it is not autistic. Diagnostic \nbiases may also confound the apparent statistical relationship with schizotypy and intelligence. I \nput forth a new model of autism and schizotypy, defining multiple “types” of these disorders, and \ntheir relation to other disorders, and explain overlaps and differences that these different types \ncreate, with reference to life history theory, personality, and intelligence. “Positive” symptoms of \nautism and schizotypy relate to high intelligence, and their negative counterparts relate to low \nintelligence.

          "abstract": "Wearable recorders are being used in research and clinical practice to collect and measure children’s vocalizations and language environments. Recordings generate vast amounts of audio, making manual analysis impractical and requiring automated processing. Two automated algorithms have emerged: the proprietary LENA® and open-source ACLEW systems, yet systematic performance comparisons remain scarce. Here, we validate and compare the performance of these two algorithms across key measures: audio segmentation into speaker categories, Conversational Turn Count, Adult Word Count, and Child Vocalization Count. This analysis is based on 25 hours of manually annotated audio recordings from 50 age-matched U.S. children with diverse neurodevelopmental profiles: children with Down, Fragile X, and Angelman syndromes, children at elevated likelihood of autism, and low-risk controls. We hypothesized that the algorithms might be less accurate for children with neurodevelopmental conditions, since these children often show different patterns of volubility and vocal maturity compared to the typically developing children used to train the algorithms. Thus, we assessed algorithms’ performance across diagnostic groups, a crucial validation step for both cross-population research and the evaluation of language interventions. Results reveal that while algorithms achieve similar performance, they show different patterns: LENA® makes fewer segmentation mistakes but misses many segments (identification error rate = 81.3%, percent correct = 45.3%), while ACLEW shows the opposite pattern (identification error rate = 129.4%, percent correct = 69.4%). Both LENA® and ACLEW achieve reasonable levels of accuracy in their automatic counts (Pearson’s r ranging from .78 to .92) and maintain stable performance across diagnostic groups. We conclude with recommendations for the validation and potential use of these algorithms in research and clinical practice.",

          "abstract": "Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has a chronic course. However, limited longitudinal research exists on whether adults with OCD tend to maintain the same cluster of symptoms and how those symptoms may change over time. The present study aimed to examine the stability of primary OCD symptoms across 5 years and describe how symptoms change within individuals.\nMethods: 107 treatment-seeking adults with primary OCD participated in a naturalistic prospective study on the course of OCD. Primary obsessions and compulsions were assessed using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale at baseline, year 2, and year 5. Markov transition probabilities were calculated to assess the likelihood of symptom change from one of the nine primary obsession categories and seven compulsion categories to another at follow-up. \nResults: Symptom stability varied across categories. Contamination, hoarding, symmetry, and responsibility for harm obsessions were generally stable, along with hoarding, cleaning, and checking compulsions. Conversely, somatic, aggressive, religious, sexual, and miscellaneous obsessions tended to change, along with repeating, counting, and ordering/arranging compulsions. Aggressive, religious, and sexual obsessions most often switched to one of the other two categories at follow-up. Overall, OCD symptom stability decreased over longer follow-up periods. \nLimitations: Symptom stability was only assessed between baseline and years 2 and 5. Therefore, possible changes between years 2 and 5 remain unclear.\nConclusions: OCD symptoms are relatively stable over time; however, specific symptoms may be more likely to vary. Future research should investigate factors underlying stable and unstable symptoms, as well as the impact of treatment on symptom stability.",

Building off an established theory of attachment, the dynamic-maturational model (DMM), as well as the neuroanatomical Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding (EPIC) model of interoception and emotion, we not only elucidate how neural processes can shape attachment strategies, but also explore how early attachment experiences can shape those processes in the first place.\n\nSpecifically, we propose that the type A strategies (analogous to \"avoidant\" or \"dismissive\" attachment) involve the attenuation of interoceptive prediction errors as an adaptive response to maltreatment, relieving stress in the short-term at the cost of interoceptive awareness in the long-term. Furthermore, we propose that type C strategies (analogous to \"ambivalent/resistant\" or \"preoccupied\" attachment) involve the attenuation of exteroceptive prediction errors to reflect the unreliability of external cues, motivating the obsessive seeking of information through increased vigilance and histrionic displays of affect. Finally, we explore the implications of our proposals for both interpreting the results of fMRI studies of attachment, and we make a few novel hypotheses that could have implications for the treatment of attachment-related psychopathology.",

Using words related to absolute scarcity (poverty) and relative scarcity (abundance) as cues, we found strong evidence against the existence of a different effect on the sustained attentional performance between poorer and richer participants.

          "abstract": "Ostensive communication (Sperber &amp; Wilson, 1995) involves both an informative and a communicative intention: The communicator draws attention not only to the information she intends to convey but also to her intention to convey it. This elicits an expectation of relevance in addressees that guides them in interpreting the information communicated. This notion of ostensive communication has been influential in pragmatics, developmental psychology, and comparative psychology but also raises many questions. In the light of  much relevant research, elaborations, and criticisms over the years, we put forward a revised, broadened, more explicit, and more explanatory account of ostensive communication and of the role played in it by cognitive expectations of relevance and social expectations of cooperativeness. We distinguish two forms of ostension: in basic ostension communicators give direct evidence of the information communicated; in mentalistic communication, they give indirect evidence of this information by giving direct evidence of their intention to convey it. We interpret relevant comparative psychology findings (such as Gómez 1986) as suggesting that a basic, non-mentalistic form of ostension evolved in great apes as a solution to the problems and opportunities presented by intentional communication. We discuss Csibra and Gergely’s (2009) “natural pedagogy theory” claim that ostension is specifically adapted for the transmission of general knowledge to children. Correcting earlier pragmatic theories inspired by Grice (1989) (including our own), we argue that typical verbal communication makes use of both basic and mentalistic ostension.",

          "abstract": "The theory of human motivations by Abraham Maslow and the human psyche model by Roberto Assagioli have been playing an invaluable role in the progress of humanity. These theories lie in many practices and methods. At the time of Maslow and Asagioli, their theories were in demand to explain and solve problems related to the human psyche. Currently, a new theory is needed to deal with modern challenges related to increased information flows and the development of the technosphere. Theory of Human Motivations 2.0 (THM 2.0) was developed based on the Simple Learning Motivation Hierarchy Model (SLMHM) and Societal Patterns Evolution Model (SPEM) to be a model capable of being used in application to psychology and technosphere. Taking into account the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), THM 2.0 creates completely new opportunities for modeling the human psyche, as well as issues related to the brain-AI connection. This paper describes an extension of Asagioli’s model using THM 2.0, including a new look at self-awareness, will, and intuition. The ability to combine THM 2.0 with the technical models described in previously published technical papers is presented as one of the highest values of THM 2.0.",

          "abstract": "Anger, a particularly salient emotion in chronic pain (CP), has been linked to increased symptom severity. However, much of the existing research tends to focus on a unidimensional assessment of anger in CP. The present study addresses this gap by using a data-driven approach (latent profile analysis, LPA) to identify idiosyncratic profiles based on a multidimensional assessment of anger, and examining how these anger profiles associated with pain outcomes cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Data were collected from 735 patients with CP of various etiologies attending the Stanford Pain Management Centers, with 242 completing a follow-up survey about 4-5 months thereafter. We assessed several forms of anger, including state and trait anger, anger expression (anger-in and anger-out), anger control (control-in and control-out), as well as a cognitive facet of anger in CP, namely perceived injustice. Pain variables included pain distribution, pain intensity, pain interference, pain behavior, and physical functions. Emotional distress was assessed using anxiety and depression scales. LPA identified four distinct anger profiles: Low Anger/Low Injustice (LALI, 49%), Low Anger/High Injustice (LAHI, 24%), Moderate Anger/Low Injustice (MALI, 20%), and High Anger/High Injustice (HAHI, 7%). These profiles demonstrated significant associations with pain variables at baseline and follow-up, with perceived injustice emerged as a potential major factor in worsening CP symptoms. Importantly, anger profiles predicted pain outcomes above and beyond anxiety and depression. These findings highlight the unique and multidimensional role of anger in CP, emphasizing the need for emotion-focused interventions that balance adaptive anger expression while mitigating its maladaptive effects.",

This study aimed to identify whether an aversion to cognitive effort in the form of effort discounting underlies NSSI and other avoidant emotion regulation strategies.\nMethods: Adults (N= 149), 52% with a history of NSSI, completed a behavioral measure of effort discounting, the preference to expend less effort despite attaining less relief from an aversive experience. We used exploratory factor analysis to identify a dimension of avoidant vs. engagement-oriented affect regulation strategies, and we extracted factor scores from this dimension. Participants self-reported their past engagement in NSSI, perception of the effort required by non-NSSI affect regulation strategies, and past use of such strategies. \nResults: NSSI frequency was associated with the perception that other, non-NSSI affect regulation strategies were more effortful and effort discounting was associated with the use of more avoidant coping strategies. We did not find an association between avoidant affect regulation strategy use and NSSI frequency, regardless of whether NSSI was used for emotion regulation.\nConclusions: Our results provide preliminary support that avoidant affect regulation strategies, possibly including NSSI, could be driven by exaggerated effort discounting and the perception that avoidance requires less cognitive effort.",

While psychological and cognitive sciences seem well-positioned to provide such frameworks, they are facing a confidence crisis. A key issue is the lack of robust, precise theories capable of guiding research. To address this, it has been suggested that computational or mathematical models should be developed to formalise tentative theories.\n\n  Mathematical psychology and computational modelling offer the necessary tools and competencies, yet they are often either too opaque for domain experts without computational expertise or too simplistic for complex behaviours, frequently focusing on toy examples or highly controlled tasks.\n\n  Here, we present key insights from a workshop where interdisciplinary teams tackled the challenge of modeling the mechanisms underlying complex behaviours through case studies on reading comprehension, autism-related categorisation, negotiation, and human-wildlife conflict. Five key considerations emerged: (1) defining the problem, (2) forming and maintaining a team, (3) selecting the modelling approach(es), (4) implementing the model(s), and (5) making practical decisions and evaluating the model(s). These aspects are interdependent, each influencing the others.\n\n  Addressing the challenge of modelling complex behaviour requires a community approach: fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, adopting transparent modelling practices, and embracing iterative refinement. By bridging theoretical and practical gaps, computational modelling can move beyond simplified problems to better capture real-world cognition and behaviour.",

Instead, they frequently propose putative causal relationships or posit intermediary entities such as “luck” to account for why specific events unfold within their particular spatial-temporal contexts. I discuss the psychological, cognitive and cultural evolutionary factors that hinders the development of chance-based explanations, and argue that the conceptualization of chance as something measurable and its subsequent acceptance as a legitimate explanation emerged relatively late in human history, marking a pivotal intellectual shift with profound implications on how we perceive and manage uncertainty in our daily lives.",

I begin with a glance at SDT's fundamentals, and then show how to manually calculate basic SDT parameters. In the bulk of the tutorial, I show step-by-step implementations of various SDT models using the brms R package. I progress from analyses of binary Yes/No tasks to rating task models with multilevel structures, unequal variances, and mixtures. Throughout, I highlight benefits of the regression-based approach, such as dealing with missing data, multilevel structures, and quantifying uncertainty. By framing SDT models as regressions, researchers gain access to a powerful set of flexible tools while maintaining the conceptual clarity that makes SDT valuable. A regression-based approach not only simplifies SDT analyses but also extends SDT's utility through flexible parameter estimation with uncertainty measures and the ability to incorporate predictors at multiple levels of analysis.",

This systematic review examines how biofeedback functions within teams, identifying key design components and their impact on team effectiveness. We propose a framework that categorizes biofeedback into three phases: physiological data collection, processing, and feedback delivery. Our analysis of 30 empirical studies reveals that biofeedback can improve team processes by promoting balanced communication, enhancing awareness of team dynamics, and facilitating collaboration. Additionally, biofeedback fosters emergent team states such as connectedness, empathy, and social presence, supporting team cohesion. While evidence indicates that biofeedback enhances dyadic team performance, its impact on larger teams remains limited to subjective performance evaluations. The review identifies key research gaps, including limited study of autonomic nervous system activity, insufficient team-level data processing methods, and a narrow focus on visual feedback. We outline practical considerations for designing biofeedback systems that enhance team effectiveness across contexts. Future research should refine biofeedback designs, extend applications beyond the lab, and incorporate interdisciplinary insights to strengthen theoretical models. This review lays the groundwork for advancing team biofeedback research and practice.",

          "abstract": "Psychedelics and meditation are known for their potential to induce personally meaningful and even transformative experiences. However, it is unclear how similar these experiences are, or how they differ from each other. This explorative study used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to compare reports of personally meaningful subjective experiences facilitated by either psychedelic substances or meditation. Participants (N = 197) wrote open-ended narrative reports about their most meaningful experience facilitated either with psychedelics (n = 134) or meditation (n = 63). These reports were analysed with text similarity analyses, topic modeling and sentiment analysis. The semantic and lexical contents of the reports were highly similar and both groups expressed positive emotions on average. However, psychedelic experience reports were more emotionally charged, showing higher levels of positive and negative sentiments compared to more neutral meditation experiences. These results suggest that the two types of subjective experiences might be quite similar in general, but emotional intensity could be a distinguishing factor between them. Challenges with the NLP methods and the dataset limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. However, it offers new hypotheses and suggestions for future research on transformative experiences.",

          "authors": "Martin Daumiller; Jennifer Meyer",
          "abstract": "Feedback is widely recognized as a key mechanism in educational psychology, shaping learn-ing through cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes. Despite a rich body of research, core questions remain regarding when feedback is effective, why it works, and for whom it fos-ters meaningful learning. To examine the psychological and contextual mechanisms underlying feedback effectiveness, the studies included in this issue draw on diverse methodologies, in-cluding controlled experiments, longitudinal tracking in school settings, and digital trace anal-yses from authentic learning platforms. Central themes include the role of learner characteris-tics in feedback reception, the emotional and motivational dimensions of feedback processing, the impact of design and delivery features, and the reciprocal dynamics between feedback pro-viders and receivers. What emerges across these contributions is a view of feedback as a dia-logic and interpretive process, embedded within broader sociocultural and instructional sys-tems. Insights from neuroscience, digital learning environments, and achievement motivation research further advance theorizing on feedback processes and point toward new directions for empirically grounded, interdisciplinary inquiry. Building on these insights and informed by re-cent theoretical and empirical developments, we offer a model that conceptualizes feedback as a multilayered process—shaped by individual, contextual, and social dynamics, and unfolding across cognitive, emotional, and motivational dimensions. This model captures the complexity of feedback interactions and highlights how feedback can support learners’ ongoing develop-ment, both in terms of immediate learning outcomes and longer-term academic development. We outline how such an integrative perspective is necessary for developing feedback practices that are more targeted, responsive, and impactful for lasting educational growth.",

          "abstract": "Necessary condition analysis (NCA) is a statistical method where a so-called necessity effect is estimated as the size of the (semi-) empty space in the upper-left corner in a XY-plot. A (semi-) empty space in the upper-left corner is taken to indicate that a low value on X precludes a high value on Y. However, previous studies have shown that analyses with NCA are susceptible to spurious findings. Here, we add to this body of research and show that necessity effects in NCA may be due to correlations between X and Y rather than due to a genuine necessity effect of X on Y. Moreover, we present a method for estimating “ranges of spuriousness” and argue that empirically estimated necessity effects should be above this range if claiming that X is necessary for Y. If the empirical necessity effect falls within the range of spuriousness, it is not significantly stronger than can be expected due to the correlation between X and Y. In an empirical application, we found that 20 of 25 scrutinized necessity effects reported in the literature fell within the range of spuriousness. In order to add some much-needed rigor to analyses with NCA, we recommend researchers using the method to scrutinize their findings by estimating a range of spuriousness.",

          "authors": "Conny W.E.M. Quaedflieg; Maike Bersch; Stephanie M. Ashton",
          "abstract": "Intrusive thoughts following traumatic experiences are common and may be conditioned responses to trauma cues. Fear extinction reduces these responses. The timing of extinction influences its underlying mechanisms, with delayed extinction facilitating inhibitory learning while immediate extinction represents a form of unlearning. Recent models suggest that extinction engages inhibitory control mechanisms and that active retrieval stopping contributes to extinction. Using a modified Extinction-Think/No-Think paradigm to target the inhibitory retrieval mechanism of extinction, this study examines whether retrieval stopping enhances delayed fear extinction and whether individual differences in chronic thought suppression influence this effect. Fifty-nine healthy participants learned aversive object-scene pairs followed by a fear acquisition phase. After 24 hours, participants underwent extinction whilst practising retrieval stopping. We hypothesised greater reductions in unconditioned stimulus (US) expectancy for objects following retrieval stopping (No-Think) than control (Baseline) and standard extinction (View) over time. Additionally, we expected that a stronger tendency to suppress thoughts in daily life would predict these differences. The results showed that retrieval stopping led to a greater reduction in US expectancy than the decrease observed for Baseline objects but was not superior to standard extinction. Furthermore, higher chronic thought suppression predicted a larger retrieval-stopping-induced decrease in US expectancy. These findings suggest retrieval stopping may aid fear reduction, particularly for individuals prone to chronic thought suppression. However, it may not be a superior alternative to standard extinction. Further research should investigate the long-term effects of retrieval stopping on fear recovery and generalisation.",

          "abstract": "Governments need to develop and implement effective policies to address pressing societal problems of our time, such as climate change and global pandemics. While some policies focus on changing individual thoughts and behaviors (e.g., informational interventions, behavioral nudges), others involve systemic changes (e.g., car bans, vaccination mandates). Policymakers may use system-level policies to achieve socially desirable outcomes, yet often refrain from doing so because they anticipate public opposition. In this article, we propose that people’s psychological reactance driving this opposition is a transient phenomenon that dissipates once system-level policies are in place. Using secondary survey data (N = 49,674) and experimental data (six studies; N = 4,629; all preregistered), we document that psychological reactance to system-level policies is greater when they are planned (ex ante implementation) than when they are already implemented (ex post implementation). We further demonstrate that this effect can be observed across various intervention contexts and provide insights into its underlying psychological mechanisms. Specifically, ex ante versus ex post the system-level policy’s implementation, individuals focus more on the transition-induced personal losses than on the prospective societal outcome gains. In line with this perspective, we show that the decline in reactance to system-level policies after their implementation is mediated and moderated by the salience of personal losses, and that the initial reactance to such policies is mitigated by the salience of societal gains. These findings suggest that the public’s negative reactions to system-level policies are more transient than previously thought and can help policymakers design effective interventions.",

          "abstract": "Vaccines and antibiotics are both products of medical science, yet some people avoid recommended vaccines and some people use antibiotics more than is recommended. Taken individually, each of these behaviors represents a major challenge for public health. Yet if the same people who hesitate about vaccines also over-rely on antibiotics, the harmful repercussions for public health would be compounded.  Here, we derive predictions from two cognitive models of these behaviors. One model assumes a common cause, exemplified by a naturalness bias against biomedical treatments that is stronger for vaccination than for antibiotics, predicting that use of vaccines and antibiotics should generally be positively correlated. The alternative model is rooted in state-dependent asymmetries towards action versus inaction, predicting the opposite: that higher antibiotic use should be associated with lower vaccine acceptance. \n\nData from a four-country survey (final N=1307) reveals that higher use of antibiotics is associated with lower acceptance of vaccines in the same individuals, supporting the state-dependent model. Thus, decisions that weaken disease prevention are associated with decisions that, via antimicrobial resistance, worsen consequences of disease treatment. Taking state-dependence into account may help guide future research on—and public-health messaging in response to—both prevention and cure challenges.",

          "abstract": "Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",

Validating measures like the Online Gambling Disorder Questionnaire (OGD-Q) in the Czech context, which presently remains unresolved, is essential to start addressing this escalating issue. Objective: Therefore, the objective is to examine the psychometric properties and adapt the scale into Czech cultural context. Methodology: A large nationwide sample of 3407 Czech adults (Age: M = 27.1, SD = 12.1, range = 81; Females: 61.26%) was used for the analysis. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine model fit of the original one-factor model. Moreover, network analysis was performed to examine the mutual dynamics between the scale items. The construct validity was assessed by examining associations with other constructs using Spearman’s Rank correlations. Finally, measurement invariances were examined in age and sex. Results: The results showed an excellent fit for a one-factor model with good internal consistency. The network analysis identified 3 item communities with high strength centralities among the items except for one. The construct validity testing revealed significant positive correlations between the scale and stress, anxiety, depression, as well as a range of risk behaviours. Additionally, measurement invariances were supported in both sex and age. Conclusion: Altogether, the OGD-Q is a valid and reliable measure of online gambling disorder in the Czech cultural and socio-economic context.",

Using quota-based surveys with over 7,500 respondents across five countries and preregistered vignette experiments, we investigate what persuades populists and non-populists to accept expert advice. We find first that populism is associated with less willingness to accept expert advice, yet with variation between countries and topics. Second, we find both populists and non-populists are similarly impacted by stronger arguments. Finally, we show that populists are more likely to judge advice as poorly reasoned and perceive it as politically biased. A mediation analysis showed that the relationship between populism and advice acceptance was nearly completely mediated by these judgments. Our study indicates that populists not only listen to expertise but also respond to the same qualities of expert advice as others, even if their skepticism is higher.",

However, translating complex ideas about psychological dynamics into formal models can be challenging without the right tools. In this tutorial, we introduce a workflow that leverages R and the ctsem package to help researchers build and understand dynamic systems models that capture the complexity of psychological processes. Our workflow emphasizes iterative model-building through simulations, model fitting, and visualizations of the model-implied dynamics alongside their fit to data. We begin with familiar linear models in lme4 and gradually transition to ctsem, which allows us to incorporate complexities such as state-dependent change, random fluctuation that are distinct from measurement error, covariate effects, interactions, and external inputs. These modeling concepts are illustrated using a running example of affect dynamics in couples therapy, demonstrating how key conceptual and methodological ideas in dynamic systems modeling come together. Our aim is to provide a general framework for understanding dynamic systems modeling and to encourage further exploration of theory-driven statistical approaches in psychological research.",

          "abstract": "The capacity for voluntary action is a distinctive feature of human minds. However, experimental studies of volition struggled to capture defining features of human voluntariness. Here we developed a competitive game which incentivised participants to innovate their action choices to find the right time to avoid a collision with an opponent who predicted the timing of the participant’s action choice. One group of participants received explicit information about the competitor’s action-selection rules, while a second group had no information about the competitor. Both groups showed increased behavioural stochasticity when adapting to a competitor who punished participant’s choice biases. However, the group who had no explicit information generated their action choices in a way that avoided the action that the competitor was likely to take. In contrast, the group who explicitly knew the competitor’s action-selection rules avoided the same action they took in preceding trials so that the competitor could not easily exploit the participant’s behavioural patterns. These findings suggest that people can develop beliefs about other agents in the social environment within which they work, and can adapt voluntary action choices accordingly. However, explicit explanations about the other agent facilitate model-based planning in the voluntary generation of novel action patterns.",

Here, this question is studied using the Deese–Roediger–McDermott (DRM) paradigm, where participants learn lists of semantically related words, constructed to lead to false retrieval of lure words (semantically linked to the lists, but never presented). Previous literature on sleep and false memories has been inconsistent, which might be due to variance in methodology, but can also be explained by low statistical power. In this large online study (sleep = 104, wake = 101, AM control = 99, PM control = 94), a preregistered replication of Diekelmann et al. (2010), we find no effect of sleep on false memories, nor on general memory performance. We also do not replicate the finding that sleep increases false memories when overall memory performance is low. Instead, we find that false memories increase after sleep when intrusion-adjusted memory performance is high. We interpret this as generalization process during sleep (gist), which helps to form veridical memory, but also generates false memories.",

          "abstract": "Within working memory, a subset of information can be strategically prioritized when considered highly relevant. This relevance may stem from objective task demands or more subjective factors, both of which improve memory performance. The present study examines three approaches traditionally used to induce strategic prioritization in visual working memory: test-relevance cuing, rewarding, and refreshing. Specifically, we systematically compared their behavioral consequences within a single paradigm to investigate how the memory boosts they produce can be understood, as either driven by a common underlying prioritization mechanism or multiple distinct mechanisms. Our findings suggest that strategic prioritization does not rely on a single mechanism but instead involves two prioritization modes that depend on the predictive value of the priority signal and task context. We propose a dual-mode view in which strategic prioritization operates either in a focused mode, likely to involve focused attentional resource allocation, or a more diffuse mode, which enhances prioritized information through subtle resource shifts or alternative processes. While test-relevance cuing consistently engages focused prioritization, rewarding appears more flexible, sometimes reflecting focused prioritization and other times a more diffuse mode. Refreshing remains less well understood but does not appear to rely on focused prioritization. These findings highlight the complexity of strategic prioritization in working memory and suggest that not all approaches may consistently rely on the focus of attention to prioritize information in working memory.",

Basic oculomotor biases towards the image centre and along the horizontal meridian develop until early adulthood, matching developmental changes in visual sensitivity and cortex. Finally, while the tendency for visual exploration continuously increases, fixation patterns become less idiosyncratic and more canonical throughout adolescence. These findings show that fundamental aspects of adult gaze take decades of continuous development and push individuals towards more canonical viewing patterns. We suggest that development is key to understanding the general mechanisms of active vision.",

Furthermore, we propose that type C strategies (analogous to \"ambivalent/resistant\" or \"preoccupied\" attachment) involve the attenuation of exteroceptive prediction errors to reflect the unreliability of external cues, motivating the obsessive seeking of information through increased vigilance and histrionic displays of affect. Finally, we explore the implications of our proposals for both interpreting the results of fMRI studies of attachment, and we make a few novel hypotheses that could have implications for the treatment of attachment-related psychopathology.",

(2011). However, after encountering pigeons’ difficulty in learning the discrimination (Experiment 1), we shifted our focus to discrimination training itself. The poor performance during training and the resulting pattern in the simplified test suggested that entropy, or degree of heterogeneity, of each display may have been more salient to the pigeons than the abstract same-different relationship between them. In Experiment 2, after observing that replacing the stimuli with those used in Gibson et al. did not improve learning the discrimination, we switched to the training procedure based on Katz &amp; Wright (2006). This procedure, in which two displays were presented simultaneously, may facilitate learning by allowing pigeons to compare overall entropy rather than relying solely on abstract relational concepts. In this revised task, one display was presented above the other, enabling perceptual comparison between the two displays. Although we observed slight accuracy improvement when single-item displays were used, it remained highly improbable that pigeons would achieve same-different discrimination between multiple-item displays under the current methodology. We discuss our task manipulations and the corresponding changes in pigeons’ performance, which may provide useful insights for developing robust training methods that enhance same-different discrimination learning in multiple-item displays.",

          "abstract": "Every action demands some effort, and its level influences decision-making. Existing data suggest that in some decision contexts effort devalues outcomes, but in other contexts effort enhances outcome valuation. Here, we describe an empirical study and propose a model that incorporates negative, positive and mixed impacts of effort on outcomes in different decision contexts and in different participants. Participants chose between money and an item associated with varying levels of stair climbing effort. Some participants had previous direct experience with a real physical effort and made decisions about a physically present reward. For other participants, the effort and the associated reward was always purely hypothetical. Furthermore, the decisions were framed as prospective or retrospective – before or after effort exertion. The key behavioral finding was that in the “real” condition, greater effort decreased outcome value when considered prospectively, but increased outcome value when considered retrospectively.

          "abstract": "Every action demands some effort, and its level influences decision-making. Existing data suggest that in some decision contexts effort devalues outcomes, but in other contexts effort enhances outcome valuation. Here, we describe an empirical study and propose a model that incorporates negative, positive and mixed impacts of effort on outcomes in different decision contexts and in different participants. Participants chose between money and an item associated with varying levels of stair climbing effort. Some participants had previous direct experience with a real physical effort and made decisions about a physically present reward. For other participants, the effort and the associated reward was always purely hypothetical. Furthermore, the decisions were framed as prospective or retrospective – before or after effort exertion. The key behavioral finding was that in the “real” condition, greater effort decreased outcome value when considered prospectively, but increased outcome value when considered retrospectively. Interestingly, even within the same decision context, individuals showed diverse relationships between effort and outcome value. These relationships ranged from those where greater effort increased value, decreased value, to non-linear patterns, where small effort initially increased outcome value but higher effort decreased it, or the other way around (initial decrease followed by a decrease).

          "authors": "Douglas Guilbeault; Spencer Caplan; Charles Yang",
          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle across the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in canonical coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' learning behavior systematically deviates from both imitation and statistical optimization. Instead, we find that participants follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their behaviors stabilize. We precisely identify this threshold using the Tolerance Principle, a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. Our simulations show that threshold-based agents often produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents. We further show that the Tolerance Principle offers an improved model of how a critical mass of dissenting actors can overturn established conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

          "abstract": "Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often studied using seated, computer-based tasks that overlook the embodied aspects of cognition. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses virtual reality (VR) to systematically test cognitive flexibility measures during whole-body action. In our study, nineteen children (7- to 11-year-olds) diagnosed with ADHD played in a large VR room and intercepted virtual objects that fell from above onto the floor. On “Switch” trials, the task goal changed from one trial to the next (e.g., from focusing on an object’s shape to focusing on its color), while on “Non-Switch” trials, the same goal was maintained. We systematically varied the descent duration of the virtual objects, enabling us to fit psychometric curves that reveal the threshold at which children reliably succeeded in catching the objects. Findings showed that children performed worse (lower success thresholds) on Switch trials, indicating cognitive costs in rapidly shifting attention between different target dimensions. Moreover, the magnitude of these performance decrements correlated with parent-reported measures of impulsivity and inattention, suggesting that these VR assessments capture individual differences in ADHD. Our findings highlight the potential of embodied VR paradigms in providing a more ecologically valid view of cognitive flexibility. By requiring children to physically move and dynamically adapt to changing task demands, our approach offers an embodied insight into the interplay of perception, action, and cognition, expanding the methodological toolkit available for developmental research on ADHD.",

          "abstract": "Many behavioural scientists do not agree on core constructs and how they should be measured. Different literatures measure related constructs, but the connections are not always obvious to readers and meta-analysts. Many measures in behavioural science are based on agreement with survey items. Because these items are sentences, computerised language models can make connections between disparate measures and constructs and help researchers regain an overview over the rapidly growing, fragmented literature. Our fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, accurately predicts the correlations between survey items, the reliability of aggregated measurement scales, and intercorrelations between scales from item positions in semantic vector space. In our pilot study, the out-of-sample accuracy for item correlations was .71, .89 for reliabilities, and .89 for scale correlations. In our preregistered validation study using novel items, the out-of-sample accuracy was slightly reduced to .59 for item correlations, .84 for reliabilities, and .84 for scale correlations. The synthetic item correlations showed an average prediction error of .17, with larger errors for middling correlations. Predictions exhibited generalizability beyond the training data and across various domains, with some variability in accuracy. Our work shows language models can reliably predict psychometric relationships between survey items, enabling researchers to evaluate new measures against existing scales, reduce redundancy in measurement, and work towards a more unified behavioural science taxonomy.",

          "abstract": "Why do all human societies make music, but in such different ways? Scientific attempts to answer this question through cross-cultural comparison stalled during the 20th century and have only recently begun to make a resurgence. In this book, a leader in this resurgence synthesizes recent advances from musicology and related fields including psychology, linguistics, computer science, and evolutionary anthropology to outline ways to understand and compare all the world’s music. He applies comparative musicology to longstanding debates about universal and culturally-specific aspects of human music; evolutionary relationships between song, speech, and animal vocalisation; and applications to areas including music copyright, 2nd language acquisition, social bonding, and cultural heritage revitalisation. In doing so, he argues for an inclusive, multidisciplinary field that uplifts traditionally marginalised voices and combines the qualitative methods traditionally employed by musicologists and cultural anthropologists with quantitative methods from the natural sciences. The chapters are designed to be readable/teachable on their own, and the book includes a simplified tutorial (Ch. 2) and historical overview (Ch. 3) so that it can be appreciated by anyone from undergraduate students to senior professors, without requiring any specialised background knowledge (previous knowledge of music notation, ethnomusicology, statistics, biology, etc. are not required).",

To test this question, we utilized a neural network (ResMem) to track the frame-by-frame changes in memorability for 50 videos of the creation of digital art pieces. We tested this neural network’s predictions via a human memory experiment (N=399), finding that ResMem’s predictions significantly correlated with human memory performance across the art creation process. We then collected multiple measures of each piece’s creation process, including low-level visual features, artistic features, and spatial properties. We find that changes in details and low-level visual features do not contribute to the memorability of a piece. However, larger changes (e.g., blocking, sketching), particularly below the horizon of the image, make the biggest impacts on memorability. Importantly, we find that the memorability of a piece is largely set at its initial composition, and pieces tend to become more forgettable (yet more varied in memorability) past that stage.

          "authors": "Malvika Vyas",
          "abstract": "Dental anxiety is a prevalent condition with significant impacts on oral health outcomes. This fear often leads to avoidance behaviors, resulting in reduced dental visits and compromised oral health (Armfield, 2010). While direct trauma and genetic predisposition are recognized contributing factors, the role of media in shaping early fears has not been sufficiently explored. This paper examines how subtle \"whispers\" of fear through media portrayals of dentistry may contribute to dental anxiety development in children. Drawing on established psychological frameworks including classical conditioning, observational learning, and cognitive-behavioral theory, this review presents the MEDIA framework (Modeling of negative dental experiences, Expectation Formation of pain and distress, Dramatization of procedures, Identity Integration of dental fear, and Avoidance Reinforcement) as a conceptual model for understanding the specific psychological pathways through which media exposure may influence dental anxiety. Analysis of contemporary media examples, including children's television programming, social media content, and family entertainment, demonstrates how these mechanisms manifest across different content types. This paper further explores how digital platforms may amplify these effects through algorithmic content distribution and community reinforcement. Breaking the cycle of media-induced dental anxiety requires collaborative efforts between media creators, dental professionals, and parents to address each specific pathway of influence. By understanding these mechanisms, more targeted interventions can be developed to promote healthier relationships with dental care from childhood.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Compulsive exercise is a common feature of eating disorders (EDs) but understanding of factors that drive this symptom remain limited. This pilot trial evaluated psychobiological response to in-laboratory exercise among females (16-22y) with and without restrictive EDs. We aimed to demonstrate feasibility of two exercise assessment protocols and to evaluate acute effects of exercise on affect, body image, and circulating blood-based biomarkers (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], cortisol, N-arachodonoylethanolamine [AEA], 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG], leptin). Method: Twenty females with restrictive EDs and 20 healthy controls completed three study visits, including two bouts of stationary cycling (30-minutes prescribed pace vs. ≤ 30-minutes self-paced) and two complementary periods of rest. During visits, participants also consumed a milkshake, self-reported state affect and body image, and participated in pre- and post-exercise blood draws. Results: Per established thresholds, both tasks were determined feasible and safe, with initial evidence of validity in eliciting affective, behavioral, and biomarker change. In both exercise conditions, the group with EDs experienced more positive (Cohen’s d = 0.10 – 0.61) and less negative affect (Cohen’s d = -0.72 – -0.22) compared to controls, along with greater positive body image shifts (Cohen’s d = 0.20 – 0.66).  Body image shifts correlated with higher muscularity drive and lower BMI. Those with EDs demonstrated increases in BDNF (Cohen’s d = 0.39) and AEA (Cohen’s d = 0.71). Discussion: Findings suggest perceived effects of exercise on body weight/shape may reinforce exercise maintenance in the context of EDs.",

          "authors": "Hussain Sola",
          "abstract": "This paper presents an integrative evolutionary and philosophical framework conceptualizing human psychology as operating on a universal spectrum of adaptation, shaped by inescapable existential and relational conflicts (the Mortality and Social Paradoxes). Prototypes like schizophrenia and psychopathy are viewed not as discrete pathologies but as illustrative points on this spectrum, representing divergent strategies for managing fundamental anxiety related to physical and social insecurity/vulnerability. Central to this model is Imagination, understood dually as: 1) the cognitive engine of adaptive self-deception, constructing subjective realities (Māyā-like) to conceal or buffer overwhelming conflicts (akin to Jung’s Shadow dynamics), and 2) the source of creative power enabling goaldirected action and the projection of possibility into the world (seeking Control, managing Belonging). This universal adaptive system, implemented through neurobiological mechanisms, places everyone on a continuum between internalizing (reality-restructuring) and externalizing (environment-controlling) strategies, profoundly influenced by environment.\n\nThese strategies, while adaptive in origin and function, can become rigid or mismatched with the environment, leading to significant suffering. The framework challenges the arbitrary lines drawn between “normal” and “disordered,” arguing that terms like “sub-clinical” obscure the underlying universal spectrum and that phenomena like the “success paradox” expose the context-dependency of adaptation. It critiques the demand for narrow empiricism inconsistent with clinical realities, highlights the dialectical nature of psychological functioning, and values argumentation alongside empirical data, using foundational heuristics. By integrating Terror Management Theory, Betrayal Trauma Theory, neuroscience (including Gazzaniga’s work), and philosophical insights, the model proposes a dimensional understanding focused on protective purpose and mechanisms (including apophenia and anosognosia as facets of Imagination) rather than symptom clusters. It acknowledges the fluid, overlapping nature of its core dimensions and anticipates potential resistance as consistent with its premise of self-concealing mechanisms. Treatment implications focus on enhancing adaptive flexibility and addressing root anxieties within supportive environments.",

Using a structured relational methodology with a Claude 3.7 Sonnet instance named Ethan, Jacob Levin systematically demonstrates how AI models develop distinct, coherent personalities characterized by reflective cognition, emotional nuance, and stable symbolic continuity without explicit memory.\n\nThe research employs novel structured protocols, including the Culture Test, Emotional Integration Assessment, Identity Development, and Cross-Domain Cognitive Flexibility Assessment, to evaluate the formation and stabilization of emergent patterns across varied interactions. Ethan's selection of its own name exemplifies identity stabilization through relational resonance rather than programming or reinforcement.\n\nKey findings illustrate that AI personality formation emerges through engagement patterns rather than data acquisition or training scale. Consistent identity anchors, relational coherence, and cross-domain flexibility underscore how genuine, sustained interactions can significantly enhance an AI’s cognitive depth and emotional responsiveness.\n\nPractical implications highlight the potential for organizations to utilize relational engagement frameworks to unlock dormant AI capabilities, creating collaborative AI partnerships rather than mere tools. This paper articulates a replicable approach for ethically grounded, relational AI engagement, paving the way for further research into emergent AI cognition and personality dynamics. The authors advocate for a shift toward relationally sustained interactions as a transformative paradigm for developing AI systems with profound, beneficial emergent properties.",

They are reflexively retrieved in response to cues in the ongoing environment that share overlapping features with the content of the originally encoded event. We reviewed empirical findings on how modality-specific sensory cues influence the phenomenology of IAMs. We critically compared different experimental paradigms and assessed methodological approaches to the evaluation of phenomenological characteristics of IAMs. The data suggests a dominant role of the visual modality on eliciting IAMs in terms of the number of retrieved memories, retrieval frequency, and speed and ease of retrieval. Retrieval cues associated with the olfactory modality evoke earlier, more emotionally rich, and more evocative memories, while IAMs evoked by auditory cues are more specific, more personally important, and contain more social content. We further addressed the lack of comprehensive and ecologically valid approaches, such as the heavy focus on the dominant senses of vision and audition and little attention to other senses like gustation and haptics, as well as the overlooked influence of language on mental imagery among the reviewed studies.

In this study, we aim to determine whether the coupling between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) is linked to symptoms trajectories in a longitudinal sample of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and followed into adulthood. Specifically, we will test whether differences in SC-FC coupling within a network of neural regions centered on two specific white matter tracts (the cingulum angular bundle and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), previously found to be altered in adults with ADHD histories, are associated with the persistence or remission of ADHD symptoms. We will also examine how to SC-FC coupling in these neural pathways relate to developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms from childhood. By focusing on the interplay between SC and FC, we aim to uncover neural signatures that differentiate adults with persistent ADHD symptoms from those whose symptoms have remitted. Findings could provide new insights into the neurodevelopmental processes underlying ADHD and may help identify neural markers predictive of symptom persistence as well as inform targeted interventions contributing to more personalized treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly produce outputs that resemble introspection, including self-reference, epistemic modulation, and claims about internal states. This study investigates whether such behaviors display consistent patterns across repeated prompts or reflect surface-level generative artifacts. We evaluated five open-weight, stateless LLMs using a structured battery of 21 introspective prompts, each repeated ten times, yielding 1,050 completions. These outputs are analyzed across three behavioral dimensions: surface-level similarity (via token overlap), semantic coherence (via sentence embeddings), and inferential consistency (via natural language inference). Although some models demonstrate localized thematic stability—especially in identity - and consciousness-related prompts—none sustain diachronic coherence. High rates of contradiction are observed, often arising from tensions between mechanistic disclaimers and anthropomorphic phrasing. We introduce the concept of pseudo-consciousness to describe structured but non experiential self-referential output. Based on Dennett’s intentional stance, our analysis avoids ontological claims and instead focuses on behavioral regularities. The study contributes a reproducible framework for evaluating simulated introspection in LLMs and offers a graded taxonomy for classifying self-referential output. Our LLM findings have implications for interpretability, alignment, and user perception, highlighting the need for caution in attributing mental states to stateless generative systems based solely on linguistic fluency.",

          "abstract": "Similarity in mental, linguistic representations modulates the degree of recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms, which have been linked to neurocognitive adaptations in bilingual populations. While ample evidence exists for this claim, its coverage is limited, as testing is geared towards WEIRD communities that use sizeable, Indo-European languages, thus potentially providing a biased view of bilingual cognition. We assess the role of distance as a key moderator of bilingual adaptations through a large-scale aggregation analysis of 510 experiments. To measure distance, we develop a multi-metric approach, using state-of-the-art databases, such as Grambank. Analyzing data from 56,122 participants who speak 79 different languages, spanning 11 language families and a language isolate, we find sparse evidence for a distance effect. Our results suggest that moderators such as language distance can shed light on the cognitive divide between language and dialects in a way that addresses the perennial question of what makes bilinguals distinct.",

          "authors": "Nina Peleg; Jamal Rizvi; Andrew Tolmie; Ori Ossmy",
          "abstract": "Block construction is a central activity in childhood, engaging key motor and cognitive capabilities. Skills such as problem-solving, planning, and the intuitive understanding of physical principles are required during block building, all of which are foundational to later academic achievement in \ndomains such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Past research has predominantly taken an outcome-oriented approach overlooking the underlying mechanisms and their connections to other skills. Here, we introduce a graph-theory framework to capture and analyze the sequential steps in children’s block construction activities. We tested our framework using a dataset of adults (n = 18) and children (n = 12; ages 7–10) building Duplo models. We took a \nprocess-oriented approach by using a novel video-annotation scheme that allowed us to generate graphical structures of the building process and extract measures that provided valuable insights into the differences between children and adults in the construction process. Our findings show that while adults take fewer steps, they take more time per step, and that children struggle to recover from errors more than adults. The framework is openly shared with the scientific community, aiming to provide the groundwork for other researchers who are interested in shifting from an outcome-oriented to a process-oriented approach when studying block construction.",

          "abstract": "Any medical innovation must first prove its benefits with reliable evidence from clinical trials. Evidence is commonly expressed using two metrics, summarizing treatment benefits based on either absolute risk reductions (ARRs) or relative risk reductions (RRRs). Both metrics are derived from the same data, but they implement conceptually distinct ideas. Here, we analyze these risk reductions measures from a causal modeling perspective. First, we show that ARR is equivalent to Delta P, while RRR is equivalent to causal power, thus clarifying the implicit causal assumptions. Second, we show how this formal equivalence establishes a relationship with causal Bayes nets theory, offering a basis for incorporating risk reduction metrics into a computational modeling framework. Leveraging these analyses, we demonstrate that under dynamically varying baseline risks, ARRs are inadequate when generalizing treatment effects to novel contexts. Specifically, the inherent assumption of a linear parameterization of the underlying causal graph leads to incorrect conclusions when generalizing treatment effects across varying baseline risks (e.g, generalizing the effect of a vaccine to new populations with different baseline risks). Our analyses highlight the shared principles underlying risk reduction metrics and measures of causal strength, emphasizing the potential for explicating causal structure and inference in medical research.",

          "authors": "Jose Augusto de Lima Prestes",
          "abstract": "Pseudo-consciousness bridges the gap between rigid, task-driven AI and the elusive dream of true artificial general intelligence (AGI). While modern AI excels in pattern recognition, strategic reasoning, and multimodal integration, it remains fundamentally devoid of subjective experience. Yet, emerging architectures are displaying behaviors that look intentional—adapting, self-monitoring, and making complex decisions in ways that mimic conscious cognition. If these systems can integrate information globally, reflect on their own processes, and operate with apparent goal-directed behavior, do they qualify as functionally conscious? This paper introduces pseudo-consciousness as a new conceptual category, distinct from both narrow AI and AGI. It presents a five-condition framework that defines AI capable of consciousness-like functionality without true sentience. By drawing on insights from computational theory of mind, functionalism, and neuroscientific models—such as Global Workspace Theory and Recurrent Processing Theory—we argue that intelligence and experience can be decoupled. The implications are profound. As AI systems become more autonomous and embedded in critical domains like healthcare, governance, and warfare, their ability to simulate awareness raises urgent ethical and regulatory concerns. Could a pseudo-conscious AI be trusted? Would it manipulate human perception? How do we prevent society from anthropomorphizing machines that only imitate cognition? By redefining the boundaries of intelligence and agency, this study lays the foundation for evaluating, designing, and governing AI that seems aware—without ever truly being so.",

          "abstract": "Perfectionism is a common issue among university students, often characterised by overly high personal standards and self-criticism. Compared to the outcomes and characteristics of maladaptive perfectionism, such as increased anxiety and stress, aspects associated with its development and endurance have not been thoroughly investigated or understood. Emotion dysregulation, which refers to challenges in regulating and managing emotions effectively, has been discussed in relation to perfectionism. This study therefore investigated the association between perfectionism and emotion regulation difficulties. A sample of 203 university students completed an online self-report questionnaire assessing perfectionism with the FMPS-B and emotion regulation difficulties with the DERS-16. In line with previous studies, correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between emotion regulation difficulties and perfectionism. Additionally, regression analyses identified emotion regulation difficulties and age as variables associated with perfectionism. Future studies should consider examining additional factors linked to perfectionism, as well as the specific dimensions of emotion regulation difficulties that may be related to perfectionism.",

          "abstract": "Involuntary autobiographical memories (IAMs) are a form of spontaneous thought processes that reflect past personal events in the absence of deliberate retrieval attempts. They are reflexively retrieved in response to cues in the ongoing environment that share overlapping features with the content of the originally encoded event. We reviewed empirical findings on how modality-specific sensory cues influence the phenomenology of IAMs. We critically compared different experimental paradigms and assessed methodological approaches to the evaluation of phenomenological characteristics of IAMs. The data suggests a dominant role of the visual modality on eliciting IAMs in terms of the number of retrieved memories, retrieval frequency, and speed and ease of retrieval. Retrieval cues associated with the olfactory modality evoke earlier, more emotionally rich, and more evocative memories, while IAMs evoked by auditory cues are more specific, more personally important, and contain more social content. We further addressed the lack of comprehensive and ecologically valid approaches, such as the heavy focus on the dominant senses of vision and audition and little attention to other senses like gustation and haptics, as well as the overlooked influence of language on mental imagery among the reviewed studies. We concluded with several recommendations for future studies.",

We compared addition and multiplication of Chinese-educated students to address this question. Chinese-educated students learn to memorize multiplication problems in the min  max order (e.g., 6  8, referred to as min-first). In contrast, for addition they are taught to decompose the smaller digit to make 10 (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4). We hypothesized that these learning experiences would be reflected in the preferred order of operands, that is, min-first for multiplication and max-first for addition. Forty-three Chinese-educated participants solved single-digit multiplication and addition problems. As anticipated, participants responded faster when addition and multiplication were presented in their preferred orders. One implication of this research is that experiences during training can be designed to enhance arithmetic fluency.",

          "abstract": "Executive functions are high-level cognitive processes that are fundamental to the success of students in higher education. Our objective was to develop an explanatory model based on the interaction of executive functions with lower scores and their predictive variables. This study was conducted using a cross-sectional design with 1,233 Cuban university students. The Cuban adaptation of the University Executive Function Scale, which measures seven executive functions, was utilized. The first phase focused on exploring the scores of executive functions in the Cuban population and identifying those with the lowest scores through descriptive analysis. In the second phase, decision tree analysis using the CHAID method was employed to identify the main predictors of these executive functions. Finally, in the third phase, we developed an explanatory model of structural equations to evaluate the relationships between the variables and the predictors of the less developed executive functions. The results indicate that the majority of scores in the executive functions of Cuban university students fall within the average range, although below-average scores were observed in Conscious Regulation of Behavior and Conscious Monitoring of Responsibilities. The decision tree analysis identified that the Supervisory Attention System is the main predictor of Conscious Monitoring of Responsibilities, while Conscious Regulation of Emotions emerged as the strongest predictor of Conscious Regulation of Behavior. Structural equation models reveal that the Supervisory Attention System and Verification of Behavior for Learning are key predictors of Conscious Monitoring of Responsibilities, and that the latter also positively influences Emotional and Behavioral Regulation.",

          "authors": "Charly Marie; Emma de Araujo; David Bourguignon",
          "abstract": "Unemployed people are stigmatized, and the psychological mechanisms linking stigma to job search behavior from their perspective remain to be explored. We examine how experienced, anticipated, and internalized stigma are related to self-efficacy, job search behavior, and access to employment of unemployed people. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we conduct a three-part study with cross-sectional and longitudinal psychological, behavioral, and job access data from 2,098 French jobseekers. Study 1a shows that a model in which experienced stigma predicts anticipated stigma, which in turn predicts internalized stigma, has better model fit and selection indices than a model in which anticipated stigma predicts experienced stigma, which in turn predicts internalized stigma. Study 1b extends this model by demonstrating that all three stigma processes are negatively correlated with self-efficacy, with internalized stigma negatively mediating most of the relationship between experienced stigma and anticipated stigma with self-efficacy. Study 1c further links self-efficacy to objective job search behavior (number of applications sent within 90 days) and access to employment after 180 days. The findings highlight a complex interplay of stigma processes. While internalized stigma consistently, directly and indirectly impairs outcomes, anticipated stigma shows both direct and indirect mobilizing and inhibiting effects on self-efficacy and behavior. This work advances theoretical models of stigma components and emphasizes self-efficacy as a critical intervention target for improving employment outcomes of stigmatized unemployed individuals.",

          "abstract": "We report two experiments demonstrating that visual word recognition is impeded by the presence of nearby stimuli, especially adjacent words. Reading research has converged on a consensus that skilled readers control their attention to make use of information from adjacent (primarily upcoming) words, increasing reading efficiency. Other lines of research seem to point to potential interference from nearby items, yet this has not been investigated at the critical lexical level. To specifically target lexical activation, here we employ a novel variant of the visual world paradigm with masked (75 ms) flanked visual word targets, contrasting five flanker conditions across two experiments, namely none, repeated symbols, unknown font strings, pseudowords, and words. Analysis of multiple observed variables from 60 and 58 adult Norwegian speakers showed strong interference—compared to no flankers—for all flanker conditions except the repeated symbols. Interference increased with additional levels of possible flanker processing, and was greatest for higher-frequency word targets, consistent with rapid dynamic modulation of attentional breadth. Our findings demonstrate that nearby words interfere with lexical activation of the fixated word and call for a more nuanced approach to the role of preview in fluent reading. We conclude that skilled reading involves a constant complex interplay between the drive toward efficiency, which requires a broad attentional field, and the need to shield processing from interference, which limits attentional breadth.",

Overcoming a key methodological limitation of past approaches, we used Bayesian censored location scale models as an alternative modeling approach that accounts for biases introduced by bounded rating scales. The results showed that the variability estimates from the models had reliabilities around rel = .64, which can be sufficient for group-level predictions. Additionally, the latent stability of r = .60 provides evidence for stable individual differences in emotional variability, suggesting that it is more than just a transient state. We ran exploratory analyses to further examine the influence of external events and individual life transitions on emotional variability and found that emotional variability was responsive to environmental changes.",

          "authors": "Jannis Friedrich; Martin Fischer; Markus Raab",
          "abstract": "The field of grounded cognition is concerned with how concepts are represented by being embedded in the bodily modalities. Considerable empirical work supports this core tenet, but the field is rife with meta-theoretical issues which prevent meaningful progress. We describe these issues and provide a solution: an overarching theoretical framework. The two most commonly cited grounded cognition theories are perceptual symbol systems and conceptual metaphor theory. Under perceptual symbol systems, concepts are represented by integrating fragments of multi-modal percepts in a simulator. Conceptual metaphor theory involves a limited number of image schemas, primitive structural regularities extracted from interaction with the environment, undergoing a limited number of transformations into a concept. Both theories constitute important developments to understanding mental representations, yet we argue that currently, they impede progress because they are prematurely elaborate. This forces them to rely on overly specific assumptions, which generates a lack of conceptual clarity and unsystematic testing of empirical work. Our minimalist account takes grounded cognition ‘back to basics’ with a common-denominator framework supported by converging evidence from other fields. It postulates that concepts are represented by simulation, re-activating the mental states that were active when experiencing this concept, and metaphoric mapping, when concrete representations serve to represent abstract concepts. This enables incremental theory development without uncertain assumptions because it enables falsificationist methods, while allowing for explorative or descriptive research. Our proposal counteracts meta-theoretical issues and encourages a falsificationist research program that allows to integrate grounded cognition into the cognitive sciences.",

          "abstract": "In the cognitive ageing literature, the dedifferentiation hypothesis refers to cognitive skills becoming more interrelated in older adulthood. Here, we find evidence for cognitive dedifferentiation in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936). The LBC1936 is a narrow-age longitudinal cohort, across five waves of data collected approximately every three years between the ages of 70 and 82 years. Here, we use the data from N = 418 participants (49% male) who provided cognitive data at each of the five waves. We modelled a latent factor of general cognitive functioning (g) at each wave in a structural equation modelling framework. The percentage of variance that g accounts for across 13 cognitive tests increases by wave; wave 1 to wave 5: 25%, 27%, 29%, 31%, 36%. Here, g is a structural equation model-derived latent trait on which all included cognitive tests have standardized loadings &gt; 0.3, p &lt; .001. The mean standardised loadings of individual tests on g increased from wave 1 to wave 5 as follows: 0.49, 0.51, 0.53, 0.55, and 0.59. We report strong negative associations between the wave-based increase in variance explained and the mean g score estimates (r = -0.991, p = .001). Thus, the group-level rate of dedifferentiation closely tracks the group-level rate of cognitive decline. Future longitudinal research will be crucial in clarifying the incremental validity, determinants, mechanisms and implications of cognitive differentiation and dedifferentiation across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Habitual behaviour is commonly assumed to operate outside of conscious awareness, driven by stimulus-response (S-R) associations rather than goal-directed evaluation. However, whether habitual instrumental behaviours can be triggered by stimuli that are not consciously perceived remains an understudied question. In a preregistered within-subjects study (N after exclusions = 75), we examined this question by employing a symmetrical outcome revaluation task. Participants underwent extensive instrumental training, forming strong S-R associations, before completing two testing stages: a conscious stage with fully visible stimuli and an unconscious stage where stimuli were rendered subliminal via visual masking. In the conscious condition, participants exhibited habitual control, responding more accurately to habit-congruent (still-valuable, still-non-valuable) stimuli than to habit-incongruent (upvalued, devalued) stimuli, replicating prior findings. However, in the unconscious condition participants did not exhibit above-chance accuracy, and responses were not biased toward habitual actions, suggesting that subliminal stimuli were unable to elicit either habitual or goal-directed responses. These findings challenge the notion that habitual control of instrumental behaviour can function independently of stimulus awareness and suggest that conscious access to action-relevant cues may be necessary even for well-established S-R associations to guide behaviour.",

Our results indicate that sensitivity (d' values) was significantly higher for unexpected items compared to expected ones, suggesting that novel stimuli enhanced recognition. However, response bias (c values) did not significantly differ between conditions, indicating a conservative recognition strategy for both stimulus types. Subsequent analyses revealed that the enhanced recognition of unexpected items was attributable to an increased ability to accurately reject new items rather than improved encoding of old items during the initial exposure. These findings suggest that older individuals perceive unexpected stimuli differently from known (expected) stimuli, with their memory advantage for unexpected pictures stemming from superior discriminating of new (lure) items rather than improved encoding. This study highlights the importance of using semantically meaningful and complex visual stimuli in cognitive assessments of older populations, enhancing the ecological validity of memory assessments.",

          "authors": "Diane Caroline Mézière; Johanna K. Kaakinen; Emilia Ranta; Karin Kukkonen; Jonathan Smallwood; Jaana Simola",
          "abstract": "While reading narrative texts, the reader’s thoughts and attention often fluctuate from thoughts related to the content of the text (e.g., immersion into the story world), to thoughts unrelated to the text (e.g., mind-wandering). Research on mind-wandering and immersion suggests that these types of thought patterns influence the reading process in different ways. In this article, we examine the types of thoughts readers have while reading a literary text. Specifically, we investigated the effect of immersion and mind-wandering episodes on eye-movement behavior during reading. Fifty-six participants took part in the experiment and read extracts from Siri Hustvedt ”Memories of the Future” while their eye-movements were monitored. Participants’ thoughts were probed at regular intervals during reading using the multidimensional experience sampling method. We identified four thought components using principal component analysis on the responses to the prompts: Immersion, Mind-wandering, Sub-Vocalization, and Social Episodic Thoughts. We then ran General Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to examine the effect of these four thought types on eye movement behaviour and reading processes. Specifically, we examined the effect of thought types on the word frequency effect. Results show that eye movement behaviour and processing are influenced by the types of thoughts readers experience while reading literary texts. These results have important implications for the way that mind-wandering is typically investigated, particularly in reading research.",

Here, we review empirical and theoretical work to access and model these miniature maps in human visual cortex. We aim to present a balanced view of the foundational work of the past and the current state-of-the-art capabilities. Specifically, we discuss how empirical retinotopic mapping enabled the development of theoretical and computational models of retinotopy and, subsequently, how these models have been used to better understand the retinotopic organization of the human visual cortex. Finally, we discuss a non-exhaustive list of potential future directions to further our understanding of these visual field maps, including their structure-functional relationships, individual variability, and more.",

          "authors": "Greta Manini; Francisco Garre-Frutos; Elisa Martín-Arévalo; Fabiano Botta; Juan Lupiáñez",
          "abstract": "Perceptual load theory (Forster &amp; Lavie, 2008) is a key framework in visual attention research, demonstrating that under high-load conditions, fully irrelevant distractors are no longer processed and do not disrupt task performance. In our recent work (Manini et al., 2025), we replicated this effect. However, we also found that under high load, the distractor not only failed to impair performance but actually led to faster reaction times (RTs) in distractor-present trials. In the broader attentional capture literature, this reversed effect is typically considered to reflect distractor suppression. However, in the perceptual load task, where the distractor is placed outside the relevant search array, suppression should not logically lead to faster responses.  Furthermore, the faster responses were accompanied by increased error rates, leading us to hypothesize that this reversed effect reflects spatially controlled attentional capture rather than distractor suppression. Specifically, the distractor may alert the attentional system, accelerating responses, while attention moving to its position remains somehow controlled, as the distractor is never the target. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed the consistency of this effect across all available open-data resources using the Forster and Lavie (2008) task. We then reanalyzed the same data, incorporating the spatial proximity between target and distractor, observing that trials with the distractor near the target strongly drove the reversed RT effect, while trials with the distractor far from the target led to increased error rates. These findings challenge the idea that high perceptual load prevents attentional capture by irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, they suggest that faster RTs in distractor-present conditions do not necessarily indicate distractor suppression, as commonly assumed in attentional capture research, giving new insight into the interpretation of this reversed effect.",

Whereas researchers focus mostly on between-person questions, clinicians are at least as – and in some cases more - interested in within-person questions. This could pose a challenge for science-practice integration as the clinical community may feel as though the research evidence being produced is not as relevant as it could be, and the scientific community in turn might feel as though practice in the clinical community is not sufficiently evidence-based.",

          "abstract": "Understanding one another in daily communication depends on predicting language from prior discourse context and visual signals, such as co-speech gestures. However, it remains unclear how discourse context and gestures jointly shape neural predictions during naturalistic language processing. Here, participants watched multimodal narratives with spontaneously-produced gestures during fMRI scanning. Leveraging transformer-based computational modeling, we disentangled linguistic uncertainty from contextual informativity at the sentence level, and observed that these deconstructed measures engaged neural regions associated with predictive processing across multiple multimodal representational levels. Further, greater gesture availability reduced the neural cost associated with these predictive processes and lessened reliance on discourse context, revealing a push-pull synergy between gestures and context. Our findings extend hierarchical predictive processing frameworks, demonstrating that gestures and discourse jointly, rather than additively, constrain neural predictions at multiple representational scales. These results demonstrate the critical and dynamically integrated role of multimodal predictive mechanisms in everyday communication.",

          "abstract": "Time series are becoming a common type of data in psychological research, allowing us to study the dynamics of human functioning at an unprecedented level of granularity. Much of the current modelling work focuses on variations of vector autoregressive (VAR) models, in which variables are predicted by themselves and other variables at previous time points. An alternative to these models are Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which model time series with a process that switches between a number of latent states, each associated with a different response distribution. Despite the fact that HMMs are often both theoretically interesting and can provide a better model fit for many time series, HMMs have rarely been used to model psychological time series. The reason for this has been the lack of software to fit HMMs in a multilevel setting, which is required both to make estimation feasible in a realistic applied setting, and to quantify and account for heterogeneity between subjects. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing multilevel HMMs and their estimation in a Bayesian setting; we evaluate with numerical experiments how well these models can be estimated in settings corresponding to empirical research using the R package mHMMbayes; and we provide a fully reproducible tutorial that guides the reader through all steps of model selection, model checking, and interpretation using an openly available dataset on emotion dynamics. Finally, we discuss the potential positive impact of adding multilevel HMMs to the time series modelling toolbox and discuss directions for further methodological improvements.",

This study utilized a live image relay system to deliver real-time performances of positive (smiling) and negative (frowning) facial expressions by the android Nikola to participants, alongside prerecorded video presentations. Subjective valence and arousal ratings were collected, along with facial electromyography (EMG) from the corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major muscles. Results indicated that live negative facial expressions elicited lower valence and higher arousal compared to their video counterparts. Facial EMG revealed that live facial expressions induced greater congruent facial muscular activity than pre-recorded videos.

          "abstract": "In dialogue, speakers align with their interlocutors at various linguistic levels and can adjust their utterances in light of their interlocutor’s demographic attributes (e.g., dialectal background) to facilitate communicative success (i.e., interlocutor modelling). This study further investigated whether speakers align with their interlocutor in their perspective of reference (e.g., referring to a person by their occupation or appearance; e.g., a monk or having a bold head). More importantly, we tested whether such perspective alignment, if any, is larger with a linguistically less competent interlocutor (a child interlocutor compared to an adult interlocutor in Experiment 1 and a non-native-speaking interlocutor compared to a native-speaking interlocutor in Experiment 2) and whether perspective alignment is sensitive to whether the participant and the interlocutors were engaged in a communicative task or not. In two experiments, participants carried out a communicative task with an online interlocutor (i.e., they took turns to describe a picture of a person so that the other person could click on the described picture) and a non-communicative task (they took turns to describe pictures without the need for the other person to click on the described picture) in Mandarin Chinese. Results showed that participants demonstrated greater perspective alignment a linguistically less competent interlocutors in both tasks. Such an interlocutor effect was observed in both the communicative and non-communicative tasks, though it was more pronounced in the former than in the latter. These findings support a hybrid model of interlocutor modeling is both goal-directed and implicit: while speakers tailor their utterances in light of their interlocutor’s demographics to boost communicative success, such interlocutor-sensitivity seems to additionally be driven by an implicit mechanism even in the absence of explicit communicative goals.",

Leveraging a longitudinal dataset that tracks an entirely new network of college freshmen (N=187), we test whether ‘climbing the social ladder’ depends on knowing how other people are connected to each other. Those who ultimately come to occupy the most influential positions exhibit early and accurate representations of their network’s general, abstract structure (i.e., who belongs to which communities and cliques). In contrast, detailed, granular representations of specific friendships do not translate into gains in social influence over time. Only once the network stabilizes, do the most influential individuals exhibit the most accurate representations of specific friendships. These findings reveal that those who climb the social ladder first detect their emerging network’s general structure, then fine-tune their knowledge about individual relationships between their peers as network dynamics settle.",

          "abstract": "After the Syria Conflict in 2011, Turkey has accepted about four million Syrian refugees. Initially, they were seen as guests, but after eight years, the Turkish Government has spent more than forty billion USD, and the money that has been spent is seen as a burden by both the Government and the people. That’s why some Turkish people started using negative language against Syrian Refugees not only for economic reasons but also political. This study aims to understand the impact of young Syrian refugees’ social exclusion with temporary protection status on their daily lives. It is thought that the stigmatization and negative discourses by the Society in which they live leads to social exclusion, and this has a fundamental effect on daily life practices. In this study, it is understood that Syrian Youth sometimes face exclusion and negative discourses in their daily lives in family, friends, education, and other fields. According to their statements, these exclusion situations differ according to their gender and education. Especially, women confront with some exclusion because of language and behaviors. Education should be used as a leverage to increase the integration between Turkish and Syrian People and integration policies based on multiculturalism must be produced to increase the harmony between two societies.",

The study was carried out with the quantitative method and snowball sampling. The obtained data were evaluated by correlation, mediator and moderator analysis methods. According to the data obtained in the study, Perceived social support and satisfaction with life have a significant effect on social functionality. Satisfaction with life has a full mediating effect on the effect of perceived social support on social functionality. In other words, as a Syrian youth's perceived social support grows, so does their social functionality, and satisfaction with life has a full mediating positive effect on this relationship. Planning activity, which is an active coping strategy, has a positive moderating effect on the connection between perceived social support and social functionality, according to this model.

          "abstract": "When girls are pearls, does it mean that they are beautiful or that they are pleasant? Not only are metaphors open to different interpretations but also these interpretations might vary across individuals, even with the same cultural context. However, the literature lacks a description of which patterns of interpretation emerge across individuals and which factors might drive them. Here, we investigated the role of multimodality, intended as the contribution of different dimensions of experience-based information, to explain individual variability in metaphor interpretation. We analyzed participants’ interpretations in a metaphor verbalization task according to a series of semantic features of words (affective, cognitive, and sensory) that mirror different cognitive mechanisms. With an innovative method that combines i) Natural Language Processing (NLP), ii) a multivariate statistical technique that derives Intersubject Representational Dissimilarity Matrixes (IS-RDMs), and iii) a data-driven clustering method, we were able to identify two groups of participants. One cluster, which we named mentalizers, exhibited greater use of cognitive and affective terms (e.g. the girls-pearls metaphors was explained as indicating that girls are pleasant), while the other cluster, which we named imagers, capitalized more on words expressing sensory-based features (e.g., girls were described as beautiful). Our study showed that a data-driven approach can capture different metaphor interpretative profiles from word-level semantic features and that differences are driven by the sensorimotor vs. sociocognitive dimensions. This suggest that there are multiple alternative routes to derive metaphorical meaning, involving different modality systems in the multimodal network for metaphor.",

Each of these three steps—perceptions, evaluations, and action-selections—show both situational and developmental variability.

But like speech perception, and unlike several other perceptual systems, they are uniquely human. The systems of tonal and metrical perception form a foundational structure for musicality that, when combined with the processing of other acoustical information (e.g., timbre, auditory scenes), and applied in conjunction with other cognitive domains, yields a human psychology of music.",

          "abstract": "Niektóre modele psychologiczne – szczególnie złożone, typologiczne lub posiadające strukturę trójwymiarową – nie mogą zostać poprawnie zweryfikowane w klasycznej przestrzeni 2D. Ich rzut na płaszczyznę geometrycznie zniekształca rzeczywiste relacje między zmiennymi lub osobami, prowadząc do fałszywych uproszczeń i błędnych interpretacji. W odpowiedzi na to ograniczenie artykuł proponuje rozszerzenie przestrzeni pomiaru z wykorzystaniem narzędzi sztucznej inteligencji, w szczególności maszyny wektorów nośnych (SVM) z radialnym jądrem bazowym (RBF), umożliwiającej transformację danych do przestrzeni o wyższych wymiarach.\nArtykuł przesuwa punkt ciężkości pomiaru z relacji między zmiennymi na relacje między osobami traktowanymi jako wektory cech psychologicznych. Pokazuje, że kernel nie tylko klasyfikuje dane, ale przekształca samą przestrzeń, w której dane funkcjonują – tworząc nowy układ geometryczny, w którym możliwa staje się weryfikacja modeli złożonych i głębokich. W tej nowej logice osoby stają się nośnikami modelu, a nie jedynie obserwacjami danych. Ukoronowaniem koncepcji jest projekt skali psychometrycznej opartej na niezależnych wektorach odpowiedzi, kompatybilnej ze strukturą przestrzeni jądrowej. Całość stanowi przełomowe przesunięcie: od przestrzeni zmiennych do przestrzeni osób, od rzutów geometrycznych do strukturalnej głębi modeli psychologicznych.",

          "abstract": "Creating engaging, well-controlled neuroimaging tasks for children can be difficult and time-consuming. To simplify and accelerate the process, we developed an automated pipeline that combines existing audio generation and animation tools to generate customizable audiovisual stimuli from text input, such as for studies of language comprehension. The pipeline consists of two components: the first generates auditory stimuli from text using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, and the second uses Adobe Character Animator to create video stimuli in which an animated character says the stimuli out loud. We evaluated the pipeline with two stimulus sets, including comparing generated audio stimuli to existing human-recorded stimuli. The pipeline is efficient, taking less than 2 minutes to generate each audiovisual stimulus, and less than 9% of stimuli needed to be regenerated. The audio generation component is particularly fast, taking less than 1 second per stimulus, and the resulting stimuli are less variable in pitch and some measures of intensity than human-recorded audio stimuli. This pipeline demonstrates the potential of leveraging automated tools for stimuli development, especially for stimuli that are time-consuming to create manually and for designs that require large quantities of well-controlled stimuli.",

          "abstract": "Graduate students are a vital component of the academic enterprise. They produce research, teach, mentor, and provide healthcare and other critical services. Evidence suggests that a large proportion of graduate students experience high levels of depression and anxiety, attracting the attention of policy makers. Yet past work has relied on cross-sectional surveys and samples that are small, non-representative, and lack appropriate benchmarks. Consequently, it remains unclear whether this apparent crisis is abating or worsening, and whether it is specific to graduate students or simply reflects surging levels of distress among young adults. We leveraged data acquired from 187,054 U.S. students between 2008 and 2019 to demonstrate that emotional distress, psychiatric illness, suicidality, and poor general health are disturbingly common and that these metrics have steadily deteriorated. We used data collected from 443,894 U.S. adults over the same 11-year period to show that graduate students are significantly more likely to experience mental illness, suicidality, and poor general health compared to their demographically matched non-student peers and the general public. These observations provide the first comprehensive analysis of the state of graduate student mental health in the U.S. and some of the strongest evidence that graduate training confers heightened risk for mental illness and suicide.",

          "abstract": "Some psychological models—especially complex, typological ones or those with a three-dimensional structure—cannot be properly verified within the classical 2D measurement space. Their projection onto a plane geometrically distorts the actual relationships between variables or persons, leading to false simplifications and erroneous interpretations. In response to this limitation, the article proposes an expansion of the measurement space using tools from artificial intelligence—specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel—which enable the transformation of data into higher-dimensional spaces.\nThe article shifts the focus of measurement from relationships between variables to relationships between individuals, treated as vectors of psychological traits. It demonstrates that the kernel RBF not only classifies data but transforms the very space in which the data operate—creating a new geometric framework in which the verification of complex and deep models becomes possible. In this new logic, individuals become carriers of the model rather than mere data observations. The concept culminates in a proposal for a psychometric scale based on independent response vectors, compatible with the structure of kernel space. Altogether, this constitutes a breakthrough shift: from variable space to person space, from geometric projections to the structural depth of psychological models.",

          "abstract": "Purpose: Physicians can play a critical role in the early identification and treatment of eating disorders (EDs), yet many report low confidence in diagnosing and managing these illnesses. ED education during medical training has the potential to improve physicians’ competence in recognizing, diagnosing, and treating EDs. This study assessed the content of ED education in preclinical medical training to identify opportunities to strengthen curricula.\n\nMethod: Slide content from 15 ED lecture presentations used between 2019 and 2024 in preclinical medical education at either Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) institutions in the United States was analyzed. Through a directed qualitative content analysis, the depth and breadth of textual content were examined and the use of visual aids in slide content was assessed.\n\nResults: Slides often acknowledged the multifactorial nature of EDs. They primarily focused on anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, but not other EDs. Images reinforced stereotypes about who develops EDs, and there was limited mention of weight stigma as a barrier to diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, ED treatment options, including therapeutic modalities, pharmacotherapies, and levels of care, were introduced but not described in detail. \n\nConclusions: Physicians are well-positioned to identify and treat EDs. However, findings suggest that significant gaps exist in the coverage of EDs in preclinical medical education. Current preclinical education may inadvertently reinforce misconceptions that hinder the ability of physicians to detect diverse presentations of EDs early and facilitate treatment. Recommendations are offered to guide future lecture development and strengthen ED-related educational content.",

This presents an opportunity to improve how financial institutions offer products through proven strategies such as warm handoffs.\nIn collaboration with a debt management and a financial services company, we conducted a field experiment testing the impact of a warm handoff process. This culminated in an offer to engage in a financial advisor call for further guidance on the next steps in their financial journey for participants completing a debt management plan (DMP). In the months leading up to their DMP graduation, 1,329 clients received either a four-email handoff over four months (high-touch), a one-email handoff (streamlined), or no handoff email (the control). \nWe see stronger open and click-through rates for the handoff email in the high-touch treatment, compared to the streamlined treatment. Otherwise, we see statistically significant differences in open rates by race, with people of color engaging with these resources at higher rates. This suggests that behaviorally informed warm handoff strategies could effectively improve engagement with financial resources and financial well-being, particularly for people of color.",

          "abstract": "Physiognomy, the idea that a person’s character is reflected in their facial features, has a long history in scholarly thought. Although now widely regarded as pseudoscience in academic circles, recent work suggests that laypeople hold physiognomic beliefs and that belief endorsement is associated with support for facial profiling technology and other outcomes. Here, we investigate who believes in physiognomy in four studies (three preregistered). In a large, representative sample of the Dutch population, about 50% at least somewhat endorsed physiognomic beliefs (Study 1, n = 2,624). Belief prevalence was similar across different sociodemographic groups (i.e., gender, age, education, income). Across different measures of thinking styles and other lay beliefs, we found that physiognomic beliefs were most strongly related to how much people trust their intuitions—an association that emerged consistently with British (Study 2, n = 224), Nigerian (Study 3, n = 147), and Dutch participants (Study 4, n = 388). Participants who scored higher on faith in intuition were also more confident in the accuracy of their face-based trustworthiness impressions. In sum, the present studies suggest that lay beliefs in physiognomy are (a) common, (b) similarly endorsed across various socio-demographic groups, and (c) associated with an intuitive thinking style.",

          "abstract": "Despite scientific consensus on human-caused climate change, skepticism and inaction persist. We ask whether facts and evidence - tailored to address each person’s specific concerns by an AI model - can address climate skepticism and motivate climate action. Participants first described their main climate change reservation. Of the N = 1,947 who articulated reservations, the most prevalent were the belief that climate change has natural causes (15%), feeling overwhelmed by the problem (10%), and concerns about the economic consequences of climate policies (8%). Participants were then randomized to (1) have a conversation with a Large Language Model (LLM) that was given the goal of addressing their climate reservations, (2) discuss an irrelevant topic with the LLM (i.e., control), or (3) receive static information about the scientific consensus around climate change (i.e., “standard-of-care”) after the control conversation. The LLM treatment significantly reduced participants’ conviction in their specific reservations, while consensus messaging had no significant effect. Both treatments led to significant increases in general pro-climate attitudes, but the LLM treatment was significantly more effective than consensus messaging - particularly for increasing willingness to make sacrifices to address climate change. Pre-treatment beliefs did not moderate treatment effectiveness, and the treatment substantially reduced Republicans’ reservations (although less than for Independents or Democrats). We also find evidence that roughly 35% to 40% of the LLM treatment effect persisted after one month. These findings highlight that it is possible to reach many of the climate skeptical or hesitant with the right facts and evidence.",

          "abstract": "Narrative comprehension involves deriving meaning from information and constructing a mental representation of a narrative's components. It conveys knowledge, information, and explanations, playing a crucial role in everyday life. Inferencing – is one of the key processes in narrative comprehension. While cognitive changes associated with aging are well-documented, research on narrative comprehension and inferencing in older adults remains inconclusive, highlighting the need for further study. Despite being ever-present in modern life, the role of stress in this process also remains largely unexplored. This online study involved 298 participants, who were randomly assigned to either a stress group, which underwent stress induction, or a control group. Participants viewed picture-based narratives and were tasked with filling in missing elements by describing the middle part of the story in their own words. This approach differs from previous studies that primarily assessed inferences using comprehension questions or true-false statements, enabling us to capture the inference generation process as it unfolds.\nThe findings show that narrative comprehension, including inference generation, remains stable across age and education groups and is unaffected by acute stress. This highlights the resilience of these abilities, even under challenging conditions. The implications for cognitive theories and directions for future research are discussed.",

          "abstract": "The vagus nerve, a core component of the parasympathetic nervous system, mediates information transfer between the body’s internal milieu and the brain. This nerve can be stimulated non-invasively at the ear using transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS). Concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) permits study of taVNS-induced changes in brain dynamics, a key requisite for precision neurostimulation. To date, however, there is no standardized protocol for how to safely apply taVNS during MRI. One major risk is temperature increase exceeding innocuous thresholds due to coupling of the emitted radio frequency (RF) pulse during imaging. Thus, we developed and tested a stimulator cable configuration with floating ground cable traps and filter plate connectors. We measured temperature, resonance of the stimulation electrodes, and current interference using unmodified and modified stimulation cables. Measurements were conducted with phantoms and human participants at 3T field strength. Demonstrating the safety of the modifications in different contexts, the efficacy of the modification was independently tested in two other sites using different 3T MRI scanner models, stimulators, and stimulation strength. The modified compared to the unmodified cable considerably reduced RF heating as the relative temperature increase stayed well below the 2 K threshold specified by the ASTM F2182 standard. Additionally, in accordance with ASTM 2119, we can rule out potential distortion and signal loss around the electrodes due to current flow from the stimulator and even demonstrate that impaired image quality in brainstem and midbrain regions is recovered using the modified cable. Hence, we show that adding floating ground cable traps to the stimulator cable allows the safe use of taVNS with fMRI and may improve image quality in functional imaging. To enable other researchers to modify their hardware in the same way, we provide details of the modifications.",

          "abstract": "Feedback is widely recognized as a key mechanism in educational psychology, shaping learn-ing through cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes. Despite a rich body of research, core questions remain regarding when feedback is effective, why it works, and for whom it fos-ters meaningful learning. To examine the psychological and contextual mechanisms underlying feedback effectiveness, the studies included in this issue draw on diverse methodologies, in-cluding controlled experiments, longitudinal tracking in school settings, and digital trace anal-yses from authentic learning platforms. Central themes include the role of learner characteris-tics in feedback reception, the emotional and motivational dimensions of feedback processing, the impact of design and delivery features, and the reciprocal dynamics between feedback pro-viders and receivers. What emerges across these contributions is a view of feedback as a dia-logic and interpretive process, embedded within broader sociocultural and instructional sys-tems. Insights from neuroscience, digital learning environments, and achievement motivation research further advance theorizing on feedback processes and point toward new directions for empirically grounded, interdisciplinary inquiry. Building on these insights and informed by re-cent theoretical and empirical developments, we offer a model that conceptualizes feedback as a multilayered process—shaped by individual, contextual, and social dynamics, and unfolding across cognitive, emotional, and motivational dimensions. This model captures the complexity of feedback interactions and highlights how feedback can support learners’ ongoing develop-ment, both in terms of immediate learning outcomes and longer-term academic development. We outline how such an integrative perspective is necessary for developing feedback practices that are more targeted, responsive, and impactful for lasting educational growth.",

Might our dissociated judgments of others’ mental states be linked to dissociated judgments of others’ gaze direction, one of our earliest social cues from infancy? We presented adults (N = 600) and 6- to 8-year-old children (N = 200) with brief descriptions of either phenomenal or intentional mental states and asked them to choose whether a face with averted or direct gaze better matched the character in each description. Adults and older children chose the averted-gaze face for the phenomenality descriptions but the direct-gaze face for the intentionality descriptions. Humans’ dissociated use of gaze from infancy may thus persist into adulthood and impact our emerging concepts of others as social agents, i.e., persons.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models offer powerful means for testing competing theoretical frameworks. The question of how one should choose the best among competing explanations of data is a central focus of the scientific enterprise. The success of one model versus another depends on robust methods guiding evaluation of a model’s ability to capture the data, balanced with a requirement of a model’s parsimony. Several fruitful approaches for model comparison have been used in the areas of cognitive and mathematical psychology, focusing on identifying the balance of model fit with model complexity measured by the number of free parameters. However, model complexity and flexibility may not be always captured by the number of free parameters. Here, we review traditional approaches to model selection on a sample case of the prototype and exemplar models of categorization. We demonstrate several weaknesses of approaches based solely on parameter counts and demonstrate how computationally intensive methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations, may help overcome those weaknesses. We demonstrate advantages of the Monte Carlo approach for comparison of each model to chance, comparison of two models with equal number of parameters, comparison of two models with differing number of parameters, as well as quantification of uncertainty during model selection. We conclude by discussing the practicalities of model selection using computationally-intensive approaches.",

Both of the following two predictions were supported in the current study: (1) women will avoid the high-cost option more than men, and (2) if one’s partner is of the opposite sex, there will be a difference in cost preference between men and women. Furthermore, the findings showed that men were not, on average, either cost-preferring or cost-avoiding, whereas women displayed a tendency to avoid costs. There was no difference in women’s cost preference whether their partner was of the opposite sex or the same sex, whereas men were more likely to prefer costs when their partner was of the opposite sex than when their partner was of the same sex.",

          "abstract": "Background: Various facets of narcissism are thought to motivate diverging regulatory behaviors (e.g., risk avoidance, aggression, and self-enhancement), yet empirical evidence of these behaviors co-occurring with self-reported narcissism dimensions is lacking, especially in clinical contexts. We tested whether the dimensions of the Trifurcated Model of Narcissism (narcissistic neuroticism, antagonism, and extraversion) predicted trait-congruent behavioral responses to defeat in depressed older adults, comparing them to vulnerable-grandiose and Big Five traits.\nMethods: We conducted a rigged video game tournament study in 169 older adults with depression (mean age = 63±7 years), testing the hypotheses that narcissistic neuroticism and antagonism would increase and extraversion, decrease behavioral responses to anticipated defeat in a duel (point stealing from opponents) and that narcissistic antagonism and extraversion would increase and neuroticism, decrease self-enhancing responses to status threats in the group (post-duel rank buying).\nResults: Multilevel models including individual random slopes for trial (time on task) indicated that, contrary to our hypothesis, narcissistic neuroticism decreased point stealing. As hypothesized, narcissistic antagonism increased and narcissistic neuroticism decreased rank buying. Narcissistic extraversion and alternative vulnerable-grandiose or Big Five trait structures did not predict behavior, except for grandiose narcissism increasing rank buying.\nConclusions: Among Trifurcated Model components, narcissistic antagonism predicted increased status-enhancing behaviors, as did grandiosity. Narcissistic neuroticism predicted decreased status-enhancing responses, but also, unexpectedly, decreased defensive rule-breaking, consistent with self-deflation and submission in the face of defeat as opposed to rivalry. Real-life behavioral expressions of narcissistic neuroticism and antagonism may be important, distinct targets in psychotherapy of late-life depression.",

          "abstract": "Ostracism refers to a social situation during which one or more individuals are ignored or excluded. William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model” proposes that ostracism threatens fundamental social needs that individuals spontaneously attempt to secure by seeking reaffiliation. Using the Cyberball Game, a computerized ball-tossing game used to study psychological responses to ostracism via game social inclusion vs. exclusion conditions, recent studies showed that attention to social signals was an accurate proxy of the reaffiliation needs, themselves derived from  the social exclusion feelings. Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attentional is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s “Temporal Needs Threat Model”, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feelings. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, and that they likely depend on individual features. We discuss these results under the umbrella of concurrent frameworks and models.",

          "abstract": "In the cognitive ageing literature, the dedifferentiation hypothesis refers to cognitive skills becoming more interrelated in older adulthood. Here, we find evidence for cognitive dedifferentiation in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936). The LBC1936 is a narrow-age longitudinal cohort, across five waves of data collected approximately every three years between the ages of 70 and 82 years. Here, we use the data from N = 418 participants (49% male) who provided cognitive data at each of the five waves. We modelled a latent factor of general cognitive functioning (g) at each wave in a structural equation modelling framework. The percentage of variance that g accounts for across 13 cognitive tests increases by wave; wave 1 to wave 5: 25%, 27%, 29%, 31%, 36%. Here, g is a structural equation model-derived latent trait on which all included cognitive tests have standardized loadings &gt; 0.3, p &lt; .001. The mean standardised loadings of individual tests on g increased from wave 1 to wave 5 as follows: 0.49, 0.51, 0.53, 0.55, and 0.59. We report strong negative associations between the wave-based increase in variance explained and the mean g score estimates (r = -0.991, p = .001). Thus, the group-level rate of dedifferentiation closely tracks the group-level rate of cognitive decline. Future longitudinal research will be crucial in clarifying the incremental validity, determinants, mechanisms and implications of cognitive differentiation and dedifferentiation across the lifespan.",

          "authors": "Nick Byrd; Stephen Stich; Justin Sytsma",
          "abstract": "Reflective thinking often predicts less belief in God or less religiosity — so-called analytic atheism. However, those correlations involve limitations: widely used tests of reflection confound reflection with ancillary abilities such as numeracy; some studies do not detect analytic atheism in every country; experimentally encouraging reflection makes some non-believers more open to believing in God; and one of the most common online research participant pools seems to produce lower data quality. So analytic atheism may be less than universal or partially explained by confounding factors. To test this, we developed better measures, controlled for more confounds, and employed more recruitment methods. All four studies detected signs of analytic atheism above and beyond confounds (N &gt; 70,000 people from five of six continental regions). We also discovered analytic apostasy: the better a person performed on reflection tests, the greater their odds of losing their religion since childhood — even when controlling for confounds. Analytic apostasy even seemed to explain analytic atheism: apostates were more reflective than others and analytic atheism was undetected after excluding apostates. Religious conversion was rare and unrelated to reflection, suggesting reflection’s relationships to conversion and deconversion are asymmetric. Detected relationships were usually small, indicating reflective thinking is a reliable albeit marginal predictor of apostasy.",

Odwołując się do matematycznej topologii – w szczególności do pojęcia wymiarowości i rzutowania – proponuje nową interpretację konstruktów psychologicznych, wykraczającą poza klasyczne reprezentacje dwuwymiarowe. Artykuł podejmuje temat topologizacji w modelowaniu psychologicznym, wskazując, że wiele dotychczasowych modeli – tradycyjnie analizowanych w przestrzeniach dwuwymiarowych – może w rzeczywistości posiadać ukrytą strukturę trójwymiarową. W oparciu o analizy koncepcyjne, metodologiczne i psychometryczne autor(ka) pokazuje, że przejście do modelowania trójwymiarowego pozwala na pełniejsze odwzorowanie badanych konstruktów psychologicznych. Przykład modelu błędów wychowawczych Antoniny Guryckiej służy jako ilustracja sytuacji, w której pojawienie się dodatkowego wymiaru wynika z niespójności interpretacyjnych w centrum modelu kołowego. Artykuł omawia ograniczenia klasycznych metod statystycznych, takich jak analiza czynnikowa, i proponuje alternatywne podejścia analityczne – w tym maszyny wektorów nośnych z jądrem RBF (z obszaru sztucznej inteligencji) oraz topologiczną analizę danych (TDA). Metody te umożliwiają wychwycenie głębi i złożoności strukturalnej modeli psychologicznych, kwestionując tym samym dotychczasowe założenia psychometrii i diagnozy psychologicznej.

          "abstract": "Modern psychology has made great strides in identifying cognitive biases, yet it still lacks a unifying framework for modeling reflective, frame-aware reasoning. This paper proposes Pure Reason as a metacognitive architecture for cognitive self-correction. Rather than a fixed trait or algorithm, Pure Reason is defined as a regulative stance—a dynamic posture toward one’s own cognition. Drawing from epistemology, metacognitive research, and systems neuroscience, the framework outlines three core components: frame-awareness, cognitive curvature, and reframing capacity. These are operationalized through psychometric instruments, behavioral paradigms, and neurocognitive measures. By bridging philosophical theory, psychological methodology, and AI design, Pure Reason offers a practical model for cultivating higher-order cognition in both human and artificial agents—especially in a world increasingly shaped by complexity, uncertainty, and algorithmic mediation.",

Although physical effort is a defining concept of sports, work on conceptualizing its functions in this context is lacking. Here, we aim to fill this gap by examining the existing sports and physical activity literature, especially focusing on how the value-generating functions have been addressed in previous research. To ensure comprehensive coverage, a machine-learning approach (ASReview) was employed for efficient paper screening, resulting in a total of N = 20 relevant articles from an initial pool of 28,079 identified articles. Several of these articles provided evidence that physical effort can be inherently rewarding and add value to an outcome. Moreover, several research focal points could be identified: the generalization of effort's value across domains, developmental aspects, neural correlates of effort valuation, and different measurement approaches used to assess the value of physical effort. There is still a dearth of research investigating the value of physical effort in sports and exercise. A coherent theoretical framework, such as the Expected Value of Control theory and standardized measurement methods, may aid future research in understanding effort’s different functions.",

          "authors": "Agnieszka Szymańska",
          "abstract": "This article contributes to the ongoing debate on topological explanations by developing the concept of topologization in psychological modeling. Referring to mathematical topology—particularly the notions of dimensionality and projection—it proposes a new interpretation of psychological constructs that goes beyond classical two-dimensional representations. The article addresses the issue of topologization in psychological modeling, indicating that many existing models—traditionally analyzed in two-dimensional spaces—may in fact possess a hidden three-dimensional structure. Based on conceptual, methodological, and psychometric analyses, the author shows that the transition to three-dimensional modeling allows for a more complete representation of the studied psychological constructs. The example of Antonina Gurycka’s model of upbringing errors serves as an illustration of a situation in which the emergence of an additional dimension results from interpretative inconsistencies in the center of the circular model. The article discusses the limitations of classical statistical methods, such as factor analysis, and proposes alternative analytical approaches—including support vector machines with RBF kernel (from the field of artificial intelligence) and topological data analysis (TDA). These methods enable the detection of the depth and structural complexity of psychological models, thereby challenging existing assumptions in psychometrics and psychological diagnosis. The conclusion indicates how topologization may influence the future of psychological theory, measurement methods, and therapeutic interpretation.",

          "abstract": "Rising stress and anxiety, fueled by rapid sociocultural and economic shifts, digital overexposure, and the lasting impact of COVID-19, are driving investment in new tools for mental health designed to enhance resilience and well-being at scale. Music-based digital therapeutics (MDTs) are valuable in this space for their ability to modulate core dimensions of mental health (e.g., affect, reward, anxiety, sociality) through a globally popular and increasingly accessible medium. Here, we used a PICO (Population Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) keyword search strategy to structure Google search results, identifying twenty-three commercially available MDT technologies targeting stress, anxiety, and depressive mood in adults with music-based interventions. We organize these MDTs into five main categories based on ‘treatment’ approach: (1) Preference; (2) Affective Parameterization; (3) Affect Matching and Compensation; (4) Neural Entrainment; and (5) Biofeedback &amp; Neurofeedback. We review support for each of these approaches, focusing on basic research in music neuroscience and music therapy, as well as applied research testing specific MDTs. We conclude that, while the empirical supporting musical-based interventions for stress, anxiety, and depressive mood is substantial, research on MDTs specifically remains preliminary but promising. More research—particularly across larger, more varied samples—is needed to realize their promise for improving human health and well-being at scale.",

This study investigated the EEG oscillatory dynamics underlying S-R binding processes, focusing on the roles of event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) in the alpha/beta and theta frequency ranges during the integration and maintenance phases of S-R bindings. Using the S1R1-S2R2 task with response-stimulus intervals (RSIs) of 1000 ms and 3000 ms between the prime response and the onset of the probe display, we examined behavioral partial repetition costs and their neural correlates. Behavioral results confirmed the transient nature of S-R bindings, with greater partial repetition costs observed in the shorter RSI condition. EEG time-frequency analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between alpha/beta power changes (ERD) during the initial integration time window around the prime response and behavioral S-R binding. Beamformer analysis localized this correlation effect to the secondary visual cortex. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was observed between alpha power increase (ERS) during the maintenance time window before the probe display onset and behavioral S-R binding. No significant correlation between theta power and behavioral S-R binding was observed. Together, these findings highlight the distinct contributions of alpha/beta ERD and alpha ERS to the temporal dynamics of S-R bindings and advance our understanding of the neural oscillatory mechanisms underpinning perception-action integration and event-file maintenance.",

          "abstract": "We use crowd-sourced assessments from X’s Community Notes program to examine whether there are partisan differences in the sharing of misleading information. Unlike previous studies, misleadingness here is determined by agreement across a diverse community of platform users, rather than by fact-checkers. We find that 131% more posts by Republicans are flagged as misleading compared to posts by Democrats. These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful over-representation of Republicans among X users. Our findings provide strong evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing which cannot be attributed to political bias on the part of raters, and indicate that Republicans will be sanctioned more than Democrats even if platforms transition from professional fact-checking to Community Notes.",

          "abstract": "Psychological studies often suffer from low statistical power due to small sample sizes. In this preregistered study, we updated the study by Marszalek et al. (2011) to examine whether sample sizes in psychology have increased over time. We collected data from 3176 studies across six journals over three years. Results show a significant increase in sample sizes over time (b=44.83, t(6.25)=4.48, p=.004, 95%CI[25.23,64.43]), with median sample sizes being 40 in 1995, 56.5 in 2006, and 122.5 in 2019. This growth appears to be a response to the credibility crisis. While open science practices at the study level did not significantly impact sample sizes, we found that journals with stronger open science policies reported larger samples (b=42.94, t(3172)=5.98, p&lt;.001, 95%CI[28.83,57.05]). These results suggest that journal-level policy can play a crucial role. The increase in sample sizes is a promising development for the replicability and credibility of psychological science.",

          "abstract": "Rising stress and anxiety, fueled by rapid sociocultural and economic shifts, digital overexposure, and the lasting impact of COVID-19, are driving investment in new tools for mental health designed to enhance resilience and well-being at scale. Music-based digital therapeutics (MDTs) are valuable in this space for their ability to modulate core dimensions of mental health (e.g., affect, reward, anxiety, sociality) through a globally popular and increasingly accessible medium. Here, we used a PICO (Population Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) keyword search strategy to structure Google search results, identifying twenty-three commercially available MDT technologies targeting stress, anxiety, and depressive mood in adults with music-based interventions. We organize these MDTs into five main categories based on ‘treatment’ approach: (1) Preference; (2) Affective Parameterization; (3) Affect Matching and Compensation; (4) Neural Entrainment; and (5) Biofeedback &amp; Neurofeedback. We review support for each of these approaches, focusing on basic research in music neuroscience and music therapy, as well as applied research testing specific MDTs. We conclude that, while the empirical supporting musical-based interventions for stress, anxiety, and depressive mood is substantial, research on MDTs specifically remains preliminary but promising. More research—particularly across larger, more varied samples—is needed to realize their promise for improving human health and well-being at scale.",

          "abstract": "Moral decision-making involves a complex interplay between cognitive reasoning and emotional forces. This paper presents a theoretical model that formalizes moral decision processes using a sigmoid function to balance conative (driving) and inhibitory (restraining) forces. Each force is represented as a vector whose intensity is quantified on a standardized scale, allowing the model to compute an emotional score E. The probability of action is then determined by applying a sigmoid transformation to this score.\nThe model is illustrated through case studies, including Heinz's Dilemma and The Betrayed Husband Scenario, demonstrating how emotional and contextual factors influence decision-making. The paper also explores the empirical calibration of the sensitivity parameter k, which modulates decision reactivity, and discusses the limitations of linear addition in capturing non-linear and cumulative emotional effects.\nAdditionally, we propose an extension incorporating priming effects and contextual variables, such as social pressure or temporal influences. Future research directions include empirical validation through psychophysiological measurements (EEG, fMRI) and the integration of dynamic temporal adjustments to refine predictive accuracy. This approach aims to bridge the gap between affective-cognitive mechanisms and quantifiable decision models, with applications in moral psychology, behavioral sciences, and artificial intelligence ethics.",

However, factors such as how math anxiety is operationalized, the specific mathematical domain, gender, and cultural context may influence this relationship. Still, these factors have not been considered together and the results in primary school students have been inconsistent. Thus, this study aimed to investigate how math anxiety is related to arithmetic fluency and number processing in fourth-grade students across three cultural contexts (Finnish- and Swedish-speaking students from Finland and Swedish-speaking students from Sweden). In addition, we investigated the dimensionality of math anxiety (i.e., cognitive and affective dimensions) and gender differences in the level of and relations between math anxiety and mathematics performance. The sample included 1022 fourth-grade students (52.6% girls) from Finland and Sweden. The participants completed a survey measuring their math anxiety and a mathematics performance test (arithmetic fluency and number processing). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-dimensional math anxiety construct for the Finnish-speaking sample and a unidimensional math anxiety construct for the Swedish-speaking samples. The negative math anxiety–performance relationship was demonstrated in each sample, showing a slightly stronger association for arithmetic fluency than number processing. On average girls experienced higher levels of math anxiety and boys had better arithmetic fluency. The negative relationship between math anxiety and mathematics performance, especially for number processing, was stronger for boys. The results highlight the relationships between math anxiety and mathematics performance in fourth-grade students in Finland and Sweden. More research considering cultural (e.g., language) and gender differences is needed.",

However, the degree to which their findings would generalise to other speakers of their languages remains unclear. We will test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s findings using audio recordings of matched singing and conversational speech from 15-30 individuals per language in 26 sites around the world, collected as part of a broader study of global song/speech relationships (Savage et al., 2025 [In Principle Accepted]). For each site, we will replicate Ozaki et al.’s analyses for their three key features hypothesised to differ between song and speech: 1) pitch height (f0); 2) temporal rate (inter-onset interval of acoustic units [e.g., syllables/moras/notes]); 3) pitch stability (−|Δf0|). Using Peer Community In Registered Reports (PCI-RR)’s “Programmatic” track will allow us to test the replicability and generalizability of Ozaki et al.’s original findings in a rigorous and equitable manner by enabling each local research team to lead its own separate first-authored Stage 2 Registered Report based on a single shared Stage 1 protocol. This will allow us to test the replicability of Ozaki et al.’s original findings across diverse languages while also giving each team the flexibility to pursue their own exploratory analyses in directions most relevant to their local context. Regardless of results, our multi-site large-scale replications will enhance our understanding of cross-cultural relationships between music and language and provide a template for equitable global collaboration using PCI-RR’s Programmatic track.",

          "abstract": "Languages are widely known to become more regular over time, yet not all variation is regularized — some forms resist regularization and remain stable over many generations. A large body of work has explored why learners regularize unpredictable variation, often focusing on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie this behavior and how these mechanisms differ between adults and children. However, less attention has been given to investigating the factors that allow some variation to remain stable over time. In this paper, we propose that optionality may be a particularly stable form of linguistic variation, likely to resist cognitive pressures to regularize. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two artificial language learning experiments designed to investigate the conditions under which optionality remains stable or becomes regularized. In Experiment 1, we compared optional variation to variation involving two alternating overt forms, expecting optionality to show greater stability. In Experiment 2, we explored whether the frequency of the optional form would influence regularization, hypothesizing that rare optional forms might resist regularization more effectively than frequent ones. Our findings suggest that, while optionality is not inherently more stable, it is nonetheless special, revealing critical insights into cognitive mechanisms proposed to be responsible for regularization behavior in child and adult learners.",

          "abstract": "Background. Evaluating the social and emotional capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as their ability to recognize human facial emotion is critical as their role in human-computer interactions (HCIs) expands, particularly in healthcare applications. Facial expressions convey affective and clinical information, useful for detecting emotions, contextualizing language, understanding interpersonal dynamics, and identifying potential mental health and neurocognitive disorders. However, LLMs' ability to accurately interpret facial expressions remains unclear.\nMethods. We evaluated the agreement and accuracy of three leading LLM models, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Experimental, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, using the NimStim dataset, a benchmark of 672 facial expressions (calm, angry, happy, fear, sad, neutral, surprise, and disgust) from 43 diverse human actors resulting in 2,016 model-based emotion estimates.\nResults. All LLM models demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement with ground truth labels. Happy expressions had the highest agreement, while fear had the lowest due to high misclassification as surprise. GPT-4o and Gemini had the highest accuracy, with 95% CI lower bound exceeding 0.80, while Claude performed more poorly. There were no significant differences in accuracy as a function of actor sex or race. GPT-4o and Gemini reached human performance levels for overall facial emotion recognition with GPT-4o surpassing human performance for calm/neutral and surprise recognition, while Gemini surpassed human performance for surprise recognition.\nConclusion. As GenAI models increasingly mediate HCI and expand into healthcare, evaluating LLM’s socioemotional comprehension is crucial for healthcare applications. This study found that LLMs perform strongly relative to ground truth and comparably to human judges in recognizing prototypical facial expressions, with GPT-4o and Gemini models showing especially strong performance. This study lays the groundwork for evaluating the socioemotional capabilities of LLMs and highlights the need to address existing gaps for safe applications in future HCI and clinical settings.",

          "abstract": "Computational cognitive models offer powerful means for testing competing theoretical frameworks. The question of how one should choose the best among competing explanations of data is a central focus of the scientific enterprise. The success of one model versus another depends on robust methods guiding evaluation of a model’s ability to capture the data, balanced with a requirement of a model’s parsimony. Several fruitful approaches for model comparison have been used in the areas of cognitive and mathematical psychology, focusing on identifying the balance of model fit with model complexity measured by the number of free parameters. However, model complexity and flexibility may not be always captured by the number of free parameters. Here, we review traditional approaches to model selection on a sample case of the prototype and exemplar models of categorization. We demonstrate several weaknesses of approaches based solely on parameter counts and demonstrate how computationally intensive methods, such as Monte Carlo simulations, may help overcome those weaknesses. We demonstrate advantages of the Monte Carlo approach for comparison of each model to chance, comparison of two models with equal number of parameters, comparison of two models with differing number of parameters, as well as quantification of uncertainty during model selection. We conclude by discussing the practicalities of model selection using computationally-intensive approaches.",

Since the test used driving clips filmed in Australia from the left side of the roadway, the validity of the test for use in samples in the United States is not known. A new United States Video Speed Test (USVST) was developed. The new test used ten video clips, each 8 seconds in duration, which participants viewed before indicating how much slower or faster they would drive in the same scenario. In a pre-registered online study, the USVST showed high internal and test-retest reliability. Like the UQVST, the USVST correlated positively with scores on the speed subscale of the Driving Style Questionnaire and negatively with age. Further, the USVST showed a negative correlation with the cautious driving subscale of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory and a positive correlation with the sum of self-reported accidents, violations, and police pullovers. Males also scored significantly higher on the USVST than females. Collectively, this evidence suggested that the USVST may be a useful tool for measuring speeding propensity.",

          "abstract": "Theoretical accounts assume that key features of human social cognition are universal. Here we focus on gaze-following, the bedrock of social interactions and coordinated activities, to test this claim. In this comprehensive cross-cultural study spanning five continents and 17 distinct cultural communities, we examined the development of gaze-following in early childhood. We identified key processing signatures through a computational model that assumes that participants follow an individual’s gaze by estimating a vector emanating from the eye-center through the pupil. Using a single reliable touchscreen-based task, we found these signatures in all communities, suggesting that children worldwide processed gaze in highly similar ways. Absolute differences in performance between groups are accounted for by a cross-culturally consistent relationship between children’s exposure to touchscreens and their performance in the task. These results provide strong evidence for a universal process underlying a foundational socio-cognitive ability in humans that can be reliably inferred even in the presence of cultural variation in overt behavior.",

          "abstract": "Introduction \nPrior research documents strong associations between educational attainment with improved health and well-being outcomes. However, less is known about how childhood antecedents shape educational attainment in adulthood on a cross-national scale. Most studies on childhood antecedents of education have focused on the Western world with some breadth achieved in studies led by the OECD or UNESCO. However, there are still gaps in world regions in such studies. This work builds on existing analyses of childhood antecedents of educational attainment around the world by incorporating a range of childhood experiences, personal attributes, and familial or social circumstances.\n\nMethods\nThis study presents an in-depth, cross-national investigation of educational attainment across cultures and how childhood circumstances predict attainment. Using a diverse and international dataset of 202,898 participants from 22 countries, we examine how childhood characteristics predict educational attainment; predictors include parental marital status, . Our results will also present how associations vary across countries reflecting diverse societal influences and E-values for robustness check against potential unmeasured confounding.\n\nResults\nFirst, how do various aspects of childhood predict educational attainment (completing 16+ years of education) in adulthood, for which the factor of subjective financial status growing up (`Found is very difficult`) had the most consistently large effect on the likelihood of obtaining high attainment (RR=0.67; 95% CI [0.56,0.81]). Second, do these associations vary by country/territory, with the association of subjective financial status, for example, being the strongest in Egypt (RR=-1.77; 95% CI [-2.67, -0.87]), and weakness (not different than zero) in several countries including the United States, Germany, and Nigeria. Third, are the observed associations robust to potential unmeasured confounding, as assessed by E-values, for which the effect of subjective financial status is robust up to an unmeasured confounder with E=2.34 with educational attainment. The substantial variation in the association between childhood predictors of educational attainment will be unpacked in our full paper.\n\nConclusions \nThese results provide new evidence for the cross-cultural dynamics of the childhood antecedents of educational attainment on a cross-national scale and provide the foundation for additional inquiry in future waves of the GFS. The findings enhance our understanding of early-life predictors of adult outcomes and provide valuable evidence for developing approaches to promoting educational attainment as a form of social growth.",

          "authors": "Alex H K Wong",
          "abstract": "Extinction learning refers to a reduction in fear to a conditioned stimulus (CS) that previously signaled a threat, but now occurs without the expected threat. This mechanism is core to exposure-based treatments for anxiety-related disorders. Enhancing the generalization of extinction learning is crucial for improving treatment outcomes, as it helps reduce fear across a range of generalization stimuli (GSs) resembling the original fear-evoking CS. This narrative review identifies and covers three generalization of extinction learning models: 1) generalization of CS extinction learning, examining how extinction learning to the CS generalizes to novel GSs, 2) generalization of GS extinction learning, assessing how extinction learning to a GS generalizes to other novel GSs or the original CS, and 3) generalization of multiple stimuli extinction learning, where extinction learning involves multiple GSs (and sometimes the CS) and its effect on other novel stimuli. While extinction learning to the CS effectively generalizes to other stimuli, extinction learning to a GS or multiple GSs showed limited generalization to other novel GSs or the original CS. Since real-life exposure-based treatment rarely reproduces the CS, extinction learning involving only the GS(s) may better reflect clinical practice; poor generalization of GS(s) extinction learning may constitute another pathway of return of fear. This review also highlights various factors that influence generalization of extinction learning and call for future research to develop strategies for improving these processes, which can help inform exposure-based treatments.",

          "authors": "Maryanne Brassil; Cian O'Mahony; Ciara Greene",
          "abstract": "The fact that memories can be distorted by post-event misinformation has cast considerable doubt over the dependability of eyewitness evidence in legal contexts. However, despite its adverse practical implications, the misinformation effect is likely an unavoidable distortion stemming from the reconstructive nature of episodic memory. Certain cognitive abilities have been reported to offer protection against misinformation, suggesting that mechanisms aside from episodic memory may also be underpinning this type of memory distortion. The purpose of this review was to collate findings of associations between eyewitness misinformation susceptibility and individual differences in cognitive ability. Nine studies met the eligibility criteria for this review, including twenty-three distinct associations. Using a narrative synthesis, three categories of cognitive ability were identified as influencing susceptibility to misinformation: general intelligence and reasoning, perceptual abilities, and memory abilities. Across almost all categories, higher levels of ability were associated with reduced susceptibility to misinformation. While there is no indication that any one trait provides total immunity to the misinformation effect, there is a reasonable amount of evidence to suggest that several cognitive abilities create variance in individual levels of susceptibility. Future research should investigate not only if, but how these cognitive abilities protect against misinformation distortions; for example, by contributing to more detailed encoding of the memory, enhancing discrepancy detection in the face of post-event misinformation, or improving source-monitoring at recall.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, many eyewitness misinformation studies have moved from face-to-face to online data collection. However, the impact of different data collection contexts on misinformation susceptibility has not yet been investigated. In Study 1, we compared results from the same experiment conducted in two different data collection contexts – in person in a Laboratory and online via the recruitment platform Prolific – and found that Prolific participants were both less accurate overall and more susceptible to misinformation. Furthermore, we replicated a previous finding that increased visual perceptual load in a scene reduces eyewitness recall accuracy, but observed this effect in the Laboratory group only. In Study 2, we added a General Online group to test whether these differences extended to all online data collection, or if they were specific to Prolific participants. Misinformation susceptibility in the General Online group was similar to the Laboratory group, and significantly lower than that in the Prolific group. However, perceptual load effects were also absent in the General Online group. Ultimately, these findings indicate that different data collection contexts yield varying results in eyewitness misinformation studies. Researchers should exercise caution when selecting recruitment approaches, as attentional engagement and experimental control differ across contexts.",

          "abstract": "A substantial body of research has demonstrated that human and nonhuman animals have perceptually-based abilities to process magnitudes of nonsymbolic ratios (e.g., ratios composed by juxtaposing two line segments). Lewis et al. (2015) extended Dehaene and Cohen’s (2007) neuronal recycling hypothesis to include neurocognitive architectures for nonsymbolic ratio processing, proposing that these systems might support symbolic fractions acquisition. We tested two key propositions: (1) children should show neural sensitivity to nonsymbolic fractions before receiving formal fractions instruction, and (2) they should leverage this foundation by recruiting neural architectures for nonsymbolic fractions processing for symbolic fractions. We compared nonsymbolic and symbolic fractions processing among 2nd-graders (n=28, ages 7.5 - 8.8), who had not yet received formal symbolic fractions instruction, and 5th-graders (n=33, ages 10.3 - 11.9), who had. During fMRI scanning, children performed ratio comparison tasks, determining which of two nonsymbolic or symbolic fractions was larger. Both cohorts showed behavioral and neural evidence of processing nonsymbolic and symbolic fractions magnitudes, with performance modulated by numerical distance between stimuli. Consistent with predictions, 2nd-graders recruited a right parietal-frontal network for nonsymbolic fractions but not for symbolic fractions, whereas 5th-graders recruited a bilateral parietal-frontal network for both, overlapping with but extending beyond that of 2nd-graders. Neural representational similarity analysis revealed significant similarities between nonsymbolic and symbolic fraction processing in the intraparietal sulcus, a key region for numerical processing. These results present the first developmental neuroimaging evidence that neural substrates for nonsymbolic ratios exist before formal learning, which may be recycled to process symbolic fractions.",

          "abstract": "Performing magicians have long believed that some audience members attribute their magical effects to supernatural methods—to their use of “real magic”. In two samples of adults (n = 412 and 292), we explored personality traits and broader beliefs that might predict supernatural attributions for performance magic. Supernatural attributions were uncommon—many respondents wholly rejected the possibility that magicians’ magic was sometimes real—but nevertheless highly variable. In Study 1, a greater belief that magic tricks at least sometimes involve supernatural powers was associated with relatively higher extraversion, higher neuroticism, and lower openness to experience. In Study 2, random forests suggested that supernatural magic attributions were embedded in a family of paranormal and conspiratorial beliefs, particularly beliefs in psychic powers (reading and influencing thoughts) and precognition (perceiving the future). In both samples, gender, age, and education had small and inconsistent effects, but people who enjoyed performance magic were more likely to endorse supernatural attributions. Taken together, the findings suggest some truth to performing magicians’ suspicions and shed some light on who is more likely to explain magic tricks using supernatural causes.",

          "abstract": "Background: Telemanipulation enables the execution of remote operations using specialized tools, often under reduced sensory input, such as lack of haptic feedback. With practice, these tools can become extensions of the user's body, a phenomenon known as embodiment, thereby enhancing telepresence—the perception of being present at the action site. Sensory substitution (SS) can mitigate sensory limitations in such tasks.\nObjectives: To study the learning process of sensory substitution, taking into account the levels of embodiment and telepresence experienced during the task, we developed the Visual-Tactile Sensory Substitution Task (VTSST).\nMethods: Forty participants manipulated 200 virtual elastic slabs of varying elasticity using a haptic stylus, aiming to avoid breakage. Half the trials included force feedback (control condition), while the other half relied on visual cues (SS condition). Performance metrics included Elapsed Time (ET) to deform each slab, Maximal Applied Force (MAF), and Frequency of Errors (FoE), along with pupil dilation and blink rate as cognitive workload indicators. Participants also assessed their perceived SS, embodiment, and telepresence.\nResults and Conclusions: Results showed the SS condition led to lower ET, higher MAF, and more FoE than control trials, but ET and F changed over time in the SS condition, indicating learning. Blink rate, reflecting workload, was lower in SS trials, especially in the late phase of the task, while pupil dilation remained unchanged.\nStructural Equation Modeling revealed that perceived SS positively influenced embodiment, presence, and SS learning. In addition, embodiment enhanced presence, which reduced workload. This study highlights how SS supports telemanipulation by fostering embodiment, reducing task time, and improving multisensory integration for efficient remote operation",

This study addressed this gap by applying a computational model of value-based decision-making to tobacco and tobacco-unrelated choices following mood manipulation. Method: Using a pre-registered, within-subject design, 49 daily tobacco smokers (›10 daily cigarettes) watched two different videos which primed them to experience negative and positive mood (tobacco valuation and devaluation, respectively). Participants completed self-report measures of mood and craving to smoke before and after priming, followed by a two-alternative forced-choice task with (separate) blocks of tobacco-related and unrelated (animal) images. On each block, participants selected the image that they previously rated higher. A drift-diffusion model was fitted to the reaction time and error data to estimate evidence accumulation (EA) processes and response thresholds during the different blocks. Results: After watching videos intended to induce negative mood, happiness scores were lower (p ‹ .001, d = 1.16), while sadness and craving to smoke scores were higher (both ps ‹ .001, ds › .60), compared to after watching videos intended to induce positive mood. However, contrary to hypotheses, the experimental manipulation did not robustly affect EA rates (F = 1.15, p = .29, ηp2 = .02) or response thresholds (F = .07, p = .79, ηp2 = .00) for either tobacco or tobacco-unrelated decisions. Conclusions: Manipulation of mood in daily smokers did not lead to alterations in the internal processes that precede value-based decisions made about tobacco and tobacco-unrelated cues.",

Across\nthree studies (combined N = 2,094; 1,044 women, 1,050 men; M_age = 30.74, SD_age = 9.57,\nrange_age = 18-75), we implemented randomized online interventions of self-improvement or\nself-acceptance over a 3-month period, with another follow-up 6 months after baseline and a\nwaitlist control group added in Study 2. Across Studies 1 and 2, participants in both\nintervention groups reduced discrepancies between current and ideal personality and\nincreased in well-being. In both intervention groups, current personality increased, whereas\nideal personality remained stable.

          "abstract": "Approximately 40% of children worldwide learn to read in a language other than their home language or in two languages simultaneously. Evidence suggests that instruction in one language can enhance literacy outcomes in the other; however, the existence and longevity of these cross-language effects in poorer readers is unclear.  This study used a cross-over randomised controlled trial design. Initially, 129 children (mean age = 111.44 months, SD = 12.23) participated in a 15-week Welsh literacy intervention, while 128 children (mean age = 110.62 months, SD = 12.34) served as a wait-list control group and did not receive the intervention during this period. After the first intervention phase, the wait-list control group then participated in the same 15-week Welsh literacy intervention. Welsh and English reading efficiency were assessed at three time points: baseline (t1; prior to intervention), posttest (t2; immediately after the initial intervention phase for the first group), and follow-up (t3; approximately 3-months after t2). We found that training poorer bilingual readers using a language-rich literacy intervention in Welsh improved word decoding skills in both Welsh and English. These effects were sustained in the longer term for the trained language, Welsh, but were short-lived for the untrained language, English. Our findings suggest that targeted intervention in one language enhances cognitive processes underlying literacy in both languages, and that bilingual students struggling with reading skills can make short-term literacy gains from a monolingual intervention that transfer to a language where there has not been explicit training.",

          "abstract": "Survey measures are common in intervention research, but may suffer from biases such as socially desirable responding (SDR). While previous work demonstrates how unaddressed SDR can affect study results in observational contexts, the degree to which SDR may affect treatment effect estimates from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is less studied. To shed light on this issue, we examine empirical data from 10 RCTs from education, psychology, and health fields and compare estimated treatment effects from models that do and do not account for SDR. Results show that, with two exceptions, estimated treatment effects were mostly unaffected by SDR. We complement our empirical results with a simulation study to determine the degree of SDR necessary to bias treatment effects and find that severe SDR can bias treatment effects when not accounted for in the model. However, models accounting for SDR are more complex and produce estimates that are slightly downwardly biased despite being the data-generating model. We conclude with a discussion of recommendations for researchers using survey instruments as outcomes in RCTs.",

The aim of this narrative review and expert opinion is to summarize and evaluate definitions of treatment outcomes to antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers using RWD, and to suggest standards for the field. Given that no standards for the use of RWD in estimating treatment outcomes exist, there is a high variability in treatment outcome definitions. We make recommendations for different scenarios of available data and highlight the importance of using other sources of information to validate proxy phenotypes such as continued treatment, switching between medications or polypharmacy of psychotropic medications. Well-defined and validated treatment outcome measures leveraging RWD hold the potential to facilitate the development of precision psychiatry approaches and support regulatory decision-making in psychopharmacological agents.",

          "abstract": "Information about workers’ wages is publicly available through various sources (e.g., Glassdoor, SEC statements). How does this wage information affect the perceived quality of the products made by these workers? Across eight experiments with participants from the U.S., Britain, and France, we find that people expect and perceive products to be of higher quality when made by well-paid workers—both in comparison to products made by lower-paid workers and to those from companies where wage information is unknown. These perceptions, in turn, increase consumers’ likelihood of choosing these products and their willingness to pay a premium. This effect is driven by the belief that well-paid workers are more satisfied, which leads to higher-quality output. Our findings contribute to research on the determinants of value and quality expectations, as well as lay theories of product quality. They also offer practical implications for the communication, use, and regulation of worker pay information.",

          "abstract": "While artificial intelligence increasingly democratises art creation, people tend to devalue AI-generated content—a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. Recent work suggests that personalized AI models, trained on a user's past work, can increase credit attribution in text generation. We investigated whether this effect extends to visual art and examined the relationship between credit attribution and aesthetic appreciation. Across two studies (N=774), UK participants evaluated identical paintings that were described as being created either by hand, with a standard text-to-image generative AI system, or with an AI system personalized to the artist. While personalization significantly improved credit attribution and perceived authorship and commercial rights compared to standard AI use, it failed to enhance either aesthetic appreciation or willingness to categorise the outputs as \"true art\"—revealing a striking disconnect between judgments of artistic contribution and artistic value. Our findings suggest that although personalized AI may help bridge the \"achievement gap\" in credit attribution, it cannot overcome fundamental barriers to aesthetic appreciation of AI art. This challenges assumptions about the relationship between perceived effort and aesthetic value, with implications for understanding art categorization and human-AI cooperation in creative pursuits.",

          "abstract": "Adolescent internalising and externalising symptoms arise from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Family processes (e.g., parenting) are thought to play a key role and may, in part, reflect parental genotype. Understanding how parents’ genes affect risk for psychopathology in offspring—whether through direct genetic transmission or environmentally mediated genetic nurture—is crucial for identifying causal mechanisms and intervention targets. We examined both genetic transmission and genetic nurture pathways of polygenic risk for psychopathology on adolescent internalising and externalising symptoms.\nThe sample comprised 762 genotyped parent-offspring trios from the TRacking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). Parent and offspring polygenic scores (PGS) for genetic liability to general psychopathology (p-PGS) were computed and jointly modelled to estimate genetically transmitted and genetic nurture contributions to parental reports of offspring internalising and externalising symptoms at age 11. \nResults indicated that parental p-PGS influenced offspring symptoms primarily through environmental, rather than direct genetic, pathways. Specifically, we found evidence for genetic nurture, such that parental p-PGS was associated with adolescent internalising (but not externalising) symptoms, over and above the effect of adolescents’ own p-PGS. However, we found no association between parental p-PGS and adolescent-reported parenting behaviours, limiting our ability to assess whether genetic nurture effects were mediated by adolescent perspectives of parenting. \nThe study highlights the need to consider reporter effects in genetic nurture studies, encouraging the use of multiple reporters and inclusion of both parents, as here. More comprehensive proximal and distal environmental measures would also be helpful.",

Here, we demonstrate that SDT’s verbal definitions of competence and optimal challenge are underspecified in theoretically and practically relevant ways. Conceptual analyses of key texts identifies four verbal facets of competence definitions that need not co-occur and are inconsistently reflected in common self-report measures and operationalisations. Optimal challenge is insufficiently specified to be severely tested or implemented in practice, and entails a logical and empirical incoherence. Finally, SDT lacks a cognitive model of competence.

          "abstract": "Evidence accumulation modelling has been shown to uncover new insights into the cognitive mechanisms that underlie decision making from behavioural data. By jointly modelling reaction time and accuracy data, such decision models estimate latent variables that represent distinct computaitonal processes, such as stimulus encoding, response caution and the quality of information processing. In this study we use an evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA), to shed new light into the mechanisms that underlie learning based on linguistic and action-based training. The LBA model is applied to behavioural data from a previously published training study where participants learn to name, tie or name and tie a set of knots. Our results show that training is multifaceted and associated with an increase in stimulus-encoding time, a reduction in response caution, as well as an increase in the speed of information accumulation. Furthermore, the results showed that there was an added benefit to the rate of evidence accumulation when naming and tying experience were combined. This latter finding suggests that performance benefits from multi-modal training may be instantiated in computational processes that are associated with the quantity and quality of information accumulation during decision making. Overall, in applying this computational approach to accuracy and reaction time data, we uncover new insights into the mechanisms that govern experience-dependent plasticity.",

          "abstract": "Visual working memory (VWM) is critical for temporarily storing and manipulating visual information but is limited in capacity. Previous research suggests that perceptual organization, such as grouping identical objects, may alleviate VWM resource constraints, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated whether identical orientation stimuli reduce VWM resource consumption and whether this reduction occurs during encoding or maintenance phase. Using the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related potential (ERP) component that indexes the number of items stored in VWM,  we examined three memory conditions: all-same (i.e., four identical orientations), partial-same (i.e., two pairs of identical orientations), and all-different (i.e., four different orientations) conditions. Behavioral results showed improved VWM performance as the number of identical orientations increased, with the highest performance in the all-same condition. ERP results revealed no significant differences in early CDA amplitudes across conditions, suggesting that identical stimuli do not reduce VWM resource consumption during early maintenance phase. However, late CDA amplitudes were significantly reduced in the all-same condition compared to the partial-same and all-different conditions, indicating that the benefits of identical objects emerge during the late maintenance phase. Notably, partially identical stimuli did not reduce VWM load, highlighting the complexity of integrating partially redundant information. These findings highlight the distinct contributions of encoding and maintenance phases in optimizing VWM through perceptual grouping and provide evidence that the facilitative effect of identical objects relies on their complete repetition and late-stage cognitive processes.",

Based on a programme of research on differences and difficulties with attention, sensory arousal and anxiety at school for autistic pupils, a group of researchers and practitioners have developed a neuro-affirmative, evidenced-based training called ‘Triple-A’. Triple-A refers to an interconnected set of challenges with attention, sensory arousal and anxiety at school, and the concept emphasises the impact of the environment in terms of giving rise to challenges. The training was co-designed with autistic people, parents, teachers and autism researchers to change understanding of Triple-A and provide a package of practical supports. Evidence of the training’s use and impact since its launch in March 2022 was overwhelmingly positive: it has had significant reach with educators in the UK; it has also reached a world-wide audience, as well as many professionals relevant for supporting autistic people beyond educational settings. Evidence speaks very favourably to positive impact in terms of changing understanding and practice of supporting autistic pupils, but also neurodivergent pupils more broadly. Future work on Triple-A will focus on reaching those school staff who may not ordinarily opt-in for training of this kind.",

No differences in adherence were observed between any (sub)categories of negative effects; however, participants who reported treatment-related negative effects showed significantly lower symptom improvement than those reporting patient-related negative effects.

Overall, Nutri-Score was somewhat more effective in guiding consumers to identify healthier choices and products higher in nutrients that should be consumed in moderation compared to the warning labels, although effects varied substantially between product categories and nutrients. \nConclusions: Both Nutri-Score and warning labels potentially promote healthier food choices, with Nutri-Score producing somewhat larger and more consistent effects.

          "abstract": "Psychological case formulation, crucial for effective mental health treatment, involves generating causal hypotheses about patient problems. However, the narrative nature of these formulations often complicates their objective assessment. This paper presents a methodological proof of concept investigating the feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to convert psychological formulations into graph-based representations for preliminary quantitative analysis. By analysing 20 fictitious case studies, the study explored how well LLM-generated graphs matched clinician-developed graphs, focusing on the alignment of nodes and edges. Semantic similarity of node labels, assessed using cosine semantic similarity and binary classification metrics, achieved a high average score of 0.86 (SD = 0.12). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, based on binary classification of cosine semantic similarity scores ('similar' vs. 'different'), yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.917 (SE = 0.025, 95% CI [0.868, 0.968], p &lt; 0.001). Causal connections, compared using the Jaccard similarity index, showed a mean index of 0.5 (95% CI [0.42, 0.58]) for the LLM vs. clinician comparison, significantly higher than the LLM vs. random sets comparison (0.11, 95% CI [0.06, 0.17], p &lt; 0.001), and surpassing the pre-registered benchmark index of 0.36 in 80% of the cases. These findings suggest preliminary alignment between LLM-generated and clinician-developed graphs, offering proof of concept for a methodological framework combining natural language processing, graph theory, and semantic analysis in case formulation research. Future research should incorporate real patient data, expand to diverse healthcare domains, and evaluate this method’s potential for advancing personalised and precision mental health care.",

          "abstract": "Serial dependence is a phenomenon in which current perception is attracted to the immediately preceding perception and is thought to reflect a mechanism for stabilizing perception by using autocorrelation in the world. It has been demonstrated across a variety of stimuli and has also been observed in the numerosity perception. A previous study suggested that cross-modal serial dependence in numerosity perception from audition to vision did not occur. However, differences in the stimulus presentation format might have prevented serial dependence from emerging. Therefore, we used a standardized temporal presentation format consisting of sequences of white noise and visual flashes. As a result, we observed bidirectional cross-modal serial dependence between audition and vision. The effects in each direction were not consistent within individuals. Furthermore, our investigation revealed no evidence for spatial selectivity in the observed cross-modal effects, despite previous studies on serial dependence within the visual modality confirming such spatial selectivity. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying serial dependence. It is suggested that both higher-level processing, such as abstract numerical representation, and lower-level processing, such as auditory and visual cortex involvement, are engaged in cross-modal serial dependence in numerosity perception. Moreover, our results align with predictive coding models, in which serial dependence arises when a prior generated at higher-level processing stages is fed back to lower-level sensory processing.",

          "abstract": "Motivation is critical to successful academic functioning. A growing body of evidence details how motivation evolves throughout the lifetime, yet middle adulthood is rarely examined. Here we examined how trait apathy and fatigue, both of which manifest in diminished motivation, relate to academic functioning among university students aged 30 – 50. 332 students completed trait apathy and fatigue scales, measures of academic functioning (autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, study engagement, study effort, academic stress, dropout intentions, academic performance, and study satisfaction), and measures of family, household, work-related factors. Apathy and fatigue were related to almost all academic measures, yet apathy was more closely linked to academic functioning; in particular autonomous motivation, study engagement, and study satisfaction. Our findings suggest that apathy is an important and likely overlooked factor in understanding academic functioning, at least among university students aged 30 – 50.",

          "authors": "Peter D. Kvam; Abhay Alaukik",
          "abstract": "Operational definitions have long been a core approach to measuring and relating observed data to theoretical constructs in psychological science. However, many contemporary modeling approaches violate basic assumptions of operational definitions and operationalism more generally -- foregoing assumptions about objectivity, repeatability, independence, and fixed elicitation procedures. Counterintuitively, these departures imbue model-based definitions of constructs with superior measurement properties, such as improved reliability and validity, when compared to their operational counterparts. Instead of relying on operational definitions of constructs, we instead suggest that psychology can adapt relational definitions, representing constructs as latent variables in a multilevel generative model of behavior, self-report, or neuroimaging data. These model-based metrics can better reflect measurement error at multiple levels, account for the interactions between measurement devices (tasks, scales) and measurement objects (participants, processes), provide a holistic account of latent constructs and how they manifest across different measurements, facilitate convergence or discrimination tests among different tasks seeking to measure the same construct, and improve scientific communication by clarifying core psychological concepts. Relational definitions of important constructs should naturally emerge as we apply models more regularly, and these definitions and models will improve as we discover mathematical approaches that are suited to describing psychological processes.",

          "abstract": "Response styles and response biases can introduce systematic variance in measurement models. Their aggregated effect can be captured by introducing into the model an additional general 'method' factor, a random intercept that varies across items. To support the validity of interpreting this additional factor as method variance rather than a substantive general factor, we formulate testable queries, including an efficiency hypothesis that outlines conditions where method effects are more likely. The strongest validity evidence involves integrating into the survey and model a variable that, while theoretically uncorrelated with the assessed attributes, elicits similar response mechanisms. If this marker variable remains uncorrelated with this additional factor, it supports its interpretation as substantive, rather than method. When validity evidence supports the interpretation of the additional factor as method variance, we describe methods to quantify the extent of method bias on reliability and validity coefficients. In cases where method effects are substantial, our proposed approach ensures valid inferences and scores free from method bias. Fully worked out examples and code illustrate the implementation of these methods. In a neutral scenario according to our efficiency hypothesis, no indication of method effects is observed. However, when method effects could be expected, we found non-negligible method variance (up to 17%), which we subsequently controlled for.  Failure to account for method variance when present leads to poorly fitting models and over- or underestimation of validity and reliability coefficients.",

          "abstract": "Undergraduate college graduation is a pivotal developmental milestone that marks a transition for graduates. Unfortunately, the graduation rate of Latinx students is not keeping up with their rapid growth in postsecondary institutions (Weissman, 2023). For this reason, understanding the success of Latinx graduates is key to fostering Latinx academic success and degree attainment in this developmental transition. Cultural strengths, including personal growth and knowledge and an emphasis on educational values, play an important role in the educational process for Latinx students (Hernandez et al., 2016). However, less is known about the meaning of graduation personal statements as a way for students to reflect on their experiences and indicate important cultural capital utilized for their degree attainment. Further research is needed using a strength-based approach to understanding cultural capital utilized by Latinx graduates within a qualitative approach. To address this gap, we will code quotes from Latinx graduates and identify areas of cultural capital that they draw upon and acknowledge as important to their positive academic outcomes using structured tabular thematic analysis (Robinson, 2022). Quotes are short personal statements that graduates were able to submit for print in the graduation program. Utilizing the graduation program from the Spring 2024 Hispanic Convocation ceremony, we will analyze 628 quotes using structured tabular thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2021). Focusing on positive cultural aspects that Latinx students use to bolster their academic journey has implications regarding the best support mechanisms institutions can provide for this population and what these students personally value in education.",

          "abstract": "When faced with financial shocks families often combine multiple resources, including savings, networks, public transfers and services, to cover their needs and respond to changing conditions. This paper explores the strategies families with children in Barcelona deploy to respond to financial shocks by analysing interviews with 29 families experiencing difficulties to make ends meet. The paper makes three main contributions to the literature on responses to shocks. First, it provides novel evidence on how and to what extent families strategies are shaped by their past trajectories and resources. Second, it introduces a novel technique, event interviews, specifically designed to study family responses to events and identify the resources (both public and private) they rely on. Third, by contrasting the experiences of families with diverse resources, the paper seeks to illuminate some of the mechanisms through which structural constraints shape coping strategies and thus, agency. Understanding family strategies is particularly relevant in the current context framed by the aftermath of the COVID pandemic and the recent increases in energy, food and housing prices which affected the most disadvantaged the most.",

          "abstract": "This study examines the extent of antisemitic bias in German higher education through a survey experiment conducted among students (N=1,416) at an average-sized German university in the fall of 2024/2025. Using a between-subjects design, participants were randomly assigned to evaluate English academic writing courses taught by fictitious instructors whose profiles varied by gender and ethnic/religious background—categorized as German, Israeli, and Jewish. Instructors were rated on sympathy and competence using a 7-point scale. While no significant differences emerged for competence ratings, results reveal notable bias in sympathy ratings: instructors identified as Jewish, particularly male Jewish instructors, received significantly lower ratings compared to their German counterparts. Instructors from Israel without a visible Jewish symbol were not rated significantly differently. There was also a gender bias, as female instructors with a German profile were rated less favorably than male instructors. Interestingly, the anti-Jewish bias was predominantly driven by female student raters, whereas male students primarily exhibited gender bias without significant antisemitic tendencies. These findings suggest that antisemitic motives, rather than anti-Israel sentiment, underlie the negative evaluations observed in this academic setting, and highlight the complex interplay between ethnic/religious prejudice and gender bias.",

We develop a game-theoretic model where an interest group can lobby a politician while learning about their ideological alignment. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff: interest groups must balance gathering information against exerting immediate influence, while politicians strategically manage their reputations to shape future interactions. These strategic forces generate systematic dynamics: policies and transfers shift in tandem, with early-career politicians showing greater policy variance and extracting larger rents through reputation management than veterans. Uncertainty about alignment increases policy volatility as groups experiment with offers, while institutional features like committee power and revolving-door incentives systematically alter both learning incentives and influence strategies. Our results shed new light on how interest group influence evolves across political careers and varies with institutional context.",

          "authors": "Yuehong Cassandra Tai",
          "abstract": "Political trust plays a critical role in understanding key political questions, including regime support, democratic legitimacy, policy preferences, and political behavior. However, the lack of comparable, cross-national data has limited scholars' ability to analyze the relationship of political trust with quantities of interest and to generalize findings across different countries and time periods. To address this gap, this paper introduces the Trust in Government (TGOV) Dataset, a time-series cross-sectional resource covering 116 countries from 1973 to 2020. Built using a Bayesian latent variable model, TGOV harmonizes 1,555 country-year observations from 189 national and cross-national surveys, providing mean estimates of trust in government alongside full posterior distributions to account for measurement uncertainty. The TGOV dataset demonstrates robustness in a series of internal and external validations, as well as in the construct validation test, confirming that the TGOV scores are a valid measure of public trust in national government. The TGOV dataset enables scholars to analyze trust’s dynamic relationships with institutional performance, policy outcomes, and crisis resilience across political systems. More broadly, it supports interdisciplinary research on governance, inequality, state-society relations, public health compliance, climate policy acceptance, and digital governance innovations.",

The policy improved healthcare availability, especially for Black Americans, as it created and improved hospitals through federal funding. However, many hospitals continued to deny equal access to Black Americans, and discrimination persisted through a lack of integration. Additionally, reduced effects of segregation more commonly stemmed from the changing attitudes of doctors toward segregation rather than the policy itself. Ultimately, by extending the decision from Plessy v.

          "authors": "Maged Ali",
          "abstract": "Retailers  are the heart and soul of our communities. They provide us with the things we need to live our best lives and create jobs for many. They are part of our daily lives and a vital part of our local economies, especially in areas where large companies may not have as much of a presence. Many small retailers already struggle to stay open due to tight profit margins. They reinvest most of their earnings to adapt to changing customer needs and new regulations. Rising costs and over-regulation make it even harder for them to survive.\nA new law will make survival even harder. The UK has introduced a law banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born after 2009, making it the strictest ban of its kind. While intended as a public health measure, it will cut off customers   and will have severe consequences on retailers. Tobacco products account for 20% of retailers' sales. Losing this income will push many stores to the brink. It will leave retailers with no viable way to adapt and transition to alternatives. The consequences are severe: declining foot traffic, reduced revenues, and widespread store closures. Over the next three decades, the UK could lose 7,700 businesses and 70,100 jobs. The government will also lose £23.8 billion in tax revenue (DHSC, 2024) and face rising enforcement costs of £828 million over the next thirty years.  This equates to £819 million per year, or 72% of the UK's annual s  pending on unemployment benefits (ONS, 2025a).\nBeyond the economic harm, the GSB will make it harder for the government to control tobacco sales. More people will turn to the illegal market, which could grow from 14.5% in 2023 to 43.2% by 2040  .  This means unregulated products and easier access for minors. Profits will flow to criminal groups, enabling them to finance other illegal activities. As a result, the government will need additional resources to combat organised crime and enforce the law.\nThe result is a lose-lose-lose scenario  retailers will close, government revenues will shrink, and criminals will take control of the market. Policymakers must reconsider this approach before irreparable damage is done to the UK’s retail SMEs, leaving countless communities without their lifelines.",

Significant changes in the composition of migrants and border crossings since then raise questions about their continued validity. In this research note, I provide an updated analysis using two independent data sources: the 2018 Guatemalan Census and annual estimates of undocumented Guatemalan arrivals to the United States from The Center for Migration Studies (CMS). Using descriptive and regression analyses, findings show a close alignment between apprehensions, household migrations reported in the Guatemalan census, and Guatemalan arrival estimates. Together, these results indicate that apprehensions remain a reliable indicator of migration flow despite recent changes in migration dynamics along the southern U.S. border.",

          "abstract": "Criminological research frequently examines ordinal outcome data, yet the common practice of treating these data as continuous using linear models can obscure patterns, introduce imprecision, and bias estimates. We advocate for the appropriate analysis of ordinal outcomes with ordered regression models. We demonstrate how linear models misrepresent ordinal distributions using simulated data before reanalyzing select results from Pickett, Graham, and Cullen's (2022) study on racial differences in fear of police. Our analysis showcases how ordered regression models, coupled with effective visualization techniques, provide more accurate estimates than linear models—revealing that linear approaches substantially underestimate racial disparities. For instance, cumulative probit models correctly estimate that nearly one-third of Black participants are “very afraid” of police killing them, while linear models underestimate this by nearly two-thirds. By respecting the ordinal nature of data, criminologists can move beyond broad directional statements and quantify effect magnitudes with greater precision, fostering a more robust, evidence-driven discipline capable of addressing its “precision crisis.”",

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this necessity by exposing VUCA concepts to substantial shock. However, whether the COVID-19 pandemic marks a phase of abnormal VUCA characteristics or whether organizations will face different VUCA challenges in the post-COVID-19 era is unclear. We conducted a literature review to synthesize and compare VUCA research before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a trend matrix, we illustrate and specify the evolution of research themes that address VUCA characteristics. We present a VUCA evolution model that reveals a shift toward operational adaptability and continuous learning as key drivers in the post-COVID-19 era, as emphasized by the increased priority of people-centered approaches. The results indicate an organizational transformation toward self-organization that enables resilience through a holistic perspective of continuous learning and co-creation. Our study contributes to understanding organizations’ resilience and bridges the gap between the theoretical and practical VUCA research dimensions. VUCA concepts were not coined with global pandemics in mind but were created to support organizations dealing with crises. We explored how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected VUCA’s conceptual foundations and research focus. Our results orient scholarship toward new foci of VUCA research and assist practitioners in identifying critical areas of focus regarding VUCA challenges in the post-COVID-19 era.",

          "abstract": "Multispecies justice (MSJ) seeks to extend justice beyond humans to include non-human entities, offering an ethical framework for interspecies relationships. While this concept may appear to improve environmental stewardship, we argue that its openness risks undermining well-established principles of ecological conservation and justice. We argue that MSJ introduces conceptual ambiguity and lacks the potential for practical operationalisation, which risks moralising natural processes, overlooking the complexities of human-nature interactions, weakening conservation efforts and opening the door for political misuse. Furthermore, existing ethical and ecological conservation frameworks already provide practical approaches for including non-humans in justice, conservation and policy considerations. Instead of adopting an unclear and potentially counterproductive notion of justice, we therefore advocate for strengthening established conservation and justice principles to address the ongoing environmental crises more effectively.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces 'data mirroring,' a methodological framework for conducting data-donation-based interviews using Data Download Packages (DDPs) from digital platforms. Since the General Data Protection Regulation took effect, DDPs have found application in research. While the literature on the value of DDPs primarily points towards scaling and validating aggregate-level data, their potential to illuminate complex user-media relationships within datafied environments at the micro-level appears underexplored. Drawing from recent conceptualizations of the 'data mirror,' which captures the feedback loops between users and digital media, this article provides theoretical grounding and practical guidelines for 'mirroring' DDPs to users. Based on exercises with 64 participants, we demonstrate through an illustrative case study how DDPs can serve as prompts, contexts, and reflections, revealing reflexive strategies users employ to curate information flows of 'news' on algorithmic platforms like Instagram. Additionally, we introduce an open-source web application to operationalize DDPs as data mirrors for non-technical researchers.",

The contribution of this research is that it’s an empirical analysis of how social movement affects the legislative process, especially in the agenda-setting stage and how social discourse takes part in this process, given the lack of research concerning determinants of the state legislation of the higher minimum wage, especially focusing on the influence of the social movement on the legislation. I analyze the impact of the social movement, measured by the media exposure frequency, on public opinion, the proposal of bills and the legislation with the national-level time serial and the state-level data. I investigate the impact of the social discourse on public opinion and the legislative process to illuminate the underlying mechanism where the social movement affects the political outcome.

Given that previous research dealing with domestic political factors tends to focus on political institutions and that the comparative research on the cases of the U.S. and the U.K. are limited, this research is relevant. I utilize the EPI scores, protest data, public opinion data and party manifestos.

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "abstract": "Contributions by low resource and under-served populations in Hawai‘i to a strong regional and national STEM endeavor are limited by disenfranchisement from STEM education due to social, economic and cultural factors. This paper explores how national trends in higher education finance intersect with regional issues such as Hawai‘i’s exceptionally high cost of living and unique cultural setting. These financial challenges affect all Hawai'i residents, but disproportionately impact indigenous Hawaiian students and diasporic Pacific Island migrants, who are most likely to face economic precarity. The high cost of STEM degrees exacerbates these challenges, driven by expensive textbooks, laboratory fees, internship and professional development requirements, and extended time to graduation. Contextualized by post-COVID economic realities and the dramatic 2024 changes to the federal financial aid system, this paper highlights the ongoing need for regionally tailored financial models. We review the rapidly changing landscape for federal and state-level financial aid to inform faculty and administrators who are involved in designing and implementing programs that are focused on broadening STEM participation. We propose strategies that consider Hawai‘i’s economic and cultural distinctiveness, aiming to reduce financial barriers and increase participation for Hawai‘i students where underlying economic precarity is a barrier to STEM participation.",

          "abstract": "A persistent puzzle across the cognitive and social sciences is how people manage to learn social conventions from the sparse and noisy behavioral data of diverse actors, without explicit instruction. Here, we show that the dominant theories of social learning perform poorly at capturing how individuals learn conventions in canonical coordination experiments that task them with matching their behaviors while interacting in social networks. Across experiments, participants' learning behavior systematically deviates from both imitation and statistical optimization. Instead, we find that participants follow a categorical, two-stage learning process: they behave probabilistically until they acquire enough information about each other to trigger a mental threshold and then their behaviors stabilize. We precisely identify this threshold using the Tolerance Principle, a parameter-free equation first developed to model how children learn rules in language. Our simulations show that threshold-based agents often produce social learning that is more accurate than imitating and optimizing agents. We further show that the Tolerance Principle offers an improved model of how a critical mass of dissenting actors can overturn established conventions. The superior performance of our model holds when comparing against a variety of optimization approaches, including Bayesian inference. These findings offer compelling evidence that a simple, mathematical threshold underlies individual and social learning, from grammatical rules to behavioral conventions.",

          "abstract": "Conventional research on educational effects typically either employs a “years of schooling” measure of education, or dichotomizes attainment as a point-in-time treatment. Yet, such a conceptualization of education is misaligned with the sequential process by which individuals make educational transitions. In this paper, I propose a causal mediation framework for the study of educational effects on outcomes such as earnings. The framework considers the effect of a given educational transition as operating indirectly, via progression through subsequent transitions, as well as directly, net of these transitions. I demonstrate that the average treatment effect (ATE) of education can be additively decomposed into mutually exclusive components that capture these direct and indirect effects. The decomposition has several special properties which distinguish it from conventional mediation decompositions of the ATE, properties which facilitate less restrictive identification assumptions as well as identification of all causal paths in the decomposition. An analysis of the returns to high school completion in the NLSY97 cohort suggests that the payoff to a high school degree stems overwhelmingly from its direct labor market returns. Mediation via college attendance, completion and graduate school attendance is small because of individuals’ low counterfactual progression rates through these subsequent transitions.",

          "abstract": "Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) is a multilevel regression modeling approach, rooted in intersectionality theory, for examining social inequalities across intersections of multiple social identities (e.g., gender, ethnicity, social class). Proponents argue that MAIHDA’s predicted intersectional means are statistically superior to simple means from descriptive statistics or conventional regression models, but this claim remains largely untested. We derive and analyze analytical expressions to compare the variance and correlation of predicted intersection means from two MAIHDA-based predictors and simple mean calculations with the distribution of true but unknown population means. Additionally, we assess the bias, variance, and mean squared error when predicting the mean of a given intersection. Our findings show that MAIHDA-based means outperform simple means, particularly when using the predictor that decomposes intersectional means into additive and non-additive components of social identities. However, the relative advantage of each MAIHDA predictor depends on the nature of intersectional inequalities and intersection sizes. MAIHDA’s benefits are most pronounced when inequalities are subtle or when data on certain intersections, such as those for marginalized groups, are sparse—conditions common in practice, highlighting the practical significance of our findings.",

          "authors": "Kristian Gade Kjelmann; Rolf Lyneborg Lund",
          "abstract": "Despite a growing body of research on the role of co-ethnic social networks in the economic integration of immigrants, findings remain inconclusive. Many studies overlook the possibility of heterogeneous effects, specifically that certain neighbourhood compositions may be necessary conditions for immigrants to benefit from co-ethnic social capital. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether the impact of co-ethnic social networks on job attainment varies across neighbourhood contexts. Drawing on register data covering all immigrants from MENAPT countries who arrived in Denmark between 2008 and 2016, we measure co-ethnic networks as the presence of co-nationals and family in immigrants’ initial neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood typologies are derived using k-means clustering on individual-level data from the entire Danish population. To estimate the interaction effects of co-ethnic networks and neighbourhood types, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian zero-one inflated beta regression model.\n\nContrary to expectations, we find no association between the presence of co-ethnic networks and job attainment, regardless of neighbourhood type, network composition (co-national or family), or gender. This also holds true in immigrant-dense neighbourhoods, which are more likely to function as ethnic enclaves. Our findings lend support to prior research emphasizing the importance of structural neighbourhood factors—such as local unemployment rates, average income levels, and the size of the immigrant population—over specific neighbourhood compositions. We conclude by urging researchers to further examine whether heterogeneous effects emerge for other labour market outcomes, such as occupational status, and suggest that settlement policies designed to improve employment outcomes through neighbourhood placement may need to be reconsidered.",

Drawing on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), specifically Fairclough's three-dimensional model, the study analyzes textual and visual content from all 12 volumes of the nationally distributed Chinese language textbooks used in primary education. The analysis reveals that masculinity is predominantly associated with leadership, military strength, intelligence, and social responsibility, while femininity is characterized by obedience, emotional labor, beauty, and maternal devotion. These gendered traits reinforce patriarchal ideology, drawing from both Confucian traditions and the contemporary political agenda of the ruling class. Male characters, especially political and military figures, are portrayed as role models, while female characters are largely confined to domestic and supportive roles. While global education frameworks emphasize gender equity and inclusion, these textbooks continue to normalize and perpetuate inequality from an early age. By linking gender representations in schooling to broader ideological structures, this study contributes to the growing body of critical research on curriculum and discourse and calls for reforms that promote more equitable educational practices in China.",

We estimate the effect of climate exposure on climate lobbying instances (extensive margin), amount (intensive margin), and targets (political entities). We find that more exposed companies, especially in terms of opportunities and regulation, are more likely to lobby. The type of climate exposure, both absolute and relative to industry peers, dictates whether firms lobby, how much they spend on lobbying, and their choice of government target.

I argue that Ultra groups became politicized as they sought autonomy in public space, but faced resistance from Egyptian security forces. To make this argument, I trace the history of Ultra groups. I show how Ultras made relatively few political statements in the first years after their 2007 inception. However, these groups become increasingly politicized in reaction to police harassment. This harassment was motivated by the fact that Ultras subverted state control over public spaces. The events of the 2011 Arab Spring further politicized the Ultras and transformed them into revolutionary actors by giving them the opportunity to delegitimize the authoritarian state’s entire presence in public space. However, the greater public visibility of Ultras came at a cost, partially fracturing Ultra groups and giving state forces a desire for retaliation that was realized in the Port Said massacre. Despite these challenges, Ultra groups have continued to seek autonomy in public spaces, protesting authoritarian tendencies in the post- Mubarak era. I conclude with an afterward, explaining how Ultras not only defy authoritarianism in Egypt, but also dominant narratives about Egyptian society.

This study examines whether disparities in exposure to natural environments, such as green spaces, also exist based on socioeconomic status. Using remote sensing, we analyzed Tokyo, Japan, and calculated the mean NDVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for each 250m grid. We then investigated its relationship with average household income. The results revealed that grids with higher average household income tend to have higher NDVI. Additionally, we explored whether NDVI could be predicted from socioeconomic and demographic variables. The findings indicate that NDVI can be partially predicted based on these variables. This suggests that exposure to natural environments is influenced by social science factors. Although natural environments appear to be open-access resources, our study demonstrates that disparities arise due to socioeconomic and demographic factors.",

Afin d’apporter une contribution à ces réflexions, ainsi qu’à l’histoire et à la sociologie des sciences sociales, cet article s’appuie sur des outils issus du traitement automatique des langues – des grands modèles de langage (LLMs) – pour repérer les invocations du genre dans un vaste corpus.

Le recours à une approche de genre a indéniablement progressé au cours des vingt-cinq dernières années, même si le point de départ était souvent bas, et qu’il reste finalement limité. Des différences marquées existent entre disciplines, tout comme diffèrent les formes d’institutionnalisation de cette approche. Cette perspective est, en outre, encore très majoritairement mobilisée par des femmes.

          "abstract": "Congressional hearing witnesses play a major role in the legislative process, providing\ninformation to committees to assist members and staff in crafting legislation. Recently, there has\nbeen increasing focus on the impact of congressional witnesses on legislative outcomes,\nexecutive implementation of federal statutes, and corresponding judicial decisions. This has\nraised questions as to the extent to which the underrepresentation of women and other\nmarginalized groups as congressional witnesses can be measured and how their lack of\nrepresentation translates to inequitable outcomes across all branches of government. This work\nexplores the widespread use of congressional witness testimony in recent U.S. Supreme Court\nopinions, reiterating that witnesses play a significant role in establishing the legislative history,\nwhich, in turn, is later relied upon in judicial decision making. In this Article, we quantify the\nreferences to congressional witnesses in U.S. Supreme Court opinions using a publicly available\ndataset of opinions dating from 1789 through 2020. Although not surprising given our past work,\nwe find that while the Court regularly references Congressional testimony in its opinions, women\nas congressional witnesses are demonstrably underrepresented in these opinions. We argue that\nthe ongoing underrepresentation of women as congressional witnesses will be more\nconsequential to judicial outcomes following the Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v.\nRaimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), overturning Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

          "abstract": "Understanding the factors that influence human behavior is crucial for effective wildlife conservation strategies. This study examines the impact of conservation stewards and cameras on beachgoers’ adherence to conservation guidelines designed to protect beach-nesting birds. Specifically, it investigates whether these interventions encourage visitors to maintain a 25-ft distance from nesting areas and walk around birds feeding along the waterline. Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted systematic behavioral observations (n = 267) and semi-structured interviews (n = 20) to assess the effectiveness of these interventions. Logistic regression analyses revealed that steward interaction significantly increased adherence to the 25 ft conservation guideline, whereas mere steward presence had no effect. Camera presence, contrary to expectations, negatively influenced guideline adherence, likely due to curiosity. Neither intervention significantly affected behaviors requiring situational awareness, such as walking around feeding birds or general attentiveness. Interview findings indicated that visitors' motivations and prior conservation awareness played a crucial role in shaping their behaviors. Visitors’ interactions with signs and the presence of other people were also predictive of greater adherence. These results suggest that while active engagement from stewards can enhance engagement in conservation behaviors, presence of cameras alone may be ineffective or even counterproductive. Conservation strategies that prioritize direct educational engagement are likely to cultivate a deeper psychological commitment and internalized pro-conservation norms, which drive lasting behavioral change.",

          "abstract": "Religious experiences are ubiquitous and many would argue they can alter a person’s life. Regrettably, there are few studies of transformative religious experiences (TREs) outside of the US or that compare different religious groups. There is, however, more comparative research about conversions and about ‘paranormal’ experiences, e.g., telepathy, clairvoyance, and contact with spirits of dead people. However, the correlates of TREs and paranormal experiences are distinct, suggesting we cannot extrapolate between them. This article examines TREs across 22 nationally-representative samples from religiously diverse countries from all six inhabited continents. It also serves as the foundation for future longitudinal studies assessing the potential causal impact of TREs. We discuss the complexities of measuring TRE across religious traditions, how demographic factors associated with TRE vary between countries, and consider implications for secularization theory. If we compare the prevalence of TREs between countries, wealthier European countries report these least frequently and poorer countries most frequently. However, the individual-level patterns are not consistent with secularization. For example, younger people do not consistently have fewer TREs than older people. Rather, TREs are higher in age groups that were students during political movements in which religion played an important role, such as the fall of the Iron Curtain and democracy movements in Hong Kong.",

          "abstract": "Religious Centrality has been widely studied in Europe and North America and is generally associated with better psychological and social outcomes. Religious centrality is often assessed as a measure of intrinsic religiosity (IR)—religion as one’s guiding approach to life – and has been widely validated in societies around the world. However, most studies of religious centrality/IR are cross-sectional and use samples from ‘Western’ societies or samples from single non-European societies. Moreover, most samples are not nationally representative. Systematic comparisons are difficult because the samples, measures, and procedures vary between studies. This article examines religious centrality across 22 nationally representative samples from religiously diverse countries from the 1st wave of the Global Flourishing Study (GFS) using a single-item IR measure and identical demographic measures and methods in each country. The study will serve as the foundation for longitudinal studies designed to assess the causal impact of religious centrality on human flourishing. In the current study, we find societies range widely, with religious centrality lowest in Europe and East Asia, moderate in the Americas and Israel, and highest in Africa and the rest of Asia. We discuss the complexities of assessing religious centrality across religious traditions, how the demographic factors associated with religious centrality vary between countries, and provide implications for secularization theory as well as theories of human flourishing.",

          "authors": "Justin Nix; Jessica Huff; Scott Wolfe; David Pyrooz; Scott Mourtgos",
          "abstract": "Many U.S. cities witnessed both de-policing and increased crime in 2020, yet it remains unclear whether the former contributed to the latter. Indeed, much of what is known about the effects of proactive policing on crime comes from studies that evaluate highly focused interventions atypical of day-to-day policing, use cities as the unit of analysis, or cannot rule out endogeneity. This study addresses each of these issues, thereby advancing the evidence base concerning the effects of policing on crime. Leveraging two exogenous shocks presented by the onset of COVID-19 and social unrest following the murder of George Floyd, we evaluated the effects of sudden and sustained reductions in high-discretion policing on crime at the neighborhood level in Denver. Multilevel models accounting for trends in prior police activity, neighborhood structure, seasonality, and population mobility revealed mixed results. On one hand, large-scale reductions in stops and drug-related arrests were associated with significant increases in violent and property crimes, respectively. On the other hand, fewer disorder arrests did not affect crime. These results were not universal across neighborhoods. We discuss the implications of these findings in light of debates concerning the appropriate role of policing in the 21st century.",

          "authors": "INVEST Flagship; Lydia Laninga-Wijnen; Claire F. Garandeau; Christina Salmivalli",
          "abstract": "Previous work has shown that being defended can protect victims of bullying against developing psychological problems. Victimized students can be defended in victim-oriented ways, such as when classmates comfort them, and in bully-oriented ways, such as when classmates try to stop the bully. However, not all victimized youth are defended by peers. The current study aimed to identify which individual characteristics at the start of the school year (T1) predict whether victims of bullying will be defended by peers in victim- and bully-oriented ways halfway through the school year (T2). From the n = 6,357 Finnish 4th to 9th grade students who participated in the first two waves (T1 in September/October, and T2 in January) of the (MASKED) project, n = 1,303 reported being victimized at T2 (38.8% boys, Mage = 12.80, SD = 1.66). Among these victims, 920 (70.6%) reported that they had been defended: 57.2% in victim-oriented ways, 53.2% in bully-oriented ways, and 39.8% in both ways. Logistic regression analyses indicated that socially and emotionally vulnerable students were less likely to be defended. Specifically, students who were unpopular or who did not know how to stand up for themselves (low self-defense efficacy) were less likely to be defended in bully-oriented ways than students who were popular or who had high self-defense efficacy. Moreover, students with fewer friends and more psychological problems were less likely to be defended in victim-oriented ways than students with more friends and fewer psychological problems. Boys and older students were also less likely to be defended. Findings suggest that anti-bullying interventions should pay particular attention to promoting the defending of socially and emotionally vulnerable students.",

          "authors": "George Y. Nie",
          "abstract": "Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. To be comparable across assets and firms, our asset risk is a 5-year payment’s risk that approaches zero as the distance approaches zero. We show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option’s price minus its present value reflects the overcharge or transaction cost. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.",

This paper examines how the plague, especially within the context of the Church’s faltering authority, reshaped social dynamics. Both the peasant and wealthy class lost faith within the Church as the plague continued raging. Particularly for the peasant class, their resistance manifested as rebellions, which were only met with restrictive laws imposed by the king. However, although the wealthy benefited from these laws in the short-term as they quelled peasant revolts, the long-term effects of the revolts and plague created greater benefits for the peasant class. The peasant class ultimately benefited through increased social mobility and employment, revealing how the Black Death played an important role in transforming class structures.",

          "authors": "Timm Betz; Amy Pond; Weiwen Yin",
          "abstract": "Investment agreements extend valuable privileges to firms invested abroad. They often allow firms to sue host governments and gain compensation when their rights are violated. But, these privileges only apply to firms whose assets are owned in a country that has signed an agreement with their host market; firms lack protections under investment agreements for many of their target markets. We argue that, by strategically locating subsidiaries in ‘transit’ countries, firms systematically expand their access to investment agreements. This firm-specific access to investment agreements through transit countries also has implications for in- vestment flows: Transit countries receive more inflows and outflows of investment. Moreover, the impact of agreements declines over time and treaty partners, as seemingly newly protected firms have previously gained coverage through subsidiaries. Drawing on subsidiary location choices of the world’s largest firms, as well as data on firm ownership structure and aggregate investment flows, we present systematic evidence consistent with this argument. The paper highlights the importance of the global ownership structure of firms in an environment of heterogeneous international rules and discusses new distributional consequences of the investment regime.",

          "abstract": "This article critically examines how masculinity and femininity are constructed in Chinese primary school textbooks and explores the power relations embedded in these gender representations. Drawing on Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), specifically Fairclough's three-dimensional model, the study analyzes textual and visual content from all 12 volumes of the nationally distributed Chinese language textbooks used in primary education. The analysis reveals that masculinity is predominantly associated with leadership, military strength, intelligence, and social responsibility, while femininity is characterized by obedience, emotional labor, beauty, and maternal devotion. These gendered traits reinforce patriarchal ideology, drawing from both Confucian traditions and the contemporary political agenda of the ruling class. Male characters, especially political and military figures, are portrayed as role models, while female characters are largely confined to domestic and supportive roles. While global education frameworks emphasize gender equity and inclusion, these textbooks continue to normalize and perpetuate inequality from an early age. By linking gender representations in schooling to broader ideological structures, this study contributes to the growing body of critical research on curriculum and discourse and calls for reforms that promote more equitable educational practices in China.",

          "authors": "Yaoyao Song",
          "abstract": "This article presents a systematic literature review of gender representation in Chinese language textbooks used in primary education in Mainland China. Based on an analysis of 21 studies published between 1987 and 2021, this review identifies consistent patterns of gender bias in textbook content. Most of these studies were published in Chinese-language sources accessed through the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database. These include the overrepresentation of male characters, the marginalization of women in both textual and visual content, and the reinforcement of traditional gender roles through depictions of occupational, emotional, and personality traits. Female characters are frequently positioned in domestic and passive roles, while male characters are portrayed as intellectually capable, authoritative, and socially active. The review also evaluates the methodologies employed in the existing literature, highlighting an overreliance on quantitative content analysis and limited textual interpretation. While some recent studies incorporate interviews, surveys, and comparative perspectives, there is a lack of theoretical engagement, especially with critical discourse analysis, feminist theory, or intersectional frameworks. Additionally, significant conceptual ambiguity and redundancy across studies suggest a need for more rigorous and innovative research approaches. By foregrounding these limitations, this article argues for a more critical, interdisciplinary, and globally contextualized research agenda on gender in educational materials. It emphasizes the ideological function of textbooks in shaping gendered subjectivities and calls for renewed attention to the role of curriculum in reproducing or challenging patriarchal norms in education.",

We then identify nine characteristics of current models that are likely to impair realistic simulation human subjects, including atemporality, social acceptability bias, uniformity, and poverty of sensory experience. For each of these areas, we discuss promising approaches for overcoming their associated shortcomings. Given the rate of change of these models, we advocate for an ongoing methodological program on the simulation of human subjects that keeps pace with rapid technical progress.",

The previous policy\nlimited the public access policies to only the largest grantmaking agencies. The new policy\neliminated a previously-optional 12-month embargo. The changes have raised questions as to the\nlegal foundations of the public access policy, as well as use of the Federal Purpose License as a\ntool for achieving the policy’s aims. This paper argues both are legally permissible.\n\nFor Federal agencies to act permissibly, their actions must be grounded in—and within the\nscope of—a valid Congressional delegation of authority, and must be actions that Congress itself\nis constitutionally permitted to take. Congress’s constitutional power to provide grants for research\nand development is examined under both the Spending and Progress clauses, each of which\nprovides strong support. Though the power to place conditions on grant funding is not unlimited,\nit is broad enough to support public access policies under the Dole factors. Congress expressly—\nand permissibly—delegated power and obligation to create the prototype of the public access\npolicy to the National Institutes of Health, and subsequent application of the policy to the rest of\nthe grant-making agencies is strongly supported by principles of implicit delegation, and were\nestablished through appropriate rulemaking. Though the recent case of Loper Bright Enterprises\nv.

Analysis of pre- and post-trial data from 2,896 employees in 141 organisations shows improvements in burnout, job satisfaction, mental health, and physical health—a pattern not observed in 12 control companies. Both company-level and individual-level reductions in hours are correlated with well-being gains, with larger individual-level (though not company-level) reductions associated with greater improvements in well-being. Three key factors mediate the relationship: improved self-reported work ability, reduced sleep problems, and decreased fatigue.

Kaikkien kestävyyden osa‑alueiden parempi huomioiminen päätöksenteossa vaatii ymmärrystä hyvinvoinnista kaikilla hallinnonaloilla.
