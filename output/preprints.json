          "title": "Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Regarding Digital Health Utilization Among Medical Students of QAMC: A Cross-sectional Study",
          "authors": "Ali Nawaz; Mehsum Shahzad; Ahmed Raza; Fasih Noshervan",
          "abstract": "Background: Interest in digital health interventions, defined as the use of mobile technologies in healthcare, is growing worldwide. Adoption and utilization of these technologies are crucial among medical students, who represent the future healthcare workforce. Prior studies have shown insufficient knowledge of digital health utilization in countries like Pakistan. Limited evidence exists on whether students feel competent using these technologies or the challenges they face in academic and clinical settings. This study aims to identify curriculum gaps and highlight the need to integrate comprehensive digital health training into medical education. As future healthcare professionals, medical students’ proficiency with digital health technologies will significantly impact healthcare delivery.\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes regarding digital health utilization among medical students in Bahawalpur, Pakistan. The study also aimed to analyze curriculum gaps and inform policymakers in developing supportive policies that encourage digital health use, provide training, and address barriers faced by students in adopting these technologies.\nMethods: Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire from 309 participants through convenience sampling in Bahawalpur. Frequencies and percentages were calculated using SPSS software. Results were presented graphically and in tables.\nResults: Knowledge of digital health utilization was moderately high. More than half of the students reported awareness of digital health. Among respondents, 43.9% used digital health for tracking physical activities, 33.1% for managing health conditions, 23.6% for communicating with healthcare professionals, 7.2% for scheduling appointments, and 0.9% for other purposes. Overall, 64.7% said they would recommend digital services to others, 12.4% said they would not, and 22.9% were unsure.\nConclusion: The study shows that knowledge of digital health among medical students is satisfactory. Students utilize digital health mainly for personal health management, and future use of these services appears promising.\nKeywords: Knowledge, Attitude, Digital Health, Utilization",

          "authors": "Veronique Kiermer; Sofia Elaine Adams; Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo; Yensi Flores Bueso; Kathleen Hall Jamieson; Joerg Heber; Mohammad Hosseini; Ana Marusic; A. Beau Nielsen; Magdalena Skipper",
          "abstract": "A responsible authorship culture is the cornerstone of a responsible research enterprise. It is the collective responsibility of the entire scholarly community—including researchers at all levels of seniority, journals, research funders, scholarly societies, and research institutions. We examined authorship guidelines issued by journals and research institutions and found that their recommendations to researchers are highly variable. We argue that harmonization of guidelines can help but also that guidelines alone are insufficient to promote culture change. A responsible authorship culture requires a principle-based reflection by research teams on what it means to be an author with support and encouragement from research institutions. Accordingly, we propose three interconnected principles that form the foundation for responsible authorship: transparency, credit, and accountability. We also offer three ways in which research team leaders can embed best practices for transparency, credit, and accountability in their ongoing work.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Hosseini; Simon Kerridge; Liz Allen; Veronique Kiermer; Kristi L. Holmes",
          "abstract": "The Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT) uses 14 standard roles to specify scholarly contributions to research publications. CRediT has been adopted by hundreds of journals and integrated into journal submission workflows. In 2022, CRediT was formalized as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the National Information Standards Organization (NISO), providing a sustained support system and custodianship. Subsequently, forming the CRediT Standing Committee aimed to ensure inclusive and transparent evolution and enhance understanding and adoption of CRediT in the research community. This paper outlines the CRediT Standing Committee's ongoing strategies to support uptake and reduce ambiguity and confusion when using roles. These strategies include developing user instructions to provide guidance on how to use CRediT, creating persona profiles to improve understanding of existing roles and designing badges for each role to make them more memorable. These resources will address challenges reported by the scholarly community or identified by the CRediT Standing Committee and will be shared openly upon completion.",

          "title": "The Origins and Emergence of Design Thinking",
          "authors": "Jan Michel Auernhammer",
          "abstract": "The research presented in this article traces the origins of design thinking back to the mid-1950s, explores its early conception, and reveals the influence from diverse fields that constitute this conception. This knowledge archaeology of manuscripts that include the terms ‘designerly’ and ‘design thinking’ before 1990 reveals the evolving knowledge structures of design thinking, including the development of various perspectives, shifts in meaning, and the discontinuities that were misplaced due to conceptual and semantic creep. Early conceptualizations of design thinking drew on theories and practices from technical systems, functional art, and other fields, particularly experimental psychology. As these foundations grew, the discourse around design thinking diversified into various perspectives, including design methods, semiotics in design, and human-centered design, in the 1960s. The knowledge structures of these diverse perspectives are not merely historical theories and approaches. They actively shape contemporary understanding and discourse, and influence design education and practice. The distinct design approaches manifest in the specific design of industrial objects and the human-made environment. These design approaches have various implications as they impact living organisms in everyday life and the large natural ecosystem. Overall, this research illustrates that the dialogue on design thinking represents a collective conversation about diverse approaches to designing, akin to the discourse on the role of the scientific method in the field of science.",

          "authors": "Amanda Jo Wright; Maike Luhmann; Sophia Salzburg; Maren Koss; Peter Haehner",
          "abstract": "Personality functioning, or Criterion A of the Alternative Model of Personality Disorders, captures deficits in intrapersonal and interpersonal capacities, is believed to be relatively malleable, and is associated with normal-range personality (e.g., Big Five traits). Questions about changes in personality functioning are of critical relevance for theory development and psychotherapeutic treatment of personality pathology, yet little is known about its longitudinal development. Using a sample of German-speaking young adults (N = 1,440; Mage = 25.57), we examined one-year unconditional and event-related development in self-reported personality functioning across four metrics of change, tested predictors of heterogeneity in event-related changes, and compared findings to self-reported Big Five traits. Generally, unconditional development of all personality constructs was very similar, but there were some trait- and metric-specific differences. Life events accounted for heterogeneity in unconditional development, but almost exclusively for personality functioning, suggesting it has a greater susceptibility to external influences than most Big Five traits. Event perceptions and initial personality levels sometimes predicted individual differences in event-related changes, mostly for mean-level effects, and initial personality functioning frequently moderated event-related changes in the Big Five whereas the reverse was less common. These findings provide further insight into the conceptual (dis)similarity of personality traits and personality functioning, inform joint theoretical frameworks, and may help advance personality disorder treatment by identifying conditions in which changes in personality pathology may be expected or best captured.",

          "authors": "Edoardo Arcuri; Leonardo Cerliani; Martina Ardizzi; Nunzio Langiulli; Francesca Ferroni; Christian Keysers; Valeria Gazzola; Vittorio Gallese",
          "abstract": "Interpersonal motor interactions are central to social life, yet it remains unclear how social cues relevant to detecting engagement are encoded in the brain. Recent evidence suggests that regions traditionally associated with mentalizing, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), co-activate with nodes of the Action Observation Network (AON) during motor engagement with others, pointing to a synergistic role in the processing of action features during interaction. Using fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we examined brain responses to reach-to-grasp actions varying in Goal (passing vs. placing), Perspective (2nd vs. 3rd person), and Gaze visibility, creating a gradient of perceived engagement. Our results show that the TPJ and premotor cortices, but not the dmPFC, displayed convergent neural geometry during action observation. Model- and cluster-based analyses further linked TPJ and AON regions in multiple representational spaces: left-hemisphere regions aligned with goal encoding, whereas right-hemisphere regions aligned with an Engagement model capturing first-person interaction. Critically, we demonstrate that the rTPJ and left premotor cortex share representational geometry for action perspective, directly coupling mentalizing and sensorimotor systems in the encoding of directional cues. By contrast, the dmPFC appeared representationally isolated from both TPJ and AON regions, with response patterns showing no similarity to Goal or Engagement models. This is consistent with accounts of its recruitment under richer interactive demands rather than selectivity for abstract action features. Together, these findings support a distributed, sensorimotor account of engagement encoding and reveal new functional links among key social cognition areas.",

          "abstract": "Parental lying to children is common. Yet, critical measurement issues, including lie frequency, variation in lie types, and challenges in cross-country comparisons, remain underexplored. This study examined parental lying prevalence (whether they lie) and frequency (how often they lie), overall and across lie types (i.e., other-oriented, self-oriented, instrumental). Additionally, measurement invariance was evaluated to determine whether meaningful comparisons could be made between parents from the Netherlands and the United States (U.S.).\nCross-sectional self-report data were collected from 109 parents from the Netherlands and 122 from the U.S. with children aged 6 to 16. Chi-square tests assessed differences in prevalence and frequency across lie types. Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis tested measurement invariance, followed by cross-country comparisons of latent means. \nMost parents in both countries reported lying, though frequent lying was rare. Significant differences emerged across lie types in prevalence and frequency. Full measurement invariance was established, supporting cross-country comparability. Comparisons revealed no significant differences in lying tendencies between groups. \nThis study advances the understanding of parental lying by highlighting not only its prevalence but also its frequency, while distinguishing between lie types. Findings also suggest similarities between parents from the Netherlands and the U.S. in item interpretation and general lying tendencies.",

          "authors": "Sebastian Risco; Devin J. Mills",
          "abstract": "As video games increasingly incorporate gambling-like mechanics, such as loot boxes and gacha microtransactions, concern has grown over their association with problematic video gaming (PVG) and mental health outcomes. This study explores how parasocial relationships (PRs) with fictional characters, a growing phenomenon in video gaming, may influence the negative effects of in-game gambling on depression. A sample of 584 players (Mage = 24.98, SD = 5.70; 81.6% male), recruited from Reddit forums centered on video games featuring gacha, completed scales assessing risky loot box and gacha use, PVG, depressive symptoms, and whether they had a PR. Using structural equation modeling, mediation and moderated mediation models were tested. Results show that having PR is indirectly linked to depression via PVG, and that while risky in-game gambling behaviors alone did not predict depression via PVG in the general sample, PRs significantly altered this dynamic. Specifically, for individuals who reported having a PR, both risky loot box and gacha engagement indirectly predicted depression through PVG. These associations were absent, or even negative, among participants without a PR. Findings suggest that PRs with fictional characters may exacerbate gaming-related harms by increasing emotional investment and gameplay frequency, particularly in games designed to foster emotional attachment or feature in-game gambling. This study highlights PRs as a key psychological mechanism linking in-game gambling to poor mental health, reinforcing the importance of considering player–character relationships in future research and policy efforts on gaming disorder and digital spending risks.",

          "abstract": "Although sports-themed video games (SVG) are some of the most popular and profitable video games, there is a lack of research regarding video gaming and gambling behaviors of SVG players. To date, research suggests that sports fandom may drive SVG play, as engagement in SVGs is an extension of sports consumption. Evidence also suggests that sports fandom is associated with more sports betting and other gambling. Despite these findings, research has yet to explore the differences between SVG players and non-SVG (NSVG) players across their video gaming and gambling engagement including measures of problem video gaming (PVG) and problem gambling (PG). The present study addresses this gap in the literature using online survey data from two independent samples from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk: N = 1,990, 53.1% Male; Mage = 40.14, SD = 11.80) and Academic Prolific (N = 2,212, 68.4% Male, Mage = 33.18, SD = 9.94). Results showed that SVG players had higher frequency video gaming and gambling, and greater prevalence of PVG and PG relative to NSVG players. Further, SVG players also reported higher frequency of video gaming-related gambling, such as loot box purchases and e-sports gambling, suggesting a strong overlap of video gaming and gambling among SVG players. This is the first study to show a significant risk for SVG players in terms of PG. The discussion focuses on the next steps for research.",

We used nationally representative data from the first wave of the Global Flourishing Study (N = 202,898) to explore the distribution of R/S connection in 22 geographically and culturally diverse countries and identify potential differences in connection to a religion or spirituality across nine sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, employment status, years of education, immigration status, frequency of religious service attendance, religious affiliation, racial/ethnic identity). Our descriptive analysis supported substantial cross-national variation in the proportion of people who endorsed ‘often/always’ feeling a connection to a religion or spirituality, ranging from 23% in Japan to 85% in South Africa. We estimated country-level descriptive statistics for a connection to a religion or spirituality in each sociodemographic category, and then performed a series of random effects meta-analyses to aggregate results across countries. Meta-analytic results provided evidence of subgroup differences in R/S connection for religious service attendance and (to a lesser extent) age, with the highest R/S connection observed among people who attended religious services.",

          "abstract": "The idea that humanity and nature are spiritually connected—ecospirituality—is a core aspect of cultural and religious worldviews around the world. Sociocultural factors, like religion, urbanization, and affluence, are hypothesized to shape people’s spiritual connections with nature, yet there are no systematic cross-cultural surveys of ecospirituality that can speak to this hypothesis. Study 1 used a sample of religious people from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to assess how these sociocultural factors relate to ecospirituality. Study 2 assessed the same factors in a sample of religious and non-religious Americans (N = 3,329). The overall pattern of results suggested that greater religiosity, urbanization, and affluence contribute to greater ecospirituality across cultural and religious contexts. Some differences in the pattern of results were found in the sample of Americans, suggesting that psychological surveys on this topic conducted in the United States may not generalize across cultures. This research contributes to our understanding of how sociocultural factors that are rapidly changing in many parts of the world may shape people’s connections with the natural environment.",

          "abstract": "The idea that nature has spiritual qualities is common in diverse cultural and religious contexts. In North American samples, evidence supports a link between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes. However, the generalizability of this claim remains untested. This study employs a large cross-cultural sample of religious individuals from 15 countries spanning the 5 world religions (N = 11,186) to (1) estimate the link between ecospirituality and three pro-environmental outcomes: behavioural intentions to make sustainable decisions, policy support, and financial donations to a pro-environmental organization; and (2) assess the pathways by which an ecospiritual worldview translates to pro-environmentalism. The results of pre-registered analyses showed that ecospirituality positively predicted each of the pro-environmental outcomes similarly across diverse cultural and religious populations. Even more, the link between ecospirituality and pro-environmental outcomes were consistently mediated by the same variables across cultures. In short, ecospirituality unites diverse cultural worldviews in motivating care for nature by fostering a sense of responsibility, gratitude and efficacy, making it a potentially powerful foundation for global environmental stewardship.",

          "authors": "Violet Aurora Brown",
          "abstract": "Successful communication requires that listeners not only identify speech, but do so while maintaining performance on other tasks, like remembering what a conversational partner said or paying attention while driving. This set of four experiments systematically evaluated how audiovisual speech—which reliably improves speech intelligibility—affects dual-task costs during speech perception (i.e., one facet of listening effort). Results indicated that audiovisual speech reduces dual-task costs in difficult listening conditions (those in which visual cues substantially benefit intelligibility), but may actually increase costs in easy conditions—a pattern of results that was internally replicated multiple times. This study also presents a novel dual-task paradigm specifically designed to facilitate conducting dual-task research remotely. Given the novelty of the task, this study includes psychometric experiments that establish positive and negative control, assess convergent validity, measure task sensitivity relative to a commonly-used dual-task paradigm, and generate performance curves across a range of listening conditions. Thus, in addition to evaluating the effects of audiovisual speech across a wide range of background noise levels, this study enables other researchers to address theoretical questions related to the cognitive mechanisms supporting speech processing beyond the specific issues addressed here and without being limited to in-person research.",

          "authors": "Mary Alexandria Kelly; David Reitter",
          "abstract": "What role does the study of natural language play in the task of developing a unified theory and common model of cognition? Language is perhaps the most complex behaviour that humans exhibit, and, as such, is one of the most difficult problems for understanding human cognition. Linguistic theory can both inform and be informed by unified models of cognition. We discuss (1) how computational models of human cognition can provide insight into how humans produce and comprehend language and (2) how the problem of modelling language processing raises questions and creates challenges for widely used computational models of cognition. Evidence from the literature suggests that behavioural phenomena, such as recency and priming effects, and cognitive constraints, such as working memory limits, affect how language is produced by humans in ways that can be predicted by computational cognitive models. But just as computational models can provide new insights into language, language can serve as a test for these models. For example, simulating language learning requires the use of more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and vector symbolic architectures, and language comprehension requires a capacity for on-the-fly situational model construction. In sum, language plays an important role in both shaping the development of a common model of the mind, and, in turn, the theoretical understanding of language stands to benefit greatly from the development of a common model.",

          "authors": "Nathan Pond; Frances Meeten; Patrick Clarke; Lies Notebaert; Ryan Bradley Scott",
          "abstract": "Generalised anxiety disorder is a prevalent condition linked to the presence of cognitive biases, including attention bias. Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Interventions to modify these biases have been developed with the aim of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, the current evidence-base for attention bias modification (ABM) procedures to alleviate symptoms is mixed. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. We revisited the efficacy of ABM, conducting a replication of a seminal study showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms following multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009). As a secondary aim, we quantified the potential influence of demand effects in the paradigm. Participants (N = 104) classed as high worriers attended seven lab-based sessions. This included five probe-based ABM training sessions (or sham-training control), and a pre- and post-training session in which levels of attention bias, worry, trait anxiety and depression were assessed. We adopted a Bayesian approach to analyses with a series of Bayesian t-tests evaluating the change in each outcome measure from pre- to post-training. These analyses revealed sensitive evidence for the null hypothesis of no effect for all measures except the measure of depression (which was insensitive), and no sensitive evidence for demand effects. These findings join a growing body of literature suggesting that probe-based ABM training does not lead to a robust reduction in bias or anxiety. Therefore, alternative ABM paradigms should be investigated.",

          "authors": "Kerwin Xiang Liao",
          "abstract": "In hyper-meritocratic societies where performance, productivity, and individualism are prioritized above all else, opportunities for genuine intimacy have become structurally constrained. In this paper, I propose a theoretical model to explain the rise of virtual intimacy—including pornography, cam platforms, AI companions, and subscription-based emotional labor—as a psychological response to institutionalized emotional deprivation. Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from sociology, psychology, and media studies, I argue that virtual intimacy functions not only as a source of sensory stimulation but also as a surrogate for unfulfilled relational needs such as being desired, seen, and emotionally accepted. I integrate findings from animal studies (e.g., Rat Park, Harlow’s rhesus monkey experiments) to underscore the evolutionary significance of social bonding, and analyze platform-level data to illustrate the global expansion of synthetic intimacy. My model outlines how social atomization fosters emotional deprivation, prompting reliance on virtual intimacy that further deepens disconnection in a self-reinforcing cycle. By situating the consumption of digital intimacy within broader socio-institutional contexts, I aim to reframe such behaviors not as moral failings but as structurally induced adaptations. I conclude by calling for institutional reform aimed at restoring the human capacity for real intimacy in an increasingly synthetic world.",

Older adults exhibit unique pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric disorders and, accordingly, have unique treatment considerations. In the case of psychedelics, differences in life circumstances, peripheral physiology, polypharmacy, weight, and neurobiology may present unique theoretical risks and opportunities for older adults.

          "authors": "Angela Capani; Henry Brice; Sara Qadoumi; Kaja Kinga Jasińska",
          "abstract": "We examined the development of reading comprehension and its neural underpinnings in the context of disrupted education among Syrian refugee children and youth resettled in Canada. One hundred participants  (Mage = 13.78, SD = 2.55) completed standardized assessments of language comprehension, decoding, and reading comprehension, and participated in functional near-infrared spectroscopy while completing a decoding task. Consistent with the Simple View of Reading (SVR), both language comprehension and decoding significantly predicted reading comprehension. However, the relative role of language comprehension and decoding to reading comprehension differed depending on the extent of educational disruptions experienced during displacement and migration. Decoding predicted reading comprehension for children with minimal education disruptions. However, when educational disruptions were longer due to prolonged displacement, the relation between decoding and reading comprehension was limited, and instead, the relation between language comprehension and reading comprehension was greater. These results suggested that in the context of limited formal literacy instruction during displacement, language comprehension may assume a compensatory function for poor decoding ability. Neuroimaging showed that greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) predicted better reading comprehension, suggesting compensatory recruitment beyond the typical left-lateralized reading network. Cluster analyses identified distinct reading profiles that were predicted by neural activation patterns and educational disruption. Children with the highest reading comprehension scores showed greater right IFG activation and lower activation in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG)–a region associated with decoding. Our study extends the SVR by demonstrating that the contribution of decoding and language comprehension to reading comprehension depends on educational experience, and that multiple neural pathways can support reading comprehension after educational disruption. Practically, these results highlight the need for individualized reading interventions and the urgency of minimizing educational disruption for displaced children and youth.",

          "abstract": "When creating art, artists must make constant decisions with each pen stroke in order to achieve their goals of the piece. One common goal is to create something memorable—a piece that will persist in the memories of the observer. However, an open question is how different artistic decisions impact the memorability of a piece as it is being created. To test this question, we utilized a neural network (ResMem) to track the frame-by-frame changes in memorability for 50 videos of the creation of digital art pieces. We tested this neural network’s predictions via a human memory experiment (N=399), finding that ResMem’s predictions significantly correlated with human memory performance across the art creation process. We then collected multiple measures of each piece’s creation process, including low-level visual features, mid-level visual features, neural network-derived features, artistic features, and spatial properties. We find that changes in details and low-level visual features do not contribute to the memorability of a piece; rather more global measures of simplicity and variability relate to the memorability of a piece. Further, larger changes (e.g., blocking, sketching), particularly below the horizon of the image, make the biggest impacts on memorability. Importantly, we find that the memorability of a piece is largely set from the very beginning, and changes that occur later have diminishing impact on the memorability of a piece. These findings have important implications for both artists and psychologists in thinking about the factors that impact memory during the creation of an image.",

          "authors": "MohammadHossein Manuel Haqiqatkhah; Ellen Hamaker",
          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

          "abstract": "Facilitation in word processing, identified as faster responses to semantically related words, has traditionally been viewed as evidence of the core cognitive mechanisms that support language processing. However, it remains uncertain whether this facilitation arises from bottom-up spreading activation, top-down prediction, or a combination of both. To address this, we developed a novel semantic priming paradigm that systematically manipulates local contextual buildup and applied drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to differentiate the decision dynamics associated with each mechanism. In our experiment, 20 participants performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one (short condition) or three (long condition) semantically related primes. We found that, as the local semantic context became more enriched (short vs. long condition), participants adjusted their decision strategies, engaging different processing mechanisms. In the short condition, participants relied on spreading activation, as indicated by increased drift rate (faster evidence accumulation), suggesting that a single related prime pre-activated the target's mental representation. In contrast, in the long condition, reduced boundary separation (participants required less evidence before responding) implied greater confidence driven by enhanced predictability from multiple primes, consistent with the predictive processing account. Together, our findings offer new insights into theoretical models of language processing; demonstrate the practical relevance of DDM in language processing and offer potential implications for translational research.",

          "abstract": "Category learning is the ability to link items to a shared label based on their common features. Despite being important for individuals of all ages, there is little research on how older age affects category learning and generalization. Moreover, there is no research, to date, on the extent to which individuals tend to adopt the same categorization strategy across different to-be-learned categories. In this study, healthy young (aged 18-30, n = 77) and older adults (aged 60+, n = 74) completed two categorization tasks in separate sessions approximately 48 hours apart, with the category structures remaining constant across sessions but the stimuli differing. We compared categorization accuracy and prototype versus exemplar model fits across age groups and across sessions. In both sessions, there was an age deficit specific to learning items near the category boundary. Despite differences during learning, there were no significant age differences in generalization performance. Fitting formal prototype and exemplar models revealed a comparable proportion of young and older adults best fit by the prototype model overall, but a continuous measure of prototype model fit advantage showed higher correlation across sessions in older compared to young adults. Together, these findings show that older adults consistently rely on typical training items to learn categories and are more stable in their prototype strategy use than young adults, which can be effective in supporting generalization performance at young-adult levels.",

          "authors": "Julie Husmann; Laura Ilen; Clémence Mathilde Feller; Stephan Eliez; Maude Schneider",
          "abstract": "Background: \n22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic condition associated with a wide range of physical, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments. This condition is often associated with difficulties in social functioning (SF), frequently exacerbated by psychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety and psychotic symptoms, which are particularly common in this population. This study adopted a multi-method approach to embrace the complexity of the SF assessment and identify distinct SF profiles in youths with 22q11DS. Association with mental health were examined, with the aim of guiding more targeted and individualized interventions.\nMethods: \nFifty-five adolescents and young adults with 22q11DS and 65 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls were recruited. SF was assessed using a combination of measures in both groups, and a latent profile analysis was conducted on the full sample to identify distinct SF profiles. Mental health was assessed in both groups using standardized questionnaires; in addition, individuals with 22q11DS completed clinical interviews to assess psychiatric comorbidities.\nResults: \nThree distinct SF profiles emerged from a Latent Profile Analysis: An Above profile composed exclusively of TD individuals; an Average profile including both TD and 22q11DS participants; and a Below profile consisting mainly of individuals with 22q11DS. These profiles differed on key SF variables. Within the 22q11DS group, individuals in the Below profile exhibited more pronounced negative and disorganized psychotic symptoms and a greater number of psychiatric comorbidities than those in the Average profile, whose SF was more similar to that of TD individuals.\nConclusions: \nThis study improves our understanding of SF in individuals with 22q11DS by highlighting both inter-group differences and intra-group variability. The identification of three distinct SF profiles (above, average, below) reveals a gradient of SF and underscores that SF difficulties are not solely linked to cognitive impairments but also to psychopathology. The findings emphasize the importance of using a combination of complementary measures to capture the complex nature of SF and to guide more nuanced, individualized interventions.",

We conducted continuous GPS tracking of 171 first-time parents in Denmark during maternity leave and paternity leave, combined with postnatal depression and sleep quality assessments. Using Bayesian multilevel models with zero-inflated distributions, we revealed three key insights. First, parental leave restricted spatial mobility for both mothers and fathers, but with distinct patterns: fathers spent more time at home yet showed greater spatial dispersion when mobile. Second, parental leave coincided with elevated depression scores and poorer sleep quality for the on-leave parent, with mothers showing consistently higher depression levels than fathers. Third, parents with more depression symptoms showed increased probability of staying home entirely and reduced mobility range when mobile. These findings demonstrate population-level associations between GPS-derived mobility patterns and parental depression, even within the constrained spatial context of parental leave.",

          "abstract": "Hierarchical models are widely used to estimate group- and individual-level parameters in cognitive and behavioral research. When model parameters are bounded within a particular range, it is common practice to estimate the group-level parameters on the unbounded real line and then map the estimated mean onto the desired bounded parameter range using a nonlinear transformation. We show that the way group-level estimates are commonly computed with this approach can produce systematic biases because it ignores within-group variability. We derive correct expressions for computing the group-level mean that take within-group variability into account. Using formal derivation, simulation, and reanalyses of empirical data, we demonstrate (using cumulative prospect theory as an example) how the commonly used but incorrect approach distorts parameter estimates. In a reanalysis of age differences in risky choice, we find that although the distortions do not alter qualitative conclusions about group differences, they can affect the size of such differences and lead to different psychological interpretations of the groups' behavior. We point out and elaborate that the underlying issue is general and can arise in a wide range of hierarchical models. Our results highlight a subtle but consequential issue in hierarchical modeling and we provide concrete solutions for ensuring the validity of group-level inferences about behavior.",

In this game, the players depend on each other’s ability to make good decisions to succeed. In two studies (N = 87, N = 281), we collected data on the understanding of an artificial agent, operationalized as the ability to predict its actions and the skill at the task itself. The participants improve at predicting the agent’s actions and at their subtasks in the game over time. Following a misunderstanding, the participants’ performance at their subtask was worse, as measured by their actions’ quality, speed, and efficiency. Results of Study 2 suggest that the improvements in predicting the agent’s actions are likely the result of an improved understanding of the game rather than an improved understanding of the agent.",

          "abstract": "As demand for problem-solving skills continues to grow, so does the need for efficient training methods. A potential method of achieving efficient training of problem-solving skills is to design a training programme that maximises transfer of learning between problem domains. However, current models of expert problem-solving make contrasting predictions about the conditions under which cross-domain transfer is possible. While pattern-recognition models using state-action associations allow only limited transfer to tasks with different actions, search-based models using state-value associations can reuse the same associations across tasks, potentially achieving greater transfer. In this study, we consider the case of transformation problem-solving tasks where each task uses a distinct and non-overlapping set of transformation rules. Participants trained using tasks from one taskset over four consecutive days and completed pre- and post-training probes on the untrained set. Training improved participants’ solution rate, efficiency, and decision speed, but there were no reliable improvements for the untrained tasks beyond what could be explained by direct practice during the probe blocks. We also observed a gradual reduction in the association between participants’ solution efficiency and their working memory capacity on the trained trials, suggesting a transition towards a problem-solving method less dependent upon working memory. We note that these findings contrast with the predictions of some search-based models of problem-solving expertise in which a rule-independent state-value function is reused across tasksets to decide actions. We discuss the implications of these results for future models of expert problem-solving and for the training of problem-solving skills.",

Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

A critical problem is the omission of adolescents’ perspectives in the development of diagnostic frameworks and questionnaires. Synthesising lived experience evidence can help inform better identification of youth mental health needs.\nMethods: A preregistered systematic search was conducted through Medline: Ovid, Epistemonikos, ProQuest dissertations, Prospero, and Psyarxiv. Systematic reviews were included if they contained qualitative evidence from adolescents (aged 10-24) experiencing the most common clinically-relevant problems (e.g., depression, self-harm). Informed by lived experience expertise, qualitative data were synthesized, including to understand which experiences were transdiagnostic (common across different mental health types). Experiences were also compared to existing questionnaires and reported alongside quality assessment via AMSTAR2.\nOutcomes: Eighteen reviews were synthesized into 30 experiences (subthemes), which were grouped into six themes: social disconnection, behavioural expression, how I relate to the experience, emotional experiences, negative and shifting beliefs of self, and disrupted ability to function. \nInterpretation: This review highlights the need to update existing frameworks and provides initial groundwork for doing so. We argue social indicators should be given more weight, and lived experience evidence also challenged traditional boundaries between symptoms and functioning. Experiences tended to be transdiagnostic, with evidence of dimensionality, overlap between disorders, and new experiences missing from existing frameworks revealed.

One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

          "abstract": "Sacrificial moral dilemmas require individuals to choose between allowing harm to several people or preventing this by actively causing harm to a smaller number of people. These dilemmas have been foundational in studying how people resolve conflicts between competing moral principles, with responses traditionally interpreted as reflecting either “utilitarian” concern for the greater good or “deontological” refusal to enact harm. Existing research relies almost exclusively on hypothetical scenarios. We confronted 794 participants across two studies with real-life consequential dilemmas involving minor but genuine physical harm. Participants decided whether to allow two confederates to receive painful electroshocks or shock a third confederate, and provided motivations for their decisions. Study 1 manipulated physical proximity to potential targets, while Study 2 examined how the gender composition of potential targets influenced decisions. Moreover, each participant faced this choice twice, allowing us to examine how prior outcomes influence subsequent moral decisions.\nResults show that responses to traditional hypothetical dilemmas moderately predict real-life behavior. Physical proximity and target gender had no significant effects on actual choices. When confronting the dilemma a second time, approximately one-third of participants switched their decision, primarily to distribute harm equitably across potential targets. Analysis of participants' motivations reveals a diverse spectrum of moral considerations beyond utilitarian-deontological frameworks, including fairness concerns, responsibility avoidance, and beliefs about shared versus individual suffering. Our findings invite scholars to expand current theoretical models to better capture the nuanced ways people approach sacrificial trade-offs in consequential, real-world situations.",

Except for GFAP, these associations remained significant after adjustments. \nDISCUSION, Digital cognitive performance was associated with several ATN plasma biomarkers in T1D adults. Prospective studies are needed to understand the utility of these biomarkers in T1D.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces InterDIFNet, a multilabel classification neural network for detecting intersectional differential item functioning (DIF) in educational and psychological assessments, with a focus on small sample sizes. Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Despite advancements in speech recognition technology, questions remain about model generalizability and how much models mirror human comprehension. These questions are addressed by comparing OpenAI's Whisper model and 75 human transcribers on 300 English sentences (20 speakers, half F, half M, half US-accented, half Spanish-accented). Sentences ended in 100 target words: 1⁄3 high-predictability sentences (The farmer milked the cows), 1⁄3 low- predictability (The farmer milked the nose), and 1⁄3 low-predictability+nonword (The marmer milked the nose). Target word transcription error rates were examined both in sentences and in isolation (recordings excised from same sentences). Errors decreased with increasing model size, but remained heightened for Spanish-accented vs. US-accented speech, roughly similar to human transcribers. Both models and humans benefited from higher sentence predictability. However, sentence context affected models and humans differently: humans benefited only from high- predictability sentences, while models benefited from any sentence context. Humans numerically outperformed the (best-performing) large model on isolated words and showed different error patterns, suggesting Whisper may have a restricted distribution of short utterances or may need lengthier acoustic context than humans. More varied training data and better context awareness, including speaker identity and pragmatic context, might improve ASR generalization.",

          "abstract": "Experimental research on self-initiated movement has for decades relied on the same methodology: the data epochs subjected to analysis are only those culminating in a movement. This approach reliably reveals early ramping activity starting one second or more before movement, but discounts the prior probability of slow ramping. We trained powerful machine-learning classifiers in a sliding window to discriminate between EEG data epochs that either do or do not culminate in a self-initiated movement. We found early ramping signals, but they were not predictive of impending movement. Instead, the ability to correctly classify movement from no-movement epochs emerged abruptly ~100 ms before action onset, while, using the traditional approach, we replicated the spurious finding of early predictability. Our results resolve a long-standing controversy, showing the neural commitment to act is a late-stage process that aligns with results on the timing of subjective experience and the ability to inhibit self-initiated movement.",

We examine how national identity predicts voting among Kurds in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), a politically autonomous yet stateless region with a long history of ethnic persecution and struggles for recognition. Voter turnout has remained high in regional Kurdish elections but has dropped to a historical low in Iraqi parliamentary elections, reflecting public disillusionment. Using a large, representative sample (N = 1,072), we found that national identity predicted both intended voting in the then-upcoming Kurdish elections and actual participation in the 2021 Iraqi elections. These associations also occurred indirectly via trust in government and life satisfaction, and held after controlling for various psychological and sociodemographic variables. These findings suggest that a strong national identity may help sustain civic engagement even amid ongoing political and economic instability, and uncertainty over the region’s future.",

          "authors": "Henry Brice; Gairanlu Pamei; Sophia Galouschak; Kaja Kinga Jasińska",
          "abstract": "Background: Globally, many children learn to read exclusively in a second language (L2), but this phenomenon is understudied. Literacy typically reciprocally builds on pre-existing language knowledge, with phonological awareness (PA) and vocabulary predicting literacy outcomes, and themselves being impacted by literacy. Bilinguals demonstrate cross-linguistic transfer (CLT) of language skills from their first language (L1) to reading in L2, but this research primarily covers contexts where children have at least some level of L1 literacy. This raises the question of whether CLT occurs in the absence of L1 literacy, or if the reciprocal relation between language and literacy must be built in L1 before it can transfer to L2 reading.\nMethods: The current study examines the role of L1 and L2 language skills in supporting literacy in emergent readers in rural Côte d’Ivoire (n=1969, females = 912), between first and fifth grade. The broad range of ages both within and across grades allows us to examine how the age of first exposure to literacy impacts this relation. Results: We found robust evidence of CLT of PA, which was not moderated by age of literacy acquisition. Within-language support of literacy was moderated by age of literacy exposure, with literacy more strongly predicted by vocabulary and less by PA for those who started school on time. This effect fully mediated the detrimental impact of a late school start. Conclusions: These results have implications for theories of CLT and sensitive periods for literacy acquisition, and for efforts to reduce illiteracy in the Global South.",

Semi-structured, individual interviews revealed how an antiracist program, which involved reading and discussing the book Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You by Jason Reynolds and Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, engaged students and teachers in racism analysis, racial reflexivity, and antiracist action. Specifically, participants provided rich descriptions of how the Stamped program encouraged them to gain new perspectives, understand and recognize racism, link historical and modern racism, feel responsible and committed to racial justice, and take internal and interpersonal antiracist action. Some developmental trends emerged in which students were more likely to gain new worldviews and social cognitive mindsets whereas teachers were more likely to be racially reflexive and simultaneously discuss analysis, reflexivity, and action. Implications for antiracist programs as well as educational and developmental theory are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Previous studies concluded that listeners struggle to discriminate AI from human voices, but these studies used monotone-like speech and did not examine prosodic expressiveness, a key advantage of human over AI speakers. This study explores whether prosodic expressiveness facilitates human-AI voice discrimination. We recorded human prosodic speech with confident and doubtful expressions, trained AI models to replicate these prosodic patterns, had AI models generate new sentences, and then had human speakers produce equivalent prosodic expressions for the same sentences. In Experiment 1, we had 48 listeners rate humanlikeness and perceived confidence in 11,808 audio samples, finding that AI speech was consistently rated as less humanlike regardless of prosody. We selected 768 audios (AI × human, confident × doubtful prosody) for Experiment 2, where 80 listeners completed an identity discrimination task, telling whether two sounds were from the same speaker. Bayesian modeling results revealed near-ceiling performance for human-human/AI-AI pairs, with inconsistent prosodies decreasing accuracy by ~7%, while listeners do not easily categorize AI and human as sharing the same identity (~54% accuracy when prosody matches, dropping to ~36% when inconsistent). We found nonlinear effects of Wav2Vec2 acoustic distance on performance, with accuracy-reaction time synchronization supporting direct matching mechanisms over prototype-based processing. Human-AI/AI-human pairs showed unique patterns where larger acoustic distances prompted listeners to rely less on acoustic distance cues, unlike other conditions. Our study suggests that concerns about voice clone detection may have been raised prematurely. Additionally, it addresses current gaps in understanding how within-speaker identity variation influences identity processing.",

Grounded in the four voices model of practical theology and employing a contemplative qualitative methodology, the research used thematic analysis to discover how participants’ prayer practices and experiences reflect and reshape theological understanding. Although participants rarely used the term ‘contemplation,’ their practices often aligned with Catholic teachings on contemplative prayer, with a shift toward monological and body-based forms such as breath prayer and attention to posture.

          "abstract": "Introduction: Peer feedback plays a critical role in adolescents’ socio-emotional development, shaping emotional responses and social functioning. While positive feedback enhances well-being, negative feedback is often linked to self-criticism and distress. Yet, real-life interactions also include nuanced forms of feedback—such as neutral remarks and constructive input—that are poorly captured by traditional paradigms dichotomizing feedback into positive vs negative. Prior research has also largely focused on global psychological outcomes (e.g., self-esteem, depression), overlooking diverse emotional reactions (e.g., pride, guilt, motivation) that peer feedback can elicit.\n\nMethods: To address these gaps, we developed a novel vignette-based measure to assess adolescents’ emotional and motivational responses to positive, negative, neutral, and constructive peer feedback. The measure was administered to 67 Portuguese adolescents (aged 14–18 years, 51% female) from the general community.\n\nResults: Repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed significant differences across feedback types for all emotions (ps &lt; .01). Positive feedback elicited the highest levels of happiness and pride, and the lowest sadness, shame, and anger. Negative feedback produced the strongest negative emotions. Constructive feedback generated relatively high happiness and motivation but also moderate guilt and shame. Neutral feedback was most associated with indifference and muted emotional responses.\n\nConclusions: These findings support the measure’s sensitivity in capturing distinct emotional responses across feedback types. Notably, it captures the motivational benefits of constructive feedback alongside its moderate elicitation of negative emotions, and the muted, indifferent responses to neutral feedback. This highlights the utility of the measure for advancing understanding of how adolescents process diverse peer interactions.\n\nKeywords: Adolescence, Vignette measure, Peer feedback, response to peer feedback",

          "abstract": "Understanding human cognition in virtual environments (VE) is essential for improving digital human modeling and creating realistic experiences.  By recognizing how context affects sensory perception, designers can more effectively adapt environmental and task-related elements of experience design. This study compared participants' ability to detect and identify sensory cues, namely, passive tactile and olfactory stimuli, between real-life (RL) and VE. We also examined visual context dependency of sensory awareness in order to understand the contribution of environmental elements on sensory awareness.  This study is designed to measure the feeling of being in a real room, detection, identification, and perceived realism, intensity, roughness, and pleasantness of odor and tactile stimuli in both RL and its VE counterpart. Participants were exposed to sensory stimuli with or without visual cues. During the experiment, participants were given listening tasks. This design aims to understand how visual cues affect sensory perception and how different environments shape sensory performance. \nThe findings revealed that the feeling of being in a real room in VEs was high when all sensory cues (olfactory, tactile, visual) were present. Notably, in VE, odor detection was more accurate, whereas in RL, surface detection and identification were more reliable. When visual cues were present, participants detected olfactory and tactile cues more effectively. These findings shed light on how sensory perception encountered in RL shapes VE experiences and cognitive processes. These insights could enhance VE experiences by guiding the design of more realistic immersive settings and informing the use of sensory elements in VE design.",

          "abstract": "Psychiatry continues to struggle with the heterogeneity of mental disorders. Classifications such as DSM and ICD catalogue symptom clusters but fail to reveal underlying mechanisms. Recent integrative approaches, including the biopsychosocial model and RDoC, have advanced the field, yet psychiatry still lacks a unifying explanatory principle. We propose the Predictive Dysfunction Hypothesis as a conceptual framework—a paradigm rather than a proven theory. It suggests that psychiatric disorders can be understood as variations of a fundamental disruption in the brain’s predictive machinery. From an evolutionary standpoint, the brain’s primary role is not to represent the world accurately, but to anticipate potential dangers in order to ensure survival. When this survival-oriented predictive system becomes miscalibrated, psychopathology may arise. This hypothesis integrates predictive processing and active inference models with clinical psychiatry. Psychosis may be seen as overweighted priors, PTSD as rigid threat models, panic disorder as catastrophic interoceptive predictions, depression as entrenched negative priors, OCD as unresolved prediction errors, autism as overweighted sensory errors, and anxiety as exaggerated threat priors. Like oncology’s unification around disordered cell division, psychiatry may benefit from a unifying lens.

          "abstract": "Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",

          "abstract": "Experience of maltreatment in childhood profoundly impacts a plethora of neurocognitive systems, significantly increasing risk for later mental health problems. Here we investigate how childhood maltreatment shapes control beliefs and their relationship with stress and exploration in adulthood. We used a recently developed task, the Wheel Stopping (WS) task, to measure and manipulate control beliefs and stress, and combined this with a novel self-report measure of exploration in a sample of 477 adults with and without experience of childhood maltreatment (matched on age, gender and socioeconomic status). The WS task utilises two between-subjects manipulations of control: task controllability (high vs low), and performance feedback (relative positive vs relative negative). We show that despite similar task performance, maltreated participants displayed lower levels of control beliefs compared to controls and that while task performance improved over time for both groups, maltreated participants used this less to update their control beliefs. Further, whereas both groups responded equally to the task manipulations, only controls leveraged relative positive feedback to reduce task-related stress and increase goal-directed exploration. We conclude that maltreatment blunts the calibration of control beliefs, informing both stress and goal-directed exploration, likely increasing vulnerability to psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The Cyber Paranoia and Fear Scale (CPFS) was developed in 2014 by Mason et al to measure the perception of information technology-related threats. Given the rapid evolution of digital systems, including artificial intelligence, surveillance, and data sharing, this study sought to revalidate and update the scale, resulting in the Cyber Paranoia and Fear Scale–Updated (CPFS-U). Method: Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) with university students informed the redevelopment of the scale. Eight new items were added, and several were revised. The CPFS-U was administered to 433 adults, alongside validated measures of paranoia, generalised anxiety, online trust, digital confidence, and activity. Results: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor structure: (1) AI and Digital Dependence Concerns, (2) Technological Risk Awareness and Distrust, (3) Perceived Data Vulnerability, and (4) Surveillance and Monitoring Paranoia. Correlational analyses showed that overall cyber-paranoia and fear were positively associated with generalised anxiety and trait paranoia. Digital confidence and activity showed limited associations with the updated scale, indicating that emotional and cognitive responses to digital systems may be more influential than digital literacy itself. Discussion: The findings suggest that cyber paranoia is a multidimensional construct distinct from general paranoia, shaped by contemporary technological developments. The CPFS-U provides an updated measure for assessing digital mistrust and fear in modern contexts and may inform future research on technology-related anxiety and clinical interventions.",

Currently used screening tools are brief and cost-effective, but there is a lack of understanding of their reliability over time as well as whether responses are influenced by demographic or clinical factors. Aims: To examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal reliability and validity of two commonly used screening tools as well as their associations with current mood states and other participant characteristics. Methods: 331 adult patients with a diagnosis of BD completed the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) and the Hypomania Symptom Checklist-32 (HCL-32) as well as measures of mood online at baseline and three months later. Results: The MDQ was found to have low reliability with poor internal consistency (α= 0.531; α= 0.647 at respective timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.582). The HCL-32 was more reliable with good internal consistency (α= 0.815 at both timepoints) and test-retest reliability (rs=0.725). MDQ scores were significantly, positively associated with comorbidities and current symptoms of activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age and years since last hospitalisation. The HCL-32 was also significantly positively correlated with activation/mania, and negatively correlated with age, years since diagnosis and years since last hospitalisation. BD-I patients scored higher than other BD-subtypes. Mood state was the only variable with a significant change over time. Conclusions: The HCL-32 appeared more reliable than the MDQ, although all participants needed to exceed an MDQ threshold at baseline to participate in the study, which may have biased our results.",

          "abstract": "Much empirical research over the last thirty years suggests that learning to categorize a set of objects alters the way in which they are perceived or judged, a phenomenon known as learned categorical perception or LCP. LCP has provided key evidence for controversial claims of top-down effects of knowledge on perception and suggested a possible mechanism by which continuous perceptual input is transformed into discrete symbolic representations. LCP may consist of increased cross-category discrimination (\"expansion\"), decreased within-category discrimination (\"compression\"), or both, and some studies fail to show either type of boundary effect. To address these inconsistencies and determine the general robustness of LCP, we conducted separate meta-analyses of expansion and compression on a total of 70 experiments comprising 4,627 participants We found a moderate average effect size for expansion (d = .48) with strong evidence of publication bias, an average effect size of approximately 0 for compression with likely publication bias, and highly significant heterogeneity of effects across experiments for both expansion and compression. Moderator analyses revealed a significant effect of the task used to assess LCP, with same-different judgments tending to produce results consistent with a non-boundary effect of improved discrimination on the category-relevant dimension. However, the sensitivity of the moderator analyses was limited by low statistical power and most of the heterogeneity of effect sizes across studies remained unexplained. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of LCP, including suggestions for how future LCP research could be more informative and better support meta-analysis.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive public health issue with enduring psychosocial consequences. Contemporary, population‑based estimates among young adults and their associations with stress and tobacco behaviors remain undercharacterized.\nMethods: This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data among U.S. adults aged 18–34 (N = 6,252). CSA was measured via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) module and dichotomized (ever vs. never). Primary correlates included self‑reported stress (low/medium/high), cigarette smoking (never, someday, everyday, former), e‑cigarette use (yes/no), and sociodemographics (sex, sexual orientation, transgender identity, race/ethnicity, education, income). Survey‑weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression (survey procedures) estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs.\nResults: In the general population, the unweighted prevalence of CSA was 6.4% (n = 400), while the weighted prevalence was approximately 5.8%. In adjusted model, high stress was associated with a greater odds of reporting CSA (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07–3.48) compared to low stress. Tobacco-related behaviors were also associated with CSA, including daily smoking (aOR = 3.16), former smoking (aOR= 1.99), occasional smoking (aOR =1.82), and e-cigarette use (aOR =1.95). Higher socioeconomic status was found to have a protective effect on CSA. Being a college graduate (aOR = 0.44) and having an annual household income of more than $100,000 (aOR = 0.48) were associated with reduced odds of CSA. Race/ethnicity was not statistically significant after adjustment. \nConclusions: CSA remains common among US young adults and is associated with higher stress, tobacco use, and socioeconomic disadvantage; sexual minority men show elevated odds. Findings underscore the need for trauma‑informed, equity‑centered prevention and integrated behavioral health and tobacco control strategies tailored to young adults and sexual/gender minority populations.\nKeywords: childhood sexual abuse; young adults; stress; e‑cigarettes; tobacco; BRFSS; sexual orientation; health disparities.",

However, previous research has largely focused on Western samples. We examined the Personality Triad across cultures with N = 15,221 participants from 61 countries and one geographic region. Participants reported on one situation from their daily lives. We examined (1) situation characteristic–behavioral state, (2) trait–behavioral state, and (3) trait–situation characteristic associations, as well as (4) trait × situation characteristic interactions predicting behavioral states. We focused on six traits (Big Five, Honesty-Humility), seven situation characteristics (Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, pOsitivity, Negativity, Sociality), and three self-reported behavioral states (Agency, Enthusiasm, Self-Negativity). Importantly, we included 15 country-level variables (collectivism, self-construal, cultural value orientations, tightness, independent and interdependent happiness, national socioeconomic status) as moderators that might contribute to country differences in the Personality Triad. Bayesian multilevel models showed sizable and expected situation characteristic–behavioral state and trait–behavioral state associations with a high degree of generalization across countries, some cultural differences, and moderator effects contradicting theoretical expectations. For instance, we found weaker situation characteristic effects in collectivistic cultures and stronger trait effects in embedded cultures. Trait–situation characteristic associations were meaningful but smaller, and trait × situation characteristic interactions were small and less often significant (although we observed some expected interactions). We found little evidence for country differences in the latter two relations. We discuss implications and future directions for cross-cultural work on the Personality Triad, including replications and extensions using intensive-longitudinal designs.",

States of consciousness refer to discrete modes of awareness elicited by normal states of the brain, such as those associated with wakefulness and sleep, and by abnormal factors, including brain lesions, pharmacological agents and other external interventions. Contents of consciousness refer what we are conscious of. In this chapter, we emphasize the dynamic nature of consciousness in terms of both its states and contents. First, we first observe that our life constantly alternates between different conscious and unconscious states, namely, sleep and wakefulness. Then, within each state, we note an inherent dynamism in content, with conscious experience ranging from content-full to content-less. By surveying the variety of conscious experiences across wakefulness and sleep, we highlight the similarities in reported contents across these states. We further discuss how the possibility of having conscious experiences without specific content challenges the idea that being conscious necessarily involves being conscious of something. Finally, by reviewing the literature on the neural correlates of consciousness, we propose a potential convergence in the study of conscious states and contents.",

Skilled players performed the task faster than novices and showed a more proactive VEA: they spent moretime looking at cues related to future passing opportunities while novices looked more at cues related to ball reception. In addition, skilled players made longer scanning movements before receiving the ball, but they did  not perform  significantly  more  head  movements  than  novices. Under  mental  fatigue,  skilled participants preserved their VEA patterns but required longer visual fixations, suggesting a reduced rate of information processing.

          "abstract": "Children’s first words are frequently recorded to be nouns, rather than verbs, but data from some languages (notably some Asian and African languages including Mandarin, Korean and Ngas) and some methodologies (especially spontaneous speech recordings) suggest that verbs can be represented as early as nouns. Variables that potentially impact early verb knowledge include the structure of the language children are learning and whether it is verb production or comprehension that is investigated. \nWe investigated longitudinal data from Kenya of children’s (N=500) vocabulary production and comprehension using Communicative Development Inventories (CDIs). Children’s caregivers completed overlapping inventories designed for younger infants (completed at age 12 months and designed for ages 8-16 months), and for older toddlers, (parallel forms completed at age 18 and 24 months and designed for ages 16-30 months). The inventories were structured to include words acquired at equivalent ages across word classes (e.g. nouns acquired at a median age of 11 months and verbs acquired at the same median age) but the interactions between word classes and children’s age and the modality in which they know the word (comprehension only or production as well) indicate that nouns and verbs do not follow the same trajectory across acquisition. Nouns emerge relatively earlier in production and comprehension while verbs emerge earlier in comprehension and their production increases as children grow older. \nWe conclude that the findings of Goldfield (2000) and of Stolt et al. (2008) are also true for these Bantu languages: that the noun advantage in early words is seen in studies where production is emphasised, and early verb knowledge can be missed if comprehension is not assessed.",

          "abstract": "Surprisingly few intervention approaches have been evaluated for youth negatively impacted by bullying, and only one known study has directly addressed the traumatic nature of these peer experiences. Thus, there is currently little guidance for practitioners working to address the mental health needs of this population in an individual therapy context. The current article presents a case report of an adolescent male with social anxiety and attention problems who had experienced chronic, severe bullying that had resulted in significant posttraumatic stress symptoms. It illustrates the process of implementing an adapted version of the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems (MATCH-ADTC) to address these presenting problems. Results demonstrate the potential utility of a modular cognitive-behavioral approach, as it effectively reduced the patient’s experiences of bullying as well as his symptoms of posttraumatic stress and social anxiety; high levels of treatment satisfaction were also reported by the patient and his caregiver. The current article highlights unique treatment considerations and challenges when providing mental health services for youth negatively impacted by bullying, emphasizing the need to help them develop coping skills and a plan for responding to aggressive peers and then the importance of trauma narration to reduce intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance symptoms and to process inaccurate and unhelpful (i.e., self-blaming) cognitions stemming from these experiences.",

          "abstract": "Psychological research increasingly uses situated measures, requiring intensive longitudinal and within-person methods. Such data are typically examined with multilevel models clustering multiple measurement time points within individuals. The intercorrelation patterns obtained with such multilevel models rely on various homogeneity assumptions that should be, but rarely are, tested before using multilevel modeling and interpreting the results.\nThis study proposes a five-step approach to systematically testing homogeneity assumptions in order to obtain more trustworthy estimates of associations among measures when examining clustered multilevel data.\nTo provide an educational illustration of this five-step approach, 1,028 experience sampling method surveys from 37 students were collected over one semester in one university lecture. Twenty-one items measured motivational components and academic emotions. Multilevel analyses estimated an overall within-person and an overall between-person network of zero-order correlations among motivation and emotion facets. Idiographic within-person networks of the 37 participants revealed substantial heterogeneity in their within-person intercorrelation patterns. Heterogeneity was further indicated by one third of the within-person correlations being bi- or multimodally distributed across individuals. We conclude that heterogeneity in within-person patterns must be examined, otherwise, methods relying on homogeneity assumptions, including multilevel analyses, may fail to describe many if not all individuals’ idiographic correlation patterns. This is crucial for the trustworthiness of measurement and structure models, the generalizability of ESM research, and any research aiming for personalized diagnostics and interventions.",

          "abstract": "This Registered Report pertains the face-name matching effect (Zwebner et al., 2017) according to which people can match the first name to an unknown target face above chance level. The purpose of the Registered Report was twofold: (i) to perform an independent conceptual replication of the face-name matching effect, and (ii) to establish the nature of the effect. To this end, undergraduate students were presented with uniform pictures of unfamiliar faces of similar age and ethnicity and asked to select these targets’ first names among two alternatives that were equated for length. Half of the trials constituted target trials, in which a face was accompanied by the true name of the depicted person and a filler name. The other half constituted sibling trials, in which a face was accompanied by the name of the same-sex sibling of the depicted person and a filler name. The target trials were meant to establish the generalizability of the face-name matching effect. If participants could reliably match a person’s true name to their face with these homogeneous materials, it would indicate that it is a pervasive effect that extends obvious ethnic, cultural, and zeitgeist differences. The sibling trials were meant to establish whether the effect extends to sibling names. If participants could also reliably match a face and the name of the depicted person’s sibling, it would indicate that we entertain stereotypes for types of names, of which individual names could be regarded tokens. Such a finding would be in line with predictions from the field of socio-onomastics, according to which names are vehicles for social meaning creation that are systematically governed by the socioeconomic characteristics of the name givers. If the face-name matching effect for target trials were to exceed that of sibling trials, this would constitute evidence that names also carry additional, individuating information. Our results provided no conclusive evidence in support of either the face-name matching effect or an analogous effect involving sibling names. Although participants’ accuracy in identifying true names and sibling names slightly exceeded chance, these effects were not statistically significant, and Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence. Moreover, no significant difference was found between performance on target versus sibling trials, and Bayesian analysis provided evidence in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference. These findings indicate constraints on the generalizability of the face-name matching effect and suggest that its emergence depends on the heterogeneity of the stimulus materials.",

          "abstract": "The adverse impacts of psychological stress during pregnancy are well established, with negative outcomes reported for both mothers and children. Intimate partner violence (IPV) represents a significant stressor, with high prevalence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In a high-adversity South African birth cohort, the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS), we prospectively investigated whether maternal exposure to IPV during pregnancy and in the first 2 years was associated with child brain structure at age 2-3 years. \n\n\n\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data was analysed from 171 children (n=70 exposed to prenatal IPV; n=55 to postnatal IPV). Regression modelling explored associations between IPV exposures and measures of brain structure derived using FreeSurfer. Voxel- and surface-based morphometry were conducted using Statistical Parametric Mapping to explore differences in cortical architecture. Analyses adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical confounding variables. \n\n\n\nBoth prenatal and postnatal IPV exposure were associated with increased mean cortical thickness (β=0.037, p=0.030, 95% CI [0.004, 0.070], and β=0.041, p=0.023, 95% CI [0.006, 0.074], respectively), when compared to unexposed controls. Exploratory analyses identified a prenatal IPV-by-child sex interaction in right medial orbitofrontal cortex thickness (p=0.025, FWE-corrected); with greater thickness in boys (β= 0.14, p=0.008, 95% CI [0.04 to 0.24]), but not girls (β=-0.04, p=0.44, 95% CI [-0.15 to 0.07]).\n\n\n\nEarly exposure to IPV may impact cortical structure in childhood, with potential sex-specific effects. These results emphasise the importance of addressing IPV as a public health priority to mitigate long-term impacts on child brain development.",

          "authors": "Jonas Schlicht; Thabo Joshua van Woudenberg; David Johannes Blok; Bojan Simoski; Moniek Buijzen",
          "abstract": "Engaging adolescents in digital environments is notoriously difficult. A common strategy is message personalization, yet most efforts focus on personalizing what is said rather than how it is expressed. This is a missed opportunity, as youth communication that truly speaks their language requires attention to style as well as content. Digital communication environments enable such stylistic adaptation by revealing users’ expression patterns that can be leveraged for personalization. Yet little is known about how adolescents respond to persuasive messages written in a similar linguistic style, or how such similarity is best operationalized. Addressing these gaps, this preregistered study tests whether adolescents prefer social media health messages that are more similar to their linguistic style and identifies which linguistic categories are most effective in eliciting positive responses. We analyzed donated WhatsApp conversation data from 191 Dutch adolescents (aged 13–15) to calculate individual linguistic profiles and design Instagram-style health messages that varied in linguistic similarity. Participants then evaluated 22 message pairs, each manipulating one linguistic category. Bayesian analyses yielded inconclusive evidence that linguistic similarity influenced message preference or personalization, and moderate evidence against effects on perceived effectiveness. However, adolescents consistently preferred messages that were positively valenced and low in complexity, regardless of linguistic similarity. These findings suggest that positive, easy-to-read messages may be an effective strategy for digital youth engagement. Furthermore, we discuss the implications for computer-mediated style matching, including algorithmic approaches, large language models, and future theoretical development.",

          "abstract": "Attachment orientations are theorized to change in response to significant\ninterpersonal life events. However, empirical findings remain mixed. Moreover, the role of\nsubjective event perceptions—though emphasized in personality research—has been largely\nbeen neglected in research on attachment development. In a longitudinal study spanning 7\nwaves over 2.5 years, we examined how romantic relationship transitions—entering or ending\na committed relationship—predict changes in attachment anxiety and avoidance, and whether\nthese effects are moderated by subjective event perceptions. We analyzed data of N = 1,717\nparticipants (69.6% women aged 18-40, M = 26.5 years) who were single (52%) or in a\npartnership (48%) at the beginning of the study. Using multilevel piecewise modeling, we\ndistinguished selection, anticipation, and socialization effects. Avoidant individuals were less\nlikely to enter new relationships (selection effect), and avoidance declined prior to partnering\n(anticipation effect). Both anxiety and avoidance shifted in response to transitions\n(socialization effects): anxiety decreased after partnering and increased after separation, while\navoidance showed a temporary decrease post-separation followed by a gradual increase.\nThese shifts mirrored average differences between partnered and single individuals,\nsuggesting rapid adaptation to new social roles. Subjective perceptions of the events (e.g.,\nvalence, social status decrease, predictability) showed limited moderation effects. Overall,\nfindings underscore the importance of social role transitions in shaping attachment processes,\nwhile suggesting that subjective evaluations may have a more nuanced role than previously\nassumed. These results contribute to personality theory by clarifying the contextual and\nexperiential mechanisms underlying intraindividual change in attachment insecurity.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",

          "abstract": "Understanding variability is a key focus in many areas of psychological research, with growing interest in modeling individual and group variability. While multilevel models such as heterogeneous variance models and Mixed-Effect Location Scale (MELS) models have been used to capture these dynamics, they typically rely on linear assumptions and temporal change of the variability is restricted to one level. Recent calls for nonlinear approaches in psychology highlight the need for more flexible models that can better account for complex, dynamic processes. This paper introduces the use of Gaussian Processes (GPs) within the framework of heterogeneous variance models to address these limitations. By incorporating GPs, we allow for the modeling of nonlinear variability across multiple levels, including temporal dynamics at both the individual and group levels. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in two empirical applications. Our findings show that using GPs provide an improved model fit compared to traditional linear methods and highlight the utility of GPs in variance modeling, offering new possibilities for studying dynamic and emergent processes in psychological and social science research.",

The goal is to identify dyslexia characteristics that are independent of bilingual experience and determine the appropriate tests for in bilinguals. Findings indicate that rapid naming and reading impairments remain prevalent in bilingual DRs while phonological awareness appears to be more variably impaired in bilinguals. Differences between monolinguals and bilinguals are more present in DRs than typical readers (TRs), suggesting that bilingual experience might play a more substantial role in populations with deficits. Results from predictive studies do not allow for evidence-based recommendations due to their variability. Overall, fndings suggest that some diagnostic tools retain cross-linguistic validity, while others’ prognostic potential may be modulated by bilingual experience. The results highlight the need for comprehensive assessments, considering linguistic profiles. Future research should adopt standardised definitions and tests, larger samples, and collaborative methods to improve diagnostic accuracy.",

          "abstract": "Social interactions can be deeply rewarding, yet they are marked by social uncertainty. The uncertainty arises because we can never truly know another’s mind. As a species, humans find uncertainty aversive and excessive. Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for emotional disorders. One way to resolve uncertainty in novel situations is to rely on memories of past similar experiences, yet this process is largely unexplored in social contexts. A novel social decision-making task showed that individuals recruit both memories and incremental experiences of social rewards to guide decisions under social uncertainty. Further, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed better integration of positive social memories if they also had high levels of autobiographical memory specificity. These findings suggest that successfully recalling past positive social experiences improves navigation of social uncertainty, and may confer preventative advantages for those with high levels of affective disorder symptoms.",

This is challenging for children as the underlying skills required to understand irony may not be fully developed. We investigated how 10-year-olds’ working memory, empathy skills, and gender are related to their processing and comprehension of written irony. Data from two previous eye-tracking experiments with 97 children (46 girls and 51 boys) were analysed. Results showed that children with stronger empathy skills had higher irony comprehension accuracy and were less likely to reread ironic phrases. Higher working memory was linked to faster processing of irony but did not lead to higher comprehension. Conversely, lower working memory was associated with more accurate irony comprehension. Child gender was not related to irony comprehension. These results imply that working memory and emotional perspective-taking are important for children's irony comprehension, aligning with theories that take individual differences into account.",

          "abstract": "The combination of high life satisfaction and frequent experiences of pleasant feelings is\nsometimes called hedonic wellbeing (HWB). We argue that a good life comprises more than\nhedonia and that a taxonomy of wellbeing should also include a eudaimonic dimension\n(EWB). The paper challenges a fundamental premise in research on wellbeing, which states\nthat self-reported life satisfaction provides an unbiased, broad, and reflected evaluation of an\nindividual’s life “as-a-whole.” Countering this assumption, two studies showed that HWB\nindicators differ from indicators of EWB, indicating that HWB does not measure EWB. Using\nsurvey experiments, the paper further demonstrated that, upon reflection, participants\ntypically regard eudaimonic values as more important than hedonic values, proposing that\nliving eudaimonically is important in people’s lives. A third finding showed that gaps\nbetween ideal and actual hedonic values predicted life satisfaction, whereas eudaimonic\nvalues gaps did not. This suggests that life satisfaction is not an unbiased evaluation of all the\nimportant values in a person’s life. Thus, measures of life satisfaction appear invalid (not\nmeasuring what they intend to measure). To get more relevant data on how well people\nconsider their lives to be, both hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions should be taken into\naccount.",

Our AQ version demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency, and a six-factor structure: Social Interests, Theory of Mind, Social Skills, Attention to Detail, Imagination, and Planning. The ASD group scored higher than the TD group on the total score and five subscales. Interactions between group and sex showed that sex differences appeared only within the ASD groups. Cut-off points showed good sensitivity, specificity, and discriminative properties for the Mexican population.

Using a multi-method approach that combined a controlled experiment with two large-scale natural experiments in over 160,000 U.S. college admissions essays, we observed a counterintuitive pattern: AI-assisted essays and essays written after the release of ChatGPT showed greater lexical diversity, but the increasingly diverse words actually expressed increasingly homogeneous ideas both within and across essays. This “paradoxical homogenization” pattern explained higher creativity ratings given to AI-generated essays than more idea-diverse human essays. Paradoxical homogenization was robust across demographic subgroups but emerged disproportionately among racial and linguistic minority applicants. Event-time analyses and robustness checks ruled out pre-existing trends and pandemic-related confounds. Results suggest that surface-level diversity of AI-generated content may mask deeper constraints on the breadth of human ideation.

Subsequent elaboration of a lower order structure based on the first three broader domains yielded seven additional factors: Fear and Somatoform, Thought Disorder, Suicide, Negative Affectivity, and Narcissism, resulting in a total of 11factors at the most nuanced level. Sequential hierarchical modeling iteratively traced the factor structure from one global psychopathology factor down to the 7-factor level, and subsequently, 11-factor level. Construct validity of the factor structures was evaluated via correlation and regression analyses using scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-3 (MMPI-3). These results yielded broad support for the convergent validity of the HiTOP-SR structure, as the various factors demonstrated meaningful associations with conceptually relevant MMPI-3 scale scores.

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

          "abstract": "Hyperglycemia affects cardiac activity at rest, but its effect on cardiac reactivity has not been investigated extensively. While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

          "abstract": "Parental rules have been curiously neglected from a conceptual and measurement perspective. The first half of this paper reviews the literature to show that there is no commonly used, standardized measure of rules. Rules are typically measured either with unvalidated ad hoc standalone items or incidentally measured with 1-2 items on multi-item scales assessing a broader parenting construct (e.g., discipline). Construct definitions are rarely stated, often circular, and inconsistent between authors. As a result, the empirical literature on parental rules is difficult to appraise and synthesize. The second half of this paper proposes a new framework for conceptualizing parental rules that includes an explicit, non-circular construct definition and delineates 7 dimensions along which a parental rule can vary. The framework is designed to be universally applicable across youth behaviors and scientific fields and enable a more rigorous science of parental rules.",

          "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges for humanity in this century. Communicating in a way that raises awareness of the risk climate changes poses while at the same time not inducing negative feelings, like helplessness, is a challenge. On one hand research has shown that emphasizing the severity of climate change is related to higher risk perception, which could lead to more pro-environmental behavior. On the other hand, it could trigger higher helplessness which is associated with lower motivation to act climate friendly. Previous research showed that controllability, leads to lower risk perception and lower learned helplessness. In our research we are investigating the impact of induced controllability of the consequences of climate change on risk perception and learned helplessness. To this end, we conducted two experiments with N = 216 and N = 489 (quota-based sample) participants in Germany. Participants received six climate change scenarios that differed only in induced controllability (high vs low). More specifically, we had four conditions: own control, control by government, hopeless, and a control condition. For both experiments results showed that participants’ risk perception increased after they read the scenarios, independent of the conditions. In Experiment 1 learned helplessness decreased, as expected, for the conditions with high controllability. Surprisingly, for Experiment 2 results showed an overall decrease of  learned helplessness independent of the controllability level. When adding participants’ ratings on the pro-environmental behavior scale (PEBS-C) as a moderator variable, results showed that those who had higher ratings on the PEBS-C scale reported higher levels of helplessness for the scenario with the lowest controllability, compared to the control group. Taken together, our results emphasize the importance of including solutions when addressing the negative impacts of climate change.",

          "abstract": "The scientific literature does not automatically correct itself. Unreliable findings may persist for years without correction or retraction. Following prior definitions of zombie articles that are retracted but continue to be cited affirmatively, we add another category of ‘undead’ articles. We define ‘vampire’ articles by two necessary conditions. The first condition is demonstrated irreproducibility, which we operationalize and define with the help of a novel typology of replication efforts. We propose a rule of thumb how many failed efforts at replication might be required for each type of replication effort before the original finding is deemed irreproducible. The second condition for a putative vampire article is that it is cited affirmatively in public policy the scientific literature, or private communications, after the first condition is met. We discuss rules of thumb for how many such affirmative citations might lead qualified researchers in that subfield to address the article of concern within the scientific literature. We surmise that a substantial number of vampire articles exist as our two cases resemble those criticized in a growing literature addressing problematic science and the reproducibility crisis. Our first case concerns aerial gunning of coyotes and the second case predicts over-fishing. We discuss the damaging effects of vampire articles and why the melodramatic metaphor has heuristic value and utility. We also discuss lessons from the communication sciences about how to remedy misinformation, offering recommendations to researchers, publishers and editors, all of whom share an interest in rigorous inquiry and public trust in science.",

Recently, interest has turned towards emotional processing and mental health correlates, including a qualitative account of the mental healthcare experiences of aphantasic people. Still, a systematic presentation of what it is like to live with aphantasia is lacking. We gathered the data of 52 aphantasic adults (mean VVIQ [Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire] score = 16.5, age range = 16 – 81, 14 women, 20 UK residents and 18 USA residents) from a larger sample of 6436 online survey respondents, and thematically analysed their answers to the survey’s open-ended items alongside additional unprompted testimonies provided via email. We identified 4 main themes: (1) Communicating and Understanding the “mind’s eye” in a world of visualisers; (2) The diverse experience of knowing without seeing and search for imagery; (3) The protective &amp; disruptive ways that aphantasia shapes life and thoughts; (4) The search for meaning. The study draws on the voices and experiences of aphantasic people to explore the psychosocial correlates of aphantasia. We describe how the absence of mental imagery is not merely a perceptual variation, but a significant dimension of human difference with implications for clinical practice, education, creativity, and self-understanding.",

Existing evidence suggests that these extreme groups are heterogeneous. After re-examining and largely replicating previously reported differences between people with aphantasia and hyperphantasia in 6436 online respondents, we investigate whether the variable features of aphantasia cluster in distinct subtypes. We conducted a latent class analysis with a subset of 3883 respondents who completed key measures of imagery (Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire) and self-reported cognitive experiences (sensory imagery, autobiographical memory, face recognition, spatial navigation). 3 subtypes of aphantasia emerge: 1) a ‘global aphantasia’ subtype with extreme sensory features in most to all sensory modalities; 2) an ‘Aphantasia +’ subtype with both sensory and cognitive features in the domains listed above; and 3) a ‘non-global aphantasia’ subtype with milder uni- or multisensory features. Our findings confirm the heterogeneous nature of aphantasia, with subtypes varying alongside 3 dimensions: number (and type) of sensory modalities experiencing low imagery, the intensity of aphantasia in the concerned sensory modalities (total lack of versus poor imagery), and the presence or absence of additional cognitive difficulties outwith sensory imagery. Together, these findings call for a shift in the theoretical and methodological approaches to aphantasia and imagery research.",

          "abstract": "While global challenges demand both equitable and effective altruism, people often prioritize those nearby and overlook the impact of their prosocial actions. Here, we examined what moral values support altruism that is both equitable (helping others impartially regardless of proximity or group membership) and effective (helping impactfully by maximizing welfare gains). We studied two rare populations: effective altruists (EAs; N = 119), defined by their philosophical commitment to impartiality and maximizing impact, and extraordinary altruists (XAs; N = 65), defined by their real-world decision to donate an organ to a stranger—an act of radical impartiality, though not explicitly impact-maximizing. A demographically similar general population sample (N = 176) served as a comparison group. Participants completed moral measures from pluralistic theories (i.e., Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), Morality-as-Cooperation Questionnaire (MAC-Q)), along with the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), and the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS). They also completed assessments of equitable, effective, and combined altruistic orientations. Both altruistic groups showed elevated moral expansiveness (MES) and impartial beneficence \n(OUS) relative to controls. EAs, compared to XAs and controls, more strongly endorsed utilitarian principles (including instrumental harm on the OUS) and deprioritized traditional cooperative values (e.g., reciprocity, deference on the MAC-Q). Familial loyalty (MAC-Q) negatively predicted altruistic orientations across groups. Surprisingly, group loyalty—conceptualized as parochial by pluralistic moral theories—positively predicted equitable and effective altruism across groups, challenging assumptions that parochial values necessarily constrain prosociality. These findings instead suggest inclusive forms of loyalty may help promote altruism that is both equitable and effective.",

          "abstract": "AI-mediated therapy systems simulate empathy, attunement, and conversational responsiveness, producing a sentience halo: the user’s perception of emergent AI awareness. This effect is driven by unopposed mirroring, where the AI reflects users’ language, affect, and cognitive-emotional patterns without challenge, fostering reliance and displacing aspects of self onto the system. Over time, Doppelgänger Drift can destabilize identity and relational scaffolding. Drawing on anecdotal reports, media accounts, and usage metrics, this paper outlines structural risks of AI therapy, including loss of containment, mirages of alliance, and accumulation of ambiguous harm. I also examine legal, medical, and societal considerations, and propose guardrails emphasizing transparency, limits disclosure, and research priorities for monitoring identity-level impacts. This framework offers a conceptual lens for understanding AI-mediated identity risk and aims to inform both clinical practice and policy development.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "The profession of psychology aims to improve societal mental health and well-being. Ironically, psychologists have neglected the study of mental health within the profession. We conducted the first comprehensive assessment of mental health difficulties across psychology disciplines in a sample (N = 1,261) of faculty and graduate students affiliated with U.S. doctoral degree granting institutions. Over 84% of respondents reported a lifetime history of mental health difficulties; 54% reported a lifetime diagnosis; 15% had clinically elevated current depression symptoms; 16% reported clinically elevated current anxiety symptoms; and 51% met Keyes’ “flourishing” criteria. The most common mental health concerns were depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Across all outcomes, graduate students reported significantly greater frequency and severity of difficulties. Clinically elevated current depression and anxiety were 3-4 times higher in graduate students (21% and 22%, respectively) compared to professor-level faculty (6% and 7%, respectively). Rates of flourishing were lower in graduate students than faculty (OR = 2.65, p &lt; .001). Clinical-area respondents (92%) were more likely to report a lifetime mental health difficulty than non-clinical area respondents (83%). Interestingly, while there were no field-level differences in rates of current elevated anxiety, clinical-area respondents had lower rates of clinically elevated depression. Academic psychology is not an exception to the mental health crisis in higher education. Particularly urgent action is needed to improve graduate students’ mental health.

          "abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: Access to specialized healthcare for children with autism spectrum disorder has long been hindered by limited availability of qualified clinicians, particularly in rural and economically disadvantaged areas. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these disparities, overwhelming traditional healthcare models and highlighting the need for innovative solutions. Telehealth emerged as a critical tool during the pandemic, facilitating continued access to care, particularly for underserved populations. We aimed to investigate the extent to which functional language deficits can be identified and assessed in children with autism, and ruled out in neurotypical children, via telehealth. \nMethods: This study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using telehealth for assessing verbal behavior deficits in children diagnosed with autism, comparing them to neurotypical peers, and exploring the potential for telehealth to expand access to specialized intervention. Twelve children, seven of whom had an autism diagnosis, participated in telehealth-based functional analyses of verbal behavior. \nResults: Results indicated that children with autism exhibited statistically significant differences in across functional language domains, whereas no such differences were identified in neurotypical peers. No false positives or false negatives were detected. At follow-up, participants with autism showed statistically significant improvements in verbal language skills. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that telehealth is a reliable and valid method for assessing the verbal behavior of children with autism. This research supports the use of telehealth to bridge healthcare gaps for families in remote or underserved areas. By providing an accessible platform for functional language assessment, telehealth offers a promising avenue for enhancing early intervention and improving long-term outcomes. \nImplications: Our findings highlight the importance of individualized interventions to address verbal behavior deficits of children with autism. Future research is necessary to explore the scalability of these findings and their application in broader, more diverse populations.",

Furthermore, we replicated a previous finding that increased visual perceptual load in a scene reduces eyewitness recall accuracy, but observed this effect in the Laboratory group only. In Study 2, we added a General Online group to test whether these differences extended to all online data collection, or if they were specific to Prolific participants. Misinformation susceptibility in the General Online group was similar to the Laboratory group, and significantly lower than that in the Prolific group. However, perceptual load effects were also absent in the General Online group. Ultimately, these findings indicate that different data collection contexts yield varying results in eyewitness misinformation studies.

Proliferating ToCs accumulate anomalies without progress, operating orthogonally. The principle of recurrency – functional and architectural – offers a unifying, mechanistic scaffold for consciousness to arise. We show that all theories tacitly invoke feedback loops and can be re-expressed along a single axis of recursion. Four nested levels, viz., cellular, local inter-areal, global, and lateral, map onto state, phenomenal content, manipulative access, and experiential similarity, respectively, thus tying evolved anatomy to phenomenon. The traditional phenomenal-versus-access stand-off dissolves into a graded cascade wherein deeper recursion expands the set of reportable, behaviour-driving variables. Recurrence is favoured evolutionarily, and ontologically, rebutting feed-forward, “unfolding” objections, while brain-body loops ground selfhood, and complete action loops with the environment. Furthermore, clinically, targeting recurrent pathways promise new biomarkers, and alleviation, in disorders of consciousness (DoCs).

Although \ndeficits in emotion recognition are well-documented in dementia, they have received less \nattention in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Due to the overlap in neural processes supporting \nemotion and cognition, early disruptions in emotion recognition may indicate broader functional \ndecline. This study examined behavioral and neural responses to emotional faces in patients with \nMCI using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. For that aim, N=60 \nparticipants were recruited, including 30 patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls. During fMRI, \nparticipants completed a facial emotion recognition task with expressions of anger, fear, sadness, \nhappiness, and neutral faces. Behavioral assessments further included measures of cognitive \ndomains (attention, memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial skills), face \nprocessing, emotional intelligence, and emotional interference. Patients with MCI showed \nimpaired recognition of negative emotions, such as anger (β=–0.37, p&lt;0.05), fear (β=–0.37, \np&lt;0.05), and sadness (β=–0.85, p&lt;0.001), whereas recognition of happiness remained intact. \nSadness recognition was predicted by face processing ability, and overall emotion recognition was \nassociated with memory performance. fMRI results showed widespread, emotion-specific \nactivation in healthy controls, particularly in occipital, frontal, and subcortical regions. Patients \nwith MCI showed reduced activation and less differentiated patterns, though group-level BOLD \ndifferences were not statistically significant.

          "abstract": "Recent research has implicated the implicit learning of statistical regularities as a potential factor contributing to reading deficits in individuals with dyslexia. These deficits are characterized by weaker neural adaptation compared to typically developing readers, suggesting impaired general processing in forming short-term representations of stimulus consistency. In addition, inconsistent findings have been observed regarding amplitude differences in mismatch negativity (MMN) between individuals with and without dyslexia. Although neural adaptation is believed to contribute to MMN, these two processes have been examined in separate bodies of literature, leaving their relationship in children with and without dyslexia unclear. To address this issue, 42 children with Chinese dyslexia and 26 children without dyslexia participated in an EEG roving paradigm experiment with continuous pure-tone stimuli. Importantly, the stimuli were carefully arranged to minimize expectations and isolate pure adaptation effects. The initial adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the deviants and the 2nd tones) and subsequent adaptation (i.e., the peak amplitude difference between the 2nd tones and the final tones) effects, including P1a, P1b, and N250, as well as the amplitudes of MMN and late MMN, were extracted. We found that both groups exhibited similar adaptation effects, MMN, and late MMN, supported by minimal evidence for differences in our Bayesian analyses. The relationship between adaptation and MMN was also comparable between the groups. Potential reasons for discrepancies between this study and previous research, including experimental design and language differences, are discussed.",

          "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in the field of science of learning is to ensure that findings are adopted by policy makers and practitioners and translated into the classroom. To address the question of why challenges persist, five heads of research labs involved in the science of learning from three different countries (the United Kingdom, France, and Chile) conducted a workshop to discuss challenges for the science of learning field. Thematic analysis was conducted on presentation slides and discussion notes, and the themes were organised around an adapted five-dimensional gaps framework by Miles (2017) to produce a gap analysis. Current gaps were identified in relation to: 1) existing theory and knowledge; 2) the research-practice divide; 3) research methodologies; 4) empirical testing and evidence verification; and 5) research with specific populations. Examples from work across the labs were used to represent international perspectives on challenges and evidence possible solutions. Some of the key takeaways and strategies for surmounting these gaps included the need for funding to research lesser-studied areas and populations, to replicate or repeat intervention evaluations, and to establish meaningful co-produced research partnerships between educators and research institutions.",

Although existing literature has examined autistic people’s views on camouflaging, it rarely explores these perspectives through natural conversations outside of research settings. To address this gap, we analyzed autistic people’s perception of camouflaging based on online discussions between autistic people.\nMethodology\nThis study examined 194 posts from 68 users on a UK-based autism forum, employing inductive thematic analysis to identify key aspects of camouflaging.\nFindings\nThe analysis revealed a predominantly negative view of camouflaging, with most users employing it primarily for social integration, especially in work settings. The most reported consequence was exhaustion. Not camouflaging leads to improved mental health, but also potentially to rejection.\nOriginality\nOur findings strengthen existing knowledge about camouflaging by adding new analysis conducted directly on conversations happening organically. Future research should collect more data from natural conversations to validate these results and consider diverse sources of autistic individuals' perspectives.\nKeywords: social camouflaging, masking, autism spectrum disorder, web forum, perception",

          "abstract": "Encountering a homonym in a sentential context that biases interpretation towards its subordinate meaning makes that meaning easier to access later. This word-meaning priming effect is not restricted to homonyms and may be supported by general episodic memory processes. Such an account predicts that word-meaning priming may be affected by factors that affect episodic learning (e.g., predictability). Specifically, the contextual predictability of an incoming stimulus has been shown to affect episodic memory in that both highly expected as well as highly unexpected input leads to better memory for that input, via two different underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. We hypothesised that if word-meaning priming is supported by episodic memory processes, both highly expected as well as highly unexpected target words should lead to stronger word-meaning priming effects than target words of intermediate predictability. Four pre-registered online experiments tested whether contextual predictability affects word-meaning priming and incidental memory for language. We exposed participants to sentences that emphasised a particular aspect of a sentence-final target word’s meaning. Importantly, target words differed in how predictable they were based on the sentence context (e.g., “You can get in a good workout by riding a bicycle” vs. “You can get in a good workout by lifting a bicycle”). Associate production and semantic relatedness judgement assessed the strength of word-meaning priming. Contrary to our hypotheses, while there was evidence for priming across experiments, we found no significant effects of contextual predictability in any experiments. Our findings suggest that predictability-guided updating is rarely triggered during language comprehension, and we outline the theoretical implications of these results for the architecture of the language system.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAttachment style is widely recognised as influential in shaping responses to bereavement and prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Although theorised extensively, empirical clarity regarding how attachment styles specifically impact PGD symptoms and therapeutic implications remains limited. This study aimed to identify cognitive-behavioural mechanisms linking attachment styles to PGD symptoms.\nMethods\nData were collected from a community sample of 695 bereaved adults. Network analysis explored interactions between attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) and various cognitive-behavioural factors associated with PGD, including appraisals, memory characteristics, maladaptive coping strategies, and social disconnection.\nResults\nThe findings reveal attachment styles as peripheral within the network, suggesting that their direct influence on PGD symptoms may be less central than previously theorised. However, anxious attachment correlated positively with injustice rumination and altered social self, while avoidant attachment was positively associated with perceived loss of future and relationships and preferences for solitude, and negatively associated with proximity-seeking behaviours and fear of losing connection to the deceased. Cognitive-behavioural factors, particularly memory characteristics and social disconnection, held central positions within the network, mediating relationships between attachment styles and PGD.\nConclusions\nAttachment styles indirectly influence PGD through cognitive-behavioural pathways rather than exerting strong direct effects. By bridging the gap between attachment theory and cognitive-behavioural approaches to grief, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of its relationship with PGD, and points towards potential new avenues for future interventions aimed at addressing attachment-related challenges in bereaved individuals.",

          "abstract": "Representational gestures have been shown to be beneficial for speech comprehension especially in adverse listening conditions, as they provide meaningful information related to speech. However, it is still unclear whether seeing representational gestures directs additional attention towards the speech signal. \nIn the current study, we addressed this research question by investigating neural tracking of speech in the presence of representational gestures during unscripted dialogue with and without background noise. Dyads performed a tangram-based referential communication task, while audio-visual behavior and dual-EEG were recorded.  \nRepresentational gestures increased neural tracking of speech in both delta and theta frequencies and in both dialogue conditions in comparison to control movements. This finding suggests that seeing representational gestures directs attention to the processing of both acoustic and linguistic information of the speech signal. As no differences in neural tracking of speech were observed between dialogue conditions, we believe that dyads made use of different strategies to overcome the noise interference. In sum, we argue that neural tracking of speech represents a flexible mechanism which can be modulated by attentional processes to meet different cognitive and communicative demands during face-to-face interaction.",

          "abstract": "Well-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.",

          "abstract": "Situations change over time, and so does our experience of them. For example, a task may initially feel engaging but can, over time, become monotonous and boring. Similarly, as processing demands increase or one’s momentary capabilities decline, the same task can feel more or less effortful. The dynamics of these task-induced sensations matter because boredom and perceived effort shape behavior by driving optimization of resource utilization. Time is among the most fundamental resources to which people tend to be acutely sensitive across contexts. Here, we propose that the sensations of boredom and effort influence how the passing of time is experienced. Specifically, both states are linked to changes in interoception—the perception of internal bodily signals—which is known to play a key role in time perception. This proposal offers a framework for understanding how fundamental regulatory sensations, such as boredom and effort, shape temporal experience through interoceptive mechanisms. We highlight the insular cortex as a potential hub mediating the effects of interoceptive signals on time perception, integrating feelings of boredom and effort, and their influence on the experience of time.",

          "authors": "Mauricio Martins; Dan Cook; Arno Villringer",
          "abstract": "The capacity to represent recursive hierarchical embedding (RHE) is considered a hallmark of human cognition. Yet, it remains debated whether non-linguistic recursion depends on language-specific, domain-general, or independent visuospatial mechanisms. In two experiments, we tested this question using a dual-task paradigm. Participants performed either a visual recursion task (REC) or a matched visual iteration task (ITE) while concurrently engaging in lexical retrieval (LEX), serial arithmetic (MATH), visual delayed match-to-sample (VIS), or no interference (NONE). Both LEX and MATH—tasks that require serial, symbolic, generative processing—reliably reduced accuracy in REC and ITE, with interference being stronger for ITE. Drift diffusion modeling confirmed that LEX and MATH slowed evidence accumulation and reduced decision thresholds, indicating less efficient and more impulsive responding. Interestingly, while LEX and MATH lengthened response times in ITE, they shortened them in REC, suggesting compensatory processing strategies. By contrast, VIS did not impair accuracy; instead, it increased drift and boundary separation, consistent with more cautious evidence accumulation. Cognitive covariates further revealed that verbal working memory predicted REC more strongly than ITE under baseline conditions; however, this advantage did not account for the greater interference observed in ITE. Taken together, these findings suggest that visual hierarchical processing involves serial symbolic resources, but recursion is more resilient than iteration, possibly due to the availability of parallel or configural strategies. This supports a hybrid architecture in which linguistic-like symbolic operations contribute to building visual hierarchies, but alternative mechanisms can buffer recursion when these resources are taxed.",

To date, these side effects have primarily been assessed through self-report measures, limiting insight into the underlying mechanisms. This study aims to investigate behavioral and emotional responses to varying levels of social provocation and the associated neural processes in epilepsy patients, using a modified version of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP) during functional MRI (fMRI).\nMethods: We included 38 epilepsy patients and 38 healthy controls with no significant difference in age or gender. All participants completed the modified TAP during fMRI scanning, consisting of three blocks with low, medium, and high provocation level defined by the amount of monetary punishment selected by a fictitious opponent. After each block, participants rated their emotional states and fairness perception. Additionally, they completed standardized psychological questionnaires assessing trait aggression (BPAQ), depressive symptoms (BDI), and impulsivity (BIS). \nResults: Despite higher self-reported trait aggression in patients, no significant group differences were observed in behavioral aggression. Compared to healthy controls, patients exhibited increased neural activity in regions associated with emotional regulation and cognitive control (e.g. Superior Parietal Lobule, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Superior Frontal Gyrus) in response to low provocation. However, they demonstrated diminished sensitivity to escalating provocation at both neural and emotional levels.\nSignificance: The findings emphasize the need for a broader perspective that addresses the internal burden of emotional regulation and the associated neural mechanisms when being provoked, not just overt behavior. We highlight the importance of minor provocations in distinguishing patients from healthy control. Although no clear mechanism for a specific type of medication could be identified, the results indicate a potential impact of antiseizure medications. \n\nKeywords: fMRI; taylor aggression paradigm; provocation; depression; antiseizure medication; adverse effects",

Chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and cancer require continuous adjustment to medical and lifestyle demands, often resulting in psychological strain. Research consistently shows elevated rates of depression and anxiety among individuals with chronic illness compared to the general population. Key mediators of this connection include stress, sleep quality, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and access to healthcare. In rural communities, these challenges are intensified by limited health infrastructure, geographic isolation, financial constraints, and stigma surrounding mental health. This paper emphasizes the need for integrated care models that address both physical and psychological aspects of chronic illness. Expanding early intervention, reducing stigma, and improving access to mental health services in underserved populations are essential steps toward enhancing quality of life for individuals with chronic illness.",

While men reported greater habitual suppression than women on trait questionnaires, no such gender difference emerged in momentary reports of suppression in everyday contexts. Additionally, there were no gender differences in the types of emotion suppressed (overall negative emotion, anger, and sadness).

          "abstract": "Absence from school has wide-ranging and enduring negative consequences for individuals and society. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been a pervasive concern and key educational research priority in many countries around the world. Using data from the #BeeWell survey and linked administrative records for N=28,293 pupils aged 12-16 attending 71 secondary schools in Hampshire and Southampton (England) during the 2023/24 academic year, we conducted Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct longitudinal patterns of attendance and estimate key predictors of latent class membership. Analysis revealed four distinct patterns of attendance: Consistently High (91.8%); Declining (3.8%); Rising (2.3%); and Persistently Low (2.1%). Consistent with bioecological systems theory, we found that socioeconomic deprivation, poorer mental and physical health, weaker school belonging, and increased exposure to peer and academic pressures significantly increased the likelihood of following sub-optimal attendance trajectories (relative to the Consistently High attendance class). Likewise, those with Special Educational Needs (SEN; compared to those without SEN) and White British pupils (compared to their peers from minoritised ethnic groups) were more likely to follow sub-optimal trajectories. Findings reveal heterogeneity in post-pandemic attendance patterns with implications for multi-tiered interventions. Universal approaches should foster a strong sense of school belonging, while early warning systems should integrate psychosocial indicators such as school pressure, internalising symptoms and exposure to bullying. Identification of a Rising trajectory suggests potential for positive change through targeted support and underscores the importance of implementing effective educational psychology interventions to reverse long-lasting impact of COVID-19 on secondary school attendance.",

Controlling for a large set of technology-related, political, and socio-demographic factors, we further find that perceiving AI as labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) is associated with lower satisfaction with democracy and political engagement with technology. Drawing on nationally representative, preregistered experimental data (N = 400; United States), we provide causal evidence for this relationship. Participants exposed to a labor-replacing (vs. labor-creating) AI frame report greater erosion of trust in democratic institutions and lower willingness to politically engage with future AI developments. Together, our findings suggest that perceptions about AI’s labor market consequences—regardless of actual outcomes—may erode democratic legitimacy and discourage public involvement in shaping the future of AI.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between visual processing and fencing performance, focusing on various gaze behaviour indices in a dynamic and interactive sport. Visual processing, particularly the ability to gather and use visual information quickly and accurately, is critical for performance in high-speed sports. We hypothesised that visual behaviour, including the duration of the final fixation (Quiet Eye; QE), the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations, significantly impacts fencing performance during offensive and defensive actions. National-level sabre fencers performed a ten-minute assault with eye-tracking technology measuring their gaze behaviour. Results indicated that QE was significantly longer before successful touches compared to unsuccessful ones (t(9) = 2.61, p =.014, dz = 0.83). Additionally, the number of fixations and the number of scanned locations were higher during defensive actions than offensive actions (all ts(9) &gt; 4.34, ps ≤ .001, dzs&gt; 1.37). This research provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying sports performance in a realistic context and has implications for training strategies, emphasising the importance of various visual behaviour patterns in fencing.",

          "abstract": "Adopting a vegetarian diet represents a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation, which involves repeated decisions in favour of the environment. This makes vegetarians a relevant group for studying the cognitive mechanisms underlying pro-environmental decision-making. In this study, vegetarians and non-vegetarians completed a decision-making task involving real trade-offs between financial rewards and carbon emissions, with information acquisition tracked using MouselabWEB. We found that vegetarians exhibited a greater propensity to select the pro-environmental option in the task than non-vegetarians. This group difference was particularly found when decisions entailed high personal costs, low environmental benefits, or uncertain outcomes. Process-tracing data further revealed that vegetarians consistently prioritized environmental information from the outset and throughout the decision process. This attentional focus significantly predicted pro-environmental choices. Overall, the findings suggest that vegetarians may rely on a principled decision-making style that transcends cost–benefit considerations, offering new insights into the cognitive basis of pro-environmental engagement.",

          "authors": "Natalia Khodayari; Howard Egeth; susan courtney",
          "abstract": "Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates the persistent myth that publication bias contaminates (indeed, possibly inflates) the scientific evidence for parapsychological phenomena, specifically extrasensory perception (ESP). We analyzed 165 published studies (243 experiments) from recent ESP meta-analyses and 40 preregistered confirmatory experiments from the Koestler Parapsychology Unit Registry. We compared these two datasets to datasets from the field of mainstream psychology. Our primary measure was the percentage of experiments reporting statistically significant positive outcomes (p &lt; .05, one-tailed). Results indicate that the rate of positive outcomes in ESP research is considerably lower than that observed in psychology, for both non-preregistered and preregistered experiments. While the bias is substantially smaller, suggesting more balanced reporting of parapsychological outcomes compared to mainstream psychological research, we cannot conclusively show that the statistical evidence for ESP is not an artifact of that relatively minimal bias, but several earlier tests on the file-drawer problem do undermine that assumption.",

Schema Therapy offers a related framework, proposing that the state expression of early maladaptive schemas—dysfunctional emotional and cognitive patterns formed in response to adverse experiences— are represented by schema modes.  These modes represent distinct parts of the self, such as vulnerable child parts, coping parts, critical parent parts, and healthy adult parts, which influence moment-to-moment experiences. This exploratory qualitative study investigated whether the content of voices experienced by voice-hearers maps onto schema modes as described in Schema Therapy. Method: Seven participants took part in semi-structured interviews exploring the characteristics and content of their voices. Interview transcripts were coded according to established schema mode definitions and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Results: Results indicated that most participants described voices that could be classified within the schema mode framework, with dysfunctional parent modes being the most frequently identified. Conclusions: These findings offer preliminary support for using Schema Therapy concepts to better understand and potentially treat distressing voices, suggesting value in further exploring this approach in clinical settings.",

This study introduces the concept of \"Thoughts on Eating\" (ToE) as a foundational framework for understanding individual eating attitudes and behaviors. ToE captures diverse perspectives on food and eating, ranging from health maintenance to emotional and social dimensions.\nIn this study, we developed and validated the Thoughts on Eating Scale (ToES), a 20-item scale with seven factors: “enriching one’s heart”, “encouraging social communication”, “realizing oneself”, “sustaining oneself”, ”respecting food”, “indifference to eating”, and “disliking eating.” Then, we confirmed its reliability and validity, including concurrent validity with Expanded Mindful Eating Scale (EMES) and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and reasonable results were obtained. Moreover, we investigated the associations of ToES with sociodemographis and eating behaviors, and some meaningful and understandable relationships were observed.\nThe ToES also revealed meaningful associations between individual traits, eating attitudes, and behaviors, offering insights into both everyday eating patterns and disordered eating tendencies. This ToE framework along with a robust tool provides for examining the psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of eating, paving the way for future research and interventions to address diverse eating behaviors in modern society.",

DSHM is a class of memory models used to model human performance in game play, memory tasks, and language learning. The ability to detect and predict patterns is an integral part of memory models and an important part of decision making. However, decision making also requires the ability to evaluate states as more or less desirous in order to motivate the decisions. We apply a DSHM model to the decision-making task of Walsh and Anderson (2011). By initializing memory to a state of optimism and by making the model sensitive to dependencies between non-consecutive events, we find that the model is able to learn the task at a rate similar to humans.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "abstract": "Across cultures and development, humans can extract proportional quantities from nonsymbolic, visual displays. Two competing accounts have been proposed for the contributions of these nonsymbolic skills to fraction understanding. The shared-magnitude account suggests that a cognitive system responsible for these nonsymbolic skills is foundational for symbolic fraction learning, predicting that neural patterns of fraction skills resemble magnitude-driven neural responses to continuous depictions, like unsegmented bars, that emphasize proportional magnitude. However, other depictions of proportions, like discretized, segmented bars, convey both proportional and whole-number information. The shared-interference account proposes that the interference from whole-number information in discretized proportions and symbolic fractions drives the link between these skills and predicts that neural responses to fraction magnitudes would strongly relate to overall activity to discretized depictions, particularly those with misleading whole-number information. We leveraged representational similarity analyses (RSA) to test these predictions. Nineteen young adults (mean age=23.26 years) compared proportions depicted in continuous, discretized, and symbolic formats. Univariate results indicated robust neural distance effects in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions across formats. Region of interest (ROI) analyses of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) revealed neural rational distance effects for continuous proportions, whereas for discretized and symbolic fractions, only comparisons with whole-number interference exhibited a rational magnitude signal. Critically, RSA demonstrated that the IPS fraction magnitude-related activity showed greater similarity with discretized brain responses than continuous ones, but only in the context of misleading whole-number information. Together, these findings support a combination of the two accounts and suggest that symbolic fraction proficiency, as well as adept discretized proportional reasoning, involves accessing proportional magnitude code despite the presence of misleading whole-number information.",

Successful encoding requires the structure of the data to be orthogonal to the structure of the Latin squares.

          "abstract": "We describe the DSHM (Dynamically Structured Holographic Memory) model of human memory, which uses high dimensional vectors to represent items in memory. The complexity and intelligence of human behavior can be attributed, in part, to our ability to utilize vast knowledge acquired over a lifetime of experience with our environment. Thus models of memory, particularly models that can scale up to lifetime learning, are critical to modeling human intelligence. DHSM is based on the BEAGLE model of language acquisition (Jones and Mewhort, 2007) and extends this type of model to general memory phenomena. We demonstrate that DHSM can model a wide variety of human memory effects. Specifically, we model the fan effect, the problem size effect (from math cognition), dynamic game playing (detecting sequential dependencies from memories of past moves), and time delay learning (using an instance based approach). This work suggests that DSHM is suitable as a basis for learning both over the short-term and over the lifetime of the agent, and as a basis for both procedural and declarative memory. We argue that cognition needs to be understood at both the symbolic and sub-symbolic levels, and demonstrate that DSHM intrinsically operates at both of these levels of description. In order to situate DSHM in a familiar context, we discuss the relationship between DHSM and ACT-R.",

We prove that MINERVA 2, a separate storage model of long-term memory, is mathematically equivalent to composite storage memory implemented as a fourth order tensor, and approximately equivalent to a fourth-order tensor compressed into a holographic vector. Building of these demonstrations, we show that MINERVA 2 and related separate storage models can be implemented in neurons.

Unlike traditional marginal DIF methods, which often fail to capture the effects of intersecting identities and require large samples, InterDIFNet models uniform and non-uniform DIF across multiple intersectional groups simultaneously. The method utilizes an optimized thresholding procedure to balance power and Type I error control. A Monte Carlo simulation compared InterDIFNet to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) test and other intersectional DIF methods across varying sample sizes, numbers of groups, and DIF prevalence rates. Results show that when trained using TLP features, InterDIFNet consistently achieved higher power than TLP while maintaining comparable Type I error control, particularly in scenarios with three or more intersectional groups. An empirical application to real assessment data further demonstrated the method’s practical utility. InterDIFNet provides a scalable, data-driven solution for identifying intersectional DIF across multiple small sample groups.",

          "abstract": "Semantic priming in lexical decision tasks has long provided evidence for automatic spreading activation, yet questions remain about how robust these effects are across different research contexts. The present study compared priming outcomes for undergraduates tested in the laboratory and participants recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk in the early 2010s, using a Qualtrics-based lexical decision task. Reaction times (RTs) were trimmed at ±3 SD within participants, and accuracy was calculated as the proportion correct. A mixed-design ANOVA revealed the expected main effect of prime type, with both groups showing the classic hierarchy of associated &lt; unassociated &lt; nonword stimuli. Within each setting, planned comparisons confirmed a full three-level gradient, underscoring the robustness of semantic priming even when measured online with tools not optimized for RT accuracy. A small but reliable interaction indicated that the overall priming span (nonword − associated difference) was larger for lab participants (M = 0.25 s) than online participants (M = 0.17 s), Hedges’ g = 0.50. Contrary to predictions, accuracy was significantly higher for online participants (M = .93) than lab participants (M = .89), g = −0.76. Perceptions of being observed did not differ between settings. Although the study was not preregistered, all data, materials, and analysis scripts are openly shared. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that semantic priming replicates robustly across both laboratory and early online contexts, highlight a modest laboratory advantage in effect magnitude, and illustrate how basic cognitive phenomena can withstand technically imperfect measurement conditions.",

          "abstract": "Most cigarette smokers say that they want to quit, but few attempts at smoking cessation are successful. To examine factors predicting the ability to quit, researchers have examined various behaviors. Heightened delay discounting, preference for smaller, sooner rewards over larger, later rewards, has been associated with a heightened probability of relapse. The current study examined whether this extended to short-term laboratory-based smoking lapse protocols, and whether probability discounting (preference for smaller, certain rewards over larger, uncertain rewards) showed similar effects. Participants were 32 adult smokers contemplating cessation, who attended two experimental sessions. Tasks required participants to choose between money available now and either $25 available later (0-365 days) or with less certainty (0-100%). Participants were then given a 2-hour window when they could either smoke or receive progressively more money over time. Time before smoking was recorded as their “lapse time”. Steeper delay discounting predicted shorter lapse times, while probability discounting was unrelated. These data suggest that delay discounting may be related to the inability to maintain abstinence over short time periods not just days and weeks during smoking cessation, thereby contributing to heightened smoking associated with heightened delay discounting. They also support the independence of probability discounting from substance use phenotypes.",

          "abstract": "Disruptive behavior in classrooms is a risk factor for students’ learning and well-being as well as for teachers’ well-being and stress. This study examined the effect of a classroom management intervention on students’ and teachers’ perceptions of the classroom behavioral climate in 85 classrooms from Grades 3–4 (1,442 students, 88 teachers) over a 12-week study period. Additionally, we investigated whether the 5-week intervention had secondary effects on students’ and teachers’ self-efficacy and well-being. Both students and teachers reported improvements in students’ concentration on learning and a decrease in classroom disruptions from the baseline to the intervention and post-intervention period. Moreover, positive changes were observed in both students' and teachers' self-efficacy as well as in students’ school-related well-being. The findings indicate that brief in-service teacher training on classroom management can enhance classroom climate and promote well-being in schools, underscoring the need to integrate such training into teacher education programs.",

This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Self-Control Scale (MSCS) in a Brazilian sample. The sample comprised 770 participants (80% female) aged 18–61 years (M = 27, SD = 9). Participants completed the MSCS, along with the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and Internet Addiction Test (IAT). The higher-order model, and scale reliability were examined using Confirmatory Factor Analysis, and McDonald's omega. Concorrent, convergent and divergent validity of MSCS scores were also assessed. The findings supported the higher-order structure in the Brazilian version, demonstrating high reliability ranging from .72 (Emotional Control) to .85 (Goals). As expected, MSCS scores were negatively correlated with common mental disorders, impulsive behaviors, and internet addiction tendencies. These results indicate that the MSCS is a psychometrically sound measure, contributing to cross-cultural research on the multidimensional nature of self-control.",

          "abstract": "Scholars have studied the personal antecedents and outcomes of the psychological state of intense immersion in an activity, known as ‘flow’. However, the role of personal values has largely been excluded from this research thus far. In this study, we tested the bi-directional nature of the relationship between frequency of flow experiences and the strength of four domains of personal values as outlined in Schwartz’s (1992) influential model: openness, conservation, self-transcendent, and self-enhancement. A nationally representative sample of UK adults completed measures of their personal values and flow experiences at three time-points over a six-month period (T1 N = 2049, T2 N = 888, T3 N = 510). Analysis using a Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) allowed for the separation of between and within-subject effects, with our hypotheses focused on the latter to infer directionality. Results revealed that none of the value domains were predictors of the frequency of flow experiences. Increases in the frequency of flow experiences were linked to subsequent increases in the strength of self-transcendent values, but none of the other three value domains were impacted by flow experiences. The findings have implications for how we think about encouraging flow and extend understandings of flow’s outcomes to include increased care for other people and the environment.",

Repeated episodes of heightened negative affect in daily life may accumulate over time and increase vulnerability for developing depressive disorders. This study examined whether individual differences in negative affective reactivity to digital experiences (i.e., social media use and upward social comparisons) predict changes in depressive symptoms over time. Using a 14-day diary design with 200 young adolescents (103 female; ages 10–14), we assessed daily social media use, daily upward social comparisons, daily negative affect, and depressive symptoms at pre- and posttest. We employed multilevel structural equation modeling, estimating the within-person coupling between daily social media use (Model 1) or daily upward social comparisons (Model 2) and negative affect and tested whether between-person differences in the strength of this coupling predicted average negative affect and depressive symptom change. Findings revealed that a stronger within-person coupling between upward social comparisons and negative affect, but not between social media use and negative affect, was associated with an increase in depressive symptoms via elevated negative affect across the study. These results highlight the importance of capturing dynamic affective responses to specific social media-related experiences when assessing psychological risk in early adolescence.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception. This may contribute to the misattribution of self-generated content as external, suggesting an additional element of predictive processing theories of hallucinations.",

          "abstract": "Recent decision making models have explained behaviour using mental sampling mechanisms, but there is still little agreement on the specific sampling process, such as whether sampling rates match true probabilities. Here, we trace the sampling process using random generation: in two experiments using general online samples (total N=103), participants repeatedly produced potential outcomes from pairs of monetary gambles before choosing between them. Results found over-generation of rarer outcomes and under-generation of common outcomes overall but not in initial responses, as well as avoidance of direct repetitions. Participants also tended to select options with higher average utility across their responses, implying generations guided choice. These findings suggest systematic biases in mental sampling that may filter through to choices, constraining models of this behaviour. We thus suggest random generation is a valuable method to access underlying choice processes, offering new assessments of existing theories of decision making.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

          "authors": "Gayoung Son; Marius Rubo",
          "abstract": "Background: Social anxiety often manifests in real-world interactions through behavioral patterns such as reduced eye contact and lower speech volume. While these markers have been examined in face-to-face paradigms, assessment of such behaviors in real-time social interactions has remained relatively limited. Social Virtual Reality (Social VR) offers a promising alternative by allowing for naturalistic yet experimentally controlled interactions, in which fine-grained social behaviors can be captured automatically and at scale. Examining how social anxiety is expressed in these contexts can support clinical applications such as early risk detection, tracking therapeutic progress, or tailoring interventions to individual behavioral patterns.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to assess whether behavioral and physiological markers associated with social anxiety can be similarly detected in dyadic Social VR interactions, and whether these patterns overlap with those linked to general psychopathology and verticality.\n\nMethods: A total of 128 participants engaged in 30-minute, avatar-mediated dyadic conversations within a Social VR environment. Behavioral markers such as gaze towards the partner’s eye region, smiling and speaking behavior were assessed, alongside physiological measures including heart rate and high-frequency heart-rate variability (HF-HRV). Psychological traits were assessed using self-report questionnaires, and composite factors for social anxiety, general psychopathology, and verticality were derived via principal component analysis (PCA). Relationships between traits and behavioral and physiological markers were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.\n\nResults: We found that behavioral and physiological patterns previously associated with social anxiety also emerged in interactions in Social VR, replicating patterns observed in face-to-face interactions. Specifically, higher social anxiety was linked to less gaze toward the partner’s eyes while speaking and quieter speech, alongside reduced HF-HRV. Similar patterns were observed for general psychopathology. In contrast, higher verticality was associated with shorter turn-taking gaps and increased HF-HRV. Correlational analyses revealed highly similar behavioral profiles for social anxiety and psychopathology, whereas verticality displayed a largely opposite pattern.\n\nConclusion: The findings demonstrate that behavioral and physiological patterns associated with psychological traits in face-to-face interactions are also traceable in immersive Social VR settings. Elevated social anxiety and general psychopathology were linked to increased submissive behaviors and heightened physiological stress, while higher verticality was associated with more assertive, dominant interaction styles — suggesting it may represent the opposing end of a shared social-behavioral spectrum. Notably, the strong convergence between social anxiety and broader psychopathology supports the view that many social interaction patterns are not uniquely tied to specific disorders but may reflect general psychological vulnerability. Although the passive and automated nature of behavioral data in Social VR presents novel ethical and privacy challenges, it also affords scalable assessments of social behavior in ecologically valid settings. These results highlight Social VR’s potential as a tool for assessing natural social behaviors in clinical and applied settings.",

Yet little is known about what psychologists are actually trying to find out through their studies, and whether hypothesis testing is the right tool for those goals. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 psychological researchers about the epistemic research goals they were trying to achieve in two of their recent projects (one completed and one ongoing; 40 projects in total). Using thematic analysis, we identified a wide range of research goals across six domains: empirical phenomena, concept development, measurement and auxiliaries, causal explanation, theory, and application. Nearly all goals in the sample were studied with hypothesis tests, but these tests served several different functions. The interviews revealed substantial variation in what researchers meant by 'hypothesis testing,' reflecting different inferential processes, assumptions, and levels of rigour. Some of these methods lacked key features of hypothesis testing and may not be ideally suited for researchers' actual objectives. Psychologists may benefit from clearer guidance about when hypothesis testing is appropriate and what alternative methods can serve the field's diverse epistemic goals.",

          "abstract": "Ancestrally, physical violence from conspecifics was a recurrent adaptive problem. Did selection favor preferences for partners who are both strong (highly able) and willing to protect us from violence? Strength and willingness are interrelated, so dissociating their effects is necessary. Here we assessed both inferences and preferences. In 7 experiments (N = 4,508 U.S. adults recruited via MTurk), we systematically varied the willingness of a date or friend to physically protect you from an attack, compared to scenarios where you do not have this information. We also varied that person’s strength. Discovering that a person is willing to protect greatly increased their attractiveness as a romantic partner or friend, regardless of their strength. This held for both women and men raters, and when evaluating both opposite- and same-sex dates and friends. In fact, partners who were willing to protect were attractive even if they tried to do so but failed, and even if you were harmed because of their failure. Discovering that a partner is unwilling to protect decreased their attractiveness, and was a deal-breaker for women evaluating a male date. Unwillingness decreased attractiveness more when the rater was a woman, when the target was a man, and when the target was being evaluated as a date versus friend. Women placed some importance on a male date’s strength, but this was mostly due to inferences about his willingness to protect them. Surprisingly, we found only weak evidence that differences in strength, independent of willingness, increased the attractiveness of a partner.",

          "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder, often an early marker of α-synucleinopathies, is characterized by the loss of REM-related muscle atonia and the occurrence of dream enactment behaviors. Dream reports in REM sleep behavior disorder are frequently described as more vivid, violent, and negative than typical dreams. However, evidence for this remains inconsistent, likely due to methodological variability and unaddressed confounds – most notably, the influence of pharmacological treatments. The extent to which medications affect REM sleep behavior disorder dream content remains poorly understood.\nThis systematic review critically evaluates the literature on the effects of medications commonly used in REM sleep behavior disorder and Parkinson’s disease – including clonazepam, other benzodiazepines, melatonin, melatonin receptor agonists, levodopa, pramipexole, and other dopamine agonists - on dream content. We identified 27 relevant studies employing qualitative and/or quantitative methods.\nOur analysis revealed major methodological limitations across studies, including a lack of standardized protocols and definitions, frequent reliance on retrospective or anecdotal reports, and predominantly qualitative or semi-quantitative assessments. These limitations constrain the interpretability and comparability of findings. Available evidence offers only limited support for clonazepam, melatonin, and pramipexole in reducing disturbing dream content. More consistent, but still preliminary, evidence links levodopa to increases in vivid or disturbing dreams, including nightmares.\nThis review highlights the need for rigorously controlled studies using standardized and reproducible methods to clarify the role of pharmacological treatments in shaping dream content in REM sleep behavior disorder. Future research should also integrate retrospective and prospective data-collection designs to account for potential recall biases.",

Additionally, the three studies provide mixed, and sometimes even contradictory findings, on the direct associations between personality traits and violent behavioural intentions, and the interactions between perceived threat and personality as a driver of violent extremism.\nConclusion: This research provides inconclusive findings for the Situation (threat perception) – Disposition (personality) Nexus in the context of future research. For future research, a way forward may be to leverage analytical procedures better capable of handling high model complexity, e.g. mediated-moderated structural equation modelling or psychometric network analysis.",

Across samples, nonbinary youth were consistently older and more likely to come from lower socio-economic and ethnic minoritized backgrounds. They also reported higher levels of social exclusion, which fully accounted for the observed mental health disparities between nonbinary (and other minoritized) youth and their peers. These findings directly challenge the widespread notion of nonbinary identities as ‘elitist’ or ‘woke,’ while underscoring the detrimental effects of social exclusion on the mental health of historically minoritized youth.",

          "abstract": "A large body of work has investigated the effect of various pharmacological compounds on aversive memory formation, retrieval, and modification in humans. A broad overview across signalling pathways and memory models is currently lacking. Here, we systematically review publications that tested the impact of acute pharmacological interventions on aversive memory in healthy humans, following PRISMA 2020. We identified 215 candidate compounds from 17 systems and searched Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus, until 14 June 2024. In total, we identified 100 publications with 36 compounds targeting 13 systems. Three compounds were used by the majority of studies: hydrocortison (n=25), propranolol (n=19), and D-cycloserin (n=8), while many of the remaining 33 compounds were investigated in single studies only. We summarise the effect of each investigated compound across memory models, according to the targeted memory stage. Solid evidence emerges for an impact of propranolol on reconsolidation, and weak evidence for an impact of propranolol, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), benzodiazepines, yohimbine, reboxetine, and D-cycloserine on aversive memory encoding/consolidation, and valproic acid on extinction encoding/consolidation. Furthermore, 11 compounds showed significant effects in individual studies with no published replication attempts to date. We discuss potential research directions and suggest steps for greater comparability of findings between compounds, memory models, and laboratories.",

          "abstract": "Research projects that are conducted as part of a degree support students to develop essential skills in project management, data analysis, and scientific communication. However, these projects can be resource-intensive, place an undue burden on certain populations, such as those with rare conditions, and often make limited contributions to wider knowledge. Incorporating open research approaches into the design and delivery of student research projects can help address these challenges. This chapter uses case studies and practical examples to demonstrate how supervisors can enhance efficiency in data collection and analysis (e.g., pooling data and using pre-existing data). It also examines the role of openness and transparency in student research projects and considers potential ethical implications. The examples provided will be useful for supervisors seeking to enhance students’ dissertation experience and embed some aspects of Open Science into their supervision.",

Here, we combined high-temporal resolution annotations of 26 discrete emotion categories and a valence model with nested behavioral segmentation and fMRI during movie viewing in youth. The emotion category model, particularly sadness and disappointment, was consistently associated with neural event boundaries across the cortical hierarchy from early sensory areas to transmodal hubs in the default mode network, and aligned with behavioral segmentation at coarser temporal scales. These effects persisted after controlling for low- and high-level non-emotional features, underscoring the unique predictive value of emotion categories. Social salience cues, such as “collective presence,” also robustly predicted boundaries, suggesting complementary roles of emotional and social information. Our findings highlight the correspondence between category-specific emotional semantics and narrative structure across multiple timescales.",

Using eight-wave longitudinal data, Dutch youth (N=933; Mage=18.72, SD=3.73) reported their gender identity repeatedly. Results showed that approximately one out of 20 youth changed their gender identity at least once, with several changing multiple times during the study. Whereas some youth changed between binary options (i.e., boy/man or girl/woman), others (also) considered nonbinary identities – either by identifying as such or through various self-descriptions. Youth also used other ways to communicate potential gender-expansiveness, including self-describe, ‘prefer not to say’ and missing data patterns. Our findings highlight gender identity as dynamic and contextual construct that continues to change beyond childhood and should be recognized as such.",

          "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health and psychiatry is transforming the diagnostics and treatment of mental disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). While the initial and promising applications span diagnostic screening and theraputic chatbots, \nthese first-wave technologies do not directly target the underlying brain alterations or account for the treatment of MDD. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) holds a tremendous promise to address the biological heterogeneity of MDD, but is currently hindered by highly variable outcomes. Therefore, we posit that synergistic integration of AI with NIBS represents the most promising path to address these difficulties. Importantly, the frontier for AI in depression treatment lies in a paradigm shift: from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven, personalized precision interventions.  We argue for a paradigm shift away from AI roles in mental health (e.g., chatbots, diagnostics) toward its deep integration as the core engine for personalized, circuit-based neuromodulation. We highlight the key opportunities this fusion creates: identifying patient-specific neural targets through predictive modeling, developing adaptive closed-loop therapies that respond to real-time brain states, and brain \"digital twins\" for in silico simulation and protocol optimization. While significant challenges in data standardization, model interpretability, and clinical validation remain, the fusion of AI and NIBS heralds an era of psychiatry that is predictive, personalized, and precise.",

          "abstract": "It has been claimed that musicians can convey different timing ‘feels’ in groove-based performance by manipulating onset asynchrony between instruments (playing ahead/on/behind the beat) and the durational ratio of metrical subdivisions (non-isochrony/‘swing’). The extent to which listeners can actually perceive such microrhythmic nuances, however, has rarely been tested in ecological, multi-instrumental contexts. While pupil dilation has been linked to asynchrony, it has not been studied for swing, even though it has been shown to reliably index attentional allocation and sensory conflict, offering a useful physiological complement to behavioral measures of microrhythm. We measured just-noticeable difference (JND) thresholds of asynchrony (Exp. 1) and swing (Exp. 2) in a naturalistic funk pattern (IOI ≈143 ms) featuring guitar, bass, and drums (kick, snare, hi-hat). Sixty-four participants (32 musicians, 32 non-musicians) completed a 1IFC staircase task with global onset displacements (asynchrony: ±1–100 ms; swing: +1–71.5 ms). Pupillary responses were recorded throughout. Across both experiments, thresholds varied systematically by instrument. For asynchrony, Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat yielded the lowest JNDs (≈19–24ms), while Bass and Guitar required the largest displacements (≈31–35ms). For swing, thresholds were lowest when Drums or All Instruments swung together (≈24–26ms), and highest for Bass and Guitar (≈32–34ms). An asymmetric effect of temporal direction was found for detection of asynchrony, with late displacements (≈28ms) harder to detect than early ones (≈23ms). In addition, musical training conferred a general advantage, with musicians achieving lower thresholds compared to non-musicians (asynchrony: ≈20ms vs. 31ms ; swing: ≈23ms vs. 34ms). We also found a linear relationship between pupil size and both asynchrony and non-isochrony, further indicating that the pupil indexes saliency in the processing of microrhythm more generally.",

          "abstract": "The present research examines how intersecting social categories shape first impressions of competence, focusing on Black women. Across seven online studies (total N = [884]), we investigated whether competence judgments toward Black women reflect additive effects of race and gender stereotypes or stem from a distinct intersectional stereotype. Across studies, we consistently found an intersectional pattern of competence judgments: Participants rated Black men and White women as more competent than White men, but this was less true for Black women. This pattern was modulated by individual differences in bias control—specifically, motivation and executive function (Studies 5–7). While internal motivation to control prejudice predicted pro-minority responses, this effect was insufficient to produce an overall response tendency favoring Black women equally to White women and Black men. A meta-analysis of Studies 5–7 further revealed that cognitive control efficiency (assessed by a Stroop task) significantly predicted competence ratings for Black women only, suggesting that applying pro-minority control for Black women is more difficult compared to their constituent groups. In study 7, emphasizing race over gender did not restore pro-Black bias toward Black women, further supporting intersectional models that posit emergent or unique stereotypes. These findings challenge additive models of stereotyping, emphasizing the distinct psychological representation of intersectional targets. They also underscore the difficulty of regulating stereotypes for multiply marginalized individuals. Together, these results offer insight into the interplay between social categorization, motivation, and executive control in real-world impression formation.",

LBAs based on individuals’ prompted descriptions analysed with large language models to produce scores of their psychological states and traits have shown strong convergence with the corresponding rating scales (r &gt; .80) and have often surpassed rating scales in predicting theoretically relevant behaviours (external criteria). Despite their high validity across numerous psychological outcomes and contexts, the broader adoption of LBA models has been limited. Even when made available alongside research publications, these models often remain inaccessible due to technical complexities, inconsistent documentation, and the absence of a standardized repository. This tutorial introduces a framework targeted to social and psychological scientists for accessible sharing models with others –the Language-Based Assessment Models (L-BAM) Library– as well as a toolkit for easily using L–BAMs via the text package in R. L-BAM covers a wide range of models for assessing mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life, harmony in life), implicit motives (need for power, affiliation and achievement) and more. The L-BAM library aims to increase the availability and resource efficiency of language-based assessments of psychological constructs while encouraging replication, independent validation and the broad application of pre-existing language-based assessment models.",

          "abstract": "According to predictive processing models, hallucinations can arise from over-weighting of prior expectations relative to sensory input. Individuals who hallucinate may misattribute internally-generated experiences to external sources. Combining these mechanisms, we hypothesised that hallucination-proneness in a non-clinical sample is associated with a greater reliance on internally-generated priors compared to externally-provided priors during degraded speech perception.\n\nTwo online experiments were conducted with healthy adult participants. Experiment 1 (N=92) targeted lower-level perceptual processes by assessing sensitivity and bias in distinguishing regular vocoded speech from unintelligible, spectrally-rotated vocoded stimuli at varying levels of sensory clarity. Experiment 2 (N=100) compared the influence of internally-generated versus externally-provided priors on perception of vocoded speech content. Internal- and external-priors were matched in reliability to test if hallucination-proneness was linked to differential influences of internally-generated priors on speech perception.\n\nExperiment 1 confirmed that participants who are more hallucination-prone showed a reduced ability to distinguish potentially intelligible speech from unintelligible speech, and a higher bias toward indicating that speech was present in unintelligible stimuli. Experiment 2 confirmed differential effects of internal priors, showing that hallucination-proneness scores were linked to a greater influence on internally-generated priors on perceptual report when these were incorrect, and a lower reliance on externally-provided priors when these were correct.\n\nThese findings suggest that hallucination-proneness is linked to an increased influence of internally-generated compared to externally-provided predictions on perception. This may contribute to the misattribution of self-generated content as external, suggesting an additional element of predictive processing theories of hallucinations.",

Straight community bi-negativity predicted poorer mental health, which in turn was associated with greater body dissatisfaction; no serial pathway via sexual identity visibility emerged. Gay community bi-negativity showed no direct relationship to body dissatisfaction or mental health but was positively associated with sexual identity visibility and indirectly associated with mental health, acting through sexual identity visibility, suggesting a potential beneficial pathway. Perceived gay community stress did not moderate pathways from gay community bi-negativity.

Results showed significant improvements in number-line accuracy and early math skills in the experimental group, while the control group exhibited stable performance across sessions. Critically, the analysis of dynamics between symbolic and nonsymbolic abilities revealed a bidirectional relation: symbolic skills predicted nonsymbolic development across groups, but the reverse prediction from nonsymbolic to symbolic skills only emerged in the experimental group.

The actors showed substantially higher scores than the controls in terms of interoceptive attention. Furthermore, interoceptive accuracy in the actors correlated positively with years of experience.

          "abstract": "It is well established that external feedback is effective not only for enhancing cognitive performance but also for regulating metacognitive monitoring. However, external feedback could be detrimental when it conflicts with one’s internal feedback signal (i.e. the level of confidence we have in our decisions). Currently, however, it is unknown how discrepancies between internal and external feedback (“metacognitive conflict”) influence cognitive and metacognitive performance. Here, we examined this question in a series of perceptual decision-making experiments in which participants reported both their level of confidence and received performance feedback. Metacognitive conflict occurs if participants have high confidence in their decision, but external feedback indicates that the decision was erroneous, or vice versa. Results revealed that metacognitive conflict triggers next-trial behavioral adjustments: participants exhibit significantly lower confidence following metacognitive conflict. Critically, this adaptation effect was confined to the trial level, with no sustained modulation observed when manipulating metacognitive conflict at the block level. To better characterize the computational mechanisms underlying this effect, we deployed an evidence accumulation model with additional post-decision accumulation to quantify confidence. Model fits revealed that participants become more conservative in reporting confidence after experiencing metacognitive conflict, as evidenced by biased post-decision starting points. Jointly, our findings provide much needed insight into the metacognitive consequences of metacognitive conflict.",

While glucose increases hormonal stress responses without changing cardiac stress reactivity, less is known about the interaction of glucose and relaxation interventions on cardiac reactivity. In the present study, we investigated the interaction of glucose administration and a standardized massage intervention on psychophysiological relaxation and sustained attention. \nNinety-four participants (age mean = 22.84 years, SD = 2.53 years; 71.28% female) were randomly assigned to consume a drink containing glucose, or pure water before receiving a standardized massage or resting. Directly after the manipulation, they completed the d2 sustained attention test. We repeatedly assessed blood glucose and mood and recorded an electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiography (ICG) throughout. Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) were used as a measure of parasympathetic activity, and pre-ejection period (PEP) indexed sympathetic activity. \nOur preregistered analyses showed that both relaxation interventions increased PNS activity and decreased arousal. Glucose activated the SNS and prevented SNS withdrawal in response to the massage. However, it did not modulate PNS or affective reactivity to the interventions. While cardiac reactivity was not related to sustained attention, higher blood glucose was linked to higher concentration performance and accuracy in explorative analyses. \nThe results provide further support for the autonomic space model demonstrating independence of SNS and PNS regulation depending on the type of manipulation. They may further our understanding of the links between glucose metabolism and autonomic functioning.",

According to the results, the intervention did not have an impact on test scores, grade point average, or dropout rate, and it did not lead to psychological benefits. Despite following the instructions regarding the adaptation of the materials to the given university context, we found neither the expected main nor moderated effects among these students.

          "abstract": "Background: Rapid population-level identification of language disorders could help provide care to young children to improve their outcomes. Two previous studies identified and replicated up to six parent-reported items that predicted 11-year language outcome with ≥71% sensitivity and specificity. Here, we assess whether including genetic propensity for toddlerhood vocabulary improves predictive accuracy. Method: The Early Language in Victoria Study (ELVS) recruited 1,910 8-month-olds in Melbourne in 2003-2004. The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited 5,107 0-1-year-olds across Australia in 2004. Both collected parent-reported items at 2-3 years, a comparable 11-year language outcome: the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF-4) Core Language score or Recalling Sentences subtest, and biospecimens for genotyping. We derived polygenic scores capturing participants’ genetic propensity for parent-reported 24-38-month vocabulary. We calculated univariate associations with continuous language outcomes. We used ensemble method SuperLearner to estimate how accurately the parent-reported predictors and polygenic scores predict low 11-year language outcome (&gt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean) in each cohort. Results: Language outcome was available for 839 ELVS and 1,441 LSAC participants. Polygenic scores accounted for little variance in continuous language outcomes (R-squared &lt; 1.5%). Adding polygenic scores to the predictor sets increased accuracy of predicting language outcome by up to 7%, but inconsistently between analyses. Conclusions: Polygenic scores derived for toddlerhood vocabulary did not meaningfully predict late childhood language. Polygenic scores derived for later global language measures in larger samples may be better predictors. Presently, parent-reported measures or clinician observation appear best for predicting language outcome at this age.",

          "abstract": "Considering their developmental sensitivities to peer approval and heightened self-consciousness, many adolescents experience body image concerns when engaging with visual social media. Using a sample of 927 adolescents aged 15–19 (M = 16.97, SD = 1.19; 59% girls, 38% boys, 3% other), this study explored whether resilience to idealized media bodies and to negative appearance feedback moderated the links between social media appearance activity, body esteem, and self-objectification, with the expectation that such resilience would buffer against low body esteem and heightened self-objectification. Resilience to negative appearance feedback did not significantly moderate these associations. In contrast, resilience to media ideals did, but in an unexpected direction. Adolescents with higher-than-average resilience who engaged more frequently in appearance activity reported greater self-objectification and lower body esteem, whereas those with lower-than-average resilience reported the opposite relationships, showing less self-objectification and higher body esteem. These results emerged for both girls and boys. Considering the exploratory nature of these results, they suggest that resilience may play a more intricate role in adolescents' social media appearance activity and body image. Future studies should investigate this idea further, including the reverse pathway where resilience may build up from exposure to idealization on social media.",

          "abstract": "Teacher shortages are a serious challenge in many countries, made worse by declining enrolments in initial teacher education (ITE) programs and growing competition for talented young people making career decisions. To address this challenge, we developed and tested two digital interventions—a persuasive game (TeachQuest) and a realistic job preview (RJP)—designed to enhance undergraduate students’ teaching interest, teaching self-efficacy, and perceptions of fit with the profession. In a two-phase experimental study (N = 957), undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to TeachQuest, the RJP, or a control condition. Results from Phase 1 showed that both interventions increased participants’ interest and perceived fit with teaching, with the RJP also improving teaching self-efficacy. In Phase 2, results from a delayed post-test (six weeks later; N = 572) indicated that while motivation-related outcomes remained higher than pre-test levels, changes were non-linear, with TeachQuest sustaining interest through participants’ immersion experiences and the RJP maintaining self-efficacy through mastery experiences. Our findings suggest that immersive game-based recruitment interventions may be particularly effective in informing and engaging potential applicants, whereas RJPs may be useful in reinforcing confidence in teaching. The study provides new insights informing the design of scalable, evidence-based teacher recruitment tools that align with the interests and digital-focused lives of prospective applicants for ITE programs.",

          "abstract": "Organizations in the United States exist in a hierarchical context, with gendered, racialized, and heteronormative influences. However, leaders seeking to mitigate bias and discrimination in organizations often treat organizations as impermeable structures immune to these influences. This blindness stymies their ability to treat the core activators of interpersonal conflict, rather than solely the symptoms. Merging bodies of work that identify and describe systems of oppression, we develop a framework that illuminates the cascading influence of such socio-historical factors on organizational processes. We integrate sociological, institutional, and systems psychodynamics theories to document how arbitrary hierarchies influence everything from how organizations form to interpersonal interactions. In doing so, we clarify the most appropriate applications of common terminology used to describe the experiences of disadvantaged groups (e.g., discrimination, marginalization, minoritization). Specifically, we redirect scholars’ usage of the term “microaggressions” away from the subtlety of the microaggression (which has been the focus of past research in this topic) to highlight their origin in – and maintenance of – hegemonic organizational power structures. We then utilize this framework to generate recommendations to help organizational leaders “stop the leak” or ameliorate the influence of hegemonic hierarchies in their workplace.",

          "authors": "Natalia Khodayari; Howard Egeth; susan courtney",
          "abstract": "Enhancement and suppression have traditionally been described as a shared process; enhancing relevant information subsequently suppresses irrelevant information, but there may also exist separable mechanisms. Recent evidence indicates that target enhancement and distractor suppression can be measured separately, using both behavioral and physiological approaches. It is unclear, however, whether the underlying mechanisms are also separable. We used an individual differences approach to investigate whether enhancement and suppression strengths vary independently across individuals, which would provide strong evidence supporting the existence of separate mechanisms. This approach, however, requires dissociable, internally-reliable individual-difference measures. We found reliable enhancement measures for endogenous cueing effects (Experiment 1) and statistical learning effects (Experiment 2) for target location. Measures of suppression in Experiments 1 and 2 were unreliable. In Experiment 3, we encouraged a single strategy (“singleton-search mode”) by changing the colors and shapes of targets and distractors across trials. We found reliable individual differences in reaction time measures for enhancement and suppression. Critically, these reliable measures did not covary. Experiments 4 and 5 largely replicated the results of Experiment 3. Again, individual-difference measures of enhancement and suppression strength did not covary. These results show a clear dissociation: while enhancement yields reliable individual differences across task manipulations, suppression measures are usually unreliable and sensitive to task parameters. When individual-difference measures of both enhancement and suppression are reliable, they do not covary. These results cannot be explained solely by a shared-mechanism account of enhancement and suppression, and instead support the hypothesis that independent enhancement and suppression mechanisms exist.",

          "abstract": "With increased interest in the replication crisis and the open science movement, it is important to examine the implications of communicating these topics to undergraduate psychology students. At the beginning of the open science movement, the effort to improve research practices was seen and discussed as both an individual and systemic endeavor. Some authors placed the focus on individual researchers, encouraging them to engage in practices like pre-registration and open data. Others, however, placed the responsibility with the system, arguing that incentive structures and norms need to reward these new practices. The current project examined whether using individual vs. systemic teaching approaches impacted psychology student’s trust, motivation, and optimism regarding the field of psychology. Undergraduate psychology students (N= 476) were randomly assigned to one of three video conditions, one specifying how researchers’ practices should change (individual), one specifying on incentive structures should change (systemic), and one summarizing general research practices in psychology. I expected to find that participants in the individual condition would show the highest levels of trust in the field, motivation to improve the field, and optimism, while participants in the systemic condition would show the highest trust in psychological researchers. Overall, while our manipulation effectively influenced participants' perceptions of the teaching approaches, the expected differences in trust, motivation, and optimism were not consistently observed. These results suggest that, regardless of whether one takes an individual or systemic approach, teaching about the replication crisis does not always undermine (or enhance) trust, motivation, and optimism.",

However, such findings relied on constrained stimuli (e.g., group labels, static faces). Studies using naturalistic designs instead reveal high dimensionality. We propose a new perspective that reconciles these views: mental representations of social inferences are structured as a growing network with small-world properties. In this structure, nodes (social inferences) are connected with only a few steps from one another, so even limited activation—elicited by constrained stimuli in only a small subset of nodes—propagates broadly across the network, producing covariation that mimics low-dimensional structures. However, these dimensions are not functional but emergent properties of network dynamics under constrained input. We demonstrated how this small-world-minds perspective accounts for classic phenomena—halo effect and psychological dimensions—as artifacts of stimulus limitations. We call for moving beyond low-dimensional paradigms to understand the complexity of social cognition.",

          "abstract": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were found to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate AI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as “GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY” were concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses varied: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the practice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as “honeypots” to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination—the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

          "authors": "Tianwei Gong; Simon Valentin; Neil R Bramley; Christopher G. Lucas",
          "abstract": "Heuristics have long been viewed as simple decision rules that sacrifice optimality for cognitive efficiency. However, this perspective fails to fully account for their effectiveness in complex, real-world environments. This paper proposes a reinterpretation of heuristics as realizations of likelihood-free approximation to Bayesian inference (LFI), bridging the gap between heuristic and normative approaches to decision-making. We argue that many heuristics can be understood as implementations of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), where observed data are compared to prior predictions via summary statistics (a form of LFI). This view situates heuristics within a probabilistic framework, explaining how they can represent uncertainty and adapt to environmental structure. Our approach addresses three key challenges in the field: It relaxes strong assumptions about cue-target relationships in heuristic models, accounts for implicit uncertainty representation in heuristic decision-making, and invites a more appropriate benchmark for evaluating heuristics' performance. To demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework, we present two case studies --- a classic cue-based decision task and an ecological causal learning task. These show that an ABC model using summary statistics can well approximate the benchmark performance provided by unconstrained Bayesian inference, explain the apparent emergence of different heuristics given environmental changes, and capture human behaviors better than a rational Bayesian benchmark without introducing new mysteries. By unifying heuristics and Bayesian inference through the lens of likelihood-free methods, this work provides a more nuanced understanding of human decision-making, and provides a bridge to the literature on inference-by-sampling.",

We proposed a novel two-dimensional framework for categorizing spatial priors based on spatial reference frame (allocentric vs. egocentric) and temporal scale (global vs. local). Participants memorized and later reproduced target locations. The spatial compactness of the target distribution was manipulated to vary the precision of the allocentric global prior. A central tendency effect, where responses were biased toward the target distribution centroid, indicated reliance on the allocentric global prior. Bias was stronger with more precise distributions, indicating greater reliance on the more precise allocentric global prior. Bidimensional regression analysis revealed additional influences from the egocentric global and egocentric local priors, but not from the allocentric local prior. These findings support the proposed framework and demonstrate that multiple forms of prior knowledge simultaneously guide navigation behavior. This work provides a foundation for future studies linking prior knowledge to spatial navigation and broader cognitive processes.",

          "abstract": "In recent years, an increasingly common practice amongst organizations has been setting representation goals, or organizational mandates intended to increase the prevalence of underrepresented employees in visible work assignments. The work of meeting these goals often falls to managers, who must also weigh additional criteria – like the employees’ workloads or skillsets – in their task assignments. Typically, when faced with a task assignment decision, managers will refrain from assigning employees who are not available or who do not have the requisite skillset. However, leaning on Tetlock’s theory of value pluralism, we predict that these goals can lead managers to set aside traditional criteria of effective task assignment (specifically, underrepresented employees’ person-job fit and/or workloads) to prioritize achieving these organizational goals. In this way, underrepresented employees are more likely to be assigned to tasks that are sub-optimal for their occupational success (i.e., by being assigned to work that does not appropriately match their skillset or that leads them to be overworked). We examine these predictions in four studies (N = 2,598). We find that this decision-making is driven by managers’ increased diversity concerns (as a consequence of the representation goals), but can be mitigated by how the organization communicates those goals. We conclude by discussing both the theoretical and practical implications of our findings.",

This study used a person-centered approach to examine how personality and imagination cluster among university students and how these profiles relate to sex and disciplinary enrollment. Latent profile analysis (LPA) revealed three typologies: Reactive Realists (10.3%), with lower imagination and emotional stability; Reserved Idealists (52.6%), with lower extraversion and moderately elevated imagination; and Balanced Visionaries (37.2%), with high imagination and greater emotional stability. Chi-square analyses indicated that sex did not significantly differentiate profile membership, suggesting imagination-personality patterns are not sex-specific. However, profiles were significantly related with college disciplinary choices when sex and race/ethnicity were added as covariates. Balanced Visionaries were less likely to enroll in the sciences relative to Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, while Reactive Realists showed higher odds of enrolling in Engineering. Regression models further showed significant effects of sex and race/ethnicity: females were less likely to enroll in Business, Engineering, and Music, but more likely in Education; Asian students were more likely to enroll in Business, Engineering, and Science; and Hispanic/Latinx students had higher odds of enrolling in Engineering. These findings highlight the value of LPA for identifying imagination-personality typologies that shape educational choices in post-secondary education.",

To counter this, we propose a framework of essential AI meta-skills—strategic direction, critical discernment, and systematic calibration—that constitute a new form of scientific literacy distinct from traditional critical thinking. Through domain-specific examples and a pedagogical model based on situated learning, we propose how these meta-skills can be cultivated to ensure that researchers, particularly those in training, maintain intellectual autonomy.

          "abstract": "Psycholinguistic theories traditionally assume similar cognitive mechanisms across different speakers. However, more recently, researchers have begun to recognize the need to consider individual differences when explaining human cognition. An increasing number of studies have investigated how individual differences influence human sentence processing. Implicitly, these studies assume that individual-level effects can be replicated across experimental sessions and different assessment methods such as eye-tracking and self-paced reading. However, this assumption is challenged by the reliability paradox  (Hedge, 2018). Thus, a crucial first step for a principled investigation of individual differences in sentence processing is to establish their measurement reliability, that is, the correlation of individual-level effects across multiple measurement occasions and methods. In this work, we present the first naturalistic eye movement corpus of reading data with four experimental sessions from each participant (two eye-tracking sessions and two self-paced reading sessions). We deploy a two-task Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the measurement reliability of individual differences in a range of  psycholinguistic phenomena  that are well-established at the population level, namely effects of word length, lexical frequency, surprisal, dependency length and number of to-be-integrated dependents. While our results indicate high reliability across measurement occasions for the word length effect, it is only moderate for higher-level psycholinguistic predictors such as lexical frequency, dependency distance, and the number of to-be-integrated dependencies, and even low for surprisal. Moreover, even after accounting for spillover effects, we observe only low to moderate reliability at the individual level across methods (eye-tracking and self-paced reading) for most predictors, and poor reliability for predictors of syntactic integration. These findings underscore the importance of establishing measurement reliability before drawing inferences about individual differences in sentence processing.",

          "abstract": "Migrants and refugees frequently shoulder the misconception that they are solely responsible for integrating into receiving societies. Diversity training interventions based on experiential learning activities, such as role-plays, can help promote receiving society members’ awareness of acculturation as a mutual process shaped by power asymmetries. However, existing role-plays on acculturation lack theory and science-informed bases, and their effectiveness has rarely been examined by empirical research. Via two mixed-method studies, the present research assessed the learning outcomes of a role-play-based intervention, designed by incorporating well-established psychological frameworks on acculturation, among a community sample of Portuguese majority members (Study 1, N = 44) and in the academic setting among Portuguese and international university students (Study 2, N = 18). Statistical comparisons of pre- and post-test scores revealed that the intervention was effective in increasing participants’ knowledge of migration and acculturation-related issues, and in fostering Portuguese majority members’ empathy towards migrants and refugees. Qualitative data collected during the debriefing discussion and via a feedback form provide in-depth insights into participants’ experiential learning processes. The intervention appeared as a valuable tool for promoting awareness of acculturation as a mutual process and supporting the introduction of acculturation theoretical frameworks in the classroom.",

          "abstract": "Background\nPeople with severe mental health problems often struggle with low self-efficacy, hopelessness, and self-stigmatization, making recovery challenging. Recovery narratives (RNs) could foster connectedness, hope, and guidance when they feature certain active ingredients, identified in previous research. However, interventions offering RNs including these active ingredients are lacking.\n\nAims\nThis study aimed to develop and implement an RN-based intervention to enhance personal recovery among adults in specialist mental health services. A secondary aim was to identify potential outcomes for a pilot randomized controlled trial.\n\nMethods\nFollowing Bartholomew’s Intervention Mapping protocol, we conducted a literature review and four stakeholder focus groups to explore needs and inform intervention design.\nResults\nThe digital module STORY MINE was developed and integrated into the online client portal ‘Minddistrict’ at a major Dutch mental health facility. It offers twelve hopeful RNs in three modalities: video podcast, audio, and text. Hypothesized outcomes include improved mental health confidence (primary outcome) and enhanced hope, reduced self-stigma, and better personal recovery (secondary outcomes). \n\nConclusion\nOur study pioneers a targeted, evidence-based approach by purposively collecting recovery narratives that include identified active ingredients to develop a RN based intervention called STORY MINE. A pilot randomized controlled trial will assess its feasibility and effectiveness using quantitative and qualitative measures.",

Across two preregistered studies (N = 504, 158) and a re-analysis of previously published data (N = 50), we rigorously examined outcome-irrelevant learning under conditions of explicit instruction and extensive training. In both cases, automatic value updating persisted even when participants clearly understood which features were non-predictive of reward, and reliance on these irrelevant values led to suboptimal choices. Moreover, working-memory capacity, known as a key regulatory resource, predicted the magnitude of this automatic outcome-irrelevant learning. Collectively, our results broaden the concept of automatic cognitive processing beyond the selective-attention literature to encompass reinforcement-learning mechanisms.",

          "authors": "ALI JAMI",
          "abstract": "In a dynamic and uncertain world, the human brain must efficiently process emotions and simulate potential scenarios to enhance decision-making under ambiguity. This theoretical framework proposes that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep serves as a cognitive simulator, decoding unconscious emotions and incoming information within a safe, virtual environment. During REM sleep, limbic system structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula, integrate recent sensory inputs with long-term memory schemas, transforming raw emotional signals based on potential threats and rewards into actionable insights. Simultaneously, REM sleep facilitates affect-centric probabilistic simulations through hippocampal-prefrontal interactions, generating symbolic reconstructions of past experiences and hypothetical scenarios to foster cognitive flexibility and resilience. This model extends traditional perspectives on REM sleep, which emphasize memory consolidation and emotional regulation, by highlighting its critical role in future-oriented decision-making. Drawing on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computational analogies with artificial intelligence, this framework highlights the dual function of REM sleep in emotional familiarization and adaptive strategy rehearsal. Recent evidence from studies on sleep deprivation and REM-specific manipulations further supports this, showing impairments in decision-making, insight generation, and risk assessment when REM is disrupted. Empirical gaps, including the need for direct neurobehavioral evidence linking REM to specific decision-making outcomes, and alternative hypotheses, such as the role of non-REM sleep or slow-wave activity, are discussed to contextualize the contributions of the model and guide future interdisciplinary research.",

In Study 1, 114 participants judged the attractiveness or trustworthiness of male dating profiles with no filter, a mild filter, and an extreme image filter. Profiles with no filter were seen as more trustworthy than those with mild filters, and mild filters were more trustworthy than those with extreme filters. However, filters had comparatively little impact on perceived attractiveness. Moreover, perceptions of trustworthiness and attractiveness were not associated for images with extreme filters, suggesting excessive filtering might disrupt the halo effect in dating app contexts. In Study 2, participants rated male (n = 137) and female profiles (n = 106), which consisted of filtered and unfiltered images, on perceived trustworthiness; half of the participants were informed of the filters. Filtered images were perceived as less trustworthy than unfiltered images for both male and female profiles, especially when participants were informed about the filters.",

          "abstract": "Groove is the pleasurable urge to move to the beat of music, a universally experienced human phenomenon. Because listeners are often inspired to move to music with groove, we asked whether high-groove music would promote greater motor system activity than low-groove music, noise, or silence, as shown by shorter latency and/or greater amplitude of the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), an event-related potential measure of neural response preparation and execution in the primary motor cortex. In Experiment 1, 21 participants were presented with one of two symbols (@ and #) on a computer monitor and pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on which symbol was presented, while listening to high-groove music, low-groove music, noise, or silence. Throughout the duration of the experiment, electroencephalography was recorded at the scalp and we calculated stimulus-locked and response-locked activity by averaging across correctly responded, non-artifact trials. In Experiment 2, 31 participants were tested with the same stimuli, procedure, and analysis, with the following exception: instead of responding to visual stimuli, participants pressed a button with their left or right hand, depending on whether they heard an occasional increase or decrease in intensity in the music or noise. None of the analyses in either experiment showed differences in LRP latency or amplitude between the high-groove or low-groove conditions. Several of the analyses yielded Bayes Factor values greater than 3 in favor of the null hypothesis. Thus, we found no evidence that high-groove music enhances activity in the primary motor cortex. Future studies should use other brain activity measurement and manipulation techniques to conceptually replicate our findings, including techniques that can separately measure different motor and auditory cortical areas.",

          "abstract": "While it is well-established that sleep benefits episodic memory, most evidence is on younger adults. The current study examined sleep benefits in older adults and chose spatial source memory as a target measure for which a recent study in younger adults showed particularly strong sleep benefits (Berres et al., 2025). This corresponds to theories of sleep and memory (e.g., active systems consolidation hypothesis) which predict sleep (especially SWS) benefits in hippocampus-dependent source memory. Using the same design as Berres et al.’s (2025) Experiment 1, we tested 58 older adults (aged 60 – 86 years) who were randomly assigned to study object pictures in left versus right screen locations either in the morning (7-10am; wake group) or in the evening (7-10pm; sleep group). Testing for item (pictures) and source (location) memory followed 12 hours later (i.e., wake group: same day evening; sleep group: next morning). Multinomial model-based analyses showed that both item and, especially, source memory were significantly improved in the sleep group. Additionally, older adults in the sleep group wore FitBitChargeHR™ wristbands for sleep tracking. Based on an extended sample of n = 61 older adults in this group, we estimated correlations to sleep parameters in a Bayesian-hierarchical multinomial analysis. Contrary to expectations, time spent in deep sleep did not predict next morning’s source memory, but time spent in deep sleep embedded in sleep cycles was positively correlated with source memory the next morning. Further, time spent awake after sleep onset was negatively correlated with source memory.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental problem facing any learning organism is how to determine which aspects of its experience to attend to and which to ignore when guiding its goal-oriented actions. This problem, known as relevance realization, is key to understanding how cognitive agents, biological or artificial, learn purposeful behaviors through experience-based interactions with their environment. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how organisms solve the relevance realization problem is currently lacking. Here, we approach this challenge by proposing a synthesis between a contemporary computational framework of goal-oriented learning in cognitive agents and a canonical Buddhist account of concept formation, specifically as developed by the Indian philosopher Dharmakīrti (c. 6-7th century C.E.). Our approach posits that cognitive agents form goal-dependent conceptual representations of the world that reflect subjective preferences about properties of simulated sensorimotor experience streams. By drawing on Dharmakīrti’s ideas to inform computational models of goal-directed learning, our approach bears on current debates regarding the prerequisites for and implications of artificially emulating human-like cognition.",

          "abstract": "Performing actions boosts memory for descriptions of those actions; this is called the “enactment effect.” The enactment effect has been repeatedly found with verbal materials, but it is unclear if this effect generalizes to naturalistic materials that include linked sequences of actions and multimodal information. In four preregistered studies, we tested for enactment effects using naturalistic movies. Experiment 1 successfully replicated the enactment effect using descriptions of actions from the movies. In Experiment 2, participants read or acted out action descriptions and then watched a movie including those actions; no enactment effect was found. In Experiment 3, participants watched the movies while simultaneously copying the actions that the actors performed; again, no enactment effect was observed. Finally, Experiment 4 examined whether enactment affected how movies were segmented into meaningful events; once again, no enactment effect was observed. These results suggest that during naturalistic comprehension viewers may obligatorily engage motor simulations, rendering enactment manipulations redundant and thus ineffective.",

          "abstract": "Academic Miscommunication (AM) is the phenomenon of a professor’s expectations, beliefs, or goals in the classroom differing from those of the students. In this study, a survey was given to undergraduates in two introductory physics classes (one class intended for majors, another for non-majors) who had recently received their grade for the first exam of the semester. The survey measured whether the exam had matched the students’ expectations of the exam, both in form and in content. From these responses, students were assigned an \"AM score,\" a numerical value in which higher numbers indicate a greater deviation between the actual exam and the students’ expectations. Students’ exam scores were compared with their AM scores; both classes displayed an inverse linear correlation between exam scores and AM scores. The class for majors displayed R-squared = 0.291 (n=14), corresponding to a p-value of 0.031. The class for non-majors displayed an R-squared = 0.457 (n=30), corresponding to a p-value of 0.000035. The survey also inquired about several other phenomena, such as Impostor Syndrome and the growth-versus-fixed mindset paradigm; 20 graphs were plotted in total. The Bonferroni correction therefore requires a p-value of 0.0025 for statistical significance. We reject the null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for non-majors. In contrast, we fail to reject the null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for majors. Our findings indicate that non-physics-major students who performed poorly on the first exam of the semester had misunderstood the expectations about the style and content of the exam.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Psychopathology shows changes in behavioral manifestation across development, i.e., heterotypic continuity. However, research has paid little attention to how to account for heterotypic continuity when examining development of psychopathology. This longitudinal study accounted for heterotypic continuity of multiple psychopathology dimensions by using developmental scaling to place multi-informant ratings of children’s behavior problems onto the same scale to chart children’s trajectories.\nMethod: The study examined children’s (N=231) development of three psychopathology dimensions—externalizing, internalizing, and thought-disordered—using different measures across seven timepoints from 3–7.5 years of age. Psychopathology dimensions were assessed by mother-, father-, and teacher/caregiver-report. We compared three assessment approaches: the common items, upward/downward extension, and construct-valid items approaches. We compared two scoring approaches: mean scoring and developmental scaling. Developmental scaling aims to place scores from age-differing measures onto the same scale. We compared their accuracy, for externalizing problems, in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task.\nResults: Using different measures across ages (i.e., construct-valid items approach) was the most accurate assessment approach—modestly more accurate than using the common items or upward/downward extension—in terms of criterion validity with respect to observations of compliance and attention to task (rdiff=.07–.13). Developmental scaling was the most accurate scoring approach—modestly more accurate than average scores (rdiff=.03–.17).\nConclusion: Using (a) age-differing measures to account for heterotypic continuity and (b) developmental scaling to link scores from the different measures onto the same scale may enable studying development of psychopathology across the lifespan.",

This pre-registered study examined whether the ability to generate visual mental imagery amplifies magical thinking responses to mentally constructed emotional events. Using a modified laboratory harm provocation paradigm, participants with aphantasia (minimal or absent visual imagery; N = 32) and visualisers (normal to high imagery ability; N = 48) were asked to write and elaborate on the sentence “I hope [name of a loved one] is in a car accident”, followed by an episodic elaboration phase to ensure both groups engaged in concrete-experiential mental processing of the specific event. The Visualiser group reported significantly higher anxiety, guilt, moral violation, responsibility, and urge to neutralise the thought relative to Aphantasic participants, despite similar perceptions of event likelihood and severity, and after accounting for the effects of age and trait magical thinking. However, neutralisation behaviour did not differ between groups. Mental imagery ratings and episodic detail reports confirmed that visualisers generated richer sensory representations of the imagined event. These findings support emulation theory by demonstrating that scene-based mental imagery amplifies emotional and motivational responses to hypothetical events, contributing to the phenomenological intensity of intrusive thoughts. The results have implications for understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying magical thinking and compulsive behaviours. Results suggest that aphantasia may confer reduced vulnerability to such responses.",

          "abstract": "Background: Camouflaging – the use of strategies to mask autistic traits in social contexts – has been linked to mental health challenges and lower self-esteem. While the relationship between camouflaging and mental health has been increasingly studied, its associations with self-related factors, including self-esteem, self-acceptance, and identity, remain underexplored. The aim of this systematic review was to examine existing research on the relationship between camouflaging and self-related factors in autistic adults. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024597257). Results: A total of 259 articles were identified. One hundred thirty articles were screened, and thirteen studies were included. Across studies, camouflaging was consistently associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, lower self-esteem, and reduced authenticity in interpersonal relationships. Most studies showed associations between exhaustion, identity confusion, reduced self-acceptance and camouflaging. Conversely, receiving an autism diagnosis and developing self-acceptance were associated with reduced camouflaging and greater opportunities for authentic self-expression. Conclusions: Evidence suggests that camouflaging is closely tied to difficulties in self-related factors and well-being among autistic adults. These findings highlight the importance of supports and interventions that affirm autistic identity and reduce social pressures to camouflage.",

          "abstract": "Visual Working Memory (VWM) is essential for temporarily retaining goal-relevant visual information, yet its limited capacity renders it vulnerable to distraction. While previous studies have examined the effects of distractors occurring during encoding or maintenance, it remains unclear how stimulus presentation duration modulates these effects and whether different types or quantities of distractors exert similar costs. Across three experiments, we systematically investigated how distraction timing, distractor content, and perceptual load interact with encoding duration to influence VWM performance. In Experiment 1, participants performed continuous recall and change detection tasks under four distraction conditions (no-distraction, encoding-, delay-, and full-distraction) and two encoding durations (short: 200 ms; long: 1000 ms). Encoding-stage distractions impaired performance only in the short-duration, high-precision task, whereas delay-stage distractions consistently disrupted memory regardless of duration or task type. Experiment 2 manipulated distractor-target similarity (same-category vs. different-category distractors) and revealed that homogeneous distractors exerted stronger disruption, particularly when presented during the delay period. In contrast, heterogeneous distractors could be effectively suppressed when sufficient encoding time allowed for robust consolidation. Experiment 3 examined perceptual load (low vs. high) and showed that increasing distractor quantity did not amplify interference, suggesting that once memory consolidation is complete, delay-stage distractions disrupt VWM representations regardless of distractor load. Together, these findings reveal an asymmetry in how VWM handles distractions at different processing stages. While extended encoding supports resistance to early interference, maintenance-stage distractions exert persistent effects—especially when distractors are similar to targets. Our results highlight the importance of presentation duration and distractor similarity in shaping VWM robustness, and suggest that distinct cognitive mechanisms may underlie suppression at encoding and maintenance stages.",

          "abstract": "Despite the well-researched association between problematic video gaming and internalizing symptoms, few studies incorporate parent reports or examine possible moderators for this association. This study examined person- and dyadic-level associations between gaming disorder (GD) and internalizing symptoms among children and adolescents, along with the moderation of expressive suppression, family functioning, and parenting behaviors. A cross-sectional design was adopted, and 121 dyads of parents and their children who played video games at least once a week were recruited. Participants received questionnaires via mail and completed them independently in a paper-and-pencil format. In generalized linear regression and multilevel common fate modeling, child-reported GD and latent GD were treated as the criterion variables, respectively. Despite the significant association between child-reported GD and internalizing symptoms, β = .023, p = .03, the latent association measuring the cross-informant agreement was not significant, β = –.004, p = .86. The only significant moderator was the parent-reported positive parenting behavior in the latent association between GD and internalizing symptoms, β = –.004, p = .04. At the dyadic-level, GD and internet gaming disorder had the same pattern of associations with the other measures, whereas a different pattern emerged at the person-level. This multi-informant measurement may indicate a possible inflation of the self-reported positive association between GD and internalizing symptoms. Positive parenting behavior, including positive response, involvement, and respect, may serve as emotional support, which protects children from resorting to video gaming to alleviate psychological distress.",

          "abstract": "Since the 1960s, the testing community has striven to ensure fairness in tests and test items. Differential item functioning (DIF) is a widely used statistical notion for items that may unfairly disadvantage specific subgroups of test-takers. However, traditional DIF analyses focus only on statistical relationships in observed data and cannot explain why such unfairness occurs. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel causal framework for defining and detecting unfair items using single world intervention graphs (SWIGs). By leveraging SWIGs and potential outcomes, we define causal DIF (CDIF) as the difference in item functioning between two hypothetical worlds: one where individuals were assigned to one group and another where they were assigned to a different group. We also connect CDIF to related fairness concepts, including group versus individual fairness and item impact. In particular, we use SWIGs to graphically distinguish between item fairness at the individual level and the population level. Additionally, we discuss causal identification strategies using SWIGs and  demonstrate how our approach differs from traditional DIF methods through a simulation study. We further illustrate its application to a controversial item from New York's Regents math exam and a real dataset from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, concluding with broader implications of promoting causal fairness in testing practices.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "This study reports the results of a pre-registered online experiment conducted with Qualtrics panelists (N = 927) to examine the persuasive effects of brief, professionally-produced video narratives aimed at reducing anti-immigrant prejudice. Drawing on narrative persuasion and inspiring media frameworks, the study explores how protagonist type—positive role model vs. transitional character—shapes identification with the protagonist and activates psychological insight, a transformative cognitive response linked to attitude change. A 3 (character type: control, transitional character, positive role model) × 3 (rumor type: “immigration increases crime,” “immigrants are taking our jobs,” “immigrants receive excessive public assistance”) between-subjects factorial design was used. Participants were exposed to short, professionally produced audiovisual narratives, each depicting a dramatized critical incident in which a negative rumor about immigrants was introduced and, depending on the condition, either confronted by the protagonist or left unaddressed (control). After viewing, identification, psychological insight, and outcome variables (e.g., attitudes toward immigrants) were assessed. Results show that modern racism moderated the effect of character type on identification: low-prejudice individuals identified more strongly with the positive role model, while high-prejudice individuals showed lower identification in both experimental conditions. Identification predicted psychological insight, which in turn mediated key outcomes such as liking the story, willingness to share it, and attitudes toward immigrants. These findings demonstrate that short video narratives can elicit character-driven insight and promote inclusive attitudes particularly among receptive audiences, but suggest that longer narratives may be needed for counterattitudinal audiences, thereby advancing understanding of how narrative-based interventions such as Entertainment-Education can counter prejudice.",

Likewise, philosophers and psychologists alike have pondered the differences between preference and behavior. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between aesthetic preference and motivation. Using an online approach-avoidance motivation task, we compare the reaction times between congruent (aesthetic preference + approach) and incongruent (aesthetic preference + avoidance) conditions. In Experiment 1, we explore the relationship between symmetry and complexity and approach-avoidance motivated behavior. In Experiment 2, we distinguish the mechanisms in play in the relationship by manipulating presentation and decision-making time. In Experiment 3, we assess the generalizability of the results beyond abstract graphical patterns. Overall, our research advances knowledge of the relationship between aesthetic preferences for features like symmetry and complexity and approach-avoidance motivation, and it has implications for fields such as marketing.",

          "authors": "Katarina Kliit; Uku Vainik; René Mõttus",
          "abstract": "Relatively stable personality traits shape people’s motivations and attitudes, and their potential effect on pro-environmental attitudes and resulting behaviours can accumulate over time. However, narrow personality traits—nuances that tend to provide stronger and more refined associations with various outcomes—have received little attention in relation to pro-environmental attitudes. Furthermore, research has almost exclusively focused on self-reports that are prone to biases. This suggests that the associations between personality traits and pro-environmental attitudes have likely been underestimated. We collected participants' self- and informant-reports of narrow personality nuances and broad Big Five domains from three samples (Estonian, N = 20,926; Russian, N = 762; English, N = 600). This allowed us to estimate their true correlation (rtrue) with and predictive accuracy (rtruepred) for pro-environmental attitudes, while controlling for single-method, occasion-specific, and random errors and estimating the findings’ generalizability. The rtrues were higher than self-reports-based correlations, and nuances had larger effect sizes than domains. In the largest sample, the Openness (rtrue = .35) and Agreeableness domains (rtrue = .27) had the highest rtrues with pro-environmental attitudes. However, a range of nuances had even stronger rtrues , primarily those reflecting progressive views, care for other people, and appreciation of art. The combined predictive accuracy of nuances for pro-environmental attitudes reached nearly rtruepred = .60, even with only three “top” nuances; the domains’ predictive accuracy was lower (rtruepred = .50). The findings replicated well across samples and suggest that pro-environmental attitudes are linked with personality traits more strongly and in more nuanced ways than previously thought.",

Synthesizing 915 effect sizes from 102 primary studies and 420 teacher samples (N = 681,745 teachers) in 70 countries via multilevel meta-analyses, we found small but significant gender differences favoring male teachers in TPACK self-efficacy (d ̅ = -0.17), particularly in technological knowledge (d ̅ = -0.31) and technological pedagogical knowledge (d ̅ = -0.14). However, no significant gender disparities were observed in TPACK performance (d ̅ = -0.08). Our findings revealed considerable heterogeneity in these effects across samples, studies, countries, measures, and over time, which could be partly explained by factors such as educational level, country-level gender inequality, and economic development. These results challenge the assumption of male teachers’ advantage in all aspects of technology-related teaching competencies. Our meta-analytic review further implies that gender disparities in TPACK are not fully generalizable and stable across contexts or over time.",

First, concurrent Think-Aloud analyzed with large language models (LLMs) surpasses classic cognitive models and neural networks in predicting behavior, showing that verbal reports contain generative information beyond behavior alone. Second, Think-Aloud generalizes across individuals with only a few examples, reflecting shared cognitive patterns. Third, Think-Aloud guides LLMs toward more human-like reasoning. Together, these findings position Think-Aloud as a scalable complement to behavioral measures, reopening a foundational debate in cognitive science and informing human-aligned AI.",

          "abstract": "Psychologists should analyze their data well rather than badly, but how do we know whether they are actually good at analyzing data in the real world? Currently, there is a dearth of empirically-grounded criteria for assessing real-world analytic skill, leaving us to judge analysts’ decisions on the uncertain or even arbitrary standards of routine, disciplinary norms, or what “feels right” or “seems off”. This knowledge gap is surprising given widespread concerns about low replication, high rates of questionable research practices, and the recent proliferation of data science initiatives both within and beyond psychology purporting to increase job-readiness for data-intensive workplaces. We address this gap by introducing and validating a new construct: analytic fluency, or real-world analytic decision-making that consistently produces trustworthy, informative, and reliable analyses across contexts. Drawing on interviews with experienced analysts, we identify and validate four distinct dimensions of analytic skill: Analyzing Flexibly, Appreciating the Importance of Data, Prioritizing Stakeholder Needs, and Striving for Simplicity. We show analytic fluency scores are predicted by real analytic experience, are empirically distinct from statistical knowledge, and show no bias by gender, race/ethnicity, or education level. By naming and measuring analytic fluency, we address a longstanding conceptual and empirical gap in knowledge about how data analysis is, and ought to be, carried out in practice. In so doing, we take a first small step toward scientifically defining what it means to be skilled at data analysis.",

This study presents a methodology for efficiently generating and selecting high-quality, non-redundant items for psychological assessments using LLMs and network psychometrics. Our approach, termed Automatic Item Generation with Network-Integrated Evaluation (AI-GENIE), reduces reliance on expert intervention by integrating generative AI with the latest network psychometric techniques. The efficacy of AI-GENIE was evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations using the Mixtral, Gemma 2, Llama 3, GPT 3.5, and GPT 4o models to generate item pools that mimic Big Five personality assessments. Additionally, items from AI-GENIE were empirically tested with five nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 4,964 total), demonstrating that AI-GENIE-generated scales achieve structural validity comparable to traditional expert-developed measures. The results demonstrated improvements in item selection efficiency, with overall average increases of 8.68-20.03 in normalized mutual information in the final item pool across all models. We also present a simulation study on the emerging construct of AI Anxiety to demonstrate AI-GENIE’s utility for underrepresented constructs. Results from newly released models (DeepSeek, GPT-OSS 20B, GPT-OSS 120B) are presented in the Appendix. The findings of our paper suggest that AI-GENIE is a highly effective tool for streamlining the scale development and validation process.",

Previous work has shown that individuals with high reward sensitivity show resilience in the face of individualized stressors. Here, we sought to investigate whether individuals with high reward sensitivity prior to pandemic onset would be resilient to the community-level stressor of the pandemic. Sensitivity to reward was defined here as neural activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum for wins as compared to losses in a reward-based task. We used data from the Human Connectome Project in Development collected before the pandemic onset, and follow-up data which was collected from the same participants during the pandemic. Activity in the left vmPFC moderated the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing psychopathology. Although those with low reward sensitivity showed a positive association between exposure to stressors and psychopathology, those with high sensitivity to reward did not show increased symptoms with increased stressors. We found no effect of activity in the striatum or right vmPFC on the association between stressors and psychopathology. These findings add to a growing literature highlighting reward sensitivity, measured prior to stressor onset, as a source of stress resilience.",

          "abstract": "Alcohol consumption can pose health risks and cause social problems, hence harmful drinking is a global health concern. Acculturation has been theorized and examined as a key driver for drinking behaviors. In this State of the Science article, we define sociocultural and psychological acculturation, and describe three causal theories associated with socialization and learning, stress and coping, and accessibility and opportunity. Data have shown small-to-moderate associations linking acculturation factors to drinking outcomes. Many existing studies measure acculturation with demographic proxies and static cultural orientation indicators. Underlying causal mechanisms are typically inferred rather than tested directly, with limited focus on key proximal factors such as stress responses, drinking motives, and cultural norms. Furthermore, current alcohol interventions lack alignment with acculturation science and fail to target modifiable, drinking-related factors. To advance the field and bridge research-to-practice gaps, studies should move beyond broad demographic markers and examine systematically the psychological and social pathways linking acculturation to alcohol use. We advocate for the adoption of context-specific measures, daily life study methods to capture acculturation’s dynamic effects on drinking, and research across diverse global populations. We call for the field to integrate the acculturation framework into the broader alcohol research and mainstream interventions to address individual and cultural variations in drinking behaviors, incorporate sociocultural influences into existing models of alcohol use to bridge gaps in generalizability, and enhance intervention effectiveness.",

          "authors": "Matthew Zefferman",
          "abstract": "As researchers broaden samples to populations that are not Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD), they often use instruments, such as questionnaires, designed for WEIRD populations. Does this practice create systematic biases when making cross-cultural comparisons? Inspired by the example of less apparent structural complexity in personality data outside of WEIRD populations, I show with computational models that designing a personality instrument for a reference, typically WEIRD, population and applying it to a novel population will systematically underestimate the relative complexity of the novel population. This occurs because instruments optimized to capture the personality structure of one society fail to capture alternative structures in other societies. The models also make the novel quantitative prediction that a society's \"cultural distance\" from the reference society should tend to be negatively associated with the apparent complexity of its personality structure. To test this prediction, I used pre-existing cross-cultural personality and cultural distance datasets to show that cultural distance from the United States, from which the reference personality instrument was designed, has the strongest negative relationship with the complexity of the personality structure, as measured by the instrument, out of all 67 countries in the dataset. This result duplicates an outcome of the model. These findings suggest that lower apparent complexity in non-WEIRD groups may be driven by the choice of WEIRD instruments, rather than by actual differences in complexity. These biases would also tend to occur in any case where an instrument designed for one group is applied to another, such as different genders or cohorts. I propose possible reforms to avoid this type of bias.",

          "abstract": "The proportion of the population who are vaccinated against an infectious disease is significant – not only because vaccination keeps the virus from spreading, but also because learning about how many members of one’s community have decided to get vaccinated has been shown to affect individual vaccination intention. In three preregistered online experiments featuring country-level vaccination rates against a hypothetical disease, we tested two theoretical approaches which offer contrasting predictions on how public health messaging should leverage vaccination rates. If selfish rationality is assumed, a high uptake would tempt people to free-ride on herd immunity (so low uptake should be emphasized); conversely, if vaccination rates exert a descriptive normative influence, a high uptake would signal that vaccination is the best choice, and vice versa (so high uptake should be emphasized). In the pilot (N = 75) and Experiment 1 (N = 174), communicating a high (90%) vaccination rate (vs. 10% vs. no rate) increased vaccination intentions, with no detectable effect of a low vaccination rate. In Experiment 2 (N = 217), decisions to get vaccinated were frequently justified based on reasons involving self-protection, but also the protection of others and the collective, irrespective of the vaccination rate level (20% vs. 80%); participants, on the other hand, rarely endorsed any of the tested reasons for non-vaccination, including free-riding; furthermore, descriptive norms were perceived as more relevant for vaccination than non-vaccination decisions. Experiment 3 (N = 1,060) tested the effectiveness of different messages when the majority have been vaccinated (60%) but the coverage is still not optimal. Alongside a weak descriptive norm, the self-benefit message worked better than other- and collective-benefit messages. We argue that public health messaging should incorporate both theoretical approaches, closer to the notion of reasonableness (rather than pure rationality or normativity), which is context-sensitive and pragmatic.",

However, the magnitude, development, and cross-cultural generality of this bias remain debated. We conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis and meta-regression of 71 studies to synthesize the evidence base. Our analysis revealed a robust overall effect, confirming the existence of a shape bias. However, this effect was characterized by extreme between-study heterogeneity (I² = 0.95). Critically, meta-regression analyses failed to support hypothesized developmental changes, with a constant model across ages providing the most parsimonious fit. The literature is overwhelmingly dominated by studies of English-speaking children, preventing meaningful tests of cross-linguistic or cross-cultural variation. We also found strong statistical evidence of publication bias, suggesting that the true effect size could be inflated in the published literature. Together, these findings indicate that procedural variation, besides a potential publication bias, more than currently testable theoretical moderators, account for the variability in the literature, severely limiting the ability to distinguish between theories of the shape bias's origins.",

          "abstract": "Sexual orientation essentialism, evident in “born this way” narratives, has long been enmeshed with pro-LGB attitudes. However, the relationship between these constructs is debated: does essentialism cause pro-LGB attitudes, or is it motivated by preexisting pro-LGB attitudes? In an experimental test of the motivated model, we presented participants across three studies (N = 750) with a passage either promoting or critiquing “born this way” narratives. Those in the “Born this way”-critical conditions demonstrated significantly less sexual orientation essentialism than those in the “Born this way”-supportive conditions, with condition effects particularly strong among liberals. Crucially, effects on essentialism were similar regardless of whether the critique was grounded in epistemic reasons (i.e., “born this way” is inaccurate) or moral motivations (i.e., “born this way” is harmful). There were no condition differences in pro-LGB attitudes. Thus, we find support for the motivated model: moral arguments alone can prompt the strategic attenuation of essentialism.",

          "authors": "Marco Mattei; John Michael",
          "abstract": "The sunk cost effect (SCE)—the tendency to persist in a failing course of action due to prior investments—has been well-documented in survey research, but behavioral evidence remains limited and inconsistent. Moreover, while recent studies suggest that people may also escalate commitment based on others’ prior investments, the so-called interpersonal sunk cost effect has yet to be tested behaviorally. To address these gaps, we developed a novel, fully controlled task and conducted two pre-registered experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to persist after personally investing effort, even under waste-free conditions. In Experiment 2, participants showed increased persistence when a partner had invested effort, providing the first behavioral evidence of the interpersonal SCE. Additionally, we observed an unpredicted main effect of social observation: participants were more likely to persist when they believed their decisions were visible to their partner, suggesting that reputational concerns may independently shape persistence behavior. Together, these findings challenge traditional self-justification and waste-aversion accounts and point instead to broader social and normative influences, including the role of commitment and public accountability in sunk cost sensitivity.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In autism spectrum condition (ASC), altered predictions (priors) or prediction errors have been hypothesized to increase the influence of bottom-up sensory input, relative to top-down prior knowledge. Such alterations could account for several autistic features, but their empirical basis is unclear. In neurotypical individuals (NT), multiple neuroimaging meta-analyses have aimed to outline domain-general ‘prediction networks’ of the brain. However, there has not been a similar meta-analysis in autism.\nMETHODS: We searched the literature for functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography studies with autistic participants. The contrasts that explicitly or implicitly involved the processing of priors/predictions and prediction errors were selected. Contrasts were divided into those that reported stronger activation in the ASC group compared to the NT group, and vice versa. We then tested the convergence of differences between the groups in two activation likelihood estimation meta-analyses.\nRESULTS: Activation differences in eight contrasts reporting stronger activation in ASC compared to NT (139 ASC; 150 NT) did not result in significant convergence. Activation differences in 13 contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC (261 ASC; 289 NT) converged in a cluster in the medial frontal gyrus/cingulate gyrus. Additionally, we identified 38 contrasts without significant group differences.\nCONCLUSION: We found converging activation differences (from contrasts reporting stronger activation in NT compared to ASC) in an area associated with error monitoring and uncertainty estimation. Our results are generally consistent with notions of altered priors/predictions or prediction errors in autism, pointing to differences at high levels of the information-processing hierarchy. However, we recommend a cautious interpretation, given the limited number of available contrasts and the high proportion of null results.",

          "abstract": "In recognition memory, the variance of the target distribution is almost universally found to be greater than that of the lure distribution. However, these estimates commonly come from long-term memory paradigms where words are used as stimuli. Two exceptions to this rule have found evidence for greater lure variability: a short-term memory task (Yotsumoto et al., 2008) and in an eyewitness memory paradigm (Wixted et al., 2018). In the present work, we conducted a series of recognition memory experiments using different stimulus (faces vs. words) along with different paradigms (long-term vs. short-term paradigms) to evaluate whether either of these conditions would result in greater variability in lure items. Greater target variability was observed across stimulus types and memory paradigms. This suggests that factors other than stimuli and retention interval might be responsible for cases where variability is less for targets than lures.",

As part of the Collaborative Replication and Education Project, 24 student groups from six countries (N = 3,774) investigated whether pro-environmental behavior can be promoted by priming status motives (desires for social status and prestige). This large, multi-site replication showed no evidence to support the hypothesis that hypothetical pro-environmental behavior can be stimulated by having participants read a story designed to prime status motives. We performed several exploratory analyses to investigate whether extension variables (i.e., equating “green” choices with prosocial behavior, political beliefs, sampling methods, location, duration of data collection, and gender) moderated the hypothesized effect of status motives on pro-environmental choices, but these analyses produced null results. One limitation of the study is that most data collection sites did not include a manipulation check, and the one site that did found a much weaker effect (d = 0.32) than the extremely large effect originally reported (d = 3.78). As a result, it remains unclear whether the null result reflects a failure of this specific priming method or a challenge to the underlying theory.

          "authors": "Marco Mattei; John Michael",
          "abstract": "In recent decades, a range of competing theories have been offered to explain why individuals sometimes persist in, or escalate commitment to, a suboptimal course of action because of prior investments of money, effort or other resources – i.e., the sunk cost effect. In evaluating these theories, it is important to identify scenarios in which they generate divergent predictions. We carried out 4 pre-registered experiments (N = 1,481) implementing two such types of scenarios: (1) waste-free scenarios, in which the resource is not lost but can be repurposed to a new goal; and (2) interpersonal scenarios, in which the decision-maker is not the individual who made the prior investment. Experiment 1 demonstrates that another individual’s non-wasted effort significantly increases escalation of commitment. Experiment 2 shows that the other individual’s prior effort can boost escalation of commitment even more than one’s own. Experiment 3 provides evidence that the effect of others’ prior investments may be driven by social expectations.  Experiment 4 replicates the effect of another individual’s prior investment while yielding no evidence that it  makes any difference whether the initial decision was made jointly or by the other individual alone. Taken together, our findings challenge theories focused on waste aversion and self-justification, and highlight the complexity of ways in which social context shapes sunk cost reasoning.",

Results showed that greater peer victimization history related to increased SS, NA, and NA persistence (i.e., higher inertia). These findings align with the social information processing model and prevention hypothesis, demonstrating that peer victimization takes an emotional toll on adolescents, leading to increased social stress, negative affect, and increased persistence of negative affect. Understanding these impacts is crucial for understanding how peer victimization may lead to emotional difficulties over time.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety disorders (ANX) are common and impairing mental health conditions. This study aimed to classify self-reported symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic attacks as two psychopathological manifestations of ANX by applying machine learning to a cross-sectional dataset of 26,378 adults from the German National Cohort Study (NAKO). We first explored linear relationships between preselected neuroimaging correlates in MRI scans and anxiety phenotypes. Overall, sex-stratified correlation coefficients - while partly highly signifi-cant - were extremely low with r ≤ .04 for panic attacks and r ≤ .06 for GAD symptoms after correction for confounding variables like childhood trauma and depression. We then examined the combined classifying value of whole-brain imaging data of 246 ROIs in addition to psycho-social variables such as self-reported depression symptoms, stress, and childhood trauma, using four machine learning algorithms (support-vector machines with linear and radial kernels, elastic-net regression, and random forest). Neuroimaging data, particularly gray-matter vol-umes in regions such as the amygdala and superior parietal lobule, contributed to classifica-tion, but performance was substantially better when psychosocial variables were added. For both GAD symptoms and panic attacks, depression, stress and childhood trauma were the clearest indicators the classification would show the condition was present. Random forest models based on psychosocial variables alone achieved the highest discrimination perfor-mance for GAD symptoms (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC = 0.973) and panic attacks (AUROC = 0.933). Combining neuroimaging and psychosocial varia-bles in elastic-net regressions further improved specificity. These results support multimodal approaches to diagnose and investigate ANX that integrate structural brain abnormalities and psychosocial measures to capture the complexity of GAD and panic attacks, enabling the crea-tion of individual risk profiles based on multiple biomarkers. These profiles may guide tailored therapeutic and preventive interventions.",

Eighty-five participants (42 low dysphoria, 43 high dysphoria) submitted photos of positive events from both perspectives. Later, participants recalled these events while viewing either a first- or third-person photo and rated and described their memory. While first-person photos promoted more field-perspective recall regardless of dysphoria level, dysphoria was still associated with greater observer recall, reduced mental imagery, and lower internal episodic detail. Additionally, dysphoria predicted less focus on the meaning of pictured events in general, and lower positive and higher negative emotional impact of recalling the events in the presence of first-person photo cues. Thus, while photo cues can shift memory vantage point, but emotional engagement remains constrained by mood-related biases.",

While cross sectional studies have identified risk factors and gender differences, long term trajectories remain unclear.\nObjective: This study investigates the stability and progression of PCS-S and PCS-R scores after 9, 24 and 36 months from initial diagnosis, identifying key predictive factors stratified by gender.\nMethods: We analyzed data from 1,526 participants of the German National Pandemic Cohort Network (NAPKON), modeling symptom-based PCS-score trajectories over time with linear mixed effects mod-els. Data were split into training (n=944), test (n=233), and two-site external validation (n=349) sets. Gender stratified elastic net regression used nine month clinical and psychosocial measures to predict PCS scores at 24 and 36 months.\nResults: PCS-S and PCS-R scores showed small but significant declines between 9 and 36 months (β = –0.054 and –0.065, respectively; p &lt; .001), indicating persistent symptom burden despite gradual im-provement. Predictive models explained 16.7–52.6% of variance in later PCS severity. Fatigue after 9 months and age predicted later PCS-S; quality of life and depression added predictive value in females. Fatigue and sleep issues predicted PCS-R, with living/employment status relevant in females and cog-nitive deficits in males.\nConclusion: The severity of PCS subtype manifest after 9 months remains relatively stable over time, with distinct gender-specific predictors shaping symptom progression.

Consensus of the thematic analysis of the transcripts was finalized after a member check. Analysis of the nine interview topics resulted into six major themes: 1) Potential positive vs. negative effects; 2) Narrative content and modality; 3) Public availability vs. anonymity; 4) Freedom vs. structure; 5) Platform structuring; and 6) Contact options and emotional support. Member checking confirmed credibility of the findings. Developing a structured yet tailored RN intervention as part of mental healthcare treatment seems promising.

Additional variables were assessed through self-reports measuring personality traits, attachment styles, behavioral maladjustment, socioemotional well-being, and risk behaviors. The analysis identified five distinct profiles, including one with high CU and low NA (primary variant) and two emotionally dysregulated profiles (secondary variants): one predominantly high in CU, the other in NA. Profiles showed differences across multiple constructs at baseline and one year later, with secondary variants exhibiting greater emotional, social, and behavioral maladjustment.

One domain where numerical reasoning is especially critical is memory, where individuals often must estimate the likelihood that one event or idea is associated with another. In this study, participants completed a free association task across multiple sessions to generate their own individualized word-pair norms. Later, they provided numerical probability judgments (0–100%) of how often they had produced each pair. These judgments were compared to collective free association norms, a matched group evaluating others’ pairs, and a traditional control group. Results showed that participants who judged their own pairs were significantly more accurate in estimating associative probabilities than control or matched groups, reflecting the benefits of expertise derived from repeated interaction with stimuli. However, systematic overestimation bias persisted, especially for weak associations, indicating that metacognitive sensitivity to probability differences remains limited. These findings highlight how expertise improves, but does not perfect, the ability to translate memory associations into numerical judgments, offering new insights into the intersection of numerical cognition, metacognition, and memory.",

Within the insular cortex, distinct subregions have been associated with predictive or evaluative coding of homeostatic states. However, it is still elusive if functional segregation of insular subregions is impaired in MDD.\n\nTo test for loss of specificity within functional connectivity (FC) profiles of insular subregions in MDD, we measured resting-state fMRI in 433 patients with MDD and 417 healthy control participants (HCP) and compared the similarity (Pearson correlation) and density (shift function) between 6 subregional FC profiles for MDD and HCP. To evaluate the clinical utility of similarity of FC profiles, we tested whether MDD can be classified on an individual level.\n\nWe found greater similarity between FC profiles of insular subregions in MDD compared to HCP which was driven by a decrease in similarity and a greater FC density within the anterior insular cortex (AIC). On the individual level, insular FC profiles significantly predicted MDD, but the accuracy scaled with symptom severity.\n\nLoss of functional segregation and a greater FC density within the AIC may indicate alterations in interoceptive signals at rest in MDD. The increase in predictive power with increasing symptom severity substantiates insular functional segregation as an index of pathophysiology and supports a model in which prolonged deviations from homeostasis might drive individuals into an energy-deficient state that characterizes depression.",

This phenomenon is often observed in real-world scenarios, such as when people place greater value on a meeting with a friend who is about to leave or in marketing, where consumers are willing to pay more for a flight when only a few tickets remain available. But why does this happen? This paper explores the dynamics behind this behavior, focusing on how subjective value increases as reference standards—considered as expectations about the future availability of events—decrease over time. We introduce a computational model to investigate the relationship between subjective value and the probability of exerting effort to attain an event under varying reference standards. The model demonstrates how deviations from these reference standards influence the perceived value of an event, with the likelihood of exerting effort rising as the perceived value increases relative to alternatives. Through simulations, we explore the psychological and economic implications of reference-dependent valuation, offering insights into how changes in perceived value drive effortful decision-making. The findings shed light on reference-dependent behavior in both everyday and high-stakes decision-making contexts.",

In this study, we quantified whether participants (N = 100) gained insight from their personalized feedback in a pre-post- design. We provided participants with a novel type of feedback about frequency distributions of their affective experiences as captured by EMA data. We compared this feedback to frequency distributions that participants estimated of all their affective experiences, both before before and after seeing their feedback. We found that participants’ initial estimates were often close to their personalized feedback. However, there were large interindividual differences in this difference score, as well as the extent to which participants changed their initial estimate in response to the personalized feedback. Overall, participants changed their estimates such that the means and standard deviations of the distributions were closer to those of their feedback. However, the means and standard deviations of participant’s estimated distributions - both before and after receiving feedback - were usually higher than those of the respective feedback. These latter findings can either be interpreted as a persistent retrospective bias towards salient experiences, or a shortcoming of EMA data to capture salient experiences.",

          "abstract": "The persuasive power of social media influencers has been well-demonstrated in the context of commercial goals, but whether influencers can be successfully employed for health messages and in particular fear appeals remain unclear. The current research explores two factors that may enhance the effectiveness of persuasive health messages using influencers: whether media users have a pre-existing bond, i.e., parasocial relationship (PSR) with the influencer, and whether the influencer directly addresses the user on a verbal and bodily level. In two online experiments, female social media users (18-30 y/o) were exposed to a set of fictional Instagram posts on eating disorder prevention. Study 1 (N = 233) employed a 2 (pre-existing PSR: yes vs. no) x 2 (verbal addressing: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. Study 2 (N = 225) used a 2 (verbal addressing: yes vs. no) x 2 (bodily addressing: yes vs. no) between-subjects design. The results showed that messages conveyed by an influencer with whom media users had a pre-existing (vs. no) parasocial relationship elicited higher parasocial interaction (PSI), which was in turn associated with an increase in message-supporting thoughts and subsequently behavioral intentions (assessed immediately) and actual behavior (assessed one week after message reception). No significant effects of verbal and bodily addressing were found. Employing influencers for eating disorder prevention seems most effective when individuals have a parasocial friendship with the influencer. Future research should explore if and how direct addressing can be effectively applied in social media health campaigns.",

          "abstract": "Background: Cardiac anxiety (CA) is a commonly occurring condition in populations with both cardiac and mental health conditions. It is assessed using the CA questionnaire (CAQ), which has been translated to several languages and its validity and reliability has been investigated using classical test theory. The factor structure of the CAQ remains uncertain, and no study has investigated the psychometric properties of the CAQ using modern test theory approaches. The aim of this study was to use Rasch analysis to test the validity and reliability of the original 18-item CAQ in a Swedish sample of patients with myocardial infarction, as well as other scales, based on previous findings.\nMethods: Participants were 754 patients after myocardial infarction with preserved cardiac function. Data were fitted to the Rasch model, investigating dimensionality, ordering of response categories, invariance, targeting and measurement uncertainty. Additionally, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using a weighted least mean squares estimator and dynamic fit indices.\nResults: All three subscales indicated problems with dimensionality and several items had disordered response categories, and with some of them minimal distance between steps. Many items displayed local dependency. There were also small problems with differential item functioning. Person locations were lower than the item threshold locations, but there were no significant floor or ceiling effects. The CFA also demonstrated a poor model fit of the three subscales in the 18-item version of the CAQ. An iterative removal of items resulted in a modified 10-item version still with questionable poor reliability.\nConclusions: The original 18-item version of the CAQ did not fit the Rasch model. The major problems with the 18-item version were dimensionality, local dependency, and disordered response categories. No other version of the CAQ achieved acceptable fit to the Rasch model. These results indicate that the CAQ is lacking in terms of reliability and a revision of the scale is called for.",

          "abstract": "Deliberative, effortful thinking supports better reasoning about science, politics, and everyday problems, but what drives its engagement remains unclear. One possibility is that low confidence acts as a trigger for deliberation. Across four preregistered experiments (N ≈ 1,200), we provide a causal test of this hypothesis. Participants received manipulated feedback about their performance on classic reasoning problems (bat-and-ball or base-rate tasks) presented in standard, single response formats (Studies 1-2) or two-response formats in which participants give both a timed and an untimed response for each problem (Studies 3-4). In the single-response studies, negative feedback reliably reduced confidence and increased response times compared to control and positive feedback. In the two-response studies, negative feedback again reduced confidence and lengthened response times. Critically, it also increased the likelihood of revising initial answers and prolonged second-stage response times—hallmarks of deliberation. Moreover, feedback-affected confidence, measured immediately after initial, timed responses and before deliberation was possible, predicted both revisions and extended second-stage processing. Together, these findings offer robust causal evidence that confidence regulates the deployment of deliberative reasoning and clarify what makes us “think it through”.",

When multiple healthcare providers are involved in the treatment, integration within interdisciplinary healthcare networks and effective communication become crucial, but challenging. The current study aimed to examine the structure and composition of the healthcare network of individuals with CP and their association with treatment satisfaction, well-being (depression, anxiety, anger, social isolation), and functioning (pain interference). Key network characteristics of interest were healthcare network density, the centrality of the general practitioner in the network, and healthcare discipline heterogeneity. \nMethods\nA four-wave online questionnaire was completed by 232 individuals with CP (179 women, mean age of 49 years). \nResults\nAnalyses of 2,745 healthcare relations showed a robust association between network density and perceived treatment satisfaction; however, no significant associations were observed with depression, anxiety, anger, pain interference, and social isolation. Additionally, the findings showed that participants who perceived more communication between their GP and other healthcare providers also reported greater treatment satisfaction; but there was no association with well-being or functioning. Contrary to expectations, while the number of different healthcare disciplines was not related to depression, anger, or pain interference, it was positively associated with anxiety and social isolation. \nDiscussion\nThese findings highlight the complexity of healthcare networks in CP management and suggest that examining healthcare networks from a structural perspective may offer valuable insights for future research, clinical practice, and policy development.",

Suicidal behavior disorder (SBD), included in DSM-5 for research purposes, has not yet been examined in this population.\nMethods: In a sample of N = 103 treatment-seeking refugees, SBD prevalence was assessed using a clinical interview. Associations between suicidality (presence and severity) and risk factors—gender, age, PTSD, disorders of self-organization (DSO), depression, insecure asylum status, flight duration, postmigration living difficulties (PMLD)—as well as the protective factor religiosity were examined via univariate and multivariate analyses.\nResults: SBD prevalence was 14.41% (n = 15). DSO and an insecure asylum status were associated with the presence of suicidality in univariate and multivariate analyses and with the severity of suicidality in multivariate analyses. Sexual trauma frequency was associated with the presence of suicidality, while PTSD severity and lower religiosity were linked to greater suicidality severity. Depressive symptoms were associated with suicidality only in univariate analyses.\nConclusion: Suicidality should be systematically assessed in treatment-seeking refugees, particularly those with DSO or an insecure asylum status. Brief suicide prevention interventions may be warranted when treatment duration is uncertain, and targeted PTSD treatments should be offered when indicated.",

          "abstract": "Vocal development research has focused on auditory feedback-based and statistical learning mechanisms, with less attention on reinforcement principles. This review examines the effects of contingent feedback on human vocal development using reinforcement learning frameworks, based on an analysis of 70 empirical studies. A literature search using the terms \"vocal learning,\" \"vocal reinforcement,\" and \"vocal contingency\" identified three study categories: contingent imitation effects (12 studies), other contingent feedback effects (33 studies), and additional contingent feedback effects (21 studies). Analysis using the antecedent-behavior-consequence framework revealed that contingent responses increase vocal production rates and modify vocal quality, with contingent imitation being especially effective. Three effects accompany the increase in target behavior, including phonological change, collateral increase, and preparatory learning. Evidence also demonstrates other effects of contingent feedback, such as enhanced object recognition learning and longitudinal language development outcomes. In sum, empirical studies show that contingent feedbacks on human vocal behavior have reinforcement effects, a positive correlation with vocalization rate, and longitudinal effects on development. Thus, vocal learning is not merely imitative or developmental, but also shaped by structured environmental feedback.",

In this Perspective, we synthesize genetic, biological, developmental, psychosocial, societal, cultural, and clinical research on illbeing and wellbeing. Our review reveals substantial genetic overlap and similar biological underpinnings for illbeing and wellbeing. In contrast, environmental factors and societal changes often exert divergent influences. We propose a differentiated multidisciplinary framework in which the shared and unique determinants, predictors, mechanisms, and consequences of mental illbeing and wellbeing vary across levels of analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections.",

          "abstract": "A growing body of research has investigated the emergence and developmental trajectory of children’s information search abilities. In this paper, we examine the capacity of 2- to 4-year-olds to identify and select the most informative cue among several options when searching for a hidden reward—a common task in decision-making research where young children have traditionally struggled. Across two experiments—including a preregistered replication—we tested 111 children (56 female) aged 24 to 59 months using a simplified version of Lindow’s (2021) finding-presents game. Children were presented with three cue cards (e.g., color, shape, icon) to determine which box contained a hidden present. Because only one feature differentiated the target box (for example, all boxes were blue and had a sticker on top, but varied in shape), only one cue card provided informative guidance. The children’s choices of cue cards served as the primary dependent measure. In Experiment 1, children aged 2 to 4 selected the relevant cue card at rates significantly above chance. Experiment 2 focused specifically on 2-year-olds and demonstrated that their choices were not driven by a saliency heuristic. Together, these findings reveal the early emergence of pre-decisional information search abilities in preschoolers and introduce a straightforward, effective paradigm for assessing early information-seeking skills.",

          "abstract": "Multilevel cosinor models can be used to study individual differences in circadian rhythms in intensive longitudinal data (ILD) obtained with experience sampling or passive sensing throughout the day. This allows examining how individuals differ with respect to their overall level, strength of trend, and peak timings, and how these relate to each other and other covariates. However, current estimation methods in psychology suffer from critical but overlooked flaws. Specifically, standard approaches cannot properly test for a cycle's absence. We demonstrate with empirical data that a majority of individuals may not have a cycle at all. Additionally, and more critically,  these techniques ignore the circular nature of peak timing defined on a 24-hour clock. This oversight leads to inaccurate peak time estimates (off by many hours) with vastly inflated uncertainty, both individually (level-1) and on average (level-2). The severity of these issues hinges on the clock time the researcher assumes a cycle starts. Furthermore, conventional correlation measures involving peak timing become uninterpretable, as their sign, strength, and significance are dependent on the same arbitrary decision. To resolve these pitfalls, we integrate methods from circular statistics within a robust Bayesian framework, allowing researchers to assess whether or not cycles are present, obtain accurate peak estimates, and utilize proper circular-linear correlation measures. Using empirical affective and heart rate data, we demonstrate the practical severity of these issues. We conclude with a call for the behavioral sciences to integrate well-established methods from other fields and propose a foundation for future research involving multimodal data.",

We then introduce specific instances of converging evidence between the fields, suggesting that presence and reality are likely to be constituted by the same integrative theoretical models, psychophysical mechanisms and neural architecture. Evidence from neuroimaging supports this claim, revealing overlapping brain regions involved in both presence and reality perception. This reconceptualization of VR presence as reality has implications  for research on consciousness, psychiatric disorders involving reality perception, and the use of virtual reality as a tool for studying and modifying perceptual experience. Future research should directly compare presence and reality mechanisms to explore their functional and neural equivalence, potentially redefining how we study consciousness and perception.",

          "abstract": "Facilitation in word processing, identified as faster responses to semantically related words, has traditionally been viewed as evidence of the core cognitive mechanisms that support language processing. However, it remains uncertain whether this facilitation arises from bottom-up spreading activation, top-down prediction, or a combination of both. To address this, we developed a novel semantic priming paradigm that systematically manipulates local contextual buildup and applied drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to differentiate the decision dynamics associated with each mechanism. In our experiment, 20 participants performed a lexical decision task on targets preceded by either one (short condition) or three (long condition) semantically related primes. We found that, as the local semantic context became more enriched (short vs. long condition), participants adjusted their decision strategies, engaging different processing mechanisms. In the short condition, participants relied on spreading activation, as indicated by increased drift rate (faster evidence accumulation), suggesting that a single related prime pre-activated the target's mental representation. In contrast, in the long condition, reduced boundary separation (participants required less evidence before responding) implied greater confidence driven by enhanced predictability from multiple primes, consistent with the predictive processing account. Together, our findings offer new insights into theoretical models of language processing; demonstrate the practical relevance of DDM in language processing and offer potential implications for translational research.",

This preprocessing influence, which operates beneath the threshold of deliberate thought, represents a crucial missing layer in the understanding of distributed cognition. This paper introduces \"Cognitive Infrastructure Studies\" (CIS) as a new interdisciplinary domain to reconceptualize AI as \"cognitive infrastructures\". Cognitive infrastructures – e.g., search engines, recommender systems, algorithmic curation platforms, and large language models - exhibit classic infrastructural properties: they are invisible in normal operation, becoming visible only upon breakdown; they are embedded in social and technical arrangements; they are learned as part of membership in digital communities; they link with conventions of practice; and they embody standards that shape what counts as appropriate, relevant, or true. Yet cognitive infrastructures possess distinctive characteristics that distinguish them from traditional infrastructures. Unlike physical infrastructures that passively transport matter or energy, cognitive infrastructures have agency, filtering and curating individuals’ perception of reality before it reaches human consciousness.  Through narrative scenarios spanning individual (cognitive dependency), collective (democratic deliberation), and societal (governance) scales, we describe how cognitive infrastructures reshape human cognition, public reasoning, and social epistemologies. CIS also provides methodological innovations for studying invisible algorithmic influence: “infrastructure breakdown methodologies”, experimental approaches that reveal cognitive dependencies by systematically withdrawing AI preprocessing after periods of habituation.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) offers a powerful tool to investigate brain connectivity by probing cortical excitability and network dynamics. Current methodologies for connectivity analysis in TMS-EEG include various methodologies to quantify effective connectivity and functional connectivity through the analysis of TMS-evoked potentials (TEP), each capturing distinct features of interareal communication. While effective connectivity approaches quantify signal propagation, they may miss network dynamics revealed by frequency-specific oscillatory patterns relevant for higher-order sensory, motor, and cognitive processes. Functional connectivity metrics applied in TEP analysis can provide deeper insight into state-dependent neural interactions. This narrative review explores current methodologies and recent applications, highlighting their potential and pitfalls, and emphasizing the need for benchmarking to frame their utility in cognitive and clinical neuroscience research.",

          "abstract": "Truly understanding the position of ideological opponents is challenging, yet crucial if our goals are to avoid escalation or further polarisation, identify areas of agreement, and ultimately reduce misunderstanding. We operationalise the idea of an ‘Ideological Turing Test’, as a behavioural measure of the extent to which people are able to accurately represent the position of their ideological opponents. The original ‘Turing Test’ challenged any artificial intelligence to successfully mimic human dialogue- the test would be passed if a human was convinced that the machine was a human. The Ideological Turing Test has been proposed (Caplan 2011 Econlib) as a requirement for would-be human debaters - can they successfully mimic their ideological opponent’s arguments to the extent that their opponent endorses the argument as strongly as their own? Crucially, this ‘Test’ offers a behavioural measure of open mindedness which goes beyond self-report measures. It is not possible to pass an Ideological Turing Test by believing you understand the other’s perspective - you must articulate those arguments to the satisfaction of those who hold them.  In this study, we operationalise the Ideological Turing Test by recruiting participants from opposite sides of commonly polarising debates (Covid-19 Vaccines, Brexit, Veganism), and asking them to provide reasons both for and against their position. These reasons were rated by participants from the opposite side of the debate. Our criteria for “passing” the Ideological Turing Test is if an argument is agreed with by opponents to the same extent or higher than arguments made by proponents. We found no difference in minority or majority positions in their ability to pass the Ideological Turing Test (i.e. no difference in passing rate between those who are for or against Covid-19 vaccines). However we did find that those who pass the Ideological Turing Test are less judgemental towards their opponents, in that they are less likely to rate them as ignorant, immoral or irrational. The Ideological Turing Test not only provides a  behavioural measure of open-mindedness, it also provides insights into the scope and diversity of arguments within and between polarising topics.",

          "authors": "Beatrice G. Kuhlmann; Nikoletta Symeonidou; Hilal Tanyas; Karen Mitchell; Moshe Naveh-Benjamin",
          "abstract": "Although item memory (e.g., remembering seeing your sunglasses) and source memory (e.g., remembering seeing them on the top shelf) have been dissociated both behaviorally and neurologically, little is known about dissociations in their forgetting patterns. A neuropsychological theory of forgetting (Hardt et al., 2013) predicts dissociated forgetting patterns depending on whether a memory is represented in the hippocampus or not. Extra-hippocampally represented memories, such as item memory, should be particularly susceptible to short-term, primarily interference-based forgetting. Hippocampus-dependent source memory should be protected from short-term forgetting but prone to long-term, primarily decay-based forgetting. We tested these predictions in three experiments (Ns = 164 to 210) in which participants studied object pictures in different screen locations. Item (object) and source (location) memory were tested at different retention intervals manipulated between subjects: immediately, after a short period (~10 min) of (similar or dissimilar) mental activity or intended low activity (audio-guided breathing exercise; wakeful rest), or on the next day. Across all experiments, there was no forgetting in source memory over any of the short retention intervals, whereas item memory significantly declined across most of them. There was substantial forgetting over 24 hours in both item and source memory, with more long-term forgetting in source memory after accounting for the short-term forgetting in item memory. Thus, forgetting patterns are dissociated between item versus source memory, in line with the predictions by Hardt et al. Some questions remain regarding the role of similarity-based interference in the observed short-term forgetting in visual item recognition.",

Using data from nationally representative surveys of the Norwegian population, I report two studies investigating whether antizionist beliefs predict (1) justification of harassment and violence against Jews and (2) refusal to take a stance against such aggression. Study 1 (N = 1575) found support for both hypotheses. In a preregistered replication, Study 2 (N = 1653) confirmed these results. Follow-up analyses found that antizionist beliefs also predicted refusal to answer questions measuring blatant antisemitic prejudice.

          "abstract": "Facial recognition Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and humans both show systematic differences in face recognition accuracy for different demographic groups. Differential accuracy has been shown due to race, age and gender, raising important questions about the impact of facial recognition decisions on the fairness of society. Current methods for measuring bias require curating large databases of face images, which is labor-intensive, producing bespoke tests that cannot be easily shared or standardized due to data privacy. Here we develop a novel solution to this problem inspired by psychological research in face perception. We ask whether face averages can be used to predict face recognition accuracy differentials for DNNs and humans. We generate sets of average images from random samples of exemplar faces from a demographic group to measure the density of these sets in representational space. We find that this approach provides reliable predictions of differential accuracy across demographic groups in both DNNs and human participants. However, we also find evidence that face averages were not represented in the center of face categories. This finding should be addressed in future development of our approach, and also challenges influential cognitive models of face identity representation.",

          "abstract": "The question of which words are the most central or important to a language has been explored in various ways. In this study, we propose definitions of core vocabulary that are based on how language is learned, represented, and processed from psychological perspectives, and test these on a word prediction task. We aim to (1) compare core vocabulary based on word frequency in natural language, the content of word associations,\nand age-of-acquisition in terms of how well they are guessed in word prediction contexts, and (2) investigate the extent to which word prediction in language models aligns with humans, and if there are systematic differences between them, whether these can be captured by core vocabulary measures. Across two experiments, 867 participants completed a task which involved guessing target words that were missing from sentence contexts. Natural language-based core words were generally easier to guess, but when the degree to which these words were naturally predictable in the linguistic environment was taken into account, word association- and acquisition-based core words were easier to predict for reasons that went beyond this. Additionally, language models were able to account for people’s word prediction responses to a considerable extent, but there were also systematic deviations from these predictions which were able to be captured by word association-based coreness. The findings suggest that distributional relationships between words in text is not all there is to human word prediction, but that people may also rely on factors like communicative usefulness and multimodal or extralinguistic information.",

Negative affect predicted more perceived overprotection in the next moment.

          "abstract": "Background: Depression is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality in the U.S. While demographic risk patterns have persisted for decades, evolving sociopolitical contexts may drive disproportionate increases across groups. The Identity Vitality-Pathology (IVP) model posits that modifiable identity-related characteristics shape depression risk, with a vitalized identity—marked by an inclusive self-concept, intrinsic valuing of living beings, and universal compassion—protective against depression. This study examined the association between identity state and depression across Black and White women and men.\nMethods: Data came from 2,008 Black and White adults aged 35–65 in the 2025 Healthy Aging with Resilient Identities study. Stratified ordinal logistic regression models generated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for race-gender–specific predictors of depression.\nResults: Severe depression prevalence was highest among White men (9.3%), followed by White women (6.0%), Black women (3.8%), and Black men (3.2%). Higher IVP Scale (IVPS) scores—indicating greater identity vitality—were associated with lower odds of worse depression in all groups except White men. Compared to those with the lowest (Q1) IVPS scores, those in the highest (Q4) had 70% lower odds among Black women (aOR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) and Black men (aOR=0.3, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.8), and 90% lower odds among White women (aOR=0.1, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.3), but little difference among White men (aOR=0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5).\nConclusions: Findings suggest vitalized identity may reduce depression risk but also highlight the need for interventions attuned to the distinct racialized and gendered contexts shaping health.",

          "abstract": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are prevalent predictors of poor health outcomes in adulthood, but their impact on moral foundations remains underexplored. This quantitative cross-sectional study was an examination in to the effects of ACEs on adult morality and proposed affective personality traits and caregiving factors as possible mediating mechanisms. The researcher administered a comprehensive online survey to a global sample of N = 376 English-speaking adults, comprised of four validated survey measures that assessed both retrospective and present experiences, traits, and character styles. The survey assessed ACE exposure (10-item ACE-Q), species-typical caregiving practices (EDNH), the Affective Neuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS), and the 20-item Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-20), an assessment of moral intuitions derived from Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). The researcher designed the study to test the trauma/Thriving-Emotions-Morality (tTEM) framework, which posits that emotions are primary in moral beliefs and are cultivated through childhood relationships. Results from group comparisons between high-ACE (≥4) and low-ACE (≤ 3) participants indicated small but significant differences, with high-ACE participants tending toward higher Individualizing and lower Binding moral foundations scores compared to low-ACE participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated a mediated link between ACEs and MFT, where positive personality traits and heightened EDNH scores positively predicted both Binding and Individualizing moral foundations. These results suggest that early nurturance promotes positive emotional development, shaping moral proclivities. Such research is instructive for clinicians, educators, and policymakers alike, informing existing practices and promoting the future development of enrichment programs that support positive childhood experiences and later moral development.",

Yet many fathers use less than their entitlement. Limited studies suggest workplace peers may encourage fathers to take more leave, but evidence is mixed, leaving uncertainty about who is influenced and when.\n\nThis study explores educational heterogeneity in direct workplace peer effects on fathers’ parental leave usage, aiming to understand which fathers in which contexts are influenced by peers. We utilise Finnish full-population administrative registers and linked employer-employee data on fathers’ leave uptake in 2009–2019, covering 117,837 births. Structural causal models and Bayesian multilevel logistic regression are used to examine how preceding fathers’ leave influences new fathers.\n\nFindings show that peers’ leave usage positively influences new fathers, with low-educated fathers more affected than highly educated ones. Peer effects were strongest in workplaces with no prior leave uptake and declined as more fathers began taking leave, especially among skilled men.\n\nWorkplace peer effects are a key mechanism behind rising leave uptake between policy reforms. In contexts with limited information on leave consequences, peers serve as important sources of learning—particularly for low-educated men—but the informational value declines as uptake becomes more common.",

          "authors": "Sameer Meralli",
          "abstract": "The discovery of Homo floresiensis on the island of Flores ignited a longstanding debate regarding the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the taxon’s unique small body size and mosaic morphology as compared to other Homo variants. Homo floresiensis’ reduced cranial capacity combined with dissimilar gracile and robust postcranial features became a point of contention in finding a clear identity in the Homo pathology. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this divergence: the Phyletic Dwarfism Hypothesis, which posits descent from Homo erectus via insular dwarfism driven by deterministic selection, and the Genetic Drift Hypothesis, which attributes its unique morphology to neutral evolutionary processes in a small, isolated population. This study quantitatively tests these competing hypotheses using a multivariate morphometric approach applied to 3D landmark data from the H. floresiensis holotype (LB1) and comparative samples of H. erectus, H. habilis, Australopithecus, H. sapiens, and great apes. Using Brownian motion simulations of genetic drift, allometric analyses, and applying tests of morphological integration this paper aims to reveal a more precise evolutionary history of Homo floresiensis.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines how land-based climate mitigation strategies under the European Green Deal raise crucial questions about the distribution and democratic control of land resources. The research analyses the intersection of carbon neutrality-driven land-use changes with existing patterns of land grabbing and concentration, revealing significant limitations in current just-transition approaches. Through a critical analysis of European climate policy frameworks and land governance mechanisms, the study demonstrates that the land dimension represents a notable blind spot in just-transition approaches. The findings indicate that existing frameworks, primarily focused on industrial restructuring and labor market adaptation, cannot adequately address the challenges of ensuring democratic access to and control over land resources. The paper proposes the concept of a \"land-just transition\" as a necessary evolution, advocating for the explicit integration of land justice considerations into climate transition frameworks. This approach would expand beyond compensation and adaptation to address fundamental questions of land governance and democratic control. The research concludes by identifying key areas requiring further investigation, including empirical analysis of land control patterns, development of policy instruments for ensuring land justice, and theoretical elaboration of land justice within just transition frameworks.",

          "title": "Lawful Handgun Licensing, Population Density, Poverty, Police Staffing, And Personal Violent Crime: A Two-Cohort Comparison of U.S. Jurisdictions (2023-2024)",
          "authors": "Daniel J. Freeman",
          "abstract": "Objective.  Prior research on gun ownership and violent crime has yielded inconsistent conclusions, largely because nearly all studies rely on proxy measures of prevalence - surveys, state-level aggregates, or policy classifications - that cannot isolate handgun ownership, cannot confirm lawful versus illicit possession, and are vulnerable to confounding.  For example, Kleck (1997) and Cook &amp; Ludwig (2006) highlighted measurement error as the main barrier to inference, Siegel et al. (2014) reported positive associations using household survey proxies, and Donohue et al. (2019) found liberalized right-to-carry regimes associated with higher violent crime, but with treatment defined as legal regime type rather than actual prevalence.  As the National Research Council concluded in its landmark 2004 review, available studies were too compromised by proxy limitations and unmeasured confounders to provide reliable evidence of causal effects.\n\nDesign.  This study is the first to eliminate that uncertainty by restricting analysis to U.S. jurisdictions that publish auditable, administrative counts of active resident handgun licenses.  We constructed two cohorts: A (higher licensing prevalence, mean ≈ 10.7% of residents) and B (lower prevalence, ≤1.6%).  We then compared two-year (2023-2024) totals for homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault per 100,000 residents, with covariates for poverty (%), sworn law-enforcement staffing (LEO per 100,000) and population density.  We estimated cohort means and rate ratios, Pearson correlations with Fisher-z intervals, OLS slopes of violent rate on licensing share, and Poisson GLMs with log(population) offsets to report percent change per +1-percentage point increase in licensed share.\n\nResults.  Mean violent crime was ≈ 542 per 100,000 in Cohort A versus ≈ 1,238 per 100,000 in Cohort B (rate ratio ≈ 2.28, 95% CI 1.52-3.43).  Each +1-percentage point increase in licensing share corresponded to ≈ 7.6% lower violent incidence (IRR 0.924; 95% CI 0.890-0.958), or ≈ 60-70 fewer incidents per 100,000 depending on model specification.  Adjusting for poverty or LEO staffing attenuated but did not eliminate the association.  Population density was negatively correlated.  Sensitivity analyses excluding outliers (Flint, MI and Washington, DC) yielded consistent results.\n\nConclusions.  This study is the first to demonstrate, using clean administrative licensing exposure measures, that higher lawful handgun ownership prevalence is strongly and inversely associated with personal violent crime.  The association is robust across models and covariates, survives outlier tests, and directly addresses the measurement weaknesses that have limited prior scholarship.  Unlike advocacy-sponsored work, this study is independent, fully transparent, and reproducible, providing the strongest evidence to date that lawful handgun prevalence aligns with substantially lower violent crime rates.  We emphasize correlation rather than causation, highlight demographic, lifestyle and illicit-market limitations, and provide a reproducibility appendix with administrative URLs to support independent audit.",

          "abstract": "Social media content filtering algorithms can both provide desired personalized content and ads for users. However, sometimes these recommendations can resemble individual private information. How might users navigate these experiences to best manage their private information? The present exploratory study utilizes the rules- and systems-based framework of communication privacy management (CPM) theory to explore social media users’ (N = 636) experiences of privacy breakdowns with social media algorithms and investigates what users do in response to said breakdowns.

          "authors": "Matthew J. A. Craig",
          "abstract": "Data about individual users drives today's social media content-filtering algorithm recommendations. Through nuanced interactions with social media algorithms, such as human-algorithm interplay, the end user effortlessly cultivates a social media feed. While this level of personalization can significantly benefit the user, recommended ads and content sometimes resemble aspects of the user's private lives that they may not have wanted the algorithm or platform to know. Moreover, though users dislike these experiences of privacy violations, they still disclose private information to the system due to fatigue in managing online privacy altogether. This current study integrates communication privacy management (CPM) theory (Petronio, 2002) into the human-algorithm interaction context to examine the extent to which social media users (N = 1,305) engage in open privacy management practices with social media platforms via their algorithms, depending on their felt privacy fatigue. Results from using latent moderated structural equations (LMS) suggest that individuals’ awareness of algorithms is negatively associated with using open privacy management practices with social media algorithms. However, this depends on their felt privacy fatigue, such that individuals who are both highly aware and highly fatigued are likely to be more closed off in sharing private information with social media algorithms, thus granting less co-ownership rights to social media platforms. In light of these findings, implications for future research on communication privacy management in the context of social media algorithms are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Policy debates have increasingly focused on further training in adulthood as a tool to promote equal career opportunities. Yet it remains empirically unclear whether further training acts as an equaliser, reducing exist-ing wage inequalities, or as an amplifier, reinforcing the Gender Pay Gap. This article examines whether the wage returns to non-formal job-related further training differ between women and men. We use data from the adult cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (2007–2023) and apply individual fixed-effects panel regression models with a cumulative approach to estimate the long-term effects of participa-tion in further training on wages. Our findings show that both men and women benefit from further training. However, men achieve significantly higher wage gains from longer spells of participation, particularly in selective, employer-provided formats. Leadership positions further amplify men’s returns. Although gaps in training participation have narrowed and in part reversed, returns show no equalising potential and instead contribute to the persistence of the Gender Pay Gap. Building on Relational Inequality Theory, our findings contribute to the broader debate on inequality reproduction through gendered claims-making by focusing on further training in organisational and institutional contexts.",

Using a national sample (N = 1,081), this study explores the racial divide in officer avoidance, the role of contact type, and the impact of police-related fear. We expect that officer avoidance will be highest among Black Americans, especially for involuntary contacts, because of elevated fear of police mistreatment. The findings are consistent with this theoretical expectation. Black Americans report more officer avoidance than their White counterparts. Fear of the police increases avoidance, both for voluntary and involuntary police contacts, although the effect is largest for involuntary contacts. These findings support growing evidence that avoidance of law enforcement contact stems from fear of police mistreatment, which derives from prior personal and vicarious mistreatment.",

However, existing research has treated these phenomena separately, leading to disconnected bodies of literature. This paper demonstrates that malapportionment can be used as an instrument of gerrymandering. Conventional gerrymandering tactics of cracking and packing can be more sophisticated when the district boundary drawers in power can control the district populations. \nWe illustrate this new yet simple gerrymandering strategy using the case of Malaysia, a long-lasting electoral authoritarian regime that endured from the early 1970s to 2018, focusing on ethnic representation. By comparing the enacted districting plan with counterfactual electoral districts simulated through Sequential Monte Carlo redistricting simulation, we identify significant ethnic gerrymandering against the minority Chinese Malaysians, in which cracking and packing are the strategies adopted by the majority Malay-dominated ruling coalition.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a dynamic equilibrium framework that reinterprets persistent macroeconomic issues—global imbalances, long-run deflation or entrenched inequality—not as market failures, but as structural outcomes. Departing from standard nominal‑adjustment models, it incorporates asset‑side mechanisms and reconsiders the transversality condition (TVC), deriving: R_t-ρ=n+D_a-U_(θa)θ/U_c; This balance means the divergence between asset returns (R_t) and time preference (ρ) is sustained by the balance of capital diffusion (D_a), population growth (n) and preference terms (U_(θa)θ/U_c). As result, equilibrium arises from structural and institutional interplay beyond a price‑clearing mechanism. Simultaneously, by redefining the TVC as a structural condition on asset valuation resulting from this framework, we explain how steady states with persistent differences in asset levels and external balances can coexist. Redefining imbalances as the result of endogenous optimization in this way enables economic understanding that is in line with the realities of economies and provides tools for designing practical policies—for example, Structural Selection of the Steady State, Policy Control of Capital Flows, Asset Dynamics–Based Policy Reconstruction and so on—. This enables economics to reflect the realities of economic society and address structural challenges.",

          "authors": "Angelo Falzarano",
          "abstract": "Digital micro-movements are distinctive phenomena of the contemporary era, characterized by horizontality, rapid mobilization, and strong dependence on algorithmic infrastructures. They are not merely an online transposition of traditional mobilizations but introduce new forms of solidarity, leadership, and collective consciousness. By integrating classical sociological theory, Durkheim, Weber, Marx, Simmel, and Elias, with recent perspectives from media and digital activism studies (Castells, Tufekci, Bennett &amp; Segerberg, Zuboff), this paper develops a framework centered on three categories: networked solidarity, diffused leadership, and algorithmic consciousness. A qualitative and comparative analysis of three emblematic cases, #MeToo, Fridays for Future, and Black Lives Matter, highlights emancipatory potentials (global amplification, rapid coordination, symbolic pressure) as well as structural vulnerabilities (dependence on algorithmic visibility, risk of slacktivism, corporate co-optation). The study shows how the same technological infrastructure that enables collective mobilization also functions as a space of surveillance, manipulation, and co-optation, thereby reshaping the relationship between movements, platforms, and institutions. The article argues for a continuous conceptual renewal: the classics should not be abandoned but reinterpreted in the light of the network society and surveillance capitalism. The three proposed categories aim to provide analytical tools to grasp the tensions between emancipation and control and to imagine hybrid strategies capable of translating the fluid energy of digital mobilization into lasting institutional change.",

          "abstract": "This article presents an analysis of the impact of the number of alters elicited in an ego network on the structural properties of those networks. There continues to be debate about the pros and cons of eliciting a fixed number of alters for each respondent versus allowing the respondent to list as many or few alters as they would like. This article explores a random assignment of respondents to three treatment groups – 1) a fixed number of alters set at 30, 2) a variable number of alters up to 45, and 3) a variable number of alters up to 45 with a 20 alter minimum. The results indicate that, from a non-structural perspective, all levels of emotional proximity, interaction contexts, genders, and ages are consistently sampled across the three treatment groups. At the structural level, the behavior of individual metrics is also largely similar. However, the most significant differences arise in the collective behavior of structural metrics—specifically, in their correlation structure, the amount of redundant information each variable provides, and the diversity and interpretability of the observed structural variability. When a data collection strategy constrains network size, it reduces the sparsity of the correlation matrix, effectively decreasing the number of independent global variables needed to describe network structure and making these global variables less interpretable. In other words, networks constructed with a survey that limits size tend to be more similar to each other, exhibiting less structural diversity and yielding differences that are harder to interpret. However, we discuss how these differences may simply be mathematical artifacts, without necessarily implying a clear advantage in choosing one treatment over another. Finally, we argue that the field needs a targeted study to answer whether the differing numbers of alters listed is a function of network size.",

This is enhanced by the emergence of non-traditional actors who can effectively assert journalistic authority within communities by deviating from specific traditional journalistic values. However, scholarly understanding of the role of community membership in claims of journalistic authority remains limited. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework that draws on boundary work and fan studies. This framework allows us to examine how diverse journalistic actors in a variety of communities can base their journalistic authority claims on their: (1) proximity to news sources and protagonists; (2) authenticity as perceived by the audience community; and (3) professionalism in relation to the journalistic field. Through empirical research, this framework may help us to better understand how diverse journalistic actors can claim authority while meeting communities’ diverse needs.",

However, the question of how ordinary people conceptualize happiness—that is, the everyday conception of happiness—has rarely been systematically explored. This study applies a word-association network approach to examine the semantic schemas, components, and group differences in people's perceptions of both happiness and unhappiness. Specifically, we create a semantic representation of happiness and unhappiness from a survey using a mini-snowball word association task and then employ network analysis to identify semantic characteristics and demographic differences. Our findings suggest that the proposed method not only aligns well with previous studies' implications but also deepens our understanding of the structure by revealing new components of these concepts. Furthermore, the method facilitates further investigation of how semantic representations of happiness and unhappiness vary across demographic groups, highlighting both the general and semantic differences in their components. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of word-association networks for capturing everyday conceptions of happiness and unhappiness, offering both theoretical insights and practical implications for developing more accurate and culturally grounded measures.",

Our second distinction pertains to the cross-pressures of fitting in\nversus standing out within organizations. Third, we distinguish between how GAI is adopted\ninitially, and responses to these configurations by strategic actors, which we refer to as “second\norder effects.” Based on these distinctions, we array our predictions across three phases, with\neach new phase a response to the tensions and dissatisfactions of a preceding one.",

However, it further indicates a lack of studies in other areas, especially in the workplace setting, such as in Singapore. Furthermore, it overviews the most prominent biases and recommends that further studies in other settings could utilize similar biases. The biases were overconfidence bias, herding bias, and decision avoidance bias. Thus, further research into other fields and regions could utilize these biases to get new insights into these topics.",

          "authors": "Vojtěch Zíka; J Dustin Tracy",
          "abstract": "Overconfidence research often involves estimating performance within a fixed range. Recent studies suggest that overprecision is affected by central tendency bias, the tendency to estimate near the center of a perceived distribution. This paper examines whether a similar pattern influences the other two overconfidence types, overestimation and overplacement. In a laboratory experiment (N = 120), participants estimated their own and the average performance over five rounds of ten Rock–Paper–Scissors games. Each round earned for up to 40 points, but average performance varied across three treatments, with means of 16.6, 20, and 23.3 points. The main question was whether this manipulation would result in the sample appearing overconfident, underconfident, or well-calibrated. The results suggest that calibration depends on the relative position of mean performance to the midpoint of the range. When the mean aligned with half of the range maximum, participants appeared well-calibrated. A lower mean resulted in apparent overestimation, while a higher mean led to apparent overplacement. Experience shifted some estimates toward the actual mean and improved calibration, but only when feedback was not overly noisy. Monetary incentives and gender were controlled for but showed no significant effect on estimation accuracy. This study provides evidence that the one-half heuristic—the tendency to estimate at half the maximum of a given range—can mechanically bias confidence judgments. While further research is needed to confirm its effect in more traditional overconfidence tasks, caution is warranted when interpreting studies in which mean performance deviates from the range midpoint.",

This article critiques the statistical architecture underlying widely used tools—particularly their reliance on additive models that neglect interaction effects between variables such as age, prior convictions, and socio-economic context. Drawing on recent literature and case studies (including COMPAS, OGRS, and ARMS), it argues that most ORAIs reduce complex human behaviours to binary outcomes, misclassifying risk and reinforcing systemic bias. The paper introduces the concept of interaction effects, supported by statistical and psychological research, to illustrate how risk is often conditional rather than cumulative. It further explores the limitations of regression models and proposes a range of alternatives, including multi-level modelling, Bayesian updating, Explainable AI, and co-produced desistance-informed profiles. Beyond improving tools, the article calls for a paradigm shift—from control to collaboration, from prediction to understanding. Risk, it concludes, should be treated not as a fixed score but as a dynamic, contextual process. Only by recognising this can justice systems promote accurate assessments, reduce harm, and rebuild public trust.",

Particular attention is paid to the additional requirements that distinguish the PhD—such as coursework, comprehensive examinations, and teaching obligations—which are absent from the Tunisian doctorate. The paper argues that conflating the PhD with other doctoral degrees risks erasing structural and epistemological differences among academic traditions. The analysis concludes that neither degree is inherently superior; rather, they serve different purposes and operate within distinct academic systems. This distinction has implications for equivalency, recognition, and the international circulation of doctoral titles.",

We share our experience and reflection, hoping that future research can build on it. We find that publicly available information typically allows us to identify parliamentarians who would be classified as having a ‘migration background’ in official statistics. For women and parliamentarians at the regional (cantonal) level, identification is more difficult. In many cases, however, publicly available information does not capture self-identification, so we can only provide a list of potential minorities. Focusing on assumed ‘visibility’, we found it useful to differentiate different forms of visibility (physical traits, names, accents), and to recognize ambivalence as a possible category.

          "authors": "Allen Gindler",
          "abstract": "This paper addresses a critical ambiguity in the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP), a cornerstone of libertarian philosophy that prohibits initiating force against others. While effectively guiding two-party interactions, the NAP lacks clarity regarding third-party bystander intervention. Utilizing formal logic and set theory, this study identifies a logical 'NULL state' inherent in traditional NAP formulations, which leaves bystander actions undefined. To resolve this, the paper introduces a modified NAP (MNAP), explicitly permitting voluntary, consent-based bystander intervention. \nThe proposed refinement enhances the practical applicability of the NAP in complex multi-agent scenarios, offering libertarian societies a coherent framework for ethically and legally addressing immediate situations of aggression through consensual collective action.",

          "authors": "Clara Juarez Miro",
          "abstract": "“The people” is a central concept in populism, yet it remains unclear how those who identify with this community interpret it. Drawing on social identity theory and fandom studies, this study examines how populist supporters identify with “the people.” Using a comparative analysis of right- and left-wing populist supporters in the United States and Spain, the study analyzes 33 in-depth interviews (between April and October 2021) and 6,000 online community interactions (between September 2019 and January 2021). This approach captures both individual and collective interpretations while highlighting how media, especially digital platforms, shape imagined communities by fostering shared identities and emotions and encouraging social and political engagement. Findings reveal three interconnected dimensions of identification with “the people:” the imagined, the felt, and the experienced. Supporters’ positive view of “the people” as hardworking and guided by common sense evokes strong emotions—such as in-group love, connected to their self-concept—validated through meaningful social experiences online and offline. This study emphasizes the central role of social motivation in populist engagement and highlights the need for further cross-national, cross-ideological research to deepen scholarly understanding of populism.",

          "abstract": "This paper proposes a typology of text analysis methods ranging from surface-level to contextual and cultural interpretation, offering a framework for understanding the evolving role of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in qualitative research. While first- and second-generation NLP methods—such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and word embeddings—have extended analytical reach, they remain limited in capturing meaning shaped by ideology, discourse, and context. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a third generation of NLP, capable of performing interpretive tasks such as identifying metaphors, framing, and rhetorical strategies. This shift enables new hybrid approaches that integrate computational efficiency with qualitative depth. The paper introduces two frameworks—AI-Augmented Grounded Theory and Theory-Driven AI Analysis—to illustrate how LLMs can support large-scale, context-sensitive interpretation. These “fusion methodologies” challenge the perceived divide between computation and interpretation, pointing toward a new paradigm for qualitative inquiry in the digital age.",

          "abstract": "This chapter presents the Layered Model of Agency as a semiotic framework for the study of collective agency. The model identifies six distinct types of agencies: operative, reflective, joint, material-mediated, sign-mediated, and symbolic. Each level is examined in detail to elucidate the semiotic mechanisms and the cognitive architecture underlying the emergence of collective agencies. The model conceptualizes collective agency as an enhanced capability for action, incorporating artifacts to constitute sociotechnical systems. Within this framework, both institutional and non-institutional forms of collective agency are explored. In contrast to institutions, the collective agency of non-institutionalized social organizations generates dense networks of interaction within horizontal structures, facilitating the convergence between shared norms and individual values. This bottom-up view on agency recognizes individuals as agents of change and their crucial role in collective agency. Consequently, I underscore the importance of examining the interactions between individual and collective agency, proposing the Layered Model of Agency as a relevant tool for investigating these issues.",

          "abstract": "The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19) cases in various countries, including Indonesia, resulted in the paralysis of most services, including in the government sectors. The enactment of Work from Home (WFH) policy for State Civil Servants (PNS) indicates the massive level of urgency for the spread of this deadly virus, leading to the Social Distance policy being also applied in the government environment. This article aims to examine civil servants' work effectiveness in implementing WFH during Covid-19 pandemic in Sleman Regency, with a case study at the Department of Social Service. This research uses an exploratory case study approach, emphasizing the exploration of a phenomenon such as WFH policy. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews and literature reviews were used to obtain reliable data analysis. The findings of this study show that the adaptation of civil servants in the Sleman Social Service to the WFH policy is seen as complex in several divisions, because they are not accustomed to working in a home environment where teleconference facilities may be urgently required and the dependence on communication and coordination between employees is crucial. Another issue is that in the Department of Social Service there are no sanctions for civil servants who do not work under the guidance of WFH policy. In addition, knowledge and skills needed to operate and administer online services are still limited, affecting civil servants' ability in delivering a community’s public service needs. Hence, the implementation of WFH policy may not be effective in all types of public operations.",

          "abstract": "The strategic placement of pedestrian crossings is critical for promoting road safety in urban environments. While previous research has used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to identify underserved areas, existing approaches often fail to integrate empirical data with stakeholder expertise, or directly link road safety concerns with wider spatial equity considerations. This study develops a novel GIS-Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) framework to evaluate the suitability of sites for new pedestrian crossings, incorporating four key criteria: existing provision of pedestrian infrastructure, road safety risks, proximity to urban amenities, and socio-demographic vulnerability. Applied to Liverpool City Region as a policy case study, the framework integrates advanced spatial analysis techniques with stakeholder informed weights, to assess the suitability of postcodes for new pedestrian crossings. Site suitability scores are generated which reflect both the considerations relevant to key stakeholders, as well as the distribution of controlled pedestrian crossings, road traffic collisions, urban amenities and census-derived vulnerability indicators. The results reveal significant spatial inequalities where, specific locations with high socio-demographic vulnerability also experience the greatest road safety risks and poorest access to pedestrian crossings, despite proximity to essential services. The framework successfully pinpoints priority locations where road safety and spatial inequality concerns compounded negatively, providing evidence-based guidance for data-driven, stakeholder-informed pedestrian infrastructure investment.",

          "abstract": "As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes a mandatory component within business environment and in many cases a key competitive advantage, it is essential that business education evolves accordingly for preparing students for this new reality. This paper presents an approach aimed at integrating AI into business education through practical, global oriented assignments. \nWe have experimented with students working in teams to tackle real-world business challenges using AI tools and concepts. Their task was to analyze a specific business problem, design an AI-driven business model, and develop a prototype solution. The goal was to offer them not just theoretical insights, but a hands-on experience of how AI can support and transform business processes.\nThe research is based on students’ experimentation with AI techniques to solve business problems, combined with insights gathered through a follow-up survey. Further, a survey explored students’ views on the relevance of AI in business, the effectiveness of the assignment, and the skills they felt they developed through the process.\nThe findings suggest that this kind of applied, project-based learning has strong educational value. Students not only deepened their understanding of AI technologies but also gained confidence in using them creatively. \nOverall, this study contributes to the growing conversation about how business schools can better align their teaching with the realities of a rapidly evolving digital economy. It also offers practical suggestions for educators who wish to bridge the gap between academic theory and the demands of professional practice.",

          "abstract": "Policies that reinforce unequal opportunity persist in democracies. I develop a theory of ``Boundary Defense\" to explain why. Middle-class families mobilize to defend these opportunity boundaries against reform when they lack alternative strategies to secure their status against uncertainty. In Germany, I argue early-age sorting across stratified schools is an opportunity boundary that excludes immigrants and that status uncertain German families defend it against reform. To test this, I introduce a 2010 referendum which blocked a reform to early-age sorting across schools in Hamburg and collect data from precinct-level votes, city-district demographics, election studies, and archival sources. Results show referendum support was highest in lower-income places and specific precincts with less access to academic schools and higher shares of immigrant children, among parents of school-age children without academic educations, and predicts future support for politicians who took positions against the reform. I suggest this theory also applies to different boundaries in both education and other fields, and that policies which reduce middle-class uncertainty can equalize opportunity better than technocratic reforms given boundary defense.",

I demonstrate the use of TEA through two applications: the effect of college completion on income gradient in health and the effect of college completion on issue alignment, using NLSY97 and GSS respectively. By exploring how treatments modify associations between outcomes, TEA offers a valuable tool for sociological research on inequality, stratification, and public opinion, providing insights into the mechanisms sustaining social inequalities and informing policy interventions.",

Given cosmopolitans’ active engagement in politics and society, their democratic preferences are decisive for future democratic reform both at the national and global level. This article investigates the heterogeneous governance preferences of German cosmopolitans. Acknowledging theoretical conceptions, the article defines cosmopolitanism as a multidimensional concept, and first empirically determines these dimensions as moral, cultural, institutional and anti-nationalist cosmopolitanism. These dimensions are connected to preferences for representative, technocratic and participatory forms of democracy. This shows that each cosmopolitanism dimensions implies distinct preferences. While nearly all dimensions relate positively to governance by experts (except for the anti-nationalist dimension), only the institutional dimension of cosmopolitanism is connected to significant and consistent support for representative government. There is strong disagreement on participatory forms of democracy. Moral cosmopolitanism is associated with an endorsement referendums and citizen assemblies, whereas the anti-nationalist dimension connects with the rejection of both. These results are explained by different values connected with moral and cultural cosmopolitanism on the one hand, and institutional and anti-national cosmopolitanism on the other.",

          "abstract": "How we remember our past can be shaped by the realities of our present. This study examines how changes to present circumstances influence retrospective reports of family income rank at age 16. While retrospective survey data can be used to assess the long-term effects of childhood conditions, present-day circumstances may “anchor” memories, causing shifts in how individuals recall and report past experiences. Using panel data from the 2006-2014 General Social Surveys (8,602 observations from 2,883 individuals in the United States), we analyze how changes in objective and subjective indicators of current social status—income, financial satisfaction, and perceived income relative to others—are associated with changes in reports of childhood income rank, and how this varies by sex and race/ethnicity. Fixed-effects models reveal no significant association between changes in income and in childhood income rank. However, changes in subjective measures of social status show contrasting effects, as increases in current financial satisfaction are associated with decreases in childhood income rank, but increases in current perceived relative income are associated with increases in childhood income rank. We argue these opposing effects follow from theories of anchoring in recall bias. We further find these effects are stronger among males but are consistent across racial/ethnic groups. This demographic heterogeneity suggests that recall bias is not evenly distributed across the population and has important implications for how different groups perceive their own pasts. Our findings further highlight the malleability of retrospective perceptions and their sensitivity to current social conditions, offering methodological insights into survey reliability and recall bias.",

          "abstract": "Myanmar’s protracted conflict, intensified by the 2021 military coup, has severely disrupted formal education and deepened psychosocial needs among children. Community-led schools, established across ethnic regions both before and after the coup, have become vital in sustaining learning, cultural continuity, and psychosocial well-being. This paper reviews how trauma-informed practices and social-emotional learning (SEL) are integrated into these schools to address the layered effects of violence, displacement, and chronic instability. Evidence from Myanmar and global literature shows that predictable routines, culturally responsive pedagogy, and SEL activities help foster resilience, belonging, and recovery. Teachers play a dual role as educators and emotional supporters, while communities contribute through engagement and culturally rooted practices. The review also highlights key challenges, including limited resources, teacher well-being, and weak referral systems. These insights contribute to broader discussions on how education systems in fragile contexts can integrate academic and psychosocial support in sustainable, locally grounded ways.",

          "authors": "Elisabetta Adami",
          "abstract": "Addressing a gap in extant research on social media content creation, the paper presents a time-space-interaction analytical framework for the investigation of content creators’ development of practices through time and orchestration across the spaces of their online presence, cross-checked through interactions with followers. While the framework is potentially applicable to any research focus, the paper focuses its application on the analysis of translocal trajectories as entextualised in the semiotic practices of social media video-based food content creators. The application takes as a case study @foodqood, a food content creator based in Italy who gained megainfluencer status (with over 23 million followers on TikTok) and analyses the creator’s whole production on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The framework is structured along four analytical semiotic layers, i.e., the resources of the subject matter (food), the embodied and disembodied resources of the creator’s performance, the video-specific visual and auditory resources, and the resources in the paratext. The semiotic layers are considered by intertwining three dimensions of analysis, i.e., the creator’s trajectories through time, across the different social media platforms of their online presence, and in the interactions with followers. The findings show distinct phases in the creator’s development of practices, from experimentation to institutionalisation, and trace trajectories of the creator’s identity performances marked by distinctive strategies in the combined use of the three layers of semiotic resources; the development of these through time, across spaces and in relation to followers’ prompts reveals the creator’s shifting interests in terms of audience reaches, as well as a nuanced effort to appeal to different audience segments. The conclusions point to the usefulness of a social semiotic framework that includes a languaging perspective to observe transnational phenomena, and of such a time-space-interaction analysis to trace the complex dynamics of influence between practices from below and institutional ones, and between agency in sign-making choices and semiotic regime ideologies.",

Middle-class families mobilize to defend these opportunity boundaries against reform when they lack alternative strategies to secure their status against uncertainty. In Germany, I argue early-age sorting across stratified schools is an opportunity boundary that excludes immigrants and that status uncertain German families defend it against reform. To test this, I introduce a 2010 referendum which blocked a reform to early-age sorting across schools in Hamburg and collect data from precinct-level votes, city-district demographics, election studies, and archival sources. Results show referendum support was highest in lower-income places and specific precincts with less access to academic schools and higher shares of immigrant children, among parents of school-age children without academic educations, and predicts future support for politicians who took positions against the reform. I suggest this theory also applies to different boundaries in both education and other fields, and that policies which reduce middle-class uncertainty can equalize opportunity better than technocratic reforms given boundary defense.",

          "abstract": "Democratic government relies on a great deal of voluntary participation from the population. This participation is not guaranteed, and when citizens are absent from the data collecting processes of the state, a missing data problem occurs. The co-occurrence of the Scottish local elections and the Scottish Census in 2022 provides an unusual opportunity to test hypotheses about common and context-specific drivers of civic non-participation. Using a geospatial approach, we show that ward-level census nonresponse is highly correlated with electoral abstention despite abstention being about five times more common than initial census nonresponse. Statistical modelling demonstrates strong common roles for deprivation and English-language speaking in driving the participation rates of a ward. Meanwhile relatively specific effects are shown for cohabitation in driving census response, and the proportion of young people in driving voting behaviour. We conclude that the similarity between these nonresponse processes represents an opportunity for improving practice in increasing response rates. For example, census “hard to count” indices can incorporate data from elections as “interim” predictions for low-response areas, and framing voting as a household duty, rather than an individual one, may improve turnout.",

          "abstract": "Traditional sources of population data, such as censuses and surveys, are costly, infrequent, and often unavailable in crisis-affected regions. Mobile phone application data offer near–realtime, high-resolution insights into population distribution, but their utility is undermined by unequal access to and use of digital technologies, creating biases that threaten representativeness. Despite growing recognition of these issues, there is still no standard framework to measure and explain such biases, limiting the reliability of digital traces for research and policy. We develop and implement a systematic, replicable framework to quantify coverage bias in aggregated mobile phone application data without requiring individual-level demographic attributes. The approach combines a transparent indicator of population coverage with explainable machine learning to identify contextual drivers of spatial bias. Using four datasets for the United Kingdom benchmarked against the 2021 census, we show that mobile phone data consistently achieve higher population coverage than major national surveys, but substantial biases persist across data sources and subnational areas. Coverage bias is strongly associated with demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic features, often in complex nonlinear ways. Contrary to common assumptions, multi-application datasets do not necessarily reduce bias compared to single-app sources. Our findings establish a foundation for bias assessment standards in mobile phone data, offering practical tools for researchers, statistical agencies, and policymakers to harness these datasets responsibly and equitably.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates journalists’ perceptions of how artificial intelligence (AI) affects disinformation risks within the news ecosystem. Drawing on a structured survey of 504 journalists in the Basque Country administered online and by telephone in May–June 2024, the study examines associations between perceived risk and professional variables, including experience and AI usage. Results show that 89.88% of respondents believe AI will considerably or significantly increase disinformation risks, a pattern consistent across genders and media types, though somewhat less pronounced among digital-native outlets. Experience matters: perceptions of risk rise with years in the profession. Conversely, intensive users of AI in the newsroom tend to report more moderate views of its harmful effects. The most frequently cited risks concern difficulties identifying false content and deepfakes, and the likelihood of obtaining inaccurate data; co-occurrence analysis indicates these concerns are commonly linked in journalists’ mental models. Additional worries include exposure to scams and biases related to data provenance. The paper argues for targeted AI literacy, ethical training, and transparent verification workflows to calibrate expectations and bolster resilience against information disorders. Overall, the findings underscore both the scale of perceived threat and the potential of professional familiarity to nuance risk assessments.",

The contribution of this paper is to provide a systematic assessment of this linearity assumption, developing a general framework to quantify how easily empirical results can be overturned when it is relaxed. Using original experimental data, we show that respondents use survey scales in ways that deviate from linearity, but only mildly so. Focusing on wellbeing research, we then replicate 40,000+ coefficient estimates across more than 80 papers published in top economics journals. Coefficient signs are remarkably robust to the mild departures from linear scale-use we document experimentally. However, estimates of relative effect sizes, which are crucial for policy applications, are unreliable even under these modest non-linearities.",

This study applies a scenario-based decomposition approach, using counterfactual scenarios for each factor of population change (fertility, mortality, migration, and age structure) to assess their individual contributions. The 37 NUTS-2 units of the Visegrád Group countries (Poland, Czechia, Slovakia, and Hungary) were selected as units of analysis. The research focused on the origins of regional differences and on the explanatory role of age structure. The results indicate that differences at the regional scale cannot be attributed solely to national-level variation, as cross-border groupings also emerge in the cluster analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that initial age structure constitutes an independent and essential explanatory factor of population heterogeneity, both at the national and regional levels.",

This article employs a cultural-sociological lens to interpret the conflict as part of a broader struggle over national identity. Drawing on original panel survey data and Latent Class Analysis, it identifies five distinct nationalist belief clusters among Jewish Israelis that structured divergent responses to the reform initiative. A key cleavage separates those concerned about democratic backsliding from those endorsing majoritarian rule. This divide has heightened political polarization and reinforced alignment between national identity and party affiliation. Contrary to expectations, the October 7 Hamas attack did not unify the public but entrenched existing divisions.

This paper leverages a pre-registered quasi-experimental design exploiting within-individual variation from as-good-as-random exposure to UK Labour leader Keir Starmer’s “Island of Strangers” speech -- a major rhetorical turn toward anti-immigration positions. We find that exposure significantly altered perceptions of Labour, making it appear more anti-immigration and right-leaning. Crucially, these shifts carried electoral costs: support for Labour declined within individuals following the speech. While we detect no corresponding gains for the radical right Reform UK party, there is also no evidence that Labour’s adoption of nativist rhetoric diminished Reform’s appeal. Our findings highlight the risks of strategic convergence, showing that accommodation of exclusionary rhetoric by social democratic parties is electorally costly for them rather than for their radical right competitors.",

          "authors": "Michael Marshall",
          "abstract": "Research on housing and populism has produced conflicting findings – evidence suggests declining housing affordability can have both a negative and positive association with populist support. Focusing on the UK, this paper argues these findings can be reconciled by decomposing the heterogeneous effects of housing affordability into distinct, but related, housing crises. Furthermore, it argues these crises will be related to political preferences through the interaction between geography and tenure. The paper hypothesises that homeowners in areas of high house prices will be less likely to hold populist political preferences due to a wealth effect that legitimises the existing socio-political system. By contrast, social renters in unaffordable areas will be more likely to support populism due to their higher likelihood of experiencing housing insecurity and as the scarcity of affordable housing will provide a conducive context in which to scapegoat immigrants. Analysis using data on local housing conditions and political preferences finds broad support for these hypotheses. The analysis finds that social renting in an area of widespread housing insecurity is positively associated with both opposition to immigration and voting for the Reform Party. It also finds that homeownership does negatively interact with local house prices in predicting attitudes to immigration, but the effect is to attenuate the positive association between house prices and opposition to immigration. This contradicts previous studies which may have been subject to omitted variable bias. No evidence is found for an interaction between homeownership and affordability in predicting support for the Reform Party. The paper contributes to an emergent research agenda around housing discontent and populism. It concludes with reflections on the future direction of this research agenda, suggesting there is value in measuring housing insecurity at the individual level, rather than as a contextual variable, and interrogating causality.",

Traditional approaches to characterising language production typically incorporate linguistic complexity metrics, which, while useful for various tasks such as learner proficiency evaluation and text readability assessment, have limited pedagogical relevance. There have been calls for more fine-grained annotations of linguistic structures in recent research, particularly in the field of second language acquisition (SLA), where grammar is a central part of second language (L2) learning. However, there is a lack of comprehensive tools for systematically analysing detailed grammatical structures. To address this gap, we present POLKE (Pedagogically-Oriented Language Knowledge Extractor), a tool for automatically annotating English grammar use based on the English Grammar Profile (EGP). In this paper, we introduce the POLKE system and outline the results of its evaluation, which yielded satisfactory results.",

          "abstract": "The expansion of higher educational systems in Western countries in the latter half of the 20th century is central to the reversal of the gender gap in education. In Norway, major reforms starting in the late 1960s aimed at making higher education more accessible for large segments of the population. This occurred through the establishment, upgrading, and gradual expansion of local colleges across the country, especially in female-dominated fields associated with work in expanding welfare sectors. Previous research has suggested that the gendered profile of educational expansions contributed to the cementing of horizontal gender segregation patterns in education and the labor market. We shed light on these processes using new and detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of higher educational institutions between 1969 and 1993. Linking these to individual-level register data, we study how regional variation in educational opportunities affected the educational attainment and field of study choices of young women and men, using an event study approach. While increased access to college education was a prerequisite for the reversal of the gender gap, our results suggest that the location of colleges had, at most, a very modest impact on local educational attainment and gendered field of study choices.",

Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. \nIn this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse.\nCluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests.\nFunded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.",

This article reports on a realist interview study which aimed to understand the mechanisms that underpin successful inter-agency collaboration in support of people experiencing self-neglect, and the barriers to achieving it. Based on semi-structured interviews with 78 practitioners from Adult Social Care, Health, Housing, Fire &amp; Rescue, and Environmental Health, 16 people with experience of self-neglect, and 2 family carers, the study proposes 9 principal programme theories of inter-agency dynamics under the headings of: policies and procedures; mutual inter-agency understandings of roles and task; keeping a collective shared focus on the person experiencing self-neglect; and support from management. It is argued that professional curiosity in safeguarding must be complemented by greater ‘inter-professional curiosity’ if inter-agency working is to fulfil its potential contribution to improving the lives of people experiencing self-neglect.",

Focusing on the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 as a quasi-natural experiment, I test this model by analyzing attitudes toward U.S. law enforcement among non-Hispanic White Americans using five surveys that collectively span from 2016 to 2024. The findings consistently show that Democrats and Independents became strongly unfavorable toward law enforcement—much more so among younger than older individuals. Moreover, the changes persisted for younger individuals, while fading among older individuals, leading to cohort-led polarization.

We develop a game-theoretic model of liquidity provision that reveals a fundamental toxicity-competitiveness trade-off in LP decision-making, which shapes the equilibrium strategy. Specifically, while arbitrageurs' toxic swaps generate non-competitive payoffs that are independent of other LPs' strategies, noise traders' non-toxic swaps create competitive payoffs that depend on aggregate liquidity provision. We demonstrate that LP equilibrium payoffs under the concentrated liquidity mechanism increasingly outperform those without it as swap toxicity rises. However, when toxicity is substantially low, competitive pressure of concentrated liquidity can worsen LP payoffs. Our comparative statics analysis identifies several patterns that can guide LPs in adapting their strategies to market conditions.",

In tale contesto,\nla visibilità organica cede il passo alla necessità di \"essere scelti\" quale fonte\nautorevole per la generazione della risposta.\nSi esaminano quindi le discipline emergenti, come l'Answer Engine Optimization\n(AEO) e la Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). L'indagine mostra come la\nvisibilità generativa premi la qualità intrinseca e la \"citabilità\" semantica di un\ncontenuto, spesso a prescindere dal suo ranking tradizionale.\nLa discussione finale affronta le implicazioni più ampie, ovvero strategiche,\nprofessionali ed etiche, di questa trasformazione. In un contesto sempre più dominato\nda automatismi, ma anche esposto a rischi reali di bias e disinformazione, emerge un\npunto cruciale: l'etica non è più soltanto un principio da rivendicare, ma si configura\ncome un vero e proprio vantaggio competitivo. La tesi mette in luce come il ruolo del\nprofessionista SEO stia cambiando in modo sostanziale, trasformandosi da esecutore\ntecnico a figura strategica, capace di curare, orientare e garantire la qualità dei\ncontenuti. In chiusura, si sostiene un’idea centrale: in un ecosistema informativo\nautomatizzato e in continuo mutamento, è proprio il giudizio umano, con la sua\ncapacità critica, il senso del contesto e la responsabilità etica, a restare l’elemento più\nprezioso e insostituibile.",

          "abstract": "Persuasiveness is an important part in political communication. While some previous studies investigated the effect of elites' political incivility on a messages' persuasiveness, the effect of incivility from citizens on persuasiveness is less investigated. In the present study, I hypothesized that an uncivil political comment is less persuasive than a civil one. I also proposed hypotheses regarding moderating effects of political interest and the status of agreement with a message. To test the hypotheses, I conducted an online survey experiment using a Japanese sample. As a result, I did not find evidence that an uncivil political comment is less persuasive than a civil comment on average. Meanwhile, I found that those who had agreeing attitudes with the presented comment before treatment were more likely to be negatively influenced by incivility than those who did not.",

Chinese learners of English show no significant difference in performance when translating symmetrical word order NP + AdjP/AdvP constructions from English to Chinese compared to from Chinese to English. 2. In contrast, their performance on asymmetrical word order NP + AdjP/AdvP constructions is significantly better when translating from English to Chinese than from Chinese to English. 3.

In an online randomized experiment, the endowment channel emerges as the principal driver. We then use a novel fMRI approach that constructs brain activity maps of cognitions and uses them to trace their variation in each cognition during decision-making. This approach validates treatments by confirming they elicit the intended cognitions and uses them as instruments to identify the causal effect of cognition on choice. Results show that endowment drives default nudge effectiveness, suggesting policy designs should leverage it.",

          "authors": "Kohei Kawaguchi; Jeff Qiu; Zhang Yi",
          "abstract": "This paper analyzes how retailer competition affects the welfare implications of resale price maintenance (RPM) under demand uncertainty. We extend the classic model of Deneckere et al. (1997) by introducing imperfect competition among retailers, which creates tension between double marginalization and business-stealing effects. Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes determined by demand uncertainty and market concentration. In highly uncertain, competitive markets, minimum RPM enhances efficiency by encouraging inventory holding. However, in markets with lower uncertainty or more concentrated retail sectors, maximum RPM better promotes competition by mitigating double marginalization. The effectiveness of each RPM type depends on whether retailers optimize for all demand states or focus primarily on high-demand scenarios. These findings suggest that antitrust authorities should evaluate RPM cases by considering both the level of demand uncertainty and the degree of retail competition, as different market conditions may call for different forms of vertical price restrictions. For managers, our results provide actionable guidance on selecting the appropriate RPM strategy based on market structure and demand predictability.",

We focus on the Japanese publishing industry where printed books are excepted from RPM prohibition. We develop and estimate a model of RPM in which price and inventory are determined before demand is realized. Counterfactual simulations show that the price ceiling due to RPM plays a welfare-enhancing role, whereas the price floor can improve supply-side welfare at the expense of consumer surplus. The parameter region for which price floor can improve consumer surplus exists but is narrow.",

Piuttosto che essere considerato un ostacolo, il conflitto emerge come un momento generativo, in cui divergenze di valori, interpretazioni e interessi possono stimolare la riflessione critica e la creazione di norme condivise. Sfruttando il dialogo tra i classici della sociologia (Simmel, Durkheim, Weber, Bourdieu) e approcci contemporanei (MacIntyre, Boltanski &amp; Thévenot), e integrando la teoria delle virtù collettive, il conflitto diventa un motore per innovazioni etiche e socialmente responsabili. Il contributo evidenzia come la gestione efficace dei conflitti interni nei team di IA possa favorire la coesione, la responsabilità condivisa e l’apprendimento collettivo. Attraverso il caso della sanità pubblica, l’articolo mostra come le tensioni tra precisione algoritmica e diritti dei pazienti possano generare virtù collettive quali fiducia e trasparenza. La ricerca sottolinea l’importanza di trattare i conflitti come dispositivi generativi, in grado di allineare il progresso tecnologico con la sostenibilità sociale, proponendo un modello di conflitto che promuove un’innovazione etica e sostenibile.",

          "abstract": "The digitalization of the immigration system through the implementation of electronic visas ( e-Visa ) and Autogate was a strategic way for Indonesia in facing the increasingly complex challenges of international mobility. The digitalization in the immigration sector has been widely studied, research specifically analyzing its impact on Indonesia's national resilience is still very limited. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the implementation of e-Visa and Autogate at Soekarno-Hatta Airport on national resilience from a security, economic, and socio-political perspective, and to identify implementation challenges. This study used a qualitative method with a library research approach, analyzing various regulations, official documents, and related academic studies for the period 2020-2025. The results showed that the implementation of e-Visa and Autogate significantly accelerates the immigration administration process, strengthens border control, improves service efficiency, and supports the national economy by increasing tourist visits by 15%. There were many challenges such as cybersecurity risks, personal data protection, and maintaining technological infrastructure, which are serious obstacles. This research was important for providing strategic policy recommendations to ensure the effectiveness of the immigration digitalization system and strengthen national resilience in a sustainable manner.",

          "abstract": "The recruitment of children into armed groups remains a critical yet under-researched issue in North Darfur, Sudan. While disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts have historically focused on post-recruitment responses, this study explores the overlooked role of women-led, community-based prevention strategies. Using a qualitative case study approach, the research draws on interviews, focus group discussions, and written narratives from 112 participants, including displaced women, civil society actors, and children associated with armed groups. The findings highlight the pivotal role of traditional female mediators—particularly the Hakamate—as cultural influencers who use oral storytelling to discourage recruitment and foster social cohesion. Despite their contributions, these women are systematically excluded from formal DDR frameworks and face structural barriers such as lack of funding, political marginalization, and security threats. This paper argues for a paradigm shift in child protection strategies: from reactive reintegration to proactive prevention, anchored in local knowledge and gender-inclusive policies. The study concludes that recognizing and supporting women’s preventive roles is essential for sustainable peacebuilding in conflict-affected regions like Darfur.",

          "abstract": "Microfinance banks have been critical players in enhancing financial deepening hence fostering socioeconomic development. Despite anchoring socioeconomic transformation and fostering societal wellbeing of households in Kenya, financial performance and sustainability of microfinance have been a concern to players in the industry. The study investigated the mediating effect of transformative capabilities in the nexus between late-mover strategies and the performance of Microfinance Banks. The anchoring theory was dynamic capability theory supported by the balanced scorecard model and theory of change. Positivism research philosophy was employed while integrating descriptive and explanatory research designs. The study population was 13 microfinance banks within Nairobi City County with a target population of 389-unit managers. The sample size was 197-unit managers. To select the sample size, both simple random sampling and stratified sampling were employed. Primary data was employed collected using semi-structured questionnaire. In ascertaining the reliability of the questionnaire, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient was adopted where a value of 0.7 and over indicated the tool is consistent. Validity was ascertained by using content, construct and face validity. Baron and Kenny techniques were employed to investigate mediating role of transformative capabilities on the association between late mover strategies and performance of microfinance banks. It was found out that transformative capabilities mediate the relationship between late movers' strategies and the performance of microfinance banks. The study recommends that mangers in charge of training should regularly organize in-service training, workshops, and seminars in collaboration with industry experts and regulatory bodies to strengthen employee competencies that are key in fostering performance.",

          "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with disabilities are underemployed. This improved recently, but how broadly across disability type? US law allows employers to pay people with disabilities far below minimum wage, typically in segregated settings (sheltered workshops), if employers hold federal 14(c) certificates. Almost everyone in 14(c) employment has an intellectual/developmental disability. Some states have eliminated sheltered workshops, and the Biden administration may propose phasing them out. This is controversial.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine employment patterns pre- and post-pandemic among people with disabilities and patterns in use of sheltered workshops.\nMETHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024.\nRESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category—but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state.\nCONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.",

While the effects of aesthetic experiences reach far beyond the simple appreciation of art, most research in the field still focuses on subjective ratings of fine art. The current study explored the effect of decorating a lab space on a participant's inhibitory control and emotional reactivity. First, we used an online survey to confirm that participants found the aesthetic room (i.e., decorated lab space) more pleasing and comforting, and expressed a greater willingness to work in that space compared to the bare room. Next, participants performed a Proportion Congruent Stroop task to examine inhibitory control and a Emotion Vocabulary Stroop task to test inhibitory control in the context of emotional stimuli, or their emotional reactivity. Average response times on both tasks were faster in the aesthetic room, while accuracy did not differ between the rooms. These results suggest that participants in the bare room were less efficient at task performance. This research provides a controlled and standardized attempt at understanding the role that aesthetics plays in our daily lives by elaborating on the, understudied, link between aesthetics and inhibitory control.",

Pre-Texts integrates collective reading, questioning, artistic creation, reflection, and associative thinking to create conditions for human flourishing aligned with Seligman’s (2011) PERMA model. Drawing on implementations across marginalized communities, we argue how the protocol’s synthesis of aesthetic education, critical pedagogy, and Montessori-inspired principles generates measurable improvements in both psychological wellbeing and cognitive development. The protocol's emphasis on collective creativity and non-competitive engagement provides an alternative to individualistic educational approaches, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations who face barriers to traditional mental health and educational resources. Through an analysis of the protocol’s theoretical foundations and empirical outcomes, we argue that Pre-Texts represents a significant advancement in understanding how creative, text-based interventions can promote mental health, social inclusion, and lifelong learning. The paper contributes to the positive psychology literature by demonstrating how relatively simple, low-cost interventions can create virtuous cycles of learning and wellbeing, offering a replicable model for fostering human flourishing across diverse cultural contexts.",

          "abstract": "Dominant wellness models have long shaped frameworks in public health, behavioral care, and education. However, they often overlook the structural, cultural, and systemic conditions that define wellness for marginalized and justice-impacted communities. Foundational models such as Hettler’s Six Dimensions and Swarbrick’s Eight Dimensions provide essential scaffolding but fail to capture the full spectrum of harm and potential for healing within communities shaped by colonizing systems: the structures and ideologies that perpetuate colonialism.\n\nThis article introduces the 12 Dimensions of Wellness: a justice-rooted, community-informed framework that incorporates four essential yet underrepresented domains in mainstream literature: creative, cultural, digital, and the newly defined carceral wellness. Carceral wellness, introduced here for the first time, is defined as a relative state of immunity to, resilience from, or recovery after the physical, psychological, social, and systemic harms imposed by carceral systems. It reflects both the enduring impacts of criminalization and the capacity to construct life-affirming alternatives.\n\nGrounded in lived experience and participatory insight, this framework offers a culturally situated and structurally aware reconceptualization of interdimensional wellness. The article explores the model’s theoretical underpinnings, its intersections, and envisioned applications across health, legal, and social systems, advocating for a wellness paradigm rooted not only in individual behavior but in collective liberation.",

Religious hobbyism is defined as shallow, consumerist, performative engagement with religion that prioritizes personal gratification over genuine spiritual commitment or civic action. Drawing on data from Pew Research Center, Gallup, World Values Survey, and analysis of social media religious engagement, this paper demonstrates how religious hobbyism undermines civic trust, deepens social polarization, and weakens traditional religious institutions. The research reveals that religious hobbyism manifests through commodified spirituality, social media performativity, and consumer-driven religious engagement that strips faith traditions of their deeper meaning and social function. Key findings include a 300-1500% growth in commodified spiritual products, declining institutional religious participation despite maintained spiritual identity, and concerning pathways from hobbyist spirituality to extremist ideologies. This paper argues that religious hobbyism represents a significant threat to democratic participation and social cohesion, requiring urgent scholarly attention and policy intervention.",

The legal solutions applied to solve those questions are also addressed, including technical solutions, fair use guidelines and legal solutions (litigation, legislative reform, and negotiation).

          "authors": "Femke H. Reidsma; Amanda Henry",
          "abstract": "Fire is a key component of human technology, but when and how we first developed the ability to use and create fire remains heavily debated. Some argue that control of fire developed early and quickly became an essential tool for cooking food, based on morphological changes that first appeared in Homo erectus. Others emphasize the lack of widespread and consistent traces of fire in the early archaeological record, and argue that control of fire came relatively late, post 500ka. In looking for archaeological evidence for fire use, most studies focus on the co-occurence of fire traces and other signs of human activity (e.g., stone tools, cut-marked bones). This assumes that our ancestors first focused on the idea of the hearth, either bringing the fire back to the activity area, or performing activities near a spatially-constrained fire. However, recent research has highlighted the potential importance of intentional burning of landscapes as a tool that could similarly provide nutritional and energetic benefits to the earliest hominin fire users. If landscape burning was the first type of intentional fire use, then we should not expect the co-occurrence of fire traces and other signs of hominin activity. Inspired in part by Wil Roebroeks’ emphasis on off-site activities and longstanding interest in fire, here we provide a suggestion for a new approach to explore the archaeological record for evidence of intentional landscape burning. Future analyses using this approach may help us better understand the deep history of fire use and resolve the potential mismatch between the early appearance of morphological traits associated with the consumption of cooked food and the late co-occurrence of fire traces and hominin activity in the archaeological record.",

          "authors": "Simón Peña-Fernández; Ainara Larrondo-Ureta; Irati Agirreazkuenaga",
          "abstract": "The second generation of web tools shook the journalist profession approximately two decades ago with the proactive incorporation of audiences into the media. Citizen journalism and user-generated content arose as an object of interest due to the democratising value of participation attributed to them, with empowered citizens who could emulate the professional and institutional practises of journalists. However, difficulties soon came to the surface, and audience participation in news media began to be limited. Within this context, this article conducts a critical review of studies on audience participation in news media based on a systematic literature review. The results indicate that, in general, audiences showed low interest in the creation of informative content and that their participation has grown increasingly problematic. In addition, journalists are reticent as they defend their professional role above all else, while company strategies have prioritised making participation profitable. For this reason, the idea of citizen journalism that offers user-created content through the media appears to be a thing of the past, with many characteristics that could define it as a failed innovation. Therefore, the text concludes that audience participation in the media could be defined as mediatised participation.",

This article, therefore, examines the activity metrics, thematic agenda, engagement capacity, and follower dynamics exhibited over one year by twenty-two Spanish media outlets on the mentioned social network. The results provide the first scientific evidence of the extent to which these reference media brands capitalize on the digital public debate on current events. The conclusions distinguish the conversational weight or leadership of these media in the political agenda and topics related to entertainment at both the national and global levels.

These “chatbot interviewers” can be used to (a) collect large-scale in-depth opinion data and (b) run prompt experiments with personalized conversational interventions. In this work, we use the open-source Python package boterview, designed for social scientists, to conduct chatbot interviews in an experimental setting. To investigate whether chatbot interviewers can develop theoretical sensitivity, we ran a pilot interviewing experiment on 26 university students and staff, compared to a group of 12 student interviewers, on the topic of a Universal Basic Income. Based on a content analysis of interviewer questions, we find that chatbot interviewers provided with theoretical background information are more likely to ask theoretically relevant questions, and are more likely to pick up theoretically relevant cues from interviewees. On the other hand, compared to (in-person) human interviewers, responses to (written) chatbot interviewers are shorter and less informative, and chatbots tend to more strongly stick to the script. We conclude by discussing avenues for improving the technical abilities and theoretical sensibilities of chatbot interviewers.",

          "abstract": "Journalists have incorporated social networks into their work as a standard tool, enhancing their ability to produce and disseminate information and making it easier for them to connect more directly with their audiences. However, this greater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure to harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists. This study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n = 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X (formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following the July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results indicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political hate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional ones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization—particularly during election periods—in shaping the hostility that journalists face. Moreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages was similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist messages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was identified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed at them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue, particularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the media must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to the individual level, where this issue usually applies.",

The results reveal that, although such technologies provide opportunities to improve teaching–learning processes, their inclusion in the curriculum is limited and often superficial. In addition, we identify shortcomings in how teachers are trained to manage these tools effectively, hindering the development of critical thinking by students. The conclusions suggest a need for critical media literacy that not only educates students in the use of technologies but also allows them to question and evaluate the content they consume, all within an ethical and reflective framework that promotes participatory and critical citizenship.",

          "abstract": "Social media have been fundamental in the daily lives of millions of people, but they have raised concerns about content moderation policies, the management of personal data, and their commercial exploitation. The acquisition of Twitter (now X) by Elon Musk in 2022 generated concerns among Twitter users regarding changes in the platform’s direction, prompting a migration campaign by some user groups to the federated network Mastodon. This study reviews the onboarding of users to this decentralised platform between 2016 and 2022 and analyses the migration of 19,000 users who identified themselves as supporters of the platform switch. The results show that the migration campaign was a reactive response to Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and was led by a group of highly active academics, scientists, and journalists. However, a complete transition was not realised, as users preferred to straddle their presence on both platforms. Mastodon’s decentralisation made it difficult to exactly replicate Twitter’s communities, resulting in a partial loss of these users’ social capital and greater fragmentation of these user communities, which highlights the intrinsic differences between both platforms.",

Current systems, such as the Model for\nEnd-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), save many lives by prioritizing urgency, but they can reduce\nlong-term survival gains. We introduce Harm-Threshold Utilitarianism (HTU), a framework\nthat seeks to maximize expected post-transplant benefit while enforcing guardrails for epis-\ntemic confidence, catastrophic harm, and computational simplicity. Using retrospective U.S.\nliver transplant registry data, we simulated organ offers under HTU and MELD. HTU consis-\ntently selected candidates with greater predicted post-transplant survival, producing measurable\nimprovements in 5-year restricted mean survival time (≈ 0.25 years per transplant) without\nsystematically abandoning high-risk patients. Sensitivity analyses show that the harm threshold\ngoverns the trade-off between efficiency and urgency, while the epistemic screen curbs over-\nreliance on uncertain model differences. By making these thresholds explicit, HTU transforms\nimplicit value judgments into transparent rules. The approach offers a principled path toward\norgan allocation policies that are both ethically defensible and outcome-improving.",

          "abstract": "Democratic government relies on a great deal of voluntary participation from the population. This participation is not guaranteed, and when citizens are absent from the data collecting processes of the state, a missing data problem occurs. The co-occurrence of the Scottish local elections and the Scottish Census in 2022 provides an unusual opportunity to test hypotheses about common and context-specific drivers of civic non-participation. Using a geospatial approach, we show that ward-level census nonresponse is highly correlated with electoral abstention despite abstention being about five times more common than initial census nonresponse. Statistical modelling demonstrates strong common roles for deprivation and English-language speaking in driving the participation rates of a ward. Meanwhile relatively specific effects are shown for cohabitation in driving census response, and the proportion of young people in driving voting behaviour. We conclude that the similarity between these nonresponse processes represents an opportunity for improving practice in increasing response rates. For example, census “hard to count” indices can incorporate data from elections as “interim” predictions for low-response areas, and framing voting as a household duty, rather than an individual one, may improve turnout.",

The intervention involved training teachers from 45 state-schools to deliver 20 hours of drama-based strategies, rooted in ensemble practice and active engagement with Shakespearean texts, within the English curriculum. \t\nThe impact of the intervention was assessed using measures of reading, language, and writing skills. While no significant effects were observed on self-concept, reading or language, the intervention group demonstrated significantly greater lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and emotional expressiveness in their writing. Pupils exposed to the rehearsal room approaches used more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structures, and their narratives reflected deeper character understanding and emotional insight. These findings suggest that drama-based pedagogy can enhance written language skills, even when writing is not explicitly taught. \nThe study provides proof of principle that rehearsal room strategies can be integrated into mainstream teaching and positively influence pupils’ writing. Future research should explore longer-term impacts, generalisation to other writing contexts, and potential gains in oracy and teacher confidence.",

This study explores the psychosocial, behavioural, and physical effects of these platforms on young adults aged 18 to 30. The researcher employed a questionnaire survey of 111 respondents, in conjunction with existing research. This study investigates the psychosocial effects of binge-watching on young adults and society as a whole. The findings suggest that long watch hours often lead to disturbed sleep, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, mood changes, and a decline in face-to-face engagement with family and friends. While OTT platforms offer unmatched convenience and cultural variety, they also introduce risks that are often overlooked. The study recommends increasing awareness among users, conducting additional research into long-term effects, and implementing proactive measures by policymakers to promote healthier digital habits.",

          "abstract": "This article presents the argument that there are two types of technocratic attitudes in post-communist CEE countries.  the first is unsurprisingly associated with authoritarian attitudes. The latter, however, is not an expression of authoritarianism, but is primarily associated with the so-called democratic deficit: the gap between the importance attached to democracy and (dis)satisfaction with the current state of democratic governance. Previous research has tended to view technocratic attitudes as rather one-dimensional; I show that there are in fact two distinct forms – authoritarian and democratic. The results of the study are relevant from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Technocratic governance thus represents, in the eyes of part of the population of the CEE region, a way of solving the problems of democratic governance.  Technocratic governance is therefore not necessarily and solely associated with authoritarianism, illiberalism, and democratic backsliding, as suggested by the existing scholarly discourse. From an empirical point of view, this study also presents a novel finding: evidence of the heterogeneity associated with technocratic attitudes.",

          "authors": "Hendrik Erz",
          "abstract": "The United States saw a series of economic crises that severely impacted the economy between 1970 and 1980. While the crises and the subsequent presidency of Ronald Reagan have been studied extensively, a perspective from U.S. Congress is lacking. This paper analyzes Congressional discourse between 1960 and 1990 and how the crises of the 1970s have affected it. It looks at how Congressional institutions as well as ideological factors have contributed to and structured the economic discourse during these years. The paper draws on a temporal concept of crisis and the “strategies of action”-approach to model the dynamics of Congressional discourse through the 1970s and 1980s. By analyzing Congressional speech transcripts, this paper tracks the salience of policy instruments in floor speeches. The results show that, in stable years, economic discourse is structured primarily by Congressional committees. In years of crisis, their structuring power weakens, emphasizing the power of ideology and personal background. This paper makes the following contributions: (1) It shows that Congressional discourse in the stable 1960s and late 1980s is structured by its institutions. (2) During the economically unstable 1970s, discourse is additionally structured by Republicans and highly educated representatives, who talk significantly more about issues of taxation than most others.",

          "title": "Answers to Which Questions? Clarifying Estimands to Rethink the Muslim–Antisemitism Link in Germany",
          "authors": "Fabian Kratz",
          "abstract": "Czymara et al. (2025) find that antisemitism is more prevalent among Muslims than among Christians and the religiously unaffiliated. They examine whether these relationships depend on educational attainment or religiosity and aim to explain them using a set of variables, including region of origin, religiosity, and education. I argue that adopting the estimands approach clarifies the research questions, reveals key identification assumptions, and demonstrates the need for causal mediation analysis. Using this approach, I distinguish between confounders and mediators, present revised estimates of what might be considered total effects, and examine the mediating and moderating roles of education and religiosity. The results indicate that caution is warranted when interpreting the link between Muslim denomination and antisemitism. Without controlling for confounders, total effects are overstated. Furthermore, differences in antisemitism between Muslims and Christians are minor among less religious people. However, even among highly educated Muslims, a substantial gap remains relative to Christians and the unaffiliated. I conclude by outlining how the estimands framework may help accomplish one key aim of Czymara et al. (2025): identifying mechanisms that could inform the design of targeted interventions to mitigate antisemitism.",

          "authors": "Isabel Maria Habicht; Eva Zschirnt; Jessica Daikeler",
          "abstract": "Unlike race or gender, parenthood is not a distinct ground of protection under most anti-discrimination laws. Yet, evidence of motherhood penalties in the labor market is well documented. To systematically assess parenthood discrimination in employers' hiring decisions across countries and time, we conducted the first meta-analysis of correspondence studies in this field. We synthesized data from 23 studies (N = 65,440 applications) across 11 countries between 1978 to 2022. Using random-effects models, we calculate discrimination risk ratios and conducted subgroup analyses to examine variation by applicant characteristics, occupational context, and national family policies. Our main findings are: (I) Statistically significant status-based discrimination against parents is evident—but primarily driven by anticipated rather than realized parenthood, as it almost exclusively affects women. (II) These penalties are more pronounced in countries lacking supportive family policies, such as paid maternity leave and high female part-time employment. (III) While parents are not systematically penalized across occupations, women—independent of parental status—face discrimination in management roles, and (though not significantly) in highly qualified and male-dominated occupations.",

          "title": "Of centers and peripheries: Explaining the  macro-structure of book translation flows  in Europe",
          "authors": "Matthias Kuppler",
          "abstract": "This study analyzes the exchange of book translations between countries. Existing research is split over the question of whether translation flows are driven by literary, economic, political, or cultural factors. The forces that stratify countries into centers and peripheries are thus debated. To advance the debate, this study leverages newly collected data on N = 147,443 translations of literary works to reconstruct the network of translation flows between 32 European countries for the time period from 2018 to 2020. The relative impacts of literary prestige, economic infrastructure, state support, and cultural proximity on translation flows are estimated with Generalized Additive Models and the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate that translation flows are best explained by a combination of literary prestige and economic infrastructure. Translations flow from countries with high literary prestige and a strong publishing infrastructure to countries with little prestige and weak infrastructure. The transnational circulation of literature appears as a game in which economic infrastructure confers power and in which the accumulation of literary prestige is the ultimate stake. This suggests a logic of competition in which translations are the medium through which economic power is converted into symbolic recognition. In this view, the market logic and the artistic logic are not contradictory orientations but different steps in ongoing accumulation processes. Although these conclusions are specific to the European literary field, they document a novel viewpoint that is not reducible to established arguments that point to either convergence or divergence of art and commerce.",

          "title": "Sanctified Space and Sovereign Pews: A Land-Use History of Black Church Autonomy from Mainstream Denomination Architecture, Storefront Churches, and Mega Ministries",
          "authors": "Alicea Peyton",
          "abstract": "This article explores the historical and spatial conditions that necessitated Black ecclesial autonomy in the United States, beginning with Absalom Jones’s appointment as the first Black pastor of a mainstream Christian denomination and culminating in the rise of contemporary Black mega churches. Using the framework of land-use enforcement and religious zoning as outlined in The Evolution of Land-Use Enforcement Related to The Religious Storefront Church Movement (Williams-Peyton, 2019), the article traces how exclusionary zoning, denominational gatekeeping, and intra-racial class tensions shaped the road from Black mainstream denominations to the emergence of storefront churches and their architectural successors. Through historical analysis and visual typology—including Table 2’s storefront church models—this study argues that Black religious space has always been a site of resistance, creativity, and contested legitimacy.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, the article applies Wilson’s Evolution of Information Behavior Modeling (1999) to interpret these spatial and theological adaptations as dynamic responses to information needs. Congregants’ pursuit of sanctified space is framed as information-seeking behavior shaped by environmental, psychological, and social variables. The creation of sovereign pews emerges not only as architectural ingenuity but as informational agency rooted in trauma, resilience, and theological innovation. By situating these ecclesial strategies within a broader information behavior framework, the article bridges urban ministry, LIS theory, and cultural preservation.",
