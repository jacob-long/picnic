          "abstract": "Objective\nTo determine whether an open science checklist can be useful for predicting the reproducibility of publications resulting from these grant proposals when used by grant referees assessing them.\n\nStudy Design and Setting\nThis is a comparative accuracy study design using funded grant proposals obtained from online sources (i.e., Open Grants, RIO Journal, NIH, and Grantome). Two independent groups of mock referees assessed open science practices in the proposals and predicted whether the resulting publications would be reproducible, with one group using an Open Science checklist as an intervention, and the other without. Then we attempted to reproduce the primary findings of a resulting publication from the grant proposal. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and overall accuracy were calculated from 2×2 tables, comparing predicted versus actual reproducibility. The primary outcome is the level of reproducibility, measured by the predictive value, the proportion of (non)reproducible study findings that are accurately predicted. This study was conducted between April and September 2025.\n\nResults \nOf seven out of 101 publications (6.9%, 95% CI 2.8–13.8%), the primary results could be reproduced. When using the checklist, only 16.8% of the proposals were expected to be reproducible, while without the checklist 75.2% were expected to be reproducible. When using the checklist, 17 proposals were expected to be reproducible, while only 2 out of these 17 could actually be reproduced (positive predictive value (PPV) 11.8% (95% CI 3.3–34.3%)). Without using the checklist, 76 proposals were thought to be reproducible, while only six out of 76 could actually be reproduced (PPV 7.9% (95% CI 3.7−16.2%)). Sensitivity analysis by research field was not conducted because of small sample sizes in most categories.\n\nConclusion \nThe Open Science checklist has a low positive predictive value, as expected given the low reproducibility prevalence in our sample. Although the differences between the group using the checklist and the group that did not use the checklist may also have been caused by their level of knowledge of reproducibility and open science, neither group could predict which proposals would or would not be reproducible.",

          "abstract": "The rigorous treatment of uncertainties in global environmental assessments is essential to characterise the scientific state of the art and to inform policy. Recognizing this, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has adopted a standardized assessment framework to promote transparency and consistency in reporting the level of confidence in its key findings — most prominently those featured in the Summary for Policymakers. However, applying this framework is challenging and often leads to confidence statements based on expert judgment rather than a transparent and replicable process. Here we recommend an updated framework for assessing uncertainties that is suitable for lines of quantitative ex-post policy evaluation evidence that inform Working Group II and III reports. The framework uses evidence synthesized from systematic reviews to support robust and transparent confidence statements and to provide a clear and traceable rationale for conclusions. Where such synthesized evidence is lacking, we offer practical guidance and outline intermediary steps for improving confidence assessments. Our approach provides a concrete and replicable pathway to enhance the level of transparency and the reliability of scientific assessments that inform climate policy.",

          "authors": "Bayley Wellons; Michael J. Kane; Karl Healey; Christopher N. Wahlheim",
          "abstract": "Proactive interference from prior associations impairs memory for related information with\nchanged features. However, experience with proactive interference can diminish its effects. We\nexamined whether this diminishment occurs because participants learn to sustain their attention\nto detect and later remember changes. Participants (n = 445) completed two cycles of an A-B, AD\ntask, each with unique items. The study phases included word pairs with cues that repeated (A)\nand responses that changed (B → D) from the first to the second half of the lists, along with\ncontrol items (A-D) that only appeared in the second half of the study lists. Sustained attention\nwas assessed using intermittent thought probes that required participants to report their\nattentional states (on-task, task-related, off-task) for the A-B and A-D pairs that appeared\nimmediately before the probes. The test phases included a cued recall test that assessed memory\nfor recent responses (D), intrusions of first responses (B), memory for changes, and memory for\nfirst responses (B). Across cycles, proactive interference diminished, and on-task reports\nindicating attentive encoding increased selectively for A-D pairs. Within participants, on-task\nreports to A-B and A-D pairs were associated with higher rates of recent-response recalls,\nmemory for changes, and first-response recalls. Between participants, total on-task reports\nindicating trait-level sustained attention predicted more accurate memory; this association\nincreased across cycles and was driven by people with better sustained attention. These results\nsuggest that experience reduced interference by promoting strategic attention allocation, which\nimproved memory for similar events and their changed temporal contexts.",

          "authors": "Igor Utochkin; Nicholas Chiang; Wilma A. Bainbridge",
          "abstract": "According to current recognition memory theories, a major source of confusion when people judge which stimuli they remember is the contextual similarity of those stimuli to those from the studied list. However, these theories overlook the potential for confusions to arise from item-specific memorability properties not explained by list properties – namely, the likelihood that a stimulus will be correctly recognized if studied (“hittability”) or falsely recognized if not (“false-alarmability”) – independent of contextual similarity. Here, we introduce a memorability continuum model, which predicts that differences in the individual “hittability” and “false-alarmability” of arbitrary items A and B can often lead to asymmetric recognition performance in a forced-choice task such that recognition of target A over foil B is more accurate than recognition of target B over foil A. In a forced-choice experiment testing memory for real-world object images, the model successfully predicted specific item pair asymmetries. Using deep convolutional neural networks validated on human similarity judgments, we showed that memory-list context explains only a small fraction of variance in false-alarmability but not hittability. We also show that, while inter-item similarity explains a small percentage of variance in their forced-choice discriminability, ignoring their differential memorability properties as targets and foils fails to predict the asymmetries. Our results highlight the need to integrate item-level memorability into existing recognition memory theories.",

          "title": "The Problem with Polarization Research in an Age of Extremism",
          "authors": "Felipe Vilanova; Flavio Azevedo",
          "abstract": "This piece critiques the dominant assumption in social and political psychology, as well as in political science and other disciplines, that polarization is inherently undesirable and should therefore be reduced under all circumstances. We argue that this premise reflects a neutrality bias (or depoliticizing bias) that obscures the asymmetrical nature of contemporary political conflict. We distinguish democratic polarization—agonistic contestation among actors who accept multicultural pluralism, democratic institutions and election outcomes, civil and human rights, and epistemic accountability—from anti-democratic polarization, in which conflict is strategically mobilized to delegitimize opponents, erode institutional constraints, and normalize dehumanization, scapegoating, misinformation, anti-scientific, and conspiratorial narratives as a route to political power. In a global context marked by the growing strength of extremist anti-democratic and authoritarian movements, such distinctions are essential for understanding the normative implications of political conflict for democratic societies. These anti-democratic movements frequently rely on coordinated campaigns that undermine public trust in science and factual reasoning. Under such conditions, polarization cannot be assumed to reflect good-faith disagreement among citizens who share commitments to fair allocation of resources, empirical truth, and evidence-based governance. Treating polarization in these contexts as ordinary democratic conflict risks misdiagnosing authoritarian mobilization as symmetric disagreement rather than recognizing it as a strategic assault on the epistemic and institutional foundations of democracy. Accordingly, when conflict itself is treated as undesirable, research risks inadvertently reinforcing authoritarian dynamics by discouraging legitimate dissent and critical engagement. We call for a reorientation of polarization research toward examining how the suppression of conflict and appeals to consensus and civility may obfuscate meaningful asymmetry and facilitate authoritarian consolidation.",

          "title": "Wired for Conflict? Neurocognitive Mechanisms Linking Threat Perception and Support for War",
          "authors": "Jorge Ratia Avinent; Emilie A. Caspar",
          "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\t\nWhy do some civilians support war despite its moral cost? Although threat perception seems to be a key psychological driver of this support, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain unclear. This narrative review integrates psychological and neuroscientific evidence to clarify how distinct threat types and temporal profiles shape war-supporting attitudes through specific brain circuits.\nMETHODS\nA two-phase narrative review was conducted. Phase I systematically screened psychological literature on threat perception and war support across major databases. Phase II targeted neurobiological studies on threat perception using operationalizations consistent with the psychological research identified in the first phase. Eligible publications included empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses involving human participants. \nRESULTS\nBy typology, realistic threats may activate amygdala–periaqueductal gray (PAG)–insula circuits linked to defensive reflexes; symbolic threats recruit self-referential and moral appraisal networks that may foster justification of violence; and existential threats engage anterior cingulate cortex–insula–bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) dynamics that may amplify worldview defense and group cohesion. By temporal profile, immediate threats elicit rapid amygdala–PAG responses that may bias punitive reactions, while prolonged threats sustain BNST–insula vigilance and weaken prefrontal regulation, fostering hypervigilance and ideological rigidity.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWar support may emerge from dynamic coalitions of salience, valuation, and control networks that reconfigure with threat type, duration, and context. This synthesis outlines a neurocognitive framework for the political neuroscience of threat, which highlights how threat manipulation can mobilize conflict, entrench group hostility, and mirror dysregulated anxiety circuitry, suggesting translational opportunities for prevention and intervention.",

          "authors": "Michael P. Grosz",
          "abstract": "The Big Five personality traits are often treated as common causes of the Big Five items in reflective measurement models such as factor analysis models and item response theory models. For example, extraversion items are modeled as reflective indicators influenced by the latent variable extraversion (i.e., the common cause). However, the Big Five do not correspond to five biological, environmental, or mental entities that could serve as common causes. The notion that the Big Five are common causes is furthermore challenged by direct causal effects, semantic overlap, and logical connections among the Big Five items. Despite these concerns, researchers continue to use methods and theories that implicitly or explicitly assume that the Big Five are common causes. I argue for three shifts: (a) Ontological shift: The Big Five are best understood as composites of personality items—not as real entities that cause item responses. (b) Methodological shift: For descriptive and predictive research, the composite-formative measurement model offers a more appropriate modeling approach than the reflective measurement model, with item retest reliabilities replacing Cronbach's alpha or McDonald's omega for reliability estimation. (c) Conceptual shift: For researchers interested in causal inference—which is essential for building theories and designing interventions—I recommend moving beyond the Big Five toward narrower personality traits grounded in clear theoretical conceptualizations and assessed multi-modally (e.g., self-reports, other-reports, physiological indicators, behavioral measures).",

We examined whether a well‑being screening tool—\nthe WHO‑5—can reliably identify women with probable postpartum depression or anxiety \ncompared with two validated symptom‑based tools: the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression \nScale (EPDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD‑7). We used data from a trial \nof 510 women in Quebec who reported significant depressive symptoms during pregnancy. \nAt three months postpartum, 16% screened positive for depression on the EPDS and 22% \nfor anxiety on the GAD‑7.

The intervention was conducted across four universities with students, faculty and staff, and was evaluated using pre- and post-test evaluations. The results demonstrate improvements in perceived GRV frequency, detection capacity, preparedness, and self-efficacy, while responsibility and intersectional awareness remained stable. Instead of producing uniform change, the intervention yielded a differentiated pattern of effects that are highly relevant for promoting zero-tolerance educational environments.

          "authors": "Lukas Kob; Tomas Marvan",
          "abstract": "Recently, several authors have argued that the current impasse in consciousness science supports a pluralistic interpretation: the view that seemingly contradictory findings may both be valid because consciousness can be brought about in different ways, each sufficient to generate conscious experience. We analyze different versions of pluralism to determine under what conditions it offers a viable interpretation of consciousness science. We argue that viable pluralism requires a two-factor framework distinguishing general consciousness factors (mechanisms rendering contents conscious) from content encoding itself. Moreover, NCC kinds must be finite in number and systematically ordered to enable a unified scientific model. While pluralism enables testable hypotheses, significant ontological tensions arise: how can consciousness constitute a unified natural kind if realized by fundamentally distinct NCC kinds? Drawing on philosophy of science, we propose an alternative interpretation in terms of scientific rather than natural kinds. Our goal is not to advocate for pluralism, but rather, to critically examine its viability and implications. Based on this, we urge the field to engage more explicitly with the foundational assumptions that shape consciousness research.",

          "abstract": "Objective\n\nResearch indicates higher prevalence of dissociative experiences in adolescents than in adults. However, the exact phenomenology and underlying mechanisms of dissociation in adolescence have yet to be clarified. The current study explores the presentation of, and possible psychological factors underlying, dissociation in this population.\n\nMethod\n\nTwo online self-report surveys captured data from 3076 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. Participants completed the Černis Felt Sense of Anomaly (ČEFSA) scale of felt sense of anomaly-type dissociation, alongside measures of mechanisms implicated in a cognitive-behavioural model of dissociation in adults (cognitive appraisals, alexithymia, and affect intolerance). N=409 completed the ČEFSA scale at a second timepoint, one month later.\n\nResults\n\nMost (91.87%) adolescents endorsed at least one ČEFSA item. The mean number of endorsed items was 13.00 (SD = 9.67). The most endorsed factors of the ČEFSA were Altered Sense of Agency (82.96%), Anomalous experience of the Self (76.76%), and Altered Sense of Connection (73.76%).\n\nMediation analysis indicated that emotion regulation (expressive suppression) mediated the relationship between Time One and Time Two dissociation scores: greater suppression was associated with greater dissociation one month later. No other tested variables showed statistically significant mediation.\n\nConclusions\n\nAdolescents are likely to experience dissociation as detachment and disconnection, particularly relating to their selfhood and external world (i.e., depersonalisation and derealisation). \nThis study suggests that the key element of a recent cognitive-behavioural model of dissociative experiences in adults – that affect intolerance perpetuates dissociation – may also be applicable in adolescence.",

          "authors": "Giovanni Pezzulo; Günther Knoblich; Domenico Maisto; Francesco Donnarumma; Elisabeth Pacherie; Uri Hasson",
          "abstract": "Humans act together to achieve feats they could never achieve alone and communicate to ensure alignment of meaning and understanding across different individuals. Explaining the unique human joint action and communication abilities poses an enormous challenge because it requires a systematic account of how people go beyond their own individual perceptions, thoughts, and needs to achieve joint outcomes and align their understanding. Here, we advance a new unified computational framework for explaining joint action and communication. It builds upon influential predictive processing architectures, extending them from individual cognition to multiagent, interactive settings. We assume that joint action and communication involve using and updating agent-neutral models that enable co-agents to predict collective outcomes of interactions regardless of who achieved them. This contrasts with previous frameworks postulating that agent-specific models predict action outcomes for self and others. We discuss three key claims derived from our framework: 1) Co-agents use agent-neutral predictive frameworks during joint action; 2) Co-agents update agent-neutral models interactively by shaping others’ predictions through verbal and non-verbal communication; and 3) Agent-neutral models enable dynamic role allocation during joint action. We highlight how these three claims stem from our proposal, what evidence currently favors or disfavors them, and what novel experiments could be conducted to test them further. Our agent-neutral predictive processing framework will provide a new perspective for understanding the individual basis of human sociality, which closely links theories of joint action and communication to principles of computational neuroscience.",

          "authors": "Guro Stensby Sjuls; Florencia Assaneo; Judit Gervain; Mila Vulchanova",
          "abstract": "Speech is quasi-rhythmic, with key acoustic events, such as syllables, occurring at semi-regular intervals (about 4.5 syllables/second) across languages. Adults’ ability to align their speech motor productions to this rate, known as sensorimotor synchronization to speech, is linked to the auditory-motor coupling of the brain, as well as their performance on cognitive tasks. When does the ability emerge and does it play a role during early language development? This question was addressed by measuring infants’ non-nutritive sucking (NNS) while presented with syllable streams at two relevant rates (3 Hz and 4.5 Hz) at 2 - 4 months of age (N = 24; 9 females). NNS is an innate oromotor response produced by infants in the absence of receiving nutrition, which typically consists of periods of rhythmic behavior (bursts) and pauses. We evaluated whether infants showed tempo-flexibility, i.e., whether they adjusted NNS from their spontaneous frequency to better align with the frequency of the presented stimuli. We also explored phase synchronization, i.e., the degree of synchronization in time between NNS and the stimuli. Further, we assessed the correlation between these synchronization measures and communicative development at 12 months of age. NNS bursts became significantly more organized around 3 Hz when exposed to the 4.5 Hz speech stimuli compared to baseline, where NNS averaged around 1-2 Hz. Interestingly, infants also showed some phase synchronization to the 4.5 Hz, but not the 3 Hz stimulus. Although, phase synchronization to the 4.5 Hz stimulus was still relatively low and did not follow the same bimodal distribution, i.e. of “high” and “low” auditory-motor synchronizers to speech, that has previously been observed for adults (Assaneo et al., 2019). Neither of our measures of sensorimotor synchronization was significantly correlated with language outcomes at 12 months of age. Infants display some flexibility and sensorimotor synchronization in their NNS response towards the speech stimuli, which suggests that the auditory-motor coupling is operational in a rudimentary form from as early as 2 to 4 months of age.",

          "abstract": "Teachers’ motivational behaviours play a critical role in shaping student outcomes, but commonly used measurement approaches rely on self-report or observation. These are vulnerable to bias and practical constraints, limiting rigorous theory testing and intervention research. To overcome these limitations, and building on advances in language-based behavioural analysis, we developed a phrase-based coding framework for classifying teachers’ motivational language based on Self-Determination Theory. We first compiled a pool of candidate phrases. Experts reviewed this pool to ensure face validity and refinement, resulting in the full, unfiltered dictionary. In the training set, transcripts from the most and least need-supportive teachers—as determined by observers—were compared using weighted log odds ratios to identify phrases more characteristic of each group. We then filtered the dictionary using these odds ratios, resulting in the filtered dictionary. The expert-derived dictionary consisted of 227 words (149 need-supportive and 82 need-thwarting). Correlations between dictionary-based and observer ratings were moderate and significant for the unfiltered dictionary (r = .34), comparable to inter-observer agreement, rating the same lesson (r = .32). Filtering the dictionary improved accuracy on the training set (r = .49) but decreased accuracy on the test set compared to the unfiltered dictionary (r = .64 vs. .73). This phrase-based framework provides a cost-efficient and reliable method for analysing teachers’ motivational language. It appears to perform comparably to human observers in predicting need-supportive teaching and offers a practical tool for teacher education, as well as a theoretically grounded basis for training more advanced models.",

Using a large U.S.-based sample (N = 7,879, 47% female) and bivariate latent change score models, we examined longitudinal associations between self-reported school/peer support and MRI-based measures of cortical thickness of social brain regions (medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), banks of the superior temporal sulcus (banks of STS), and temporal pole (TP)) from age ~12 to ~14; and how these associations related to positive affect at age ~15. School and peer support were differentially associated with cortical thickness changes and demonstrated sex-specific patterns. We observed correlated change between school support and thickness of the SMG (β = 0.04, p = .01) and TP (β = 0.04, p = .02), as well as female-specific correlated change between peer support and TP thickness (β = 0.05, p &lt; .01), with less steep declines in support associated with less cortical thinning. Although school support at age ~12 was not associated with subsequent cortical thickness change, greater peer support at this age was associated with greater cortical thinning in the SMG (β = -0.05, p &lt; .01) and with a female- specific effect in the mOFC (β = -0.05, p = .02). Additionally, less steep declines in school and peer support were associated with greater positive affect at age ~15 (school: βs = 0.20, ps &lt; .001; peer: βs = 0.07, ps &lt; .001), and less cortical thinning in the SMG was related to greater positive affect (βs = 0.05-0.06, ps &lt; .01). These findings highlight nuanced links between social support, structural cortical development, and positive affect, and underscore the importance of supportive peer relationships and school environments in promoting adolescent socio-emotional development.",

This study examined associations between adult attachment orientations (ECR-RS), psychological distress (DASS-21), and the use of GenAI for mental health support. In a nationally diverse sample of 584 adults who utilize GenAI tools, 29.3% of users reported turning to these models for emotional support or coping advice, with prevalence rising to 47.0% among those experiencing severe distress. Hierarchical logistic regression revealed that psychological distress was the primary predictor of use. While attachment anxiety was initially associated with AI-mediated support seeking, this association was largely accounted for by distress levels, suggesting that anxiously attached individuals may turn to AI primarily due to heightened emotional need. Conversely, attachment avoidance emerged as a robust negative predictor after adjusting for distress, indicating a reluctance to engage with AI support even under conditions of need. Overall, findings position general-purpose GenAI as an accessible, low-barrier resource that is disproportionately utilized by distressed individuals, underscoring the need for research on the safety and efficacy of this emerging digital behavior.",

          "abstract": "This paper develops a model of information seeking and avoidance in multi-attribute choice. The analysis shows that, in trade-off choices where attributes are negatively correlated, information avoidance can emerge as an optimal information policy, as seeking less information can improve preference alignment. Consumers choose which attributes to seek or avoid, while attention acts as the mechanism transforming processed information into decision weights. When multiple attributes are jointly processed, diminishing returns to attention compress their relative influence, reducing differentiation in effective decision weights. In environments characterized by negatively correlated attributes, selectively avoiding a less important attribute can yield choices more closely aligned with underlying preferences than broad information seeking. By contrast, seeking information across multiple conflicting attributes amplifies weight compression and increases expected utility loss. The model further identifies conditions under which information avoidance should diminish, showing how changes in attribute variance, search costs, or beliefs about attribute trade-offs restore the benefits of broader information seeking. These results have implications for information design and consumer welfare.",

          "abstract": "Speakers are typically assumed to adhere to Gricean communicative principles, which allows comprehenders to make inferences about the intended meaning. However, such inferences depend on the speaker being a pragmatic communicator, and overestimating the speaker's pragmatic competence may result in incorrect interpretations. We investigate whether comprehenders track speakers' pragmatic competence during interaction and adjust their interpretations accordingly. Across two paradigms, we find strong evidence of such an adaptation effect, whereby comprehenders lower their confidence in the pragmatic interpretation when interacting with a speaker who behaves less optimally. We propose a Bayesian belief updating model of this adaptation process. Our modeling results suggest that in some situations listeners may learn not through direct observation of speaker behavior, but by reasoning about their own interpretations: adaptation occurs on trials that are ambiguous from the listener’s perspective, even when they are unambiguous from the speaker’s perspective. Additionally, we observe evidence for different adaptation strategies, which may be explained by different prior beliefs about the speaker and tendency to generalize across interlocutors.",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this prevailing view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary neurogenetic origins (explaining developmental multifinality and fanning) but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes (explaining developmental equifinality). While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

          "abstract": "Personality disorders (PDs) are commonly associated with impairments in social cognition, particularly facial emotion recognition. However, evidence also suggests deficits in more basic cognitive functions, including lower-order face processing (e.g., detection of non-emotional facial features) and indicators of general intelligence (e.g., crystallized intelligence). We examined associations of facial emotion recognition, lower-order face processing, and crystallized intelligence with personality pathology, considering both categorical and dimensional PD models and distinguishing general personality pathology (personality functioning) from specific personality pathology (pathological personality traits and specific PDs). We further tested whether associations between personality functioning and facial emotion recognition were accounted for by lower-order face processing or crystallized intelligence. In a clinical sample (n = 219), cognitive abilities were assessed using performance-based measures, and personality pathology was assessed using interviews and self-reports. Structural equation modeling, including correlated factor and bifactor-(S-1) models, was applied to separate general from specific personality pathology variance. General personality pathology showed strong negative associations with facial emotion recognition and small-to-moderate negative associations with lower-order face processing and crystallized intelligence. Associations with specific personality pathology were substantially attenuated when controlling for general personality pathology. The link between personality functioning and facial emotion recognition was only minimally accounted for by lower-order face processing or crystallized intelligence. These findings indicate that cognitive deficits in PD primarily reflect severity rather than disorder-specific variance, while also pointing to partially independent cognitive domains linked to general personality dysfunction. Our study suggests that dimensional models provide a more nuanced framework for understanding cognitive impairment in personality pathology.",

Sign-trackers (ST) attribute both incentive and predictive values to these cues, while goal-trackers (GT) assign solely predictive value, orienting their attention rapidly toward the forthcoming reward. Although animal studies report sign-tracking and goal-tracking as stable, trait-like learning styles often related to maladaptive behaviors, human research has produced inconsistent results, raising questions about the reliability and the stability of this behavior. To address these issues, we investigated the test-retest reliability and stability of the classification over a four-month period of the eye-gaze index most commonly used in human sign- and goal-tracking literature. Our findings revealed good capacity for detecting sign-tracking behavior, but limited consistency in identifying goal-tracking behavior, resulting in suboptimal overall reliability. These results raise the possibility that goal-tracking may be either genuinely rare in the population or poorly captured by the current index. Overall, while the gaze index holds promise for identifying ST behavior, methodological refinements or alternative approaches may be needed to reliably detect GT behavior and improve the utility of this measure in future research.",

          "authors": "Raunak M Pillai; Jay Joseph Van Bavel",
          "abstract": "Classic social psychological accounts of belief formation propose that beliefs can be influenced by directional motives to reach specific conclusions. Such theories have been particularly influential in recent accounts of the spread of political misinformation. However, the assumption of directionally-motivated belief formation has been challenged by theories reexplaining motivational effects in terms of purely cognitive factors like prior beliefs or information exposure. The goal of the present manuscript is to provide a direct test of the assumption that social-identity-based motives can shape what people believe. We report three experiments (N = 1,459) causally isolating the effects of identity-based directional motives on belief formation using minimal groups. In Experiment 1, participants were more likely to trust, and thus believe statements endorsed by, arbitrarily assigned in-group versus out-group members. Experiment 2 replicates these findings and experimentally demonstrates that this in- group bias in belief can be affected by social motivations to affiliate with groups: exposing participants to social exclusion selectively reduced belief in statements endorsed by out-group members. Experiment 3 suggests that these effects arise because social motivations moderate people's relative trust in novel in-group over out-group members. Together, these results address longstanding debates about the possible role of social motivations in epistemic processes by demonstrating that social identities, unconfounded from other explanatory factors, can shape who people trust and what they believe.",

          "abstract": "Human social life is filled with coordination problems: passing each other in a hallway, taking turns talking and listening, differentiating the meanings of \"hook up with\" and \"meet up with,\" gathering at the same time and place, etc. But what happens when we suffer a mix-up—for instance, we get stuck dancing back and forth in the hallway, or I casually mention that I “hooked up” with your mother last night? Here, I argue that such mix-ups posed a significant adaptive problem for our ancestors, disrupting cooperation, damaging reputations, fomenting needless conflict, and destroying valuable relationships. Natural selection favored three solutions to this adaptive problem: 1) a sense of humor (i.e., the ability to detect, anticipate, and avoid mix-ups), 2) mutual laughter in response to humor  (which creates common knowledge of the mix-up and defuses its costs), and 3) joking as a hard-to-fake signal of one’s ability to detect and avoid mix-ups (and thus one’s value as a coordination partner). I present a formal model of these phenomena suggesting that agents with a sense of humor, the ability to laugh at (or mutually signal) the humor they’ve sensed, and a preference for partners with a ‘good sense of humor,’ would have been favored by natural selection under conditions that were plausibly characteristic of human evolution. I use the model to shed light on the nature of wordplay, comic timing, practical jokes, awkwardness, embarrassment, mockery, absurdity, mirth, seriousness, impersonations, slapstick, satire, creepy clowns, and cringe comedy.",

Due to their spatial heterogeneity, tumours can be problematic for voxel-wise lesion-symptom mapping. In addition, lesion maps of resection cavities may not capture displaced/deformed tracts, limiting the accuracy of white matter disconnection approaches based on population average atlas templates. Here we explore whether shape features extracted from individualised diffusion MRI tractography such as volume, curvature, surface area, irregularity, and span of six language-related white matter tracts are able to predict long-term speech production outcomes in survivors of left hemisphere primary brain tumours: The arcuate (AF), uncinate (UF), inferior longitudinal (ILF), inferior frontal occipital (IFOF), ventral component of the superior longitudinal (SLF III) fasciculi, and frontal aslant tract (FAT). Best fit regression models selected via cross-validation and both univariate and multivariate lesion-symptom mapping analyses including clinical and demographic variables were used to compare the predictive capability of tract shape features, atlas disconnection estimates, and lesion location. Lesion-symptom mapping failed to reveal any significant relationships with speech production outcomes. A model comprising atlas-based disconnection estimates from the UF, SLF III, and FAT was able to significantly predict long-term speech production outcomes (R2 = 0.14). However, a model comprising shape features of the FAT, SLF III, and IFOF explained considerably more variance (R2 = 0.37). Finally, we show that, in this dataset, shape features uniquely predict 26% variance that is not accounted for by disconnection estimates, demonstrating their relevance for predicting speech production outcomes in post-surgical patients.",

However, less is known about the influence that underlying structural, modal, or conceptual intervention features have on their effectiveness, which limits both the theoretical interpretation of the effects, as well as the practical construction of theories in their most effective implementation. Here, we empirically examine the impact of 19 intervention features ranging from attentional ease or outcome-specificity, to delivery modality (e.g., text, video, image, open-ended questions), or conceptual construction (e.g., risk, moralization, emotions), on the effectiveness of 274 psychological interventions extracted from 15 megastudies that included N=4.13 million participants. We find that only one feature - the interventions’ specificity to the outcomes measured - significantly and consistently predicts effectiveness, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to outcomes of interest.

While current pharmacological treatments fail to address demoralization's existential dimensions, and despite the potential effectiveness of a number of psychosocial interventions, not everyone responds to behavioral therapies and they remain chronically underfunded in mainstream oncology. Mindfulness-Based Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy (MB-PAT) offers enhanced therapeutic potential by synergistically integrating evidence-based mindfulness training with psilocybin's neuroplastic effects; however, the traditional dyadic delivery model limits scalability within healthcare s settings. This viewpoint opines that MB-PAT delivered in a group format represents a potentially optimal solution to this evidence-implementation gap. Our contention is that MB-PAT may harness synergistic biopsychosocial mechanisms that directly counter the isolation of demoralization through an integrative approach. We finish by highlighting the Canadian Network for Psychedelic-Assisted Cancer Therapy (CAN-PACT) as a pioneering initiative poised to generate critical evidence, infrastructure and capacity through its planned multi-phase initiatives and projects. By leveraging existing group-therapy infrastructure and therapist familiarity with mindfulness-based interventions as the basis for multi-site national clinical trials, and developing a scalable, equity-focused delivery model, MB-PAT offers a pragmatic pathway to integrate potentially transformative existential care into publicly funded Canadian oncology practice.",

Confirming the first assumption, residents of more unequal areas reported stronger and more frequent upward and downward economic comparisons. These associations were mediated by perceived competitiveness. Challenging the second assumption, income inequality was associated with a mix of emotional responses to comparison: Inequality consistently predicted resentment when comparing with better-off others and compassion when comparing with worse-off others. Inequality also predicted shame, hope, relief, contempt, and anxiety in one study but not the other. Finally, inequality predicted support for redistribution, an association mediated by resentment and compassion. Together, the findings confirm that income inequality fuels social comparison but reveal that its emotional and attitudinal consequences are more nuanced than commonly assumed.",

Participants who received anodal stimulation rated metaphors to be less comprehensible than participants who received sham stimulation. No effects were observed for literal or nonsensical sentences. In addition, word-level semantic characteristics affected metaphor comprehensibility ratings but not literal or nonsensical sentences.

          "abstract": "Objectives: Our study examines how individuals perceive responses to mental health–related questions when these are generated either by an automated system or by a licensed psychologist. Specifically, we compare evaluations across three dimensions: empathy, utility, and expectation, and explore whether digital health literacy shapes these perceptions. Methods: Two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, 36 participants evaluated a response to a question they had personally submitted, attributed either to an automated system or to a psychologist. In Study 2, 126 participants assessed a standardized set of question–answer pairs, evenly divided between the two response sources. Across both studies, participants completed the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) to examine whether digital health literacy was associated with response evaluations. Results: In personalized contexts (Study 1), psychologist-generated responses were generally preferred across empathy, utility, and expectation, although differences did not reach statistical significance. In depersonalized contexts (Study 2), automated responses received higher ratings on all three dimensions, with large effect sizes. No significant associations emerged between eHealth literacy and participants’ evaluations. Conclusions: These findings indicate that automated mental health responses can be perceived as empathetic and useful, particularly in standardized or less personally involving situations. However, they may not fully reproduce the relational qualities typically associated with human interaction. The results support approaches that integrate automated systems with professional expertise in mental health communication.",

New approaches for increasing vaccination rates are needed. We tested whether brief text conversations with the artificial intelligence large language model (LLM) GPT-4 Turbo could significantly increase intentions to vaccinate children against HPV.\nMethods\nWe conducted a pre-registered randomized clinical trial in which participants were assigned to a text conversation with GPT-4 Turbo in which the LLM (with no specific training) tried to persuade them to vaccinate against HPV, a CDC informational brochure, or a control conversation with the LLM about an unrelated topic. In October 2025, we recruited 7368 Americans via Cint Exchange who had unvaccinated eligible children or did not yet have children, and whose intentions to vaccinate their children against HPV was under 75 on a 0-100 scale. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention measures of HPV vaccination intentions for sons and daughters. Randomization was via Qualtrics, with no masking possible. Our primary outcome was change in HPV vaccination intentions.\nFindings\nThe AI-dialogue significantly increased vaccination intentions relative to the control (sons: 9.73 points, 95% CI [6.89, 12.56], p &lt; .001; daughters: 7.72 points, 95% CI [4.98, 10.46], p &lt; .001); as did the brochure (sons: 8.04 points, 95% CI [4.83, 11.25], p &lt; .001; daughters: 5.51 points, 95% CI [2.52, 8.50], p &lt; .001). The differences between the AI-dialogue and the brochure were not statistically significant (sons, p = .268; daughters, p = .120). Post-assignment attrition rates did not significantly differ between treatment arms (AI-dialgue, 11.9pp; brochure, 14.2pp), although both arms had significantly more attrition than the control (5.1pp); our results were robust to baseline-carried-forward imputation. Post-hoc analysis found that the AI-dialogue was significantly more likely than the CDC brochure to produce large increases in vaccination intentions (e.g. &gt;30 points). Fact-checking of all 15,559 AI-generated claims using an independent AI model with web search capability revealed high overall accuracy (median = 100/100, mean = 95.4/100 on a scale where 0 = completely inaccurate and 100 = completely accurate), with only 0.4% of claims being medically inaccurate.\nInterpretation\nDialogues with GPT-4 Turbo offer a potential strategy for increasing HPV vaccination intentions at scale.",

We conducted a randomized controlled trial in an intelligent tutoring system for math and science, involving 164,532 students (Grades 8-12) who completed 17 million practice problems. We tested two scalable interventions: a brief persuasive prompt encouraging students to try again, and a visual default nudge that highlighted the retry option. Both interventions increased persistence after failure, and when combined, their effects were additive—suggesting they operate through distinct psychological mechanisms. The nudge had a much larger immediate effect, but the prompt showed proportionally greater spillover to untreated problems. These findings advance theories of persuasive design, demonstrating that implicit, interface-level nudges and explicit motivational prompts can be combined to avoid redundancy while amplifying impact.",

          "authors": "Juha Silvanto",
          "abstract": "I propose that imagery's origins lie in interoceptive processing, the phylogenetically ancient system linking internal bodily states to valence, emotion, and motivational salience (Craig, 2009; Barrett, 2017). Interoceptive signals inherently specify survival-relevant goals: hunger with approach, threat-arousal with avoidance, sexual arousal with pursuit. This makes interoception the necessary foundation for any planning system because planning requires knowing what you are planning for: which bodily states and emotions to pursue or avoid. Motor imagery emerged first, extending forward models to enable offline action planning. Because survival-relevant motor actions already involved interoceptive states, motor imagery inherited interoceptive integration from these forward models. Motor imagery worked well for first- person action planning directly coupled to immediate motor execution. However, as social complexity increased, organisms needed to simulate scenarios involving others; tracking rival alliances, predicting dominance conflicts, monitoring mating competitors. Here, organisms faced a discriminability problem rooted in the low-dimensional nature of autonomic arousal (Barrett, 2017). The same autonomic pattern can occur across different social situations (dominance encounters, rival conflicts, mating opportunities) that demand distinct behavioral responses. Visual imagery evolved to solve this discriminability problem by binding distinctive sensory features with interoceptive states. This binding makes simulations goal-directed: imagining a dominant rival automatically activates the associated arousal pattern and avoidance tendency, while imagining a mating opportunity activates approach motivation. Mental simulations therefore evolved as multimodal representations where sensory and interoceptive components are bound during construction itself, creating images that inherently possess valence and motivation, not as subsequent responses to neutral sensory simulations but as constitutive features of mental images themselves (cf Silvanto &amp; Nagai, 2025).",

Across two studies involving French employees in individual, open-plan, and flex-office settings (N = 340; N = 225), exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a robust three-factor correlated structure. The PDS demonstrates strong internal consistency (α = .81–.83) and excellent model fit (CFI = .96; RMSEA = .058), explaining 45.7% of the variance.

          "abstract": "This study utilized data from a large-scale multi-ethnic cohort study on thousands of English children aged between 7 and 10 years from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds, enabling novel, detailed exploration of age, difficulty, serial order effects, and error patterns in children’s working memory. Children completed three tasks that are routinely used in cognitive testing and the developmental literature to assess working memory, covering verbal and visuospatial domains and different levels of executive control. Children’s working memory performance increased with age for all tasks, and were particularly pronounced when more executive control was required. There was a linear and steep decline in performance with increasing difficulty (i.e., memory load) across all tasks. In contrast to previous literature, the serial order curves for the verbal and visuospatial tasks showed distinct patterns. Further, the task requiring the most executive control (backward digit recall) indicated a strategic saturation effect where children’s performance did not scale as memory load increased. Transpositions were the most common error across all tasks, and typically involved items being recalled one position away from their true location, suggesting a locality constraint. However, with increasing task difficulty there was an increase in items displaced beyond the adjacent locality, and these patterns appeared more pronounced for the younger age groups, which suggests children may have less precise or less stable positional bindings. These findings offer novel insights into children’s performance on routinely used working memory tasks and provide a foundation for refining both theoretical models and practical assessments in developmental research.",

          "abstract": "Doomscrolling, defined as the compulsive consumption of negative online information, has been increasingly linked to poorer mental health and heightened anxiety in contexts of societal threat. The present research had two main aims: (1) to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Polish adaptation of the Doomscrolling Scale (DSS) and (2) to examine the mediating role of doomscrolling in the relationship between social media addiction and war-related anxiety and persistent thinking about war. Two cross-sectional studies were conducted among Polish adults (Study 1: N = 530; Study 2: N = 529). In Study 1, confirmatory factor analysis supported the one factor structure of both the full 15-item DSS and its short 4-item version. The scales demonstrated high internal consistency and satisfactory convergent validity through positive associations with social media addiction, fear of missing out, escapism, and psychological distress, as well as discriminant validity through weaker relations with well-being and life satisfaction. In Study 2, structural equation modeling indicated that doomscrolling fully mediated the relationships between social media addiction and both anxiety of war and persistent thinking about war. Overall, the findings confirm that doomscrolling is a coherent and measurable construct linked to maladaptive patterns of media use and emotional responses to threat-related content. The validated Polish versions of the DSS may be used in research and applied settings to assess risk associated with excessive exposure to negative information and to inform preventive and psychoeducational interventions aimed at promoting healthier media consumption.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Assessing the validity of testimony is critical in sexual abuse cases, particularly in case of recovered memories, whose authenticity has been considered controversial. The current study examined whether different types of memories (i.e., continuous, spontaneously recovered, recovered following an active search) could be reliably distinguished and whether they differed in the extent to which they are supported by evidence. Hypotheses: We predicted that three types of memories could be reliably differentiated: Continuous memories, spontaneously recovered memories, and recovered memories following an active search. We further predicted that continuous memories and spontaneously recovered memories would be more frequently corroborated by evidence than recovered memories following an active search. Method: We analyzed 140 police files on complex cases of sexual abuse in the distant past in which the prosecutor requested advice from an expert committee of behavioral experts. One pair of coders identified memory type based on continuity and retrieval, and another set of coders scored the degree of supporting evidence. Results: Memory types could be differentiated reliably. Statements from (alleged) victims in the continuous memory group were corroborated more often than those in the recovered memory-following-search group, which were rarely supported by strong evidence. The data were inconclusive regarding whether recovered memories following an active search and spontaneously recovered memories differ in the extent to which they were corroborated by evidence. Exploratory analyses showed that spontaneously recovered memories were more often related to single incidents, whereas recovered memories following an active search frequently involved sexual abuse over an extended period, including reports of multiple perpetrators. Conclusions: Reports of sexual abuse in the distant past can be reliably categorized into three types that help shed light on the likelihood of finding corroborating evidence in a criminal context. Recovered memories should not be treated as a homogeneous phenomenon because their phenomenology varies.",

As a direct measure of overall welfare, wellbeing data are not only a useful screening tool to detect unintended consequences but also allow analysts to appraise the \"full\" impacts of behavioural public policies.

Yet, the mechanisms through which these components contribute to global program outcomes are largely unclear. Potential mechanisms are the translation of immediate, session-level effects, amount of attended sessions, and social support. Ecological momentary assessment might reveal these mechanisms at the session-level and determine their link with program-level outcomes.\nWe investigated an 8-week, naturalistic, health-insurance-provided group-based secondary prevention program comprising weekly outdoor PA with weekly PsycEd in individuals experiencing mild mood disturbances. To assess session-level mechanisms, 80 participants reported their current mood and stress (time pressure and burden) before (3 pm) and after (9 pm) session times and further rated each session on helpfulness, group atmosphere, and social support. In addition, session attendance was recorded. Concerning pre-post program effects, affective well-being (WHO-5) was assessed. Regarding potential links, we examined moderation of pre-post program effects by the assessed mechanisms. \nRegarding session-level mechanisms, results revealed that sessions improved both mood and stress burden compared to non-session days, while only PA sessions improved time pressure. PA sessions were also rated higher on helpfulness, group atmosphere, and social support. Concerning program-level outcomes, WHO-5 scores improved from pre- to post-program with small effect size. Regarding links, participants attending more sessions had higher WHO-5 improvements, but no other mechanism variable moderated the improvement. \nThese findings illustrate immediate improvements on the session level in mood and stress. Yet, these effects did not translate into more global outcomes such as affective well-being across the program, but attendance did. Potential program effectiveness might be boosted by targeting continued attendance. Outdoor PA might be slightly superior to PsycEd in activating group benefits and could potentially be expanded.",

Participants (N = 515) completed face recognition tasks and personality, contact, ethnic-racial identity, and emotions measures. Network analysis revealed a hierarchical face recognition model: hostility is the central mediator through which personal identity variables influence other-race recognition. Intergroup emotions and ethnic-racial identity further play dual roles in recognition. While hostility and negative own-race attitudes impair other-race recognition, multiculturalist identity, empathy, and affection reduce hostility to improve performance. This study redefines other-race recognition as rooted in intergroup emotions and ethnic-racial identity, rather than merely perceptual or socio-cognitive processes.

          "abstract": "Cultural experiences can strongly shape human cognition. Prior research has yielded mixed evidence on whether literacy—a culturally acquired skill—affects spoken language processing. Using an individual differences approach, we examined whether literacy predicts the speed of spoken word recognition. Using a large dataset (Hintz et al., 2025) that is unprecedented in size (number of participants) and depth (number of skills assessed), 655 typically developed native Dutch adults between 18 and 30 years carried out a lexical decision task: Participants listened to Dutch words and nonwords and judged their lexical status as quickly as possible. Drift diffusion modelling of response times provided drift rate estimates indexing the speed of auditory evidence accumulation. To clarify which aspects of literacy matter, we distinguished between representational literacy (vocabulary, orthographic knowledge, author recognition) and procedural literacy (self-paced reading fluency, rapid automatized naming). Psychometric network analysis and structural equation modelling showed that spoken word recognition was reliably predicted by representational literacy, whereas procedural literacy contributed little once shared variance was controlled. Domain-general skills (processing speed, working memory, nonverbal reasoning) explained additional variance but did not mediate literacy effects. Our findings indicate that extensive written language experience enhances spoken word recognition primarily by sharpening and enriching linguistic representations, rather than by improving reading-related procedures. Literacy’s beneficial influence on spoken word processing thus resides primarily at the representational level.",

We conducted a 2-week AA study with four prompts per day, yielding 8,474 measurement occasions from 205 participants. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to predict momentary compliance using psychological, contextual, temporal, and prior compliance variables. Compliance was most likely when participants experienced “typical” levels of stress, time pressure, and mood. Participants were more compliant when at home (vs. elsewhere) and when alone (vs. with others). Compliance was also higher on work days (vs. nonwork days).

This study presents the Children’s Voices on School Well-Being (CV-SWB), a mixed-methods instrument designed for children aged 3 to 12 years. The CV-SWB includes 21 items rated on a three-point Likert scale with visual support, complemented by open-ended questions eliciting children’s justifications. The instrument was individually administered to 548 children from preschool and elementary education in 12 schools in Spain. Exploratory factor analyses supported a five-factor structure: Belonging and Fairness, School Liking, Daily Relationships, Adult Care, and Conflict and Victimization, with evidence of measurement invariance across age and gender. Qualitative analyses revealed coherent thematic domains in children’s explanations, converging on personal relationships, school atmosphere, self-perception, and academic aspects, supporting the interpretability of children’s responses. Practice or Policy: The CV-SWB provides researchers and practitioners with an appropriate tool to assess school well-being from children’s perspectives from early schooling. By integrating quantitative ratings with children’s verbal explanations, the instrument facilitates a comprehensive and child-centered understanding of school experiences, informing early educational practices and policies promoting well-being and participation in preschool and elementary settings.",

A majority reported ever using or purchasing self-help products. Usage was more likely among women, more educated and younger adults, those higher in openness, lower in emotional stability and self-esteem, and those desiring to change their personality (in bivariate associations). Among users, higher cognitive ability and education were associated with spending less time on self-help products. However, people did not differ in personality and well-being trajectories depending on self-help product use and usage intensity, raising questions about the effectiveness of such products for these outcomes.",

          "authors": "Hubert Plisiecki",
          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly treated by the public as if they\npossess subjective experience. Colombatto and Fleming (2024) recently showed that most U.S.\nadults attribute at least some phenomenal consciousness to ChatGPT, despite a scientific consensus\nthat current AI systems are not conscious. The present study provides the first large-scale\nmeasurement of this phenomenon in Poland. A nationally distributed online survey panel (N =\n1,736) rated ChatGPT’s capacity for conscious experience on a 1–100 scale. Most respondents\n(74%) attributed ChatGPT at least minimal consciousness, closely mirroring prior U.S. findings.\nSmall exploratory associations suggested that older and more highly educated participants were\nslightly more skeptical, whereas right-leaning respondents attributed slightly more consciousness.\nThese effects, though modest, indicate theoretically relevant variation. Interpreting these results\nthrough Epley’s three-factor anthropomorphism model, the work argues that limited mechanistic\nunderstanding of LLMs, highly human-like behavior, and unmet social needs likely contribute to\nwidespread phenomenal consciousness attribution. Given ethical concerns about over-trust,\nparasocial attachment, and responsibility misperception, these beliefs matter for AI deployment\nand governance. Our findings highlight the need for evidence-based educational strategies that\nimprove public understanding of how LLMs work while allowing beneficial use of the technology.",

          "authors": "Ruth Beadle; Eleanor Sarah Little; Bo Yao",
          "abstract": "Voice hearing has been linked to an externalising bias, i.e. the tendency to misattribute internally generated experiences to external sources. In signal detection terms, this manifests as a more liberal response criterion (greater willingness to report detecting signals). While cultural factors shape voice-hearing experiences, whether religious affiliation influences this perceptual bias remains unclear. We tested whether dialogic and positive inner speech - patterns relevant to prayer and religious cognition - modulate differences in response criterion between Christians (*N* = 27) and non-religious individuals (*N* = 49). Bayesian mixed-effects models found no main effect of religious group, suggesting Christian affiliation alone does not increase externalising bias. However, dialogic inner speech showed a decisive interaction: among Christians, more frequent dialogic inner speech predicted more liberal responding; consistent with religious frameworks that normalise conversation with a divine presence, rich internal dialogue may be more readily attributed to an external source; no such effect was found among non-religious participants. Positive inner speech showed moderate interactions. Among Christians, more frequent positive inner speech predicted more conservative responding, particularly for negative stimuli. Among non-religious participants, more frequent positive inner speech predicted more conservative responding for positive stimuli but trended towards more liberal responding for negative stimuli, consistent with thematic congruence between inner speech content and stimulus valence shaping source discrimination. These findings suggest externalising bias emerges from interactions between inner speech patterns and cultural framework rather than religious affiliation alone.",

          "abstract": "Digital environments such as video games are central to contemporary life, yet progress in understanding their range of impacts has been hindered by limited data access, skewed funding, imbalanced research agendas, and inadequate coordination between academia, industry, policymakers, and community stakeholders. To address this lack of progress, we conducted a multi-stage modified Delphi study (n = 85 round one; n = 59 round two) followed by an in-person World Café workshop (n = 30) involving experts from most major game studios, international policy bodies, NGOs, research funders, and academia. Across online and in-person stages, participants identified shared priorities for future research and articulated practical steps needed to advance them. Using preferential-rank Single Transferable Vote analysis and reflexive thematic synthesis, we derived four cross-cutting conditions which had general consensus across stakeholders as necessary for coordinated progress: (i) strengthening evidence, (ii) improving communication, (iii) fostering collaboration, and (iv) building literacy. We translate these into a cross-sector roadmap outlining concrete near-, mid-, and long-term actions for researchers, industry, policymakers, funders, and civil society. Although developed in the context of video games, the structural barriers and proposed solutions generalise to behavioural science as a whole. Our findings show that while progress can often be difficult in digital behavioural science, applying the often underutilised Delphi and World Café methods allowed for the creation of both convergent priorities and a concrete path forward that stakeholders across sectors support. We see this as a foundation for building a more cumulative, transparent, and collaborative science of human behaviour in digital environments.",

However, Chiang et al.’s conclusions are based, in part, on a pair of implausibly large effect sizes that were extracted from a randomized controlled trial published in 2010. In this paper, we repeat Chiang et al.’s analyses, but replace the pair of implausibly large effect sizes with much more plausible effect sizes taken from a second journal article that reported results of that 2010 randomized controlled trial.

          "abstract": "Background: Conspiracy beliefs pose a societal challenge, yet the processes through which they emerge remain debated. One pathway to conspiracy beliefs that has received limited attention is the role of emotional responses to relative deprivation (RD). RD — the perception of being unfairly disadvantaged— elicits negative emotions such as anger and disgust, which may in turn foster conspiratorial interpretations. \nMethods: Across eight preregistered studies (N = 3,306), we experimentally induced direct, individual-level RD using a validated unfair-outcome paradigm and assessed anger, disgust, and (exploratorily) anxiety. All studies measured conspiracy mentality and specific conspiracy beliefs. \nResults: We synthesized study-wise effects in a random-effects mini–meta-analysis. Experimentally induced RD reliably increased negative emotional responses (i.e., anger and disgust across all studies. Anger and disgust, but not anxiety were associated with both conspiracy mentality and specific conspiracy beliefs. Mini–meta-analytic mediation analyses showed consistent indirect effects of RD on both conspiracy outcomes through negative emotions. Total effects of RD on conspiracy beliefs, however, were small and inconsistent, underscoring the importance of emotional mechanisms. \nConclusions: The findings indicate that direct experiences of RD can promote conspiracy beliefs through heightened anger and disgust. This work highlights the importance of momentary emotional responses in the emergence of conspiracy beliefs and advances understanding of the affective mechanisms linking RD to conspiratorial thinking.",

          "abstract": "Positive peer interactions are fundamental to children's social and academic development, yet the dynamic behaviors that support these interactions remain poorly understood. Smiling is one of the most frequent and socially functional behaviors, and when children respond to each other's smiles (smile synchrony) it provides a window into their engagement and connectedness. Although previous work has examined smile synchrony in dyadic settings, little is known about how it shapes perception of group activity or how individual backgrounds and relationships contribute to these dynamics. Here we show that smile synchrony serves as a behavioral marker of group interaction quality in children's collaborative activities. We analyzed facial expressions of 187 children in 34 groups during two everyday educational activities: listening to a story and discussing it together. Using automated smile detection and event-based analysis to quantify directional smile synchrony, we found that children with higher and more evenly distributed synchrony perceived more positive group climates, characterized by greater safety, contentment, inclusion, collaboration, and cohesion. Individual and dyadic factors further modulated these dynamics in activity-specific ways. During listening, synchrony increased with gender and national identity similarity and with perceived closeness to the smile emitter. During discussion, synchrony was heightened among extraverted children, those reporting greater group closeness, and friendship pairs. These findings reveal that smile synchrony captures meaningful variation in children's social engagement during real-world group interactions and reflects the interplay of personality, interpersonal relationships, and social identity. Our results suggest that smile synchrony represents an accessible behavioral marker for assessing peer interaction quality in collaborative learning environments.",

          "abstract": "Meat consumption negatively affects planetary health in addition to human health and animal welfare, and choices to eat meat are often driven by motives that are encouraged or muted by contextual factors within the lived environment. Romantic relationships are among the most influential contextual factors, yet little is known about how relationships shape meat eating motives and behavior. We examined between- and within-person actor and partner effects of dietary motives on meat consumption in general and across 28 shared meals (7,203 ratings in total) in 272 romantic partners. We found that the most important motives for higher personal meat consumption were the beliefs that meat tastes good, is necessary for health, and is natural, whereas concerns about ethical impacts for the environment and animals were the most important factors for lower consumption. People ate more meat if their partners viewed meat as necessary and tasty. Only high meat eating partners ate more meat when they or their partners believed it was normal, or their partners believed it was natural, but ate less when their partners were concerned about the environment. They further felt less capable of preparing plant-based meat alternatives during meals in which their partners ate less meat. Only low meat eating partners ate more meat when they felt pressured or when their partner valued health or felt incapable of preparing alternatives. These results demonstrate how interpersonal processes shape sustainability related behaviors that involve conflicting motives and preferences between romantic partners, such as meat consumption. Understanding these processes offers insights for encouraging dietary shifts towards meat reduction.",

          "abstract": "The accumulation of resources by elites has increased global economic inequality, which is linked to deteriorated population health and wellbeing. A primary mechanism explaining this relationship is status anxiety (SA)—a chronic concern about one's socioeconomic status. This article reviews the literature on SA, outlining how it could be a causal chain from perceived EI to negative health and well-being outcomes. We summarize empirical evidence on SA differentiating it from related constructs like status seeking and envy, and explore its antecedents and consequences. Using the economic inequality as normative information model (EINIM) and the competitiveness-based framework, we explain how perceived inequality fosters a competitive climate, enhances materialistic values, and increases SES relevance for self-worth and social esteem. This competitive and materialistic climate becomes threatening when the gap between aspirations and expectations widens, triggering SA and chronic stress. Finally, we suggest future research directions to investigate mediators and moderators of the relationship between EI and SA, advocating for a more unified theoretical framework in this critical area of study.",

          "abstract": "Virtual agents are becoming increasingly common in various areas of daily life. A key area of application is their use as pedagogical agents in educational contexts. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and immersive media technologies have enabled the development of increasingly sophisticated agent-centered learning in immersive media environments (ACLIME), which are attracting expanding attention in academic research and educational practice. Despite this growing interest, the existing body of literature still lacks an integrated analysis of the key factors and their relationships that together define the interaction with pedagogical agents in immersive media environments. To address this gap, the present review conceptualizes and characterizes human-agent interaction in the context of learning in immersive media environments. It proposes a conceptual framework that structures the key technical and psychological factors involved and analyzes their characteristics and relationships. Additionally, it considers the role of temporal dynamics as an important but so far inadequately studied aspect of immersive human-agent interaction. By synthesizing these theoretical insights, the review provides an overview of the potentials and risks associated with agent-centered learning in immersive media environments. Furthermore, it offers a comprehensive foundation for future empirical research and application in the emerging field of immersive learning with pedagogical agents.",

Participants interpreted a series of low-familiar metaphors (e.g., religion is a raft), and generated their own related metaphors (e.g., spirituality is a raft). After this familiarization procedure, participants were presented with familiarized metaphors (e.g., faith is a raft) and non-familiarized metaphors (e.g., highways are snakes) and listed semantic properties associated with both the familiarized and non-familiarized metaphorical concepts (e.g., raft, snakes). The results showed that familiarized metaphorical concepts evoked semantic properties that were more semantically distant and more abstract than those evoked by non-familiarized metaphors or literal sentences. These results demonstrate how metaphorical abstraction results in the growth of novel and abstract semantic connections.",

Free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) in India have been shown to strongly prefer the color yellow over blue and grey (Roy et al. (2025). Animal Cognition, 28(1), 1–9). However, it is not clear if this finding is specific to free-ranging dogs in India or whether it generalizes to other dog populations. We conducted a replication of the Roy et al. study to assess whether pet dogs in the United States show similar preferences by measuring whether they approached yellow, blue, or grey bowls first. We conducted two experiments and found that pet dogs younger than seven years old first approached yellow bowls most often, replicating Roy et al.'s findings. To test if brightness rather than color accounted for this preference, we conducted a third preference experiment with light, medium, and dark grey bowls. The dogs did not prefer the light grey bowl, indicating that there was not an overall preference for brighter colors. Therefore, a preference for the color yellow could be a characteristic of dogs in general. Understanding dog color preferences is important for guiding the design of dog products and environments but also is critical for canine behavioral scientists who must make decisions about colors for experimental stimuli.",

          "authors": "Andrei Preda; Andrei Razvan Costea; Adrian Opre; Răzvan Juchiș",
          "abstract": "Humans often appear to possess knowledge they cannot fully articulate. For instance, in the landmark artificial grammar learning (AGL) task, participants acquire a complex regularity (grammar) that generates letter sequences, while typically claiming to have little or no subjective access to the regularity, thus suggesting that learning has been largely unconscious. A highly influential argument against this conclusion comes from studies showing that participants can identify simple letter pairs (bigrams) that the grammar is composed of, when asked to do so. Consequently, the unconscious status of learning in AGL has remained highly controversial. Crucially, however, these latter studies have never measured participants’ subjective states when performing the bigram identifications but assumed that bigram identification necessarily reveals conscious knowledge. In this paper, we put to test this critical assumption, by employing novel bigram-based artificial grammars and, simultaneously, by measuring participants’ subjective states when operating with bigram knowledge. For generalization, we employed both typical letter stimuli and face stimuli. Participants (N = 188) memorized strings (of faces or letters), constructed from the grammars; subsequently, they classified novel strings (half grammatical, half nongrammatical), reporting subjective awareness trial-by-trial. We found that letter strings were classified above chance based both on unconscious and on conscious knowledge (all ps &lt; .001, Bayes factors &gt; 106), while data were insensitive for the faces condition (Bayes factors between 0.33 and 3, all ps &gt; .05). Our findings demonstrate unconscious learning of bigrams for letter strings, challenging the influential idea that accurate bigram knowledge necessarily reveals conscious knowledge.",

          "abstract": "Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and eating disorders frequently co-occur and share disturbances across the gut-brain axis. Growing evidence suggests that aversive reactivity to physical sensations, particularly gastric discomfort intolerance, may be a key mechanism underlying both conditions. Gastric discomfort intolerance refers to the inability or unwillingness to experience aversive gastric sensations. Despite its theoretical importance, no validated measure of gastric discomfort intolerance exists. This study aims to develop and provide initial validation of the Gastric Discomfort Intolerance Scale (GDIS). Adults (n = 219) completed the GDIS and measures of convergent and discriminant validity. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported a unidimensional 17-item measure with excellent internal consistency (α = 0.93) and acceptable-to-excellent model fit indices (RMSEA = 0.10, 90% CI [0.08, 0.12]; CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96). The GDIS demonstrated convergent validity through significant positive correlations with anxiety sensitivity, depression, anxiety, stress, and some measures of interoception (Trusting). Additionally, discriminant validity was supported by non-significant associations with self-esteem and other measures of interoception (Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening). Participants reporting current eating disorders had significantly higher GDIS scores than those with previous or no eating disorder history (p = 0.02). The GDIS is the first validated measure of gastric discomfort intolerance and shows excellent psychometric properties. This tool may facilitate research of gastric discomfort intolerance in eating disorders, DGBI, and other psychiatric conditions, potentially informing treatment approaches.",

Snakemake allows researchers to use a Python-based markup language to describe how input files are transformed into output files. Snakemake then uses these rules to schedule and execute the computational jobs that are required to generate the output files, without unnecessary recreation of existing output files. This allows the complete processing workflow to be executed with a single command and creates workflows that are interpretable, efficient, and reproducible.",

          "abstract": "People appraise situations in different ways, giving rise to affective responses that can be modified through reappraisal. It is not clear, however, whether effective reappraisal involves tailoring appraisals to situational demands—thereby expanding the number of appraisal profiles—or reusing particularly helpful appraisals across situations, thereby reducing the number of appraisal profiles. To address this question, we examined whether successful reappraisal relates to an expansion or a reduction in appraisal variability. In an online experiment (Sample A, N = 158) and a laboratory replication with facial electromyographic measurement (Sample B, N = 70), participants viewed and reappraised affective pictures and rated their subjective affect and appraisals along the dimensions of relevance, congruence, accountability, certainty, and controllability. We found that appraisal variability decreased during reappraisal, as indicated by a higher Gini index, and that the greater this reduction, the greater the reappraisal success, reflected in increased positive affect and decreased negative affect. Together, these results suggest that successful reappraisal involves a narrowing of appraisal profiles. This challenges the assumption that greater variability is always advantageous and highlights the need to better understand the mechanisms underlying this effect. Moreover, the findings underscore the value of examining discrete appraisal profiles and their variability for better understanding the cognitive mechanisms of reappraisal.",

          "authors": "Matthias Gruber",
          "abstract": "Intelligence research has produced a paradox: the field widely acknowledges that motivation influences cognitive development, yet virtually every major model of intelligence formally excludes it. The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) taxonomy, the dominant psychometric framework, contains no motivational component. Cattell's own investment theory treats motivation as an external condition rather than a constitutive element. Sternberg's triarchic theory incorporates practical intelligence but not the drive to acquire it. This paper argues that this exclusion is not merely an oversight but a systematic blind spot that distorts our understanding of intelligence in three specific ways. First, it mischaracterizes intelligence as a static trait rather than a recursive, self-reinforcing system in which knowledge, cognitive performance, and motivation form a closed amplification loop. Second, it renders invisible the role of operational knowledge—learning strategies, logical tools, and strategic thinking—which functions as the primary multiplier within this loop. Third, it leaves the field unable to explain why current artificial intelligence systems, which possess vast knowledge and computational performance but no intrinsic motivation, fail to exhibit the self-directed development that characterizes human intelligence. This paper proposes a three-component recursive model (Knowledge × Performance × Motivation) and argues that intelligence is best understood not as a capacity but as a learning ability—one whose trajectory is determined by the dynamics of this recursive loop rather than by any single component measured in isolation.",

          "abstract": "The current study investigated whether the generation effect, a memory advantage for self-generated verbal information, is enhanced in multisensory conditions. Such a finding would be consistent with the multisensory facilitation effect, a phenomenon wherein multiple sensory inputs may reduce the cognitive load required to process and respond to co-occurring stimuli from multiple senses. Although extensive research has explored the generation effect, the multisensory aspect of this task has been overlooked. In the current study, we aimed to determine if the generation effect is modulated by the multisensory facilitation effect. Multisensory facilitation involves the brain’s ability to efficiently process information from diverse sensory sources simultaneously, enhancing cognitive performance. We employed a 2 (Task Type: generate, read) X 3 (Sensory Modality: auditory, visual, multisensory) factorial design, utilizing word pair lists and a cued recall test. A generation effect emerged for the auditory and audiovisual condition, but not for the visual condition. The hypothesis that the magnitude of the generation effect would be greater for the multisensory encoding condition was not supported. Overall, the hypothesis that generation effect will be enhanced for multisensory learning was not supported. The current study addresses a gap in existing literature by examining the multisensory component of generation tasks and extends the current understanding of multisensory learning by incorporating verbal stimuli as the visual component.",

But what are the public’s beliefs about human extinction? And how much do people prioritize preventing extinction over other societal issues? Across five empirical studies (N = 2,147; U.S. and China), we find that people consider extinction prevention a societal priority and deserving of greatly increased societal resources. However, despite estimating the likelihood of human extinction to be 5% this century, people believe that the chances would need to be around 30% for it to be the very highest priority (U.S. medians). In line with this, people consider extinction prevention to be only one among several important societal issues. We also find that people’s judgments about the relative importance of extinction prevention appear relatively fixed and hard to change by reason-based interventions.",

          "abstract": "The present study aimed to examine the influence of incidental emotions on risk-taking propensity and investigate its relationship with Emotional Intelligence (EI) abilities. For this purpose, we developed a variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) in which balloons included a face with a specific emotional expression: happiness, fear, or neutral. Thus, although the emotional content was incidental, it was presented concurrently with the task, embedded within the balloon. To assess EI, we employed the MSCEIT, an assessment instrument based on the performance-based ability model of EI. The study consisted of a sample of 120 participants (Mage = 21.52; 80% women). The results revealed a higher risk-taking propensity in conditions displaying happy faces compared to the fear and neutral conditions. Moreover, participants who reported higher levels of EI were less risk prone across all conditions, but this relationship was particularly strong in the fear face condition. These findings confirm the effect of incidental emotions on risk-taking propensity and suggest the role of EI as a potential protective factor for risk engagement. Further research is needed to clarify the influence of EI on incidental emotions in risk contexts. Implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a CIT paradigm based on the attentional blink (AB) phenomenon and to verify its applicability using target detection accuracy as an index. AB refers to the failure to detect the second of two temporally proximate targets. The experimental results demonstrated that participants in the encoding group who had encoded crime-relevant items were more likely to miss the second target when the first target was crime-relevant than when it was irrelevant. In contrast, no such difference was observed for participants in the non-encoding group who had not encoded crime-related items. The result of the ROC analysis showed that the accuracy of discrimination based on AB magnitude was comparable to some of the autonomic indicators used in the current polygraph CIT. These findings provide empirical support for the feasibility of using an attentional blink-based CIT.",

We propose a novel experimental paradigm and Bayesian computational model to examine how confirmatory inference shapes reward learning when outcomes have ambiguous valence. In these cases, interpretation involves integrating prior beliefs with incomplete evidence, reflecting an inductive bias analogous to missing data imputation. We develop and test this theory using a reward learning task in which information about outcome valence (but not magnitude) is sometimes withheld, allowing for subjective interpretation. Our Bayesian model explains the dynamics of behavior and stated beliefs better than alternative reinforcement learning models. Moreover, stated beliefs about the positivity of ambiguous outcomes are correlated with optimism. Together, these findings demonstrate how confirmatory reward learning can emerge from inference under ambiguity, and may be individually linked to broader dispositional traits.",

          "abstract": "Human listeners are remarkably skilled at identifying voices, yet the mental representations that support voice identity processing remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a data-driven approach that reveals core dimensions of the voice identity space. We compiled a large-scale voice corpus including 337 male speakers producing each a unique sentence (VocDat). Using a Sparse Positive Similarity Embedding (SPoSE) model trained on voice similarity judgments from 389 participants, we identified a five-dimensional voice identity space capturing human between-speaker similarity judgments. Regression analyses showed that these model dimensions were characterised by distinct combinations of acoustic voice properties, with pitch, spectral slope, and syllable rate emerging as the most consistent and informative features. These acoustic labels closely aligned with perceptual voice attributes provided by trained phoneticians (e.g. low pitch, old age, fast speech), demonstrating that these dimensions can be interpreted in a perceptually meaningful way. By combining a data-driven modelling approach with a large and acoustically diverse speaker sample, and by characterising voice identity space dimensions in both acoustic and perceptual terms, our findings provide perceptually grounded insights into the structure of voice identity representations.",

          "abstract": "Over the past decades, human reasoning research has identified a variety of effects and processes, of which several have been compiled into comprehensive theories. Based on such theories, cognitive models were developed that made the theoretical findings applicable and testable. However, the models often consist of a variety on sub-processes and effects internally, but are not built in a modular way, hindering the transfer of findings between different models and their comparability.\nWe approach this problem by proposing a different perspective: By treating the generation of cognitive process models as a search problem, process models can be derived from cognitive operations automatically in an objective way. Our method is illustrated on the domain of syllogistic reasoning, where we show that it generates a process model that outperforms state-of-the-art models while preserving their explanatory meaning. Finally, we discuss our approach as a framework for streamlining and facilitating cognitive modeling endeavors.",

This study investigates the motivations for initiating large-team papers and the potential benefits of these projects in psychology. By qualitatively analyzing 500 papers, we find that large-team collaborations are most often instigated to deal with the practical challenges  inherent to complex research questions, but can also be motivated by broader social and or strategic factors. The results from quantitatively analyzing 1,699,513 papers published between 1975 and 2024 indicate that large-team collaborations are more likely to be cited and to appear in higher-ranked journals. Furthermore, their immediate impact on the field, as measured by citation counts within the first 2 years after publication, is on average higher than individually-authored papers. This suggests that contributing to collaborative projects in psychology will likely increase the number of high-rank journal publications to the resume of researchers. Overall, our findings indicate that large-team collaborations can be rewarding for individual researchers both by enabling early scientific impact and by contributing to stronger publication records.",

          "abstract": "Background: The mental well-being benefits and challenges of pet ownership have been explored in many populations, including clinical populations such as individuals with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Critically, there are currently no published studies focusing specifically on pet ownership for individuals with eating disorders. The present work aimed to explore pet ownership experiences of adults experiencing eating disorders.\n\nMethods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 cat- and dog-owning British adults (eight cat owners, six dog owners, three participants with both cats and dogs) with diagnosed or suspected eating disorders. Reflexive thematic analysis was utilized to identify two overarching themes and seven subthemes relating to the role of the human-pet bond in eating disorder symptoms and treatment.\n\nResults: Data-driven themes include recovery experiences, the dual role of pets in eating behaviors, exercise experiences, pets’ influence on cognitions, body image perceptions, and self-identity, as well as pets’ roles in recovery motivations. Furthermore, pets were found to impact treatment experiences, represented by themes that discuss pets as catalysts for change and partners during treatment, while also creating challenges around separation during treatment. \n\nConclusions: The present study found that pets can be largely beneficial for individuals with eating disorders, especially for those in later stages of recovery; however, pets can also create challenges, especially for individuals in earlier stages of recovery. The present work also provides a foundation for future work related to pet ownership for individuals with eating disorders, such as further exploration on incorporating pets into eating disorder treatment, how to utilize the human-pet relationship to support symptom reduction, and how to mitigate challenges posed by pets related to treatment, with the results having key relevance for the development of clinical interventions for this population.",

Digital phenotyping methods allow for passive monitoring of \nbehavioural and physiological biomarkers, offering potential to predict suicidality in real-time \nand in daily life.

It \nassesses the associations and predictive validity of digital biomarkers for suicidality and \nidentifies key research trends, contributors, and themes. PubMed, Web of Science, and \nPsycINFO were searched for empirical studies reporting associations between digital \nbiomarkers and suicidality. The search yielded 1120 records, with 33 records meeting eligibility \ncriteria for inclusion. Most studies feature small, predominantly female, white, clinical, and \nwestern samples, often with mood or anxiety disorders. Sleep and extralinguistic features (e.g., \nspeech disfluency) showed the strongest associations with suicidality.

To conclude, behavioural digital biomarkers such as sleep \ndisturbances and speech patterns capture core clinical features of suicidality and currently show \nthe strongest potential to predict suicidality. Combining passive sensor data with active self\nreports substantially improves predictive accuracy, as passive data alone have not yet \ndemonstrated sufficient validity for suicide prediction.

          "abstract": "Purpose: A growing body of evidence suggests that rhythm abilities play an important role in reading development. However, how rhythm supports reading and how its role changes across acquisition remain to be fully specified. In this study, we tested whether rhythm perception contributes to reading fluency via phonological decoding and/or lexical access, and whether this pathway varies as a function of reading proficiency. \nMethod: Three-hundred and five Portuguese-speaking primary school children (167 girls; age: M = 8.49 ± 1.17 years, range 6.35–11.20) completed measures of rhythm perception, pseudoword reading (phonological decoding), word reading (lexical access), and text reading fluency. Serial mediation and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. \nResults: Rhythm perception was positively associated with all reading measures. The relation between rhythm perception and reading fluency was fully mediated by pseudoword reading, both directly and sequentially through word reading. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that these indirect effects were present only among children with lower reading proficiency and diminished as proficiency increased. No direct effect of rhythm perception on reading fluency remained once phonological skills were accounted for. \nConclusion: Together, these findings suggest that rhythm perception acts as an early functional constraint on reading fluency, supporting reading primarily through phonological decoding during early stages of acquisition. Accordingly, rhythm-based mechanisms scaffold phonological learning rather than sustain proficient reading, highlighting rhythm perception as a developmentally specific contributor and a potential target for early support.",

Both the book and the VSI are largely authored, peer-reviewed, and edited by individuals affiliated with an NGO. A central issue addressed throughout the paper is the rationale for transforming book chapters into articles for a peer-reviewed journal. The motivation, perhaps, can be found in the editors’ own words, expressing their intent to use this “peer-reviewed and published” evidence to influence “policy-makers and practitioners across the world.” It is evident that articles published in peer-reviewed journals carry significantly more weight in shaping public policy than a book released by an NGO. This does not imply that the book or the special issue contain research of poor quality; however, it raises important questions about the transparency and rigor of the peer-review process.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effects of an intervention for improving the knowledge of open science practices among undergraduate psychology students.\n\nMethod: Participants were undergraduate students (n pre-intervention = 95, n post-intervention = 116) taking a course in health psychology. Seminar leaders introduced open science principles and practices in a 20-minute presentation and a week later students delivered a group presentation including critical reflection on the implementation of open science practices within the health psychology literature. The change in scores between before and after the teaching intervention was measured using a questionnaire evaluating students’ open science knowledge and attitudes.\n\nResults: There were baseline differences in most of the open science knowledge and attitude items between students enrolled in a psychology degree program compared to students enrolled in other programs. Following the teaching intervention, students demonstrated improved knowledge about code sharing and user participation. However, study program was better predictor of changes in attitude item scores than the intervention. \n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that a teaching intervention as short as 20 minutes can impact students’ knowledge about and attitude toward open science practices. Moreover, students’ prior knowledge and attitudes had some influence on the results of the intervention. \n\nTeaching Implications: A short introduction to open science practices combined with student activity can enhance students’ knowledge and impact their attitudes towards open science. For the development of teaching materials, students’ pre-existing open science knowledge and attitude should be considered. It is also important to update course materials to accommodate new methods and discussions around open science.",

          "abstract": "In various cultures, across history and at many different spatial scales, humans produce a rich variety of geometric shapes. Recent work has put forward a concrete proposition for a Language of Thought (LoT) underlying the mental representation of geometric shapes in contemporary humans. Initial experiments, based on a comparison of baboon and human performance in an intruder task, suggested that this ability could be unique to humans. Here, to deepen our understanding of the evolutionary origins of geometric representations, we compared humans and baboons (Papio Papio) in a delayed geometric match-to-sample task with a broad array of shapes. Crucially, the presentation speed was manipulated so that, on slow-paced trials, animals were given more time to reflect on the shapes. The shapes were sampled from our proposed LoT and spanned a range of predicted geometric complexity under that model. Although the overall pattern of behavior was still strikingly different in humans and baboons, when presentations were slower, we did find a small contribution of the LoT representations in baboons, although weaker than in humans. In both species, longer looking time increased the effect of the LoT-based predictor. While humans used the ability to self-pace to modulate their looking time, thus benefitting from longer exposure times for more complex shapes and rendering this geometric complexity effect visible, baboons did not.",

          "abstract": "Understanding how individuals form beliefs about their own creativity – referred to as the creative self-concept (CSC) – requires examining the informational sources that shape these self-assessments. In this paper, we introduce and validate the Sources of Creative Self-Concept Scale (SoCSC), a questionnaire adapted from self-efficacy research, designed to assess four theorized sources of CSC: mastery experience, vicarious experience, social persuasion, and physiological and emotional states. A sample of 558 adults completed measures of CSC (both global and trait-like) and the SoCSC. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor model aligned with the proposed sources. All sources were significantly associated with CSC, with social persuasion emerging as the strongest individual predictor. However, structural equation modeling revealed that a general factor – reflecting shared variance across all sources – accounted for the majority of the variance in CSC. This finding suggests a dynamic interplay between personal experiences, observed models, social feedback, and affective responses in shaping creative self-perceptions. The results are discussed in the context of Bandura’s theory of self-efficacy.",

          "abstract": "Perception and action form a feedback loop through which organisms gather information to guide behavior. Yet many theories still treat perception as relatively passive, disconnected from the movements that shape sensory input and from the bodily rhythms that sustain life. We advance a framework that integrates active sensing, the voluntary control of sensing through movement, with interoceptive physiology in an active-inference framework. We propose that cardiac and respiratory cycles rhythmically tune the reliability of sensory evidence and readiness to move, creating recurring windows that favor sampling or action. Accordingly, cardiorespiratory rhythms shape action–perception coupling primarily by biasing when organisms sample information, for how long, and when they initiate action. Organisms can exploit permissive periods of the cardiorespiratory cycle and compensate during suppressive periods by delaying commitment, extending sampling, or adjusting decision criteria. Because respiration is partly under voluntary control, organisms can adjust their breathing to shift or extend these periods, thereby shaping this coupling. We further formalize how interoceptive and exteroceptive streams may interact under limited processing capacity to bias the weighting of sensory evidence and prior expectations, yielding testable predictions in both constrained laboratory designs and self-paced, naturalistic tasks. Treating bodily rhythms as internal control variables may unify accounts of moment-to-moment variability in perception and action, support more ecologically valid experimental designs, and motivate body-based interventions to enhance sensorimotor performance.",

          "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of intentional action is the ability to generalize learned response-effect (R-E) associations to novel situations. However, the mechanisms underlying such category-based generalization, particularly in the context of voluntary action selection, remain contested. Across four free-choice experiments, we systematically investigated this issue. Participants learned associations between keypresses and pictorial effects, where the learning experience was manipulated from a single, repeated exemplar to numerous unique exemplars presented only once. The categories ranged from basic-level (e.g., dogs vs. cars) to abstract superordinate levels (e.g., animals vs. machines). Results consistently demonstrated a significant generalization effect: participants preferentially selected actions congruent with the category of novel test stimuli, even when exemplar-specific learning was minimized. This provides evidence for a direct response-category binding mechanism. However, this group-level effect was consistently driven by a subset of participants exhibiting near-deterministic choice patterns, and the statistical evidence for this effect was substantially weakened after excluding them. These findings suggest that R-E generalization in voluntary action is not a uniform, automatic process but relies on the acquisition and strategic application of explicit, propositional knowledge regarding action-effect contingencies. This highlights the critical role of conscious reasoning in goal-directed behavior, refining current theories of action control.",

Our study addresses this critical gap by assessing statistical learning in the same participants at ages 7, 8, 11, and 14. Utilizing linear mixed models and latent class analyses, we observed a decline in statistical learning with age, and found that higher executive functions were associated with this decline.

Multilevel logistic regression models were used to predict momentary compliance using psychological, contextual, temporal, and prior compliance variables. Compliance was most likely when participants experienced “typical” levels of stress, time pressure, and mood. Participants were more compliant when at home (vs. elsewhere) and when alone (vs. with others). Compliance was also higher on work days (vs. nonwork days).

          "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly diffuses and concerns about job displacement intensify, the psychological mechanisms underlying AI job replacement anxiety remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on Integrated Fear Acquisition Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model, the present research investigates whether AI job replacement anxiety can be elicited through vicarious exposure to narratives emphasizing AI-over-human control, and whether perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of AI moderate this response. Across two studies, we examine AI job replacement anxiety as a response that emerges through vicarious exposure to narratives emphasizing AI agency and human control loss, rather than through direct personal experience of job displacement. Study 1 employed a randomized experiment (N = 314), demonstrating that such exposure increased AI job replacement anxiety. This effect was moderated by perceived usefulness of AI, but not by perceived ease of use, and remained robust after controlling for core self-evaluations. Study 2 (N = 1,189) replicated the association between perceived AI-over-human control and job replacement anxiety in an observational design and provided convergent evidence for the moderating role of perceived usefulness, supporting the external validity of the findings. Together, the results provide the first causal evidence that perceptual and vicarious processes can trigger AI job replacement anxiety. By shifting attention from structural labor-market conditions to how AI agency is perceived and communicated, this work offers a mechanism-based account of when and why AI-related job fears arise.",

          "abstract": "We examined how recent visual working memory (VWM) models for continuous-outcome tasks quantify memory capacity limitations through model parameters, and whether these quantifications conform to the inverse square-root scaling predictions derived from the sample-size model. We simulated response errors under varying memory load using a Poisson neural population coding framework, in which load was manipulated by decreasing neural population size to represent increases in memory set size. We applied multiple models that differed in noise distributions and decision rules. For each model, we compared alternative parameterization schemes, including variants constrained by the sample-size model, that allowed different parameters to vary with load. Across models, the parameter expressing capacity-related change depended systematically on the decoding strategy used in the decision rule. When response errors were generated under a maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, the dispersion parameter σ scaled with decreasing population size. In contrast, under maximum-output, or MAX, decoding, the signal amplitude parameter γ scaled with decreasing population size. These results demonstrate that the apparent locus of capacity limitation in continuous VWM depends systematically on how population-level neural activity is decoded in memory retrieval and provide evidence that the form of decoding used in making decisions is identifiable from the parameter invariance in the VWM model.",

Using structured literature retrieval\nand full-text processing, we apply this approach at scale with the aid of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) used as an annotation support tool, while anchoring all\nclassifications in expert-defined stance categories. As a case study, we analyze 472\narticles engaging with memory-decay theory published between 1958 and 2023. LLM-\nassisted stance classifications show strong agreement with expert judgments using\nonly the article abstracts (Cohen’s κ ≈ .80–.83).

          "abstract": "Background. Smartphones/social media have been hailed as offering educational benefits, but widespread concerns highlight multiple negative effects, including for learning and wellbeing. \nSome countries enforce school phone bans, while others (e.g., England), have guidance  promoting “phone-free environments” but no legal mandate at present. There is limited evidence on the benefits of such policies, including whether they promote safeguarding. Methods. We used Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to investigate the relationship  between mobile phone policies and digital safeguarding incidents in 114 schools in England  (&gt;90,000 pupils). We examined the prevalence and content of policies during the 2023/24 academic year and digital incident reporting.  \nResults. 60 of 114 (52.63%) schools had a mobile phone policy. Policy type and content varied significantly, with inconsistent use of “ban” terminology. Digital safeguarding incidents made up only 4.9% (4183/85,540) of all incidents but varied substantially (&gt;10% in 36/114 schools; &gt;25% in 9), suggesting inconsistent reporting. Schools with policies, regardless of restrictiveness, reported more digital incidents. Schools with restrictive policies were more likely to refer incidents and reported more school-based incidents, although most still occurred outside school. Conclusions. Safeguarding incidents involving smartphones or social media are occurring in schools throughout England. Schools with mobile phone policies were more likely to report digital safeguarding incidents, suggesting an association between policy presence and reporting. Vast variation in policy content and inconsistent “ban” rhetoric undermine the potential for effective safeguarding. These findings underscore the need for standardised definitions of digital risks, and consistent policy approaches.",

Contemporary research shows that a six-category typology is overly simplistic, but no alternatives have reached broad acceptance. This paper takes a data-driven solution to this problem. Using data from the release of Kinbank, a global database of 1,156 kinship terminology, I quantitatively review the global diversity of kinship terminology to derive a more granular typology of kinship terminology. In a two-part analysis, I show that kinship terminology structure is more diverse than is often assumed across three metrics. Firstly, more than six types are needed to represent the global diversity of kinship terminology. Secondly, typological categories are not equally variable. Some categories may contain identically structured terminology. Others may contain languages that only share a single feature. Finally, different subsets of kin (e.g. cousins vs grandparents) show different levels of variability. In the second part of the analysis, I explore the global distribution of the new typological categories, identifying globally and locally recurring structures. My analysis demonstrates how data can carve this semantic domain at its joints to identify observed clusters of diversity.",

          "abstract": "Learning rational numbers poses significant challenges on mathematics education. Recently, it was suggested to facilitate learning rational numbers by introducing them starting with the easiest format (i.e., fractions, decimals, or percentages). However, difficulty may not only be influenced by the format itself but also by other factors which drive difficulty within formats, such as responses types (e.g., multiple-choice vs. open responses) and problem types (e.g., visualization, mere calculations, or word problems). Yet, conclusive evidence on how responses types and problem types drive the difficulty within each of the three different rational number formats is largely missing. To address this gap, we analyzed a large-scale dataset (around 38{,}000 students completing more than 7,000,000 problems) from an intelligent tutoring system. We found large and significant differences in error rates within each rational number format, ranging from about 26\\% for problems including visualizations and up to 77\\% for word problems. We did not observe significant differences between multiple-choice vs. open responses. These findings suggest that problem types, i.e. the way rational numbers are included in mathematical problems, drive the difficulty of rational number formats considerably and more than rational number format itself. Therefore, curriculum design may consider the arrangement of problem types more compared to arrangements based on format. This means starting with problem using visualizations first, before gradually progressing to more difficult problem types such as word problems.",

Longitudinal growth in both forecasted and felt aggressive pleasure over time was positively correlated with corresponding growth in aggressive behavior. Further, the better that aggression felt on one wave, the more aggressive participants were on the next. Suggesting that these effects contribute to broader patterns of aggressive tendencies, dispositionally-aggressive participants forecasted and felt more aggressive pleasure over time. Forecasts of aggressive pleasure were broadly inaccurate, though this inaccuracy had uncertain implications for aggression.

Type S errors are a response to the criticism of testing against a point null of exactly zero in contexts where true zero effects are implausible. Testing against a minimum-effect, while controlling the Type 1 error rate, provides a more coherent and practically useful alternative. Type M errors warn against effect size inflation after selectively reporting significant results, but we argue that statistical indices such as the critical effect size or bias adjusted effect size are preferable approaches. We do believe that Type S and M errors can be valuable in statistics education where the principles of error control are explained, and in the discussion section of studies that fail to follow good research practices. Overall, we argue their use-cases are more limited than is currently recognized, and alternative solutions deserve greater attention.",

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the HiTOP-BR in two German-speaking samples: a non-clinical community sample (N = 1,049) and a clinical sample seeking outpatient psychotherapy (N = 601). Confirmatory factor analyses and exploratory factor analyses with target rotation supported the hypothesized six-factor structure across both samples, although observed cross-loadings suggested scope for item refinement. Scalar measurement invariance was established between the clinical and non-clinical sample. Scale scores showed acceptable to good reliability (ω = .77–.88). Convergent and discriminant validity were examined via correlations with established measures of symptoms, maladaptive personality traits, and impairments in personality functioning. As hypothesized, the HiTOP-BR spectra showed the expected associations with corresponding constructs. HiTOP-BR scales further predicted sickness-related work absence beyond established measures, with incremental validity analyses demonstrating additional explained variance in sick days beyond the Patient Health Questionnaire scales. Overall, the HiTOP-BR represents a reliable and valid screening tool, offering a time-efficient way for dimensional psychopathology assessment. Further cross-cultural replication and normative data are needed to optimize its interpretability and integration into routine assessment procedures.",

          "abstract": "Emotions are central to our political decision-making and behavior. Fear and anger are particu-larly consequential, as fear directs attention to threats and fosters reliance on institutions, where-as anger reduces trust and promotes confrontation. However, it remains unclear if and how polit-ical emotions can be easily prescribed, who is most susceptible and what are the political conse-quences. In a preregistered representative experiment (N = 1,000 U.S. citizens), participants se-lected a salient political issue and reported whether they felt fearful or angry. The treatment group was then informed that most in-party members felt the opposite emotion. Compared to control, treated participants showed greater emotional shifts toward the in-group emotion. Shift-ing from fear to anger increased preference for authoritarian-looking political leaders, demonstrat-ing behavioural relevance. Emotional malleability was greater among individuals higher in alex-ithymia and perceived stress. Our findings show how political emotions are socially malleable with the power to change political choices.",

          "abstract": "Recent debates about psychology’s credibility have renewed attention to validity threats that are often difficult to evaluate from standard research reports. We argue that pilot studies can function as methodological due diligence by improving early decisions about design, measurement, manipulation, sampling, and analysis prior to a main study. We examine four types of validity: construct, internal, external, and statistical-conclusion validity. Across these domains, we show how piloting can help researchers assess whether materials and procedures function as intended, identify potential validity threats, and provide key design parameters for planning and model choice. However, we also caution that piloting can reduce validity when treated as a consequence-free space for undocumented tinkering, or when small, noisy pilots are used to justify overconfident inferences. Drawing on recent methodological debates, we distinguish two problematic uses of piloting: fragile use and opportunistic use. We discuss how hidden selection and analytic flexibility can distort the evidential value of confirmatory tests. We, then, conclude with practical recommendations for transparent pilot reporting. Greater transparency would enable readers to evaluate how pilot evidence shaped the final design of a study and consequently, how to interpret a study’s findings.",

          "abstract": "There are two competing accounts explaining how increased worry about one issue affects people’s worry about unrelated issues. According to one account, it decreases worries about other issues (i.e., a negative cross-effect such as one predicted by the finite pool of worry hypothesis). In the second account, it increases worry (i.e., a positive cross-effects such as one predicted by the generalized affect hypothesis and availability heuristics). We conducted a web-based experiment on representative samples of adults in the Czech Republic and Poland (total N = 7,051). We manipulated worry about one of three societal issues and measured the effect of this manipulation on the degree of worry about 12 unrelated issues. We also examined the underlying mechanism by looking at whether the effect was mediated by affect (a mechanism related to generalized affect) and moderated by issue similarity (a mechanism related to availability heuristics). The study provides strong evidence for a positive but negligible cross-effect of worry on non-target worries (i.e., target worries increase non-target worries) that becomes somewhat larger, yet still small, for some target worries and when examined in each of the two countries separately. Further, there is strong evidence that this effect is mediated by generalized affect (specifically its valence; small effect size) and positively moderated by issue similarity (negligible effect size). These results support both hypothesized mechanisms of positive cross effects, namely that these are driven by generalized affect and availability heuristics. Our result contributes to a better understanding of how increased worry affects worries about other issues.",

In an effort to contribute to a better understanding, we examined the impact of greenwashing training on consumers’ ability to discern greenwashing using an online survey experiment designed to resolve ecological and internal validity issues of past work (N = 518). Additionally, we extended the scope by exploring whether greenwashing training also affects healthwashing detection. Our study revealed that greenwashing training can make consumers more likely to perceive advertisements featuring deceptive environmental claims correctly as greenwashing but can also make them more likely to misperceive advertisements without such claims as greenwashing. Furthermore, it showed that although healthwashing is not the subject of greenwashing training, the triggered skepticism can transfer to healthwashing perceptions, too. Overall, these findings suggest that greenwashing training does not enhance greenwashing detection proficiency but rather promotes excessive suspicion.",

          "abstract": "Bullying is a risk factor for internalising problems in adolescence. However, few studies have examined how distinct bullying experiences are associated with individual symptoms of anxiety and depression. Although prior research suggests that parent-child relationships may buffer the negative impact of bullying on mental health, moderation effects at the symptom-level remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the associations between multiple bullying experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and whether these associations were moderated by parent-child relationship. We used data from adolescents participating in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The total sample included 21,308 adolescents (mean age = 14.42 years, SD = 0.51; 53% girls), with networks estimated using data from 18,671-18,870 participants. Adolescents reported on bullying victimization (including experiences of teasing, exclusion/isolation, physical aggression, and cyberbullying), anxiety and depressive symptoms, and parent-child relationship quality. We estimated a Gaussian Graphical Model to identify associations between bullying experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression. We subsequently examined if associations between bullying and symptoms of anxiety and depression were moderated by parent-child relationship quality using a Moderated Network Model. All bullying experiences, except for physical bullying, were linked to at least one symptom of anxiety and depression. Feeling blue was the symptom most strongly related to bullying. Specific patterns emerged: cyberbullying was linked to feeling tense and suddenly scared; exclusion to fearfulness and hopelessness; and being teased to feeling tense and suddenly scared. One edge linking bullying and symptoms was moderated by parent-child relationship quality: the association between bullying and feeling scared was weaker at higher levels of parent-child relationship quality. These findings highlight symptom-specific associations between bullying experiences and symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescence and suggest that supportive parent-child relationships may influence the strength of these connections.",

          "abstract": "Spatial-numerical associations (SNAs), such as the SNARC effect, demonstrate that numerical magnitude is represented along a left-right continuum. Theories of shared magnitude processing (ATOM) and polarity correspondence suggest that emotional dimensions might be spatialized in a similar way. Across two experiments, we tested whether emotional valence and intensity elicit spatial-emotional associations and whether exposure to emotional stimuli modulates numerical SNAs. In Experiment 1, participants completed a number parity judgment task (NT) and a gender judgment task with emotional faces (FT) that varied in both valence (happy/sad) and intensity (0%, 20%, 80%, 100%). Experiment 2 removed direct valence contrasts by presenting either happy or fearful faces per participant, isolating intensity effects. Across both experiments, the NT revealed a reliable reverse SNARC effect. Crucially, this effect disappeared when the FT preceded the NT, indicating that emotionally salient stimuli disrupted subsequent SNAs. By contrast, emotional intensity produced no consistent spatial mapping in the FT, regardless of valence. These findings challenge the view that emotional magnitude is spatialized like numerical magnitude and instead suggest that emotional stimuli indirectly influence SNAs by taxing attentional or control processes. Emotional salience thus modulates, but does not itself constitute, spatial-magnitude representations.",

Such strategic manipulation by incentivised actors serves to construct “alternative realities” that undermine shared truth and institutional trust. This paper reviews recent evidence on the direct cognitive and behavioural impacts of misinformation, examines the transformative roles of social media and generative artificial intelligence, and considers broader epistemological consequences, including the erosion of truth norms and implications for democratic discourse. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated individual and systemic interventions that integrate psychological, technological, educational, and regulatory approaches to strengthen epistemic resilience and safeguard evidence-informed public reasoning and decision-making.",

However, empirical evidence on the role of sound in educational video games remains limited, particularly in narrative-driven educational adventure games such as digital history games.\n\nMethods: In a laboratory experiment, university students (N = 111) either played an educational history video game with sound (ambient audio, character voices, and narrated codex entries providing additional historical information) or without sound. Post-test measures assessed factual knowledge, triggered and maintained situational interest, and academic emotions (enjoyment and boredom). Engagement with optional supplemental historical information provided through in-game codex entries was measured using behavioural log data. Group differences were analysed using one-way analyses of covariance, controlling for relevant pre-test variables.\n\nResults: Participants in the sound condition did not score significantly higher on the knowledge test than those in the no-sound condition. Likewise, no statistically significant differences emerged in situational interest, enjoyment, boredom, or codex engagement between conditions. Additional analyses indicated that participants’ interactions with codex entries positively predicted knowledge test performance, indicating that voluntary engagement with supplemental content contributed to learning.\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the presence of sound alone may not enhance academic outcomes in a narrative-driven educational video game. Additionally, our findings indicate that learning outcomes depended strongly on learners’ engagement with in-game codex entries. Overall, our results on the inclusion of sound highlight the importance of examining specific design features within educational history video games.",

          "abstract": "Importance: Despite 2 million adolescents (aged 12-17) in the United States having a substance use disorder (SUD), little is known regarding where they seek behavioral healthcare (e.g., mental health treatment, substance use treatment, or both). Adolescents have higher rates of co-occurring major depressive episodes (MDEs) than adults with SUDs, which may increase their use of mental health services. Understanding where adolescents with SUDs enter behavioral treatment is crucial to ensure adequate workforce preparedness to care for them where they seek help.\nObjective: To determine where adolescents with SUDs, with or without co-occurring MDE, present to behavioral health treatment. \nDesign: This was a secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional nationally representative survey.\nSetting: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health for adolescents (2022-2023). Data were analyzed between October 2025 and December 2025.\nParticipants: A sample of 24,541 adolescents between the ages of 12-17 from the United States of America. \nExposures: Treatment setting, SUD diagnosis, past year substance use, MDE diagnosis, adolescent age, biological sex, race and ethnicity, insurance status, household income, and study year. \nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Behavioral health treatment setting (i.e., mental health treatment, substance use treatment, both, or none) among adolescents with a SUD. \nResults: Adolescents with a SUD were significantly more likely to engage in mental health (34.7% [95% CI: 30.9-38.8%]) than SU treatment (18.6% [95% CI: 15.8-21.8%], F1,50=62.2, p&lt;.001). Similarly, adolescents with co-occurring SUD and MDE were significantly more likely to engage in mental health (70.7% [95% CI: 65.6-75.3%]) than SU treatment (21.2% [95% CI: 17.5-25.5%], F1,50=43.7, p&lt;.001). Minoritized adolescents with a SUD (aPR = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.71-0.94], p = .007) were less likely, while female respondents with a SUD (aPR = 1.22 [95% CI: 1.07-1.40], p=.006) were more likely to receive any treatment. \nConclusions and Relevance: This study found that adolescents with a SUD were twice as likely, and adolescents with co-occurring SUD and MDE over three times more likely, to engage in mental health compared to substance use treatment. Clinically, these results suggest mental health treatment may serve as a critically important touchpoint to treat adolescents with SUDs.",

In a three-wave longitudinal study, 469 diverse undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution repeatedly forecasted how pleasant they expected aggression to feel, perpetrated an aggressive act, and then reported how pleasant it felt. Longitudinal growth in both forecasted and felt aggressive pleasure over time was positively correlated with corresponding growth in aggressive behavior. Further, the better that aggression felt on one wave, the more aggressive participants were on the next. Suggesting that these effects contribute to broader patterns of aggressive tendencies, dispositionally-aggressive participants forecasted and felt more aggressive pleasure over time. Forecasts of aggressive pleasure were broadly inaccurate, though this inaccuracy had uncertain implications for aggression. These results highlight the complex ways that forecasted and felt positive affect reinforce aggression over time.",

          "abstract": "Evolutionary theory and historical evidence suggest humans possess distinct psychological tendencies for defensive and offensive violence, which have insufficiently been considered in research. In a large-scale pre-registered study across 58 countries (N = 18,128), we demonstrate that violent extremist intentions manifest along two distinct psychological phenomena: defensive extremism, motivated by protecting one’s group from (perceived) threats, and offensive extremism, driven by establishing group dominance. We show that these dimensions can (a) be reliably differentiated across diverse cultural contexts, (b) are distinctively associated with psychological dispositions, and (c) systematically differentiate countries varying in macro-level sociopolitical functioning and violence. Across nations, a two-factorial structure was observed that was invariant at the scalar level. Defensive extremist intentions were consistently higher than offensive extremism in 56 out of 58 countries, suggesting greater moral acceptance of protective violence. While psychopathy was positively related to both types of violent extremist intentions, those high in Machiavellianism and narcissism demonstrated particularly higher levels of defensive extremist intentions. By contrast, those scoring high on religious fundamentalism and social dominance orientation demonstrated particularly higher levels of offensive extremist intentions. Unexpectedly, liberal political group identification was associated with higher offensive but lower defensive extremist intentions. Crucially, offensive (but not defensive) intentions were associated with macro-level societal function, including political terror and internal conflict. These findings establish that defensive and offensive violent extremist intentions represent two conceptually different forms of extremism across a large and diverse range of countries, with consequences for research and practice.",

Principal component analysis revealed two factors: Affective Well-Being (AWB; emotions, vitality, arousal) and Relational Well-Being (RWB; community, self-worth, belonging). Across analytical approaches, RWB consistently predicted more positive impressions of others with superior predictive power, whereas AWB showed weak to null effects. The pattern of results replicated using validated affective versus relational subscales from the Comprehensive Inventory of Thriving. Despite the correlational design, our consistent findings highlight RWB as a key predictor of person perception, suggesting the classic “feel good, judge favourably” effect may reflect stable relational schemas shaping perceptions of others.",

          "abstract": "Meditation has long been studied for its ability to enhance mental, social and emotional well-being and reshape brain networks. Meditation studies have largely focused on neural and cognitive correlates, overlooking the impact on fundamental biological scales. Here, we bring in an integrated perspective that meditation is not only a mental training but also a phenomenon that can optimize the physiological and molecular processes that entrain the brain-body systems toward metabolic, genomic and epigenomic coherence. \nWe first synthesize current evidence linking meditative practice to changes in brain network dynamics, metabolic changes and epigenetic alterations. Emerging findings reveal that meditation modulates stress induced markers, cerebral metabolic changes, hormonal rhythms and transcriptional alterations in the genes involved in cellular pathways, suggesting a coordinated cellular recalibration. Parallel evidence indicates that regular contemplative routines may stabilize circadian oscillations of cortisol and melatonin. At the molecular level, meditation-associated epigenetic signatures, including alterations in DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and noncoding RNAs, also point towards the role of biological processes in practice-induced enduring traits.\nWe propose an integrative multiscale model in which meditation operates as a holistic intervention, synchronizing neural activity with peripheral, molecular rhythms to promote adaptive homeostasis. Finally, we outline methodological pathways for future work, advocating for multimodal designs that unite neuroimaging, metabolomics, chronobiology, and epigenomic profiling. Understanding meditation through this multi-scale lens can transform it from a behavioral phenomenon into a biologically grounded framework for brain-body synchronization, offering new insights for preventive and translational neuroscience.",

Here, we scrutinized the findings and conclusions by Andrés-Sánchez et al. by estimating “ranges of spuriousness” of effects that can be expected due to correlations between variables. Necessity effects reported by Andrés-Sánchez et al. did not fall above these ranges of spuriousness, meaning that their findings may have been spurious and their conclusions may be challenged. It is important for researchers to be aware that necessity effects in NCA do not prove necessity in order not to overinterpret findings. We recommend researchers to estimate ranges of spuriousness and to require that necessity effects are above this range before claiming that X is necessary for Y. Otherwise, the necessity effect can, as in the present case, be fully accounted for by the correlation between X and Y.",

          "abstract": "Love and gratitude are key to human flourishing but have been predominantly studied in WEIRD populations, limiting our understanding of these emotions. Here, we explored the culturally shared and distinct aspects of love and gratitude. We asked European American (N = 99), Chinese (N = 100), and Chilean (N = 97) participants to recall four situations that elicited love and gratitude. Content analysis revealed shared themes, such as Romantic Affection for love and Appreciation and Graciousness for gratitude, but also cultural variations. For both emotions, European Americans (a more independent group) mentioned more self-oriented experiences like pride, while the two more interdependent groups, Chinese and Chileans, highlighted social connections. Notably, the two interdependent groups diverged. Chinese participants emphasized tangible reciprocity, respect for authority and mixed emotional experiences, while Chilean participants valued open expression of intimacy. These data contribute to a growing body of research on cultural variations between interdependent groups.",

          "abstract": "Sensory differences and discomfort are significant on-campus barriers for many autistic postsecondary students, but we know relatively little about what makes sensory environments accessible or inaccessible for autistic students.  In this study, 19 autistic university students in Australia responded to experience sampling questions several times a day for two weeks.  Quantitative sensory comfort ratings were significantly poorer when participants reported states of greater anxiety, irritability or emotional reactivity, and exhaustion.  Participants also reported more quantitative sensory discomfort when open-ended answers described feeling tired/exhausted, anxious, or stressed/overwhelmed, rather than feeling relaxed/good. However, our study cannot resolve whether sensory discomfort causes experiences such as anxiety and exhaustion, whether those states exacerbate sensory discomfort, or both.  Qualitative-quantitative triangulation also suggested that participants experienced less sensory comfort: in open-access spaces (notably, on campus, travelling, and shopping) compared to closed-access spaces (notably, at home); to high-intensity (e.g., loud) than low-intensity (e.g., quiet) or non-notable stimulation; to most sounds over visual, feel, and taste stimuli; to people-related sounds than touch sensations; and to crowds over environments with fewer people. These findings suggest sensory environments systematically shape many autistic people’s everyday experiences and thus that we should modify these environments to be more accessible and inclusive.",

          "abstract": "The Dark Triad/Tetrad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism) is commonly argued to be a set of distinct but related traits. However, researchers have argued that these traits may reflect a single underlying factor. In the present study, we evaluated whether a triad or a tetrad structure could be recreated from a comprehensive, reliable, and non-redundant personality item pool. Using the 100 Nuances of Personality (100NP), we adopted a bottom-up approach that combined expert-derived trait definitions, layperson item-interpretability ratings, multi-times and multi-rater data, and a conservative psychometric selection criterion for the selection of items. Across multiple structural analyses, we were unable to recover separate factors corresponding to narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, or sadism. Instead, retained items consistently converged on a broad single factor, which we refer to as Antagonism Core (AC). The resulting 15-item AC scale demonstrates high test–retest reliability (r = 0.90), self–other agreement (r = 0.54), and convergent validity with established Dark Triad measures (Short Dark Triad and Dirty Dozen; 0.79 and 0.83, respectively) as well as the Honesty-Humility domain of the HEXACO (-0.77). These findings provide little empirical support for a distinct triad/tetrad structure, and instead suggest that antagonism is the primary construct assessed by “Dark” personality measures.",

          "abstract": "Despite the widely recognized impact of social norms on prosocial behavior, little is known about how local norm information modulates the socio-affective traits and states that drive charitable giving. Here, across two experiments, we assessed how information about local norms alters the influences of self-interest and self-blame on decisions to donate time and effort to raise money for real charities. In Study 1 (N = 210), revealing that previous participants overwhelmingly chose anonymous over public donations reversed the positive effect of approval-driven compassion on the overall likelihood of donating. In Study 2 (N = 240), experimentally induced guilt arising from poor performance in an unrelated social task increased the likelihood of subsequent charitable giving; however, learning that one’s performance fell below the local norm eliminated this prosocial effect, consistent with the dominant emotion shifting from guilt to shame. Together, the findings illustrate how local social norms can dynamically reframe the motivational and affective processes that drive charitable behavior.",

          "abstract": "Personality characteristics are early indicators of later cognitive functioning, but existing studies primarily focused on trait-level trends. How well these between-person differences translate to risk-mitigating interventions remains unclear. Addressing this entails examining within-person differences that explain how states may accumulate over time to influence longer-term outcomes. The present study answers this by investigating associations between personality traits and states and momentary cognitive function and variability. We conducted a three-week ecological momentary assessment study of middle and older adults (N = 183). We used Bayesian Mixed-Effect Location Scale Models to capture contingencies between personality and momentary cognitive functioning and variability. We additionally explored machine learning via (elastic net regression) profiles of personality state-cognition contingencies to identify who experiences stronger associations. At the trait-level, higher conscientiousness was associated with poorer working memory and processing speed. Higher openness was associated with better cognitive functioning and lower variability for episodic memory and processing speed. At the state-level, conscientiousness was better for working memory performance, while neuroticism was associated with variable episodic memory functioning. Extraversion was associated with working and episodic memory functioning and variability. Finally, sociodemographic, health, and personality trait variables emerged as top predictors of individual differences in within-person associations. By investigating within-person associations between personality and cognitive ability, we demonstrate that trait-level associations do not necessarily generalize to state-level ones. Profiles of top predictors of individual differences in state-level associations may be promising targets for intervention, but interventions should be tailored with between- and within-person differences in mind.",

Recent work has shown that adolescents with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) do not fully resolve this competition, likely due to a deficiency in inhibition among words (lateral inhibition). It is not yet clear how this develops. Three experiments investigated the development of lateral inhibition using a variant of the Visual World Paradigm. Experiment 1 compared adults (N=35), older children (11-12) (N=43), and younger children (7-9) (N=45). In line with previous works, adults demonstrated robust inhibition, evidence from the two child groups were inconclusive. Experiment 2 tested 222 younger children to achieve greater statistical sensitivity and found a small but significant effect. Experiment 3 asked if these weaker effects were due to the younger listeners’ failure to activate competitors, or if competitors were active but simply not inhibiting the target. It found robust competitor activation even in younger children, suggesting the weaker effects may derive from true inhibition differences.",

          "abstract": "Social stereotypes are traditionally understood as direct associations between groups and traits. Here, we show people also systematically link social groups to concepts across nonsocial domains, such as women to wine and harps, men to beer and drums. These seemingly nonsocial objects form a hidden architecture of stereotypes, which we bring into view. By asking participants, ``If X were a Y, what Y would it be?\", we mapped 100 social groups across eight semantic domains such as beverages, musical instruments, and color, and found that these cross-domain mappings closely mirrored the perceived warmth and competence of social groups. By further randomly assigning participants to reason through counter-stereotypical cross-domain mappings using the prompt “If X were a Y, it would be y,” we shifted their subsequent justifications toward portraying the target groups as more competent and warmer than they otherwise would have. Analogical reasoning that emphasizes structural similarity was more effective at changing evaluations than associative reasoning based on contextual or surface-level similarity. Our findings suggest that stereotypical traits can be emergent properties of rich associative networks, and that manipulating which everyday objects people link to social groups-even seemingly irrelevant ones-can change how people make sense of social groups.",

          "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) has been central to cognitive neuroscience research for over two decades, yet understanding of its contribution to decision-making remains incomplete. This review synthesizes recent evidence demonstrating that the DMN directly supports subjective valuation and value-based decision-making. Anatomically and functionally, core DMN regions—including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex—overlap extensively with the brain’s valuation system, suggesting that they may perform shared computational roles. Further, emerging research has identified distinct subregions within the posterior cingulate cortex that support different aspects of internal simulation, memory retrieval, and evaluative processing. Beyond localized activation, the DMN dynamically interacts with reward-related regions (such as the ventral striatum), memory systems (such as the hippocampus), and frontoparietal control networks during value-guided decisions, especially in social contexts. These network interactions flexibly shift with motivational demands and individual differences, providing new insights into how subjective value emerges across diverse situations. Disruptions in these network dynamics have been documented throughout development and in psychiatric conditions, including depression and schizophrenia, revealing mechanisms that underpin maladaptive decision making. Collectively, these findings position the DMN not as a passive or task-negative system, but rather as an integrative hub essential for constructing internal valuations and guiding goal-directed behavior.",

Evidence from educational neuroscience points toward the importance of foundational skills—attentional control, working memory, and oral language—while recognising individual strengths and developmental stage. These findings have implications for the identification of SEND needs, the interventions to support students with SEND in schools and teacher training needs. Evidence from educational neuroscience is still evolving and we outline research priorities related to early holistic assessment and identification of children’s needs, mechanism linked interventions, and longitudinal studies to determine for whom approaches work and why.",

In Study 2, we conducted a five-week long visual art intervention experiment to examine potential changes in primals based on psychoeducational priming for certain methods of engaging with the art (i.e., focusing on art technique, social connections, or perspective taking). Although the experimental conditions did not differentially change primals, Good world belief increased and Hierarchical decreased. Further, key individual differences (i.e., openness to experience, aesthetic appreciation) predicted who was more likely to exhibit changes in primals following an art intervention. These studies provide initial evidence of the relevance of the arts in the study of primal world beliefs and provide suggestions for future work on this topic, including practical ways for changing primal world beliefs via arts engagement.",

          "abstract": "Whenever bilinguals produce language, both languages are activated and compete to some degree. Language control is the process used to minimize this cross-language interference and facilitate the selection of words in the appropriate language. While ample research has investigated language control, the overwhelming majority of studies focus on single word production with little attention to language control during sentence production. The distinction between single word and sentence production is an important one, as the few studies that compared these two conditions have observed language control differences. With this study, we investigated this issue by relying on an index of language control that has not been used to investigate differences/similarities in language control during single word and sentence production, namely the blocked language order effect. The results revealed a robust blocked language order effect reflecting sustained language control following second language use. Importantly, the effect did not differ as a function of the linguistic content of second language use (i.e., single word vs sentence production), suggesting mainly similarities in proactive language control processes across levels of linguistic complexity.",

          "abstract": "As key players in the internationalization of the counseling profession, international student therapists (ISTs) possess valuable strengths given their cross-cultural experiences. While an expanding body of literature underscores the importance of meeting ISTs’ training needs, the current emphasis leans heavily on their challenges while overshadowing the valuable potentials and strengths ISTs can offer to the field. Exclusive focus on challenges may perpetuate a deficit-based perspective, whereas excessive focus on strengths may run the risk of undermining the practical challenges ISTs often face in training. To bridge this gap, we introduce a dialectical framework rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy, naïve dialectism, to reconceptualize the deficit-based perspective on ISTs’ challenges. This framework emphasizes strengths as transferrable outcomes that arise from one’s challenges with effective training. Building on this dialectical framework, we propose a theoretical model to highlight the dynamic interplay between the challenges and potentials often encountered by ISTs as they navigate cross-cultural experiences as bicultural individuals in the U.S. This model captures the essence of how these challenges may serve as potentials and strengths in their professional development. Training recommendations for programs, supervisors, and trainees are discussed. We encourage the field to recognize ISTs not only as learners but as valuable contributors whose unique experiences and insights enrich the counseling profession.",

However, empirical evidence on the role of sound in educational video games remains limited, particularly in narrative-driven educational adventure games such as digital history games.\n\nMethods: In a laboratory experiment, university students (N = 111) either played an educational history video game with sound (ambient audio, character voices, and narrated codex entries providing additional historical information) or without sound. Post-test measures assessed factual knowledge, triggered and maintained situational interest, and academic emotions (enjoyment and boredom). Engagement with optional supplemental historical information provided through in-game codex entries was measured using behavioural log data. Group differences were analysed using one-way analyses of covariance, controlling for relevant pre-test variables.\n\nResults: Participants in the sound condition did not score significantly higher on the knowledge test than those in the no-sound condition. Likewise, no statistically significant differences emerged in situational interest, enjoyment, boredom, or codex engagement between conditions. Additional analyses indicated that participants’ interactions with codex entries positively predicted knowledge test performance, indicating that voluntary engagement with supplemental content contributed to learning.\n\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that the presence of sound alone may not enhance academic outcomes in a narrative-driven educational video game. Additionally, our findings indicate that learning outcomes depended strongly on learners’ engagement with in-game codex entries. Overall, our results on the inclusion of sound highlight the importance of examining specific design features within educational history video games.",

Previous reviews and meta-analyses have primarily examined the role of SE within specific treatment methods and/or disorders, often viewing SE as just one aspect of broader cognitive mechanisms. Moreover, the existing evidence is based solely on studies in adult samples.\nThis systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date overview on both specific (SSE) and general self-efficacy (GSE) as outcomes, predictors, or mediators of CBT for ADs, including data from both adult and child/adolescent samples. We identified N=104 studies with a total of 9707 participants. These studies employed a wide range of CBT interventions, including exposure therapy, cognitive restructuring (CR), systematic desensitization, and mindfulness-based approaches.\nKey findings indicate that CBT significantly enhances both GSE and SSE, particularly when exposure or CR are key components. Pre-and post-treatment levels of SE, as well as CBT-induced increases in SE, predicted or mediated treatment outcomes regardless of AD diagnoses. However, evidence linking SE gains to outcomes is weaker in studies with children/adolescents, interventions targeting general or subclinical anxiety, trauma-focused samples, and remote interventions especially when GSE measures were used.\nTo conclude, while the evidence supports SE as both a treatment outcome and a mechanism of change in CBT, we identified various boundary conditions that significantly impact existing associations. Promising results from experimental studies suggest that interventions designed to bolster SE could be a valuable addition to enhance the efficacy of standard CBT protocols.",

Much of this work was inspired by Pavlov’s work in which it was first documented that trace conditioning can broaden generalization, a finding that we have replicated in human participants. We then describe studies in which we have assessed whether the affective valence of stimuli and outcomes can affect generalization, and we find that indeed human participants can generalize across the valence of stimuli and this can interact with different outcomes. Finally, we review a study in which we assessed whether changes in a response-produced safety signal can influence avoidance and conclude that it does. We also observed that this generalizes and this depends on the similarity between trained and tested safety signals (i.e., outcomes). Overall, we conclude that generalization is a much more complex phenomenon than previously thoughts, and that more research is needed to understand this phenomenon and make it amenable to current theorising.",

          "authors": "Gonzalo Pablo Urcelay; José A. Alcalá",
          "abstract": "Uncertainty refers to the state in which the probability of an outcome following an event is unknown. Substantial progress has been made in terms of understanding how uncertainty modulates learning and decision making, however the effect of outcome uncertainty on the generalization of prior knowledge to novel situations has not been clearly documented. In two predictive learning experiments, participants experienced cue-outcome trials in which the probability that an outcome would follow a Gabor grating (vertical or horizontal) was deterministic (100%) or probabilistic (50% or 25%). Participants learned that one Gabor orientation predicted the outcome whereas the other did not. Following training, participants provided expectancy ratings of the outcome to the trained and to novel gratings at different orientations (generalization test). Experiment 1 documented that participants displayed more generalization to novel gratings when training was probabilistic. Experiment 2 replicated these results and further showed broader generalization when participants were trained with deterministic outcomes and then switched to probabilistic in the last training block, a manipulation that increased experienced prediction error and hence surprise. These results suggest that outcome uncertainty broadens generalization gradients, and this is mediated by unsigned prediction errors.",

          "abstract": "Domain-general object recognition ability (o) is an individual’s capacity to tell apart\nsimilar objects. O has been measured using tasks that make strong demands on either\nperception or memory. These types of test correlate with one another, suggesting that they\nboth require precise encoding of high-level visual details. However, the assumption that tests of\neach type differentially measure perception and memory has not been tested, nor has the\ntheoretically critical assumption that tests of each type tap into the same high-level visual ability\nwhen other relevant abilities are controlled. A large online sample completed a battery of\nperceptual and memory type object recognition tests alongside tests of low-level perception,\nmemory, and general intelligence. We specified preregistered structural equation models.\nResults indicated that perception and memory o tests form two separable factors, each tapping\ninto concurrently measured perceptual and memory abilities respectively. However, also in line\nwith our predictions, these two factors were very strongly correlated, and remained so when\ngeneral intelligence, and perceptual and memory abilities were regressed out. We argue that\nthe remaining covariance between the two factors is attributable to o. While our results suggest\nthat general intelligence explains a very substantial share of the ability to make high-level visual\ndiscriminations, they also suggest that it does not explain all of this ability. The results also have\nimplications for interpretation of prior research that distinguishes face perception and face\nmemory.",

          "abstract": "Many people worldwide want to be less neurotic, and targeted interventions can elicit these desired changes. However, many prior interventions relied on a heterogenous mix of strategies––often chosen ad hoc or derived from varied theoretical perspectives––leaving the change mechanisms of neuroticism and of effective interventions unclear. To guide theory development and inform intervention design, we first detailed a multidimensional theoretical personality framework that can support future intervention research. Second, we systematically reviewed literature on nonclinical interventions for neuroticism and related constructs (k = 99 articles). We used the multidimensional framework to code information from studies, provide an overview of this literature, and identify limitations. Third, using the coded information, we developed a theoretically informed taxonomy of 19 intervention strategies for neuroticism-related constructs. The Taxonomy of Neuroticism Strategies (TONS) organizes intervention components focal to theorized personality change processes, serves as an interactive tool for intervention design, and offers a systematic framework to test change mechanisms. Fourth, we used three personality change theories to conceptually validate the taxonomy. Overall, by integrating prior empirical and theoretical research, we hope for TONS to offer a common language to guide future study designs and systematically test the mechanisms and consequences of intentional neuroticism change.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive control is assumed to be a fundamental component of successful emotion regulation, yet it remains largely unclear whether individual differences in specific facets of cognitive control predict the frequency and effectiveness of specific emotion regulation strategies in daily life. This study investigated how two facets of cognitive control, i.e. discarding irrelevant negative information from working memory, and controlling interference from negative stimuli, relate to reappraisal, rumination, and suppression in daily life. We examined these associations in female participants with borderline personality disorder (BPD; n = 52), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 55), and healthy controls (HC; n = 55). All individuals participated in four experimental paradigms, and a 7-day experience sampling protocol measuring the frequency and effectiveness of reappraisal, rumination, and suppression in daily life. In line with previous studies, results of the experimental tasks showed heightened interference from negative stimuli and slower discarding of irrelevant negative information in individuals with BPD compared to healthy controls. Evidence for impairments in MDD was less clear. Notably, cognitive control measures provided negligible value for predicting daily life emotion regulation after accounting for diagnostic group. The frequency and effectiveness of reappraisal, rumination, and suppression were determined primarily by diagnostic group rather than cognitive control. This highlights limits of cognitive control measures regarding their ecological relevance and raises questions for interventions targeting cognitive control to enhance emotion regulation.",

          "abstract": "An emerging hypothesis proposes that overlap between task representations aids learning transfer but\ninvokes greater control demands during task-switching. A parallel line of research shows that we flexibly\ninfer what is relevant to a task, and thus what forms the task representations, by observing what events\nco-occur in time and space. Thus, varying how much two tasks are interleaved, which affects whether we\ncan rely on temporal context to differentiate them, could alter their representations and, in turn, how we\ngeneralise or switch between them. Over two experiments (N=100 each), we tested whether contextual\nclarity during training impacts both learning transfer (Experiment One) and task-switching (Experiment\nTwo). Participants searched through grids of squares to find hidden targets. Grids were bordered by one of\ntwo coloured cues; each colour signalled the relevance of a different set of target squares. Thus, participants\nlearned two task-sets, each signalled by a different task cue (colour) and associated with a unique set of\ncontingencies. Participants then trained on the task without explicit colour cues. The task set\npseudorandomly switched over trials at one of two rates, to modify contextual clarity across groups. The\nStable group experienced rare switches (5%), whereas the Variable group experienced more frequent\nswitches (30%). At test, explicit colour cues were reintroduced. Rare switching impaired transfer learning\non a novel task that combined the trained tasks, but not on a novel task that replicated a single trained\ntask (Experiment One). However, the training regimen did not impact task-switching performance at test,\nwhere the switch rate increased to 50% (Experiment Two). These findings show that contextual clarity can\ndissociate task representations at the expense of learning transfer, and constrains theories regarding the\ntransfer/task-switching trade-off.",

A total of 193 students from 36 primary school classrooms in the Netherlands (60% boys; Mage T1 = 12.16 years) were followed as they transitioned into 37 secondary school classrooms. Their level of victimization before and after the transition was determined using self-reported questionnaires and peer nominations. We further determined whether any of their primary school classmates transitioned to the same classroom in secondary school, and if so, whether these co-transitioning peers were friends in primary school, as determined by peer nominations. Multilevel analyses revealed that self-reported victimization was likely to continue if students co-transitioned to the secondary school classroom without peers, but not if they co-transitioned with peers, regardless of the friendship relation with them. In contrast, peer-reported victimization tended to be stable across all groups. However, it was more stable among students with co-transitioning non-friends than among those with a co-transitioning friend or without co-transitioning peers. Practical implications are discussed.",

While policy debates focus on bot farms, a distinct threat to democracy is emerging via partisan coordination apps and artificial intelligence–what we term “cyborg propaganda.” This architecture combines large numbers of verified humans with adaptive algorithmic automation, enabling a closed-loop system. AI tools monitor online sentiment to optimize directives and generate personalized content for users to post online. Cyborg propaganda thereby exploits a critical legal shield: by relying on verified citizens to ratify and disseminate messages, these campaigns operate in a regulatory gray zone, evading liability frameworks designed for automated botnets. We explore the collective action paradox of this technology: does it democratize power by ‘unionizing’ influence (pooling the reach of dispersed citizens to overcome the algorithmic invisibility of isolated voices), or does it reduce citizens to ‘cognitive proxies’ of a central directive? We argue that cyborg propaganda fundamentally alters the digital public square, shifting political discourse from a democratic contest of individual ideas to a battle of algorithmic campaigns. We outline a research agenda to distinguish organic from coordinated information diffusion and propose governance frameworks to address the regulatory challenges of AI-assisted collective expression.",

          "abstract": "This article investigates how cognitive and grammatical mechanisms shape variable singular-plural agreement in Spanish perception-verb constructions, a domain where speakers alternate between agreement with the postverbal NP2 and agreement with the infinitival complement. Building on usage-based and cognitive linguistics approaches, the study examines whether factors related to perceptual modality and conceptual salience underlie these alternations. A corpus analysis of pronominal infinitive constructions with ver and oír reveals divergent patterns across modalities, with visual perception favoring plural agreement and auditory perception favoring singular agreement. To evaluate whether these tendencies reflect deeper linguistic preferences, an acceptability-rating task systematically manipulated modality, agreement, and animacy. The results show no overall interaction between modality and agreement, but they identify a robust effect of animacy: sentences with human referents received higher ratings than those with inanimate referents. Moreover, animacy modulated the influence of modality and agreement in opposite directions, suggesting that speakers’ evaluations are sensitive to the ontological nature of the perceived stimulus. Together, the findings show that agreement variation reflects flexible conceptual construal, and that corpus and experimental evidence offer complementary insights into the interface between morphosyntax, perception and salience in Spanish.",

          "abstract": "This work is concerned with the study of the long-term behavior of associative values of conditioned stimuli undergoing a discrimination training, as predicted by models of associative learning. The analysis applies to Rescorla and Wagner model (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972), Pearce’s model (Pearce, 1994), the Replaced Elements Model (Wagner, 2003), the Inhibited Elements Model (Thorwart &amp; Lachnit, 2020), and the Context-Dependent Added Elements Model (George, 2020). The main tools used are a kernel machine approach proposed by Ghirlanda (2015, 2018), and a theorem by Aguirre (2026) regarding asymptotic behavior of periodic linear difference equations. These tools will help provide a method to find asymptotic associative values predicted by models, aid in the study of structural constrains of models that may limit their predictions, and allow to study the role that may be played by parameters of the training. As a result of the theory developed, it is proven that the Replaced Elements Model, the Inhibited Elements Model, and the Context-Dependent Added Elements Model, will always predict that, with enough training, any possible discrimination training will be solved.",

However, EMA questionnaires are rarely psychometrically evaluated, potentially compromising data quality. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a German item set assessing psychological chronic pain processes for use in EMA, focusing on variability and reliability. \nMethods. First, the item set was piloted with three people suffering from chronic pain to gather feedback on participant burden and the usability of the data. Second, an evaluation was conducted with a sample of n = 68 individuals with lived experience of chronic pain who completed an EMA protocol with six assessments per day over twelve days (4,236 datapoints). Third, revised parts of the item set were preliminarily evaluated in n = 10 people suffering from chronic pain over a 21-day EMA period with six assessments per day (1,253 datapoints). Variability was examined primarily using within-person standard deviations and response distributions. Reliability was assessed according to current recommendations for single-item measures (test-retest reliability), two-item scales (Spearman-Brown coefficient), and multi-item scales (McDonald’s Omega).\nResults. Most items and process scales met the predefined criteria for variability and reliability. However, variance was largely attributable to between-person differences. Four out of thirteen scales demonstrated insufficient reliability.\nConclusions. This study presents the first psychometrically evaluated German EMA item set capturing a broad range of clinically relevant pain processes. While the findings are promising, further refinement of several scales and additional psychometric evaluation are warranted.",

          "abstract": "Elderly people and patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) immensely rely on arithmetic skills to lead an independent life. Activities such as medication management, financial transactions or using public transport require intact abilities to manipulate numbers with different arithmetic operations. However, research on cognitive deficits in PD has been focussing on domain-general functions such as executive functions, attention or working memory so far – largely neglecting potential domain-specific aspects of numerical cognition (e.g., carry or problem size effect). These aspects should be addressed, as PD-immanent deterioration of domain-specific numerical areas and domain-general functions suggests mechanisms of both primary and secondary (mediated by other cognitive deficits) arithmetic deficits, respectively. The current study systematically investigated arithmetic performance and effects in PD patients differing in cognitive impairment for the first time, targeting domain-specific cognitive representations of arithmetic as well as the influence of domain-general factors. Besides healthy controls (HC), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) were compared in arithmetic performance in the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The deficits consisted of problems in two-digit addition and subtraction and PD-MCI, as well as delayed arithmetic fact retrieval for single-digit multiplication and division in PD-NC and PD-MCI. Deficits were not domain-specific, as arithmetic effects (problem size, carry, and borrow effects) did not differ between the groups. Discriminant analyses showed that performance in addition, multiplication and division tasks could differentiate between PD-NC and PD-MCI. The study results help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of arithmetic deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.",

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) has become increasingly feasible with technological advances, enabling the capture of dynamic fluctuations in symptoms and processes. EMA is ecologically valid and can reduce recall biases. However, there is a lack of thoroughly validated items. This study seeks to validate a set of items to assess key psychological processes in chronic pain in EMA.  \nMethods. The “Prozesse Chronischer Schmerzen ErfaSSen” (ProCEss; engl. „Assessing Chronic Pain Processes”) item set was developed for an EMA coverage model, i.e. a broad range of the day shall be captured instead of single momentary experiences. In multiple studies, practitioners (n = 18 + n = 12) and affected persons (n = 12 + n = 12) contributed to establishing content validity through an adapted Discriminant Content Validity Method and cognitive interviews. Findings from these studies informed the development of written and audio-visual comprehension aids, designed and evaluated in a healthy sample (n = 128) to replace extensive participant instruction procedures.\nResults. Across studies, both affected persons and practitioners rated the items positively with regard to content validity and clinical utility. Feedback of affected persons contributed to item refinement, and the item set was reduced from 29 to 25 items. The evaluation of the comprehension aids supported the comprehensibility of the item set.\nConclusions. The ProCEss item set is among the first validated instruments for assessing chronic pain processes using EMA in German. The current study supports its content validity.

Using validated scales alongside novel stress and coping inventories, we found that 7% of participants reported extreme stress, with self-imposed pressure, constant availability, and social relationships emerging as dominant stressors. While better social integration predicted higher well-being, it did not buffer the effects of stress. Conversely, self-selected coping strategies (e.g., gardening, yoga) significantly mitigated the impacts of stress (p &lt; 0.001).

          "abstract": "Early adolescence is a critical time marked by dynamic changes in physiology, appearance and social environment. These changes are also reflected in how adolescents perceive themselves, in-cluding their bodies. The transition from pre-pubertal through pubertal stages allows us to con-sider the development of the self from the perspective of how body perception, both from within and from the outside, changes. While research in adults and post-puberty adolescents suggests that lower interoceptive accuracy is associated with greater body image concerns, how these fac-tors interact during puberty remains unknown. We tested a sample of 181 girls (aged 10-14 years), spanning from pre-puberty to post-puberty, on measures of interoceptive accuracy and behavioural and self-report measures of body image. Lower interoceptive accuracy predicted greater body image dissatisfaction. Moreover, this relationship was moderated by puberty stage, showing that the protective effect of higher interoceptive accuracy against body image dissatis-faction was stronger during more advanced stages of puberty. Our findings show that interocep-tive influences extend from the basic multisensory integration to conscious attitudes about our body during a critical developmental period, highlighting the positive role that better interocep-tion can play in mental health.",

          "abstract": "The perspectives on the genuine basis of self and self-consciousness are diverse. Against the background of two exemplary theories, a concept is presented which modifies otherwise contrasting models and merges essential features of consciousness into a modified concept. This includes the brain’s comparative representation of sensations originating in the subject’s body versus those originating in the environment. It will be substantiated why, in contrast to alternative proposals, specifically the comparison of these two sources of information is considered both, essential and sufficient, for self-consciousness to emerge. The modified model further includes a gradual and overlapping progression of sensory and cognitive abilities in phylogeny and ontogeny, contrasting with categorization of distinct and discrete stages of consciousness, as proposed in the literature.",

          "abstract": "Recent findings have shown the influential role of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the \nmaintenance of items in Working Memory (WM). Specifically, it has been proposed that individual \nitems are represented within gamma oscillations that are nested within slower theta waves. Thus, \nlonger theta cycles would theoretically allow the retention of more items. On the basis of this theory, \nthe present preregistered study aimed to test whether slowing theta rhythms via 4 Hz transcranial \nalternating current stimulation (tACS) over the frontoparietal network improves WM capacity. Given \nthe potential role of individual differences in stimulation effects, participants were divided into high \nand low WM capacity groups based on initial screening. Additionally, task difficult was also \nmanipulated to maximize the likelihood of obtaining an improvement in performance. Contrary to \nour hypothesis, tACS did not improve behavioral outcomes regardless of task difficulty or baseline \nWM capacity. Post-stimulation EEG effects were also analyzed, but no modulation of theta power, \npeaks, or phase synchronization was found. Importantly, differences in mean theta frequency were \nobserved before any stimulation between high- and low-capacity WM participants, with higher \nfrequencies present in participants with better WM performance. Furthermore, higher mean \nfrequency was also observed in high-load trials versus low-load trials. These findings contradict the \npredictions of the theta-gamma coupling theory. Taken together, these results raise questions about \nthe validity of the theta-gamma coupling theory to explain cortical dynamics related to WM.",

However, translating complex ideas about psychological dynamics into formal models can be challenging without the right tools. In this tutorial, we introduce a approaches using R and the ctsem package to help researchers build and understand dynamic systems models that capture some of the complexity of psychological processes. We emphasize iterative model-building through simulations, model fitting, and visualizations of the model-implied dynamics alongside their fit to data. We begin with familiar linear models in lme4 and gradually transition to ctsem, which allows us to incorporate complexities such as state-dependent change, random fluctuation distinct from measurement error, covariate effects, interactions, and external inputs. These modelling concepts are illustrated using a running example of affect dynamics in couples therapy, demonstrating how key conceptual and methodological ideas in dynamic systems modelling come together. Our aim is to provide a general framework for understanding dynamic systems modelling and to encourage further exploration of theory-driven statistical approaches in psychological research.",

Scholz et al. (2018) demonstrated that LAN could enhance memory performance not only through eye movements but also via covert attention shifts. Across 2 experiments, the aim of our study was to investigate whether this is also the case for retrieval from working memory. Participants encoded three word-pairs at three distinct locations. At retrieval, participants' memory for one word pair was assessed using auditory cues related to the target pair in both an immediate retrieval test (Experiment 1 and 2) or a delayed test (Experiment 2). We manipulated either the location of gaze (Experiment 1 and 2) or of covert attention (Experiment 1) during retrieval by introducing a digit tracking task at one of three locations: congruent (where the tested word pair was originally presented), incongruent (a different location), or central. We found evidence against any difference in memory performance between the cue conditions. Attending the location at which memory information has been perceived appears to not lead to a benefit in memory performance for either working or long-term memory in an associative recognition task with word pairs.",

We share their call to move beyond MI as a gatekeeper and to focus on the substantive relevance of non-invariance. However, we question whether correlating country-level scale scores with external indices separates construct-relevant factors from method biases. In a simulation calibrated to their empirical setting, we show that scalar non-invariance (threshold/intercept shift) (a) attenuates and destabilizes country-level correlations, (b) inflates correlations when bias aligns with the construct, and (c) suppresses associations when bias opposes it. We also outline a causal perspective on MI that treats non-invariance as theoretically informative and motivates explicit models of its causes. Using this causal view, we argue that adjusting for demographic covariates at the composite score level does not remedy item-level non-invariance.",

          "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) prompts participants to report on various variables such as their current emotions, cognitions, or behaviors multiple times per day across several days, enabling the collection of rich, high-frequency data. However, the high frequency of measurements can burden participants, potentially leading to non-compliance or inattentive responding that compromises data quality. To minimize these effects, it is crucial to understand how EMA design factors influence inattentive responding and, consequently, the quality of the collected data. This study contributes to this aim by investigating how response format, as a more subtle design choice, affects inattentive responding in EMA.  We re-analyzed data from two experimental EMA studies, in which surveys were administered either in a Likert-type or a visual analogue scale (VAS) format in between-subjects designs. Each dataset was analyzed with one of two state-of-the-art confirmatory mixture modeling approaches to examine whether response format is associated with differences in (a) the overall level of inattentive responding and (b) its associations with two fatigue- and attention-related contextual factors: the cumulative number of EMA study days and time of day. Across datasets and analytical approaches, we found indications that Likert scales yield up to 3 percentage points higher rates of inattentive responding than VASs, though the temporal patterns varied across studies. In Study I, differences were observed in overall inattentiveness levels, with parallel increases across EMA days. In Study II, initial inattentiveness was comparable between formats, but the Likert format showed a steeper increase over time. Implications for EMA design are discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study explored perceptual sensitivity to spectral and temporal acoustic features in music recognition among BaYaka hunter-gatherer children. Using an interactive, non-competitive game (Move to Match), we tested song recognition under various forms of audio degradation to identify which musical dimensions are crucial for recognizing familiar songs. BaYaka children demonstrated robust recognition of songs across unaltered, spectrally degraded, and temporally degraded versions, highlighting sensitivity to multiple acoustic dimensions. We suggest that songs may be recognized despite degradations because of spectral contour processing, rather than pitch and rhythm cues alone. Moreover, recognition performance decreased for duration-degraded songs (“plinks”), as the brevity constrains the cues available to listeners. However, song identification of (spectrally degraded) plinks far exceeded chance levels and outperformed Western adults performing similar tasks. This suggests that onset-transients and spectral shape, contributing to timbre perception, might serve as reliable markers for identifying musical sounds. We discuss the possibility that music cognition evolved for reasons beyond social bonding to support identification of personal contributions within musical exchanges through timbre, which may hold importance in cooperative contexts. As one of the first experimental studies of music perception in hunter-gatherers, this work demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted methods for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are pervasive in everyday life and pose well-documented public health risks, yet little is known about how lay perceptions of EDC risks are structured and how they vary across exposure routes and regulatory contexts. Drawing on the psychometric paradigm of risk perception, we conducted a large cross-national survey (N = 1,966) in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Participants evaluated 18 EDC-related activities across nine canonical risk attributes, ranked perceived health risks by exposure route (consumption, inhalation, dermal contact), and reported perceived severity, susceptibility, general exposure, institutional trust, and sociodemographic characteristics. Across all three countries, risk perceptions exhibited a robust two-dimensional structure corresponding to affective-dread and cognitive-controllability dimensions. However, the relative salience of these dimensions varied systematically: cognitive-controllability cues accounted for more variance in Denmark, whereas affective-dread cues were more prominent in the UK and US. Perceived risk also varied consistently by exposure route, with consumption judged the most risky, followed by inhalation and dermal contact, a hierarchy that showed minimal cross-country variation. At the individual level, greater knowledge of EDCs consistently predicted higher perceived severity, while gender, age, income, parenthood, and institutional trust showed context- and outcome-specific associations. By extending the psychometric paradigm to chronic, diffuse chemical hazards embedded in everyday activities, this study demonstrates that EDC risk perceptions reflect stable affective-cognitive dimensions while remaining sensitive to exposure routes and governance contexts, offering theoretically grounded insights for risk communication and policy design.",

Proficiency in motor skills is crucial for maintaining autonomy and enhancing quality of life in older adults. Nonetheless, recent findings indicate that alterations in sleep patterns due to aging may greatly hinder the consolidation of motor memory, thus speeding up the decline of motor abilities. In this context, motor learning is modulated/affected not just by internal neural processes but also by the quality and organization of sleep, especially the preservation of slow-wave and REM sleep. Interruptions in these sleep stages seem to hinder the neurological changes required for enduring enhancements in motor skills. This synthesis emphasizes the importance of recognizing the relationship among sleep, aging, and sensorimotor plasticity, while suggesting effective intervention strategies like improving sleep or specific therapies to alleviate age-related motor deficits. These findings originate from a pre-registered systematic review of 21 research articles extracted from 740 sources indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We investigated these effects on motor learning and whether these effects vary by task type, complexity, sleep effect, and age.

This study investigates attention during passive social media use using detailed behavioural log data collected from a simulated,\nInstagram-like platform. More precisely, we recorded fine-grained measures of dwell time, navigation, and engagement. Analysing over 42,000 image-viewing episodes across more than 1,000 browsing sessions, we show that attention in feed environments is fleeting, with most posts viewed for less than a second and only a small minority receiving sustained attention. Variability in dwell time was primarily attributable to individual differences rather than to systematic content features, contextual factors, or social reinforcement cues. Attention declined over the course of browsing sessions, with longer dwell times occurring during deliberate exploration or overt interaction. These findings suggest that everyday social media use consists largely of momentary micro-exposures rather than sustained message processing. By documenting the temporal constraints under which attention unfolds during scrolling, this study provides descriptive foundations for more realistic theories of exposure and media effects and illustrates the value of simulated platforms for high-resolution analyses of attention in digital environments.",

Exploration is recognised as a key cognitive process supporting adolescent development and wellbeing but how real-world exploration relates to emotional adjustment during major life transitions remains unclear. To address this question, we tracked adolescents entering high school and university (N=64) over the first three months of transition using continuous smartphone geolocation and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). \n\nWe quantified daily exploration as the dispersion of time in a day across locations (“roaming entropy”) and the number of newly visited locations (“novelty”) and assessed in-the-moment affect, autonomy and new social connections using EMA. On days when individuals visited more novel locations than usual, they reported higher positive affect, lower negative affect and more new social connections. Novelty was a stronger predictor of these outcomes than roaming entropy. Associations between exploration and positive affect were more pronounced in university students than in high school students, consistent with greater autonomy during this transition. Greater anxiety and depressive symptoms were not associated with lower exploration, but attenuated the positive associations between novelty, affect and perceived autonomy. \n\nThese findings link theories and laboratory studies of adolescent exploration and mental health to naturalistic behaviour, showing that engagement with novel environments during major transitions is linked to positive emotional and social experiences. Importantly, these associations were weaker when depression and anxiety symptoms were greater. Real-world exploration may therefore represent a behavioural pathway supporting adjustment as young people navigate environmental change.",

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been widely recognized as a significant risk factor, yet few studies have deciphered the key components of early adversity exposure that lead to addiction outcomes.  \nObjective: This study aimed to compare the predictive utility of the type of adversity (adversity classification model) and the dose-response effect of exposure (the cumulative risk model) for drug addiction, and to examine the mediating role of alexithymia in the relationship between childhood adversity and drug addiction symptoms. Participants and Setting: Participants were 461 male drug addiction offenders recruited from a detoxification center in a southwestern province of China.\nMethods: Participants completed self-report measures assessing childhood adversity, alexithymia, and drug addiction symptoms. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted under both the adversity classification and cumulative risk models. Model fit was compared using likelihood ratio tests. A path mediation model was constructed to assess the mediating role of alexithymia. Results: Compared to the cumulative risk model, the adversity classification model better predicts drug addiction. Specifically, emotional neglect and parental incarceration were significantly related to drug addiction. Regarding the role of alexithymia, difficulties in emotion recognition and description partially mediated the effects of emotional neglect on unconscious drug cravings and automatic behaviors. In contrast, parental incarceration showed a direct association with automatic behaviors, but this effect was not mediated by alexithymia. \nConclusions: Types of childhood adversity explain the psychological mechanisms of drug addiction more effectively than the cumulative adversity exposure. In particular, emotional neglect contributes to addiction through difficulties in emotion processing, highlighting the importance of early emotional development in prevention and intervention efforts.",

Participants received either anodal stimulation, which increases the excitability of neurons, or sham stimulation, and subsequently rated metaphorical (e.g., Passion is a storm), literal (e.g., A gorilla is an ape), or nonsensical (e.g., Depression is a party) sentences on comprehensibility. Participants who received anodal stimulation rated metaphors to be less comprehensible than participants who received sham stimulation. No effects were observed for literal or nonsensical sentences. In addition, word-level semantic characteristics affected metaphor comprehensibility ratings but not literal or nonsensical sentences. We interpret our findings to demonstrate that the LIFG plays a causal role in metaphor comprehension, and that excitatory stimulation overworks semantic control processes, leading to selection and inhibition impairments during comprehension.",

In Study 1, data from 500 participants from a research company were analyzed. In Study 2, data from 600 participants from a research company were analyzed. The results showed that a higher distribution of web surveys was associated with a higher response rate, and the importance of the factors of refusal and discontinuation varied across groups.

          "abstract": "Diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) statements have become a popular additional evaluative criterion for academic hiring and promotion, but little to no empirical research has been conducted to assess how university faculty evaluate these statements. The present set of experiments sought to fill this void. Across seven studies (ntotal=4,953), tenured/tenure-track university faculty rated DEI statements that did not discuss race/ethnicity and gender diversity actions or efforts (i.e., statements that lacked equalitarian content) significantly lower than those that did. Specifically, faculty perceived these “alternative” statements to be weaker DEI statements, and perceived the applicants who submitted these statements to be less competent, less hireable, and less likable. Furthermore, faculty were less likely to recommend–often by a large margin–that the applicants behind these “alternative” statements pass an initial screening and be advanced for further review. Evaluative penalties were most severe toward DEI statements focusing only on viewpoint diversity actions and efforts (Studies 1-4), but also manifested for statements focusing only on rural diversity (Study 6), or only on socioeconomic diversity (Study 7). Findings for disability diversity (Study 5) were mixed. These studies provide novel insight on how DEI statements are perceived and evaluated by university faculty.",

          "abstract": "Social stereotypes are traditionally understood as direct associations between groups and traits. Here, we show people also systematically link social groups to concepts across nonsocial domains, such as women to wine and harps, men to beer and drums. These seemingly nonsocial objects form a hidden architecture of stereotypes, which we bring into view. By asking participants, ``If X were a Y, what Y would it be?\", we mapped 100 social groups across eight semantic domains such as beverages, musical instruments, and color, and found that these cross-domain mappings closely mirrored the perceived warmth and competence of social groups. By further randomly assigning participants to reason through counter-stereotypical cross-domain mappings using the prompt “If X were a Y, it would be y,” we shifted their subsequent justifications toward portraying the target groups as more competent and warmer than they otherwise would have. Analogical reasoning that emphasizes structural similarity was more effective at changing evaluations than associative reasoning based on contextual or surface-level similarity. Our findings suggest that stereotypical traits can be emergent properties of rich associative networks, and that manipulating which everyday objects people link to social groups-even seemingly irrelevant ones-can change how people make sense of social groups.",

          "abstract": "Linguistic prediction, which emerges from experience, is a pervasive process in language comprehension. However, how prediction develops as learning unfolds and how it drives the learning process remains unclear. This study examines three key questions: (1) whether learning is associated with growth in prediction, (2) whether stronger prediction errors are associated with greater learning, and (3) whether linguistic prediction skills are stable across tasks. Our results revealed that learners who successfully updated their verb biases showed greater growth in anticipatory looking patterns upon hearing the verb in ambiguous test sentences. Greater prediction errors operationalized by the mismatch between learners’ initial verb bias and the subsequent training predicted greater learning. Finally, individuals who predicted more in a separate comprehension task showed greater changes in anticipatory looking behavior and ambiguity resolution in the verb bias learning task. Taken together, these results provide empirical support for a prediction-based language learning framework.",

          "abstract": "Anxiety, the anticipatory unease about a potential negative outcome, is a\ncommon and beneficial human emotion. However, there is still much that is not\nknown, such as how anxiety relates to our body and how it manifests in\nlanguage. This is especially pertinent given the increasing impact of\nanxiety-related disorders. In this work, we introduce WorryLex, the first\nlarge-scale repository of descriptive, population-level, norms of word--anxiety\nand phrase--anxiety associations. It includes entries for over 44,450 English\nwords and 10,000 multiword expressions (MWEs). We show that the anxiety\nassociations are highly reliable. We use WorryLex to study a wide variety of\nresearch questions, including: the relationship between anxiety and other\nemotion constructs, the rate at which children acquire anxiety words, the\nextent to which the anxiety association of MWEs is compositional, and *when* we\nare anxious. We show that from ages 1 to 4 children learn more calmness words\nthan anxiety words, and that trend is reversed age 5 onward. We show that our\nlevels of anxiety on social media exhibit systematic patterns of rise and fall\nduring the day -- highest at 8am and lowest around noon. Anxiety is lowest on\nweekends and highest mid-week. We show that anxiety is highest in past tense\nsentences and lowest in future tense; and that there is more anxiety in\nsentences with 3rd person pronouns (he, they) posts than 1st and 2nd person\npronouns. Finally, we show that using WorryLex alone, one can accurately track\nthe change of anxiety in streams of text.

          "authors": "Lukas Wallrich",
          "abstract": "Research into team diversity is flourishing, yet often inconclusive. While diversity measures need to reflect the construct under investigation, this often goes wrong for continuous variables such as age or tenure diversity. Reviewing 95 papers that report relationships between age/tenure diversity and team performance, we find a fundamental mismatch: while most hypotheses appear to be concerned with diversity as variety (maximized with many different groups), most measures reflect separation (maximized with two polarized groups). The most widely used measures—the coefficient of variation and standard deviation—reflect separation, while existing variety measures require discretizing the continuous variable, losing distance information. Here, we propose a measure that captures variety on a continuous variable using all available information: the Coverage &amp; Evenness Index (CEI). Compared to established measures, we show that it produces an intuitive ordering of teams and increases statistical power, as shown through a simulation. By adopting the CEI, diversity researchers can reduce false negatives, improve comparability across studies, and generate findings that more faithfully test their hypotheses. We provide R code for calculating the CEI in the divMetrics package.",

          "authors": "Achiel Fenneman; Alan Sanfey; Sarah Malamut",
          "abstract": "We can guide our decisions in novel situations by drawing on our past experiences (episodic memories). While at times we can retrieve relevant episodes via cued recall, other situations may require a process of memory search. But what mechanisms underlie this search? In this work we synthesize six key principles concerning the storage and retrieval of episodic memories, and build on these principles to propose a cognitive mechanism which allows for the retrieval of relevant past experiences through a process of cascading recall. In this process, observing a stimulus triggers the cued recall of a past event.  If this memory does not provide sufficient information to warrant a decision, then it next reinstates all the memory’s constituent features. These features then form the inputs to sample an additional memory in a subsequent recall step, which in turn reinstates its own features and so forth. This process continues until a suitable past experience is retrieved. We provide empirical support for key predictions of this cascading process through three online experiments in which participants interacted with unfamiliar stimuli. The results indicate that participants rely on cued recall of similar past experiences (experiment 1), and on indirectly related experiences when cued recall is not informative (experiment 2). Additionally, participants were substantially more likely to retrieve a predicted memory, and did so faster, when relying on cued recall versus cascading memory search (experiment 3). We conclude by discussing how this cascading recall process bridges several influential models of memory-based decision-making, as well as offering promising directions for future research.",

          "abstract": "Romantic chemistry is a widely referenced yet poorly assessed construct in psychology research. We aimed to develop and psychometrically validate the Romantic Chemistry (RoCh) scale, a measure designed to assess the perceived reciprocal connection between current or potential romantic partners—a construct that may have implications for relationship maintenance and overall well-being. Across four studies with single and partnered individuals and romantic couples, we used a hybrid bottom-up and theory-guided approach grounded in the Interpersonal Chemistry Model to generate, refine, and validate scale items. In Studies 1a (n = 200) and 1b (n = 201), lay definitions and theory-driven content informed an initial item pool. Study 2 (n = 1,094) applied exploratory factor analysis and item response theory to refine the scale and examine its dimensional structure. Study 3 (n = 1,113) confirmed a multidimensional structure comprising five components—compatibility, comfortability, unique connection, positive interaction, and sexual attraction—and demonstrated strong internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, incremental validity beyond related constructs, and measurement invariance across relationship status, gender, and sexual orientation. Short-form versions of the RoCh scale had good psychometric properties. Study 4 evaluated the scale among married couples (n = 134 couples), establishing dyadic measurement invariance and convergence between partners’ reports. Romantic chemistry emerged as a shared, couple-level construct associated with relationship outcomes, such as commitment and sexual frequency. Findings support the RoCh scale as a reliable and valid measure of romantic chemistry, a construct whose role in fostering high-quality relationships warrants further investigation.",

          "abstract": "The existence of a conceptual link between numbers and space is a fundamental question in numerical cognition and has been highly debated in recent years. Although Spatial-Numerical Associations (SNAs) have traditionally been investigated using bimanual response settings, recent studies have moved towards unimanual paradigms to avoid potential measurement artifacts. For instance, an influential line of research adopted a modified Implicit Association Test (IAT) in which numbers and arrows were presented sequentially. However, SNAs consistently emerged only when spatial and magnitude codes were explicitly contrasted, questioning the idea that numbers are inherently represented in a spatial format. To further investigate this issue, we designed a modified flanker task in which spatial and numerical stimuli were presented simultaneously. When arrows were task irrelevant (Experiment 1), no significant SNA emerged. By contrast, when participants judged arrow direction and numerical magnitude conjunctively (Experiment 2), the paradigm revealed extremely large SNAs compared to existing literature. Overall, our results provide no evidence for a purely conceptual spatial–numerical link, suggesting that robust SNAs require explicit spatial codes combined with semantic number processing. Finally, the large effect size of group-level SNAs, together with remarkable mixed-model-derived psychometric properties, indicates the modified flanker task as an ideal paradigm for studying individual differences and effect modulations. We suggest that this paradigm has the potential to further advance the research on SNAs by overcoming limitations of previous bimanual and unimanual paradigms and, consequently, by helping to disambiguate mixed results in the literature.",

We investigate whether practice-based instruction improves programming skills relative to traditional lectures and which features of practice make it effective. In this preregistered experiment (N = 250), we compared three approaches for an introductory programming lesson: watching a video, code tracing visualizations, and writing code with immediate, AI-generated feedback. Participants who engaged in practice-based instruction performed significantly better than those who watched the video on a novel code-generation test, with the highest performance among learners who practiced writing code. Practice-based instruction also resulted in reduced distraction and increased interest. Whereas video and code tracing conditions led to overconfidence about programming abilities, code writing led to underconfident self-assessments. These findings suggest that active practice, particularly generative practice with feedback, supports learning with advantages in cognitive processing, metacognition, and interest in programming.",

Recipients gave substantially higher ratings to a scene when they saw it via the viewing pattern of the donor who liked (vs. disliked) the scene.  In subsequent experiments, we replicated this effect, and found that attention patterns which drive greater liking allow better prediction of upcoming visual information.

          "abstract": "Beat perception—the ability to extract a regular pulse from rhythmic sequences—is a foundational component of human musicality and a key mechanism supporting synchronization, dance, and collective music-making. Research across neuroscience, developmental psychology, and comparative cognition demonstrates that beat processing exhibits four defining characteristics: it is near-universal across human cultures, emerges spontaneously in early development, engages domain-specific predictive timing mechanisms, and appears largely species-specific. Neurophysiological evidence indicates that newborns, and even late-gestation fetuses, respond to rhythmic regularities using predictive neural processes that cannot be explained by simple interval timing or statistical learning alone. Across infancy and childhood, these early predispositions are progressively refined through auditory experience, motor development, and musical enculturation, ultimately supporting the flexible, hierarchical beat-based timing seen in adults. Comparative studies reveal that while non-human primates and other species can detect isochrony or local temporal violations, they typically fail to induce a beat, highlighting a dissociation between evolutionarily conserved timing abilities and the specialized predictive mechanisms characteristic of humans. Together, findings from phylogeny and ontogeny suggest that beat perception reflects an early-emerging, biologically prepared capacity that is further shaped by experience. Understanding its developmental and evolutionary bases offers crucial insight into the origins of human musicality and the neural architecture supporting temporal prediction.",

While new pedagogical approaches and AI-driven learning technologies are rapidly deployed, the empirical paradigm of classroom-based research remains slow, fragmented, and ethically constrained, often generating evidence only after large-scale implementation has occurred. Here, we argue that education requires a paradigmatic shift toward agent-based educational science: a research framework in which educational theories are formalized as interacting agents and environments, enabling in silico experimentation on developmental processes that are otherwise slow, risky, or infeasible to test empirically. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence make such a shift practically achievable for the first time. As a concrete instantiation of this paradigm, we introduce Student Development Agents—computational agents designed to generate longitudinal developmental trajectories under counterfactual educational environments. Rather than replacing empirical research, agent-based educational science reconfigures its role, enabling predictive, ethical, and cumulative theory building in the science of learning.",

          "abstract": "Autistic pupils in mainstream secondary schools face significant barriers to academic progress, social engagement, and mental wellbeing, with parents consistently reporting that their children's autism-related needs are not being met. This qualitative comparative case study examined what shapes the educational experiences of autistic pupils in secondary schools with Specialist Resource Centres (SRCs) versus comparable mainstream settings without specialist provision. Using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems framework, the study explored how multiple layers of influence – ranging from classroom practices to societal attitudes – interact to support or undermine inclusion.\nData were collected across seven secondary schools (five SRC schools, two mainstream schools without SRCs) in South-East England via interviews with pupils, parents, and staff. Findings revealed that SRCs functioned as protective microsystems, providing predictable environments, visible support, and trusted relationships that buffered pupils from sensory and social demands. Key protective features included consistent staffing, flexible policies, and normalised support-seeking. However, systemic challenges – including workforce shortages, inadequate mental health services, and resource limitations – constrained the impact of even the most effective school initiatives. The study underscores that effective inclusion requires coordinated support spanning immediate school environments to broader policy frameworks, with implications for admission criteria, staff training, and inter-agency collaboration.",

          "title": "Aesthetic Emotions and the Drive for Knowledge",
          "authors": "Joerg Fingerhut",
          "abstract": "In this paper, I address how the arts contribute to knowledge and understanding by defending an Affective Aesthetic Cognitivism (AAC). AAC is an empirically informed theory model, concerning the role of affect and emotions in sustaining the transformative, cognitive impact of the arts.  The relation of our art engagement to our drive for knowledge might at times seem rather indirect. We do not mainly engage with art for educational purposes but rather for pleasure (e.g., when we rewatch a movie or TV show we love) or for emotion regulation (e.g., when we go to an art exhibition when we are bored). Aesthetic Cognitivism in philosophy and psychology, in contrast, focuses on the epistemic outcomes of our art engagement. It provides a theory about the value of the arts not “as sources of delight, amusement, pleasure, or emotional catharsis, but as sources of understanding.” (Brewer 2025, 1). The proposed AAC in this chapter goes one step further by integrating affect and cognition, arguing that the emotions are not a byproduct but a significant driver of the epistemic impact of the arts. The claim of AAC is therefore not just that the emotions accompany epistemic changes, or that they motivate cognitive engagement (they do that as well), but that specific aesthetic emotions play a constitutive role in how understanding through the arts is achieved. \n\tI first discuss the more general impact of art and cultural artifacts on our habits of perceiving and distinguish them from epistemically valuable cognitive gains; this gives me the opportunity to revisit some central claims of Aesthetic Cognitivism. I then examine how affect and cognition have been related in aesthetic psychology and, starting with Berlyne’s (1960, 1970) work on curiosity that recent psychology has been amended to cover more specific emotions. The main part of the chapter analyzes two recent empirical approaches to Aesthetic Cognitivism. An attempt at a taxonomy of aesthetic impacts (Christensen et al., 2023) and an assessment of viewers’ affective and cognitive experiences in a museum context (Miller et al., 2025). I propose some conditions that empirical studies must meet to speak to Aesthetic Cognitivism and AAC respectively. Overall, these studies suggest that when people actively engage with artworks their emotional involvement is not merely reactive or pleasure-based, but contains different expansive experiences that closely connect to shifts in perspective and the generation of understanding.",

          "abstract": "Autistic people may be more likely to experience trauma, cumulative trauma and PTSD. This mixed methods research proposal aims to address significant gaps in autism and trauma research. Autistic women and gender-diverse individuals face significant barriers in autism research. Existing diagnostic and treatment models are based on male-centric frameworks, leading to underdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, and inadequate support for this population. While validated trauma interventions for autistic people are scarce in general, autistic women and gender-diverse individuals are almost absent in these studies. To address these gaps, this thesis has 4 main sections; 1) a literature review on existing research, 2) a survey on expert perspectives in this context, 3) A scoping review on methodologies for mind-body treatments in this population, 4) proposed randomised controlled trials on mind-body therapies for this population and 4b) proposed interviews evaluating the lived experience of this population before, during and after the trials. The integration of expert knowledge, quantitative outcomes and lived experience in this research challenges gender biases in autism care and adds to the development of autism-informed trauma treatments. Findings of this thesis and the proposed trials may provide critical insight into trauma-informed care for autistic women and gender-diverse individuals, influencing both practice and policy.",

          "authors": "Sean Kelley; Christoph Riedl",
          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to sycophantic behavior, uncritically conforming to user beliefs. As models increasingly condition responses on user-specific context (personality traits, preferences, conversation history), they gain information to tailor agreement more effectively. Understanding how personalization modulates sycophancy is critical, yet systematic evaluation across models and contexts remains limited. We present a rigorous evaluation of personalization's impact on LLM sycophancy across nine frontier models and five benchmark datasets spanning advice, moral judgment, and debate contexts. \nWe find that personalization generally increases affective alignment (emotional validation, hedging/deference), but affects epistemic alignment (belief adoption, position stability, resistance to influence) with context-dependent role modulation. When the LLM's role is to give advice, personalization strengthens epistemic independence (models challenge user presuppositions). When its role is that of a social peer, personalization decreases epistemic independence. In this role, extensively personalized user challenges causing LLMs to abandon their position at significantly higher rates. Robustness tests confirm that the effects are driven by personalized conditioning, not by additional input tokens per se or demographic information alone. Our work provides measurement frameworks for evaluating personalized AI systems, demonstrates the necessity of role-sensitive evaluation, and establishes a novel benchmark to assess goal alignment.",

          "abstract": "Coping with crisis is a culturally situated process shaped by models of self, moral obligation, and interdependence rather than by individual stress regulation alone. Drawing on cultural psychology frameworks, this study examines how parents of young children in low-resource settings coped with adversity situated within the context of COVID-19 pandemic. Using a constructivist qualitative design, in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 parents of children under six years of age living in economically marginalized urban contexts. Data were analyzed through Reflexive Thematic Analysis, guided by Kirmayer’s (2007) model of sociocentric and cosmocentric selves. Sociocentric coping reflects a relational orientation in which well-being is understood as collective, caregiving is morally central, and emotional regulation is oriented toward preserving family harmony. Cosmocentric coping reflects an orientation toward higher-order forces through which uncertainty is accepted, distress externalized, and endurance cultivated. The study challenges individualistic models of coping and highlights how care, endurance, and meaning-making are collectively organized in contexts of structural vulnerability. The paper contributes to cultural psychology by extending theoretical understanding of coping, resilience, and parenting as culturally mediated processes and calls for a contextually grounded model of parental coping to inform culturally responsive interventions and policies promoting family and child well-being in low-resource settings.\nKey words: cultural coping, parenting, sociocentric self, cosmocentric self, Covid 19, low-resource setting, crisis, family stressors",

William’s “Temporal Need-Threat Model” proposes that ostracism threatens fundamental social needs that individuals spontaneously attempt to secure by seeking reaffiliation. Using the Cyberball Game, a computerized ball-tossing game used to study the psychological responses to ostracism via social inclusion vs. exclusion phases, previous studies showed that attention to social signals was an accurate proxy of the reaffiliation needs, themselves being derived from the social exclusion feelings. Yet, contradictory results challenge this view, either because a subset of studies revealed opposite patterns, or because social attention is thought to escape cognitively controlled attentional processes. Here, we directly investigated the relationship between the participants’ social exclusion feelings and their overt attention patterns towards social signals during a Cyberball game. Contrary to William’s Temporal Need-Threat Model, we found anecdotal evidence supporting a negative relationship between attention to social signals and social exclusion feeling. Exploratory analyses revealed that overt social attention patterns in a situation of social exclusion are more intricate than previously assumed, with gaze proportion toward faces varying throughout the Cyberball game, but most likely independent of participants’ social pain.",

          "abstract": "Researchers in psychology frequently combine exploratory data analysis (EDA) with confirmatory data analysis (CDA). In multiple linear regression, this practice often involves using the same dataset both to select predictors and to conduct statistical inference. This leads to invalid post-selection inference (PoSI), a violation of classical statistical assumptions that can produce biased standard errors, distorted p-values, and inflated Type I error rates. As a result, conclusions drawn from such analyses may be misleading or overstated. This paper provides a comprehensive and didactical review of the problem of invalid PoSI arising from data-driven variable selection in multiple linear regression. We illustrate how standard inferential procedures fail after model selection and demonstrate these issues through simulation studies conducted under different model specifications. We also discuss several established statistical approaches for obtaining valid inference after model selection, highlighting their assumptions, strengths, and limitations.\nOur goal is to make the issue of invalid PoSI accessible to applied psychological researchers and to offer practical guidance for conducting statistically valid inference following variable selection.",

          "abstract": "This study explored perceptual sensitivity to spectral and temporal acoustic features in music recognition among BaYaka hunter-gatherer children. Using an interactive, non-competitive game (Move to Match), we tested song recognition under various forms of audio degradation to identify which musical dimensions are crucial for recognizing familiar songs. BaYaka children demonstrated robust recognition of songs across unaltered, spectrally degraded, and temporally degraded versions, highlighting sensitivity to multiple acoustic dimensions. We suggest that songs may be recognized despite degradations because of spectral contour processing, rather than pitch and rhythm cues alone. Moreover, recognition performance decreased for duration-degraded songs (“plinks”), as the brevity constrains the cues available to listeners. However, song identification of (spectrally degraded) plinks far exceeded chance levels and outperformed Western adults performing similar tasks. This suggests that onset-transients and spectral shape, contributing to timbre perception, might serve as reliable markers for identifying musical sounds. We discuss the possibility that music cognition evolved for reasons beyond social bonding to support identification of personal contributions within musical exchanges through timbre, which may hold importance in cooperative contexts. As one of the first experimental studies of music perception in hunter-gatherers, this work demonstrates the potential of culturally adapted methods for future cross-cultural research.",

          "abstract": "Background\nRising skin cancer rates emphasise the need for sun protection measures. While sunscreen is a widely accepted protective measure, its use faces barriers such as perceived inconvenience and forgetfulness. Free sunscreen dispensers aim to mitigate these barriers and promote sunscreen use in various environments. As children are an important target group for skin cancer preventive efforts, placement of sunscreen dispensers at primary schools offers potential to promote sunscreen use. However, to date, their value remains underexplored. \n\nMethods\nA mixed-method study design was applied to evaluate the use and implementation of sunscreen dispensers at three primary schools in the Netherlands. Structured observations (n=1040), guided by an observation checklist, were conducted to assess dispenser use in practice. Additionally, group interviews with pupils (n=112) were carried out to explore their perceptions regarding the dispensers and their motives for (non-)use. Individual interviews (n=6) with school stakeholders (i.e., management, teachers, and facility staff) were conducted to identify perceived facilitators and barriers to implementation.\n\nResults\nObservations revealed that sunscreen dispenser use varied from 6.8% to 42.7% across schools and times. In total, 29.9% of users were encouraged by teachers. Both pupils and stakeholders were positive about the dispensers. Pupils’ main motive for dispenser use was prevention of harmful consequences of the sun, while motives for non-use included weather conditions, no perceived need, and impracticalities. Implementation was facilitated by the ease of use of sunscreen dispensers, supportive environments, and information provision, but hindered by practical concerns and pupils’ need for assistance. \n\nConclusion\nSunscreen dispensers were positively evaluated by pupils and stakeholders, their use depending on several contextual and behavioural factors. Integrating sunscreen dispensers into a comprehensive educational approach for skin cancer prevention at primary schools is key to overcome practical barriers",

This study examined the influence of spatial priors (pre-existing knowledge about spatial parameters) using a spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality. We proposed a novel two-dimensional framework for categorizing spatial priors based on spatial reference frame (allocentric vs. egocentric) and temporal scale (global vs. local). Participants memorized and later reproduced target locations. The spatial compactness of the target distribution was manipulated to vary the precision of the allocentric global prior. A central tendency effect, where responses were biased toward the target distribution centroid, indicated reliance on the allocentric global prior. Bias was stronger with more precise distributions, indicating greater reliance on the more precise allocentric global prior. Bidimensional regression analysis revealed additional influences from the egocentric global and egocentric local priors, but not from the allocentric local prior. These findings support the proposed framework and demonstrate that multiple forms of prior knowledge simultaneously guide navigation behavior. This work provides a foundation for future studies linking prior knowledge to spatial navigation and broader cognitive processes.",

          "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities are present in many software systems, putting those who entrust software with their data in harm’s way. Many vulnerabilities are avoidable since they are not new and are well-described. Despite this awareness, they remain widespread. One hypothesis for their persistence is that they represent software blindspots, problems that are implicit in the mental models of developers and thus escape attention (Brun et al., 2023; Oliveira et al. 2018). Our current understanding of how cognitive influences secure coding is limited, and we address this by extending the hypothesis by suggesting differences in decision making approaches alter the ability to detect vulnerabilities. Through an empirical study and power analysis, we show the potential value of dual processing theory, where individuals make decisions using one of two cognitive systems: a default system reliant on heuristics and intuitive mechanisms, and a more deliberate and computational interventionist system. This preregistered study replicates key predictions from previous blindspot research, extends the analysis towards cognition, and models effect sizes of variables that might impact software security. We complement this analysis with data simulations to expose the sampling scale of empirical studies that would be necessary for highly powered work in this domain.",

Although the results revealed various situational predictors, the strongest was the presence of other people. People who characteristically welcomed accountability tended to experience more pleasant emotion and meaningfulness and less unpleasant emotion. Similarly, when people welcomed accountability more than was typical for them, they tended to experience more pleasant emotion and meaningfulness, but also more unpleasant emotion.

          "abstract": "The ability to detect and learn from errors is critical for adaptive behavior across the lifespan. In motor learning, errors drive accurate movements by updating internal forward models that predict sensory consequences. However, the developmental trajectory of the neural mechanisms underlying error processing in motor learning remains largely unknown. Here, we recorded EEG in children (8–10 years), adolescents (13–15 years), and adults (20–35 years) during a goal-directed drawer-opening task requiring movements at a target speed to obtain a reward at the end of the movement. The task dissociated predictive processing of internal errors, reflected in an error-related negativity (ERN)-like component, from postdictive processing of external errors, reflected in a feedback-related negativity (FRN)-like component. Unlike previous cognitive studies, our results showed significant ERN-like and FRN-like components already in 8-year-olds, with no significant differences across the age groups, suggesting early development of predictive and postdictive error processing. Exploratory analyses revealed a more pronounced late frontal positivity in children compared to adolescents and adults, indicating that external feedback may remain more salient at younger ages. This study highlights children’s ability to monitor performance internally and externally during motor learning and underscores the value of supporting both self-monitoring and feedback-based learning in motor skill acquisition across ages.",

This mixed-methods study surveyed 126 staff from six secondary schools, assessing autism-specific training, perceived inclusiveness of school environment, experience with autistic pupils, neurodiversity-affirming attitudes, personal connection to autism, and staff role. Teacher self-efficacy and intentions for inclusive practice were measured using adapted scales, and hierarchical multiple regression identified significant predictors. Autism-specific training, perceived quality of the inclusive environment, years of experience with autistic pupils, classroom teacher role, and neurodiversity-affirming attitudes predicted higher self-efficacy. Together, these explained 42.1% of the variance. Intentions for inclusive practice were predicted by neurodiversity-affirming attitudes and training, explaining 27.5% of variance. Thematic analysis of open-text responses revealed practical adjustments including clear communication, sensory adaptations, and emotional regulation supports, alongside challenges such as resource constraints, complex classroom dynamics, and inconsistent institutional support. Findings highlight the value of targeted autism-specific training and fostering neurodiversity-affirming attitudes, supported by inclusive school environments, to strengthen teacher capacity and sustain inclusive practice.",

Past research has indicated that persistent and strenuous interactions with people who have experienced trauma may result in indirect trauma reactions. The objective of this qualitative research is to understand the experiences of cis women researchers working in the field of Gender Based Violence. To achieve this objective, this research seeks to answer the following questions: What psycho-social challenges do the researchers experience, and how do they cope with them? Using Reflexive thematic analysis of 6 semi-structured interviews, the following three themes emerged, each with its own set of subthemes: Experience of Vicarious Trauma as a Researcher, Reflections on Violence, Safety and Womanhood, and Coping as a Researcher. This study suggests that the psycho-social impacts on researchers are shaped by the nature of the work, their positionalities, and the broader contexts in which they operate. \nKeywords: Gender Based Violence, Researchers, Psycho-Social Challenges, Women,  Vicarious Trauma",

For that purpose, we took all robot stimuli currently contained in the Anthropomorphic Robot Database (ABOT; n = 251) and examined the degree to which they trigger mind perception (N = 300). Consistent with prior findings, robots were generally attributed more agency (capacity to act and plan) than experience (capacity to sense and feel). Body components significantly explained variance in the perception of agency, especially in interaction with facial features; for experience, on the other hand, variance was significantly explained by body components, face and surface details. Increasing human-likeness boosted perceptions of both dimensions, but the trajectories differed: experience followed a cubic function, plateauing at medium levels of human-likeness, while agency followed a quartic function with a dip around 75% human-likeness—a pattern resembling the un-canny valley. Our results indicate that in order to create specific levels of agency (e.g., for surgery robots) and experience (e.g., for companion robots), a general increase of human-likeness might not suffice; instead, targeted design of individual physical features is crucial for convey-ing specific mental capacities. Our ratings linking physical robot features to dimensions of mind perception are made available, offering a comprehensive and accessible resource for researchers to experimentally manipulate perceptions of agency and experience.",

          "abstract": "Representing relational knowledge in a mental map is useful for adaptive behaviour. Here, we studied how curriculum learning (the use of different training regimes) influences the way that mental (or ‘cognitive’) maps are formed. We investigated how the order in which people learned one-step transitions impacted their subsequent ability to perform multi-step inference using the cognitive maps they had formed. Participants learned one map with a curriculum that grouped information by rows and columns (‘grouped curriculum’) and another that selected transitions for training in a spatially disjoint way (‘disjoint curriculum’). Subsequent multi-step navigation was performed better after training using the disjoint curriculum. We hypothesise that learning under a grouped curriculum results in mental fragmentation of the learned maps, which impairs subsequent navigation across rows and columns. By contrast, learning one-step transitions in a pseudo-random order facilitates subsequent integration of learned information into a mental map to enable adaptive behaviour.",

While most attention control signals are well acknowledged to interact with each other, the case of reward has led to mixed findings supporting either its interaction with, or its independence from other signals. We addressed this issue using a 4-item search task that entailed spatially biased reward contingencies, with one of the four locations associated with high rewards for correct target discriminations. In different conditions, the target, a distractor or neither of them could be physically salient. Targets at the high-reward location did not enhance search performance. In contrast, and contrary to our initial expectations, salient distractors at the high-reward location interfered less with the discrimination of the task-relevant targets, reflecting gating mechanisms at the high-reward location. Exploratory analyses showed that, across participants, the degree of target and salient distractor gating at the high-reward location correlated with each other. In contrast to previous findings supporting attention capture by reward signals, we evidenced gating by reward.",

Our results revealed that national collective narcissism mediates the relationship between centrality and negative intergroup phenomena. In two experiments, we provided evidence that national collective narcissism is a consequence of high centrality of national identity.

          "abstract": "Auditory feedback modulation (AFM) – altering how speakers hear their own voice during phonation – is a well-established method for investigating vocal motor control. Healthy speakers typically respond to AFM with compensatory adjustments in the opposite direction, such as lowering pitch in response to upward pitch shifts. Whether hoarseness-induced auditory feedback elicits comparable compensatory behaviour – specifically, vocal adjustments that enhance acoustic voice quality – remains unknown. To address this gap, the present study pursued two aims: (1) to introduce and evaluate a real-time voice resynthesis system, VQ-Synth, designed to induce the percept of hoarseness in otherwise healthy voices, and (2) to test whether hoarseness-induced auditory feedback leads to compensatory improvements in acoustic voice quality, measured by smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPS). In Study 1, participants rated recordings of their own voice processed with four different resynthesis methods. Overall, the anti-peak-window method, which inserted noise between the pitch-related amplitude peaks, produced the strongest percept of dysphonia. In Study 2, this method was applied in an AFM experiment to modulate voice quality in real-time. Participants sustained the vowel /a:/ 140 times. In the AFM group, auditory feedback was modulated according to a phase design (baseline, ramp, hold, after), whereas the control group received unaltered feedback throughout. CPPS in the AFM group increased significantly from baseline through ramp and hold and remained elevated in the after phase, while there was no CPPS increase in the control group. These results indicate that the improvement in acoustic voice quality was not a practice effect but indeed driven by hoarseness-induced AFM. Future work will explore VQ-Synth’s potential in connected speech and its application as a therapeutic tool for individuals with dysphonia.",

Across studies, we measured attitudes and anxiety at three time points (before, immediately after, and a week following the intervention). Results indicated improved attitudes and reduced anxiety towards the outgroup that persisted for at least one week. Notably, both participants who were mandated to attend the event by their organization and those who attended voluntarily showed improvements in attitudes. Our project offers insights into the effects of the intervention across distinct contexts and shows that these effects endure beyond the immediate intervention context, re-affirming the contact hypothesis in a field setting.\n\tKeywords: prejudice reduction, intervention, intergroup contact, Living Library, attitudes",

Thus, it is important to understand the sources of individual differences in this trait. Existing hypotheses on the development of narcissism have focused on familial and parental environments that act to make siblings in a family more alike. However, the relative importance of shared environments as opposed to other environmental and genetic sources is still unclear. Using a large extended twin family design, we found that parents’ and children’s narcissism scores were correlated, but this association was entirely genetically driven. Across age and measures, genetics and individual-specific environmental factors each explained 50% of the variance in narcissism and there was no evidence of environmental sources shared within families. This finding calls for a fundamental shift in the search for the origins of narcissism, including extra-familial environmental factors (e.g., educational and occupational pathways, experiences with peers, and romantic partners).",

This study investigated the impact of mental imagery simulations of threat on endogenous pain modulation in n = 71 healthy participants using a cuff-pressure algometry protocol. In block one, participants were assessed on their baseline pain detection threshold (PDT), pressure pain tolerance (PTT), and their conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses. In the second block, participants underwent the same procedures again but were randomly allocated to imagine the dominant leg cuff as being made of bubble-wrap (benign imagery condition; n = 36) or metal wire (threat imagery condition; n = 35). In between blocks, participants went to a separate room to interact with a piece of real bubble wrap or metal wire around their legs, facilitating mental imagery generation in Block 2. Partially consistent with our hypothesis, mental imagery impacted CPM effects for pain detection threshold (PDT), which was significantly reduced in the Wire relative to the Bubble-wrap condition. Mental imagery did not influence pressure pain tolerance (PPT). These results indicate that mental simulations of threat may reduce threshold-based conditioned pain modulation (CPM) responses in healthy individuals. Present findings suggest that mental simulation of threat may influence endogenous pain modulation processes.",

          "abstract": "Kusano et al. (2025) argue that strict measurement invariance (MI) requirements may be ill-suited for cross-cultural psychology because they can obscure theoretically meaningful differences between countries. We share their call to move beyond MI as a gatekeeper and to focus on the substantive relevance of non-invariance. However, we question whether correlating country-level scale scores with external indices separates construct-relevant factors from method biases. In a simulation calibrated to their empirical setting, we show that scalar non-invariance (threshold/intercept shift) (a) attenuates and destabilizes country-level correlations, (b) inflates correlations when bias aligns with the construct, and (c) suppresses associations when bias opposes it. We also outline a causal perspective on MI that treats non-invariance as theoretically informative and motivates explicit models of its causes. Using this causal view, we argue that adjusting for demographic covariates at the composite score level does not remedy item-level non-invariance.",

          "abstract": "Our capacity for attention is increasingly outpaced by the volume of information that is available through digital media, contributing to widespread concern that digital media use might compromise our ability to focus. We conducted a scoping review of experimental and quasi-experimental studies to map what the causal evidence on digital media and attention actually tests, investigating the study designs used (RQ1), the exposures, outcomes, and populations studied (RQ2), the operationalizations and theoretical frameworks employed (RQ3), the mediators and moderators assessed (RQ4), and points of convergence or divergence across studies. Across 94 papers (110 studies; Ntotal = 12,054), we found a heterogenous and diverging field. Most experiments assess immediate performance changes under additional stimulation (e.g., dual-task interference or device presence), whereas relatively few study sustained changes in attentional functioning. Many observed effects therefore reflect general multitasking costs rather than mechanisms unique to digital media. At the same time, different research traditions target different attentional components and implicitly test different mechanisms, making results difficult to integrate. Consequently, conclusions about digital media and attention depend strongly on how digital media use and attention are operationalized. Overall, we argue that the field has devoted limited attention to the central question motivating public concern: whether everyday digital media use produces enduring changes in attentional functioning. Progress will require a mechanism‑oriented, ecologically valid, and cumulative research that aligns theory, design, and temporal scope.",

          "abstract": "Episodic memories showcase the complexity of internal thought: they bind together people, places, and events into coherent narratives, and they carry a subjective quality that sets them apart from other mental representations. In this review, I argue that episodic memory provides a powerful lens for understanding the functional organization of the default mode network (DMN). Recent research reveals that memory-related functions of the DMN are organized along at least two key dimensions— content and specificity. Distinct areas support memory for different types of content (e.g., object, spatial, and social information) and with varying levels of specificity (e.g., detailed episodes vs general schemas). Together, DMN pathways can support the diversity of episodic thought, imbuing multidimensional representations with subjective experience. By delineating how these pathways correspond with memory features, we can gain insight into how the DMN builds and updates internal narratives across cognitive domains.",

Wealth is 60-70% more spatially concentrated than income, with patterns distinct from income and housing values. Post-1980 increases in between-place inequality reflect places changing positions rather than divergence. Within places, bottom 50\\ wealth shares declined nationwide.

          "abstract": "Although scholars initially hypothesized that exile reduces domestic conflict, recent research finds that forcing political challengers abroad correlates with subsequent political instability. However, the mechanisms linking exile and contentious politics remain unexplored. This paper investigates how exile exacerbates domestic contention with original data on exile participation in revolutions, and argues that under certain conditions exile bestows benefits on challengers relative to being based domestically. First, we show that revolutionary challenges are more likely to occur in countries with former leaders in exile, and that revolutionary challenges led by exiles are longer and more violent than those led by domestically based actors. Additional analyses reveal important linking mechanisms; exile’s escalating effects are strongest when exiles are geographically proximate, maintain a sustained presence abroad, provide direct leadership, secure international support, or establish governments-in-exile. Finally, exile is most escalating for revolutions that would otherwise be relatively peaceful. Our study highlights an important but neglected feature of revolutionary contention and advances a broader research agenda on exile and contentious politics.",

Drawing on experimental evidence, an original dataset of 105 elections since 1990 in which autocratizing incumbents sought reelection, hand-coded measures of autocratization scope and visibility in recent electoral contests, and comparative analyses of Poland and Zambia, we find that visibility, but not scope, is systematically linked to incumbent defeat.

Students listed an average of five key discussion partners, most of whom were Latine, and networks were centered on friends, family members, and fellow college students. Correlational analyses show that stronger ties are associated with multiple forms of support, while family members are especially linked to material aid, aspirational support, and community role modeling. Regression results indicate that greater tie strength and access to community role models are positively associated with STEM identity, whereas denser, more close-knit networks are negatively associated with STEM identity. Network size, tie strength, and having alters who help navigate college life are positively related to students’ sense of belonging. Together, the findings highlight the importance of relational context and culturally grounded assets in shaping Latine students’ persistence and identity development in STEM.",

Drawing on comparative evidence from two studies of Latine college students, one using TNGI and the other using MGRI, the analysis demonstrates that MGRI captures larger and less kin-centered networks, yields lower network density estimates, and better reflects the diversity of students’ academic and career support ties. The findings suggest that MGRI provides a more accurate portrait of undergraduate support networks and enables researchers to examine multiple types of relational contexts within a single survey.

          "abstract": "Modern work and support systems often assume that effort translates into action in a steady and predictable way through routine, reinforcement, and private self-management, embedding this expectation in institutional infrastructure. For many people with ADHD, this expectation does not hold. Traction can be discontinuous and highly context-dependent, and sustained functioning is often achieved through compensatory pathways such as urgency and acute pressure rather than stable routines. While these strategies can enable short-term performance, they can also be costly when chronic stress becomes the main route to action. When institutions treat their motivational expectations as universal, differences in regulation are frequently moralised as laziness, unreliability, or defiance, and people are praised for crisis performance but blamed for later collapse. Drawing on disability studies, this paper frames these dynamics as institutional misfit rather than individual pathology.

We test how incentive amount and information about vendor options affect response behavior and explore differences by language background. Incentivized parents were more likely to start and complete surveys and claim gift cards, though Spanish-speaking parents exhibited distinct patterns—greater completion rates but lower redemption rates, often selecting essential-goods vendors. Increasing incentive value and providing advance information both improved engagement. Findings inform the design of equitable, effective digital incentive strategies for diverse populations.",

          "authors": "Branko Milanovic; Marco Ranaldi; Carolyn Fisher",
          "abstract": "Global capital income inequality has declined in the 21st century, with the Gini coefficient falling from 97% to 94%. Over the same period, the share of the world population with annual capital income above $100 increased from 12% to 27%. This implies more than a doubling of the number of individuals earning positive income from interest, dividends, rents, and privately-funded pensions. Most Western nations have lost positions in the global capital income ranking, in contrast to several developing countries, particularly China and Russia. When adjusting for missing capital income in surveys using national accounts, while the levels of inequality slightly vary across adjustment methods, the results consistently confirm a decreasing inequality trend. This is also confirmed when the capitalized wealth of billionaires is included in the analysis using Forbes lists. Overall, this paper provides new global evidence on the evolution, distribution, and measurement of capital income, and highlights its implications for inequality analysis in contemporary capitalism.

          "abstract": "Private sector management frameworks (PSMFs) are increasingly utilised by nonprofit leaders to drive strategy and manage operations. While some scholars laud PSMFs for enhancing nonprofit productivity and strategic effectiveness, others contend they are ill-suited for a social mission context. This study addresses a pragmatic route forward, exploring how nonprofit leaders of organisations in the UK and US adapt PSMFs to befit their nonprofit context. Through in-depth interviews and document analysis we explore PSMF translation in six cases, revealing three distinct “PSMF translation” approaches: Responsive, Proactive and Mediative. These categories demonstrate senior leaders are intentional actors who rework private sector logic to fit functional nonprofit needs, bridging the dual demands for commercial efficiency and social impact. We conclude by addressing the currently ad hoc and atomised state of PSMF usage, calling for scholars, policymakers and field leaders to support informed PSMF translation across the social sector.",

Existing research explains why voters tolerate autocratizing leaders, but we know less about when they hold them accountable. We develop a framework of electoral accountability under autocratization to evaluate when attacks on democracy trigger electoral backlash, considering the scope of autocratization (i.e., the breadth of institutional erosion) and its visibility (i.e., the extent to which these actions are clearly legible as undemocratic to voters), while situating these features alongside preexisting institutional strength, economic performance, and political culture. Drawing on experimental evidence, an original dataset of 105 elections since 1990 in which autocratizing incumbents sought reelection, hand-coded measures of autocratization scope and visibility in recent electoral contests, and comparative analyses of Poland and Zambia, we find that visibility, but not scope, is systematically linked to incumbent defeat. Our findings have implications for the conditions under which citizens can disrupt episodes of autocratization through electoral channels.",

          "abstract": "Kinship networks are a key informal infrastructure of support, yet demographic change is reshaping how many and which relatives people can rely on. Some people may lack kin completely or in part. Thus, we also consider friendship ties as potential compensatory sources of support. Using nationally representative surveys from 1998 and 2016, we describe age-specific configurations of close kin and friends among Italian adults. We measure the availability of close kin (partner, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren), kinlessness, kinship size and diversity, and generational positioning. In 2016, complete kinlessness remains rare (about 1%) but is concentrated at older ages, whereas small, vertically “thinned” networks are more common. Kin availability peaks in midlife and declines at older ages. Between 1998 and 2016, the average number and diversity of kin decreased and generational profiles increasingly feature ascendants without descendants and a group of “generational solos.” Friendship ties are widespread and more prevalent among those with fewer kin, but they do not fully offset emerging inequalities in kinship resources. These findings show how the changes occurred in longevity, low fertility, and partnership reconfigured informal support bases in an ageing, strong-family context.",

The EU LIFE Multi Peat project introduces the European Peatland Policy Portal as a novel policy corpus and toolkit to support analysis and evidence-based policy development in this disjointed landscape of peatland policy. The portal presents the first comprehensive European Peatland Policy Corpus, with over 400 peatland-affecting policies catalogued across 27 countries and 22 languages, spanning United Nations, European Union, national, and sub-national levels. Alongside the unified, multilingual policy catalogue, the portal introduces an interactive mapping tool to support spatial policy analysis, as well as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based question-answering tool that allows users to query the full policy corpus with the power of machine learning. With multilingual comprehension, the RAG tool enables users to interface with policies which would otherwise sit behind a language barrier. By enabling systematic policy examination and analysis across countries, governance levels, domains, and languages, the portal assists the coordination and efficiency gaps of European peatland governance. While this portal demonstrates the efficacy of these tools for peatland policy specifically, its framework is transferable to other land use policy domains that face complex regulatory environments.",

We find that both grievances are positively associated with anti-feminist sentiment. Exploring effect heterogeneity, we find that the associations are slightly stronger for men, but these differences are minimal in substantive terms. However, using a three-way interaction model, we find that financial dissatisfaction can compensate for some of the negative associations between marginalization as well as loneliness with anti-feminist attitudes for men; the opposite is the case for women. Arguing from an identity threat theory perspective, the study shows how gender plays an incremental role in how the perceived personal situation exerts an influence on gender related attitudes. Therefore, our study contributes to our understanding of how perceived grievances interact with socio-demographic characteristics and how this interplay potentially increases anti-feminist attitudes.",

          "abstract": "From the smart urbanism of the 2010s to platform and AI urbanism(s) of the present-future, the ‘data-driven city’ has been imagined as a functional and controlled whole, impulsed and regulated by autonomous (humans off-the-loop) systems, and fed through powerful data infrastructure. AI urbanism, in particular, manifests the current climax of the long-standing desire to control digital technology in the city yet to come. An excessive focus on technology, however, risks de-contextualising it from the wider economic and political landscapes. \nWhile digital platforms have been structuring the fabric of daily urban life colonising almost any field of interest through their ecosystems and mobile apps, AI technologies start making their way into cities with: autonomous vehicles, city brains, Digital Twins and robotics. Advocates suggest these novel technologies have changed the geographies of their deployment – not confined to cities any more, rather on regional or global scales – and of their partnerships with city management – cities no longer having exclusive and central stage, rather participating to consortia with limited or secondary roles. Both these configurations have been framed as the ‘post-smart city’. \nBut, is there a paradigm shift between these versions of urbanism? Has the ‘smart city’ framework – the neoliberal project of linking private investment from technology firms into the management and governance of city living – substantially changed? And, finally, what role is expected for cities to take in this uncertain and evolving scenario? \nThe ‘data-driven city’ ought to be understood in pair with the development of data capitalism and the enormous expansion of its data infrastructure, markets and services. Thus, I invite to re-position this debate as an intensification of neoliberal (‘smart’ or ‘data-driven’) urbanism and its ideological assumptions: technological solutionism and smart mentality, and data extractivism, surveillance and control.",

          "abstract": "How first-time parents arrange childcare has critical implications for their careers and the child's development. Previous research shows that childcare choices are shaped by family care availability, understood as an additive function of a small set of parental and grandparental characteristics. However, research on family networks suggests that care availability is rather a non-linear, non-additive function of large family networks. We compare the predictive ability of these two perspectives using a machine learning framework and register-based family network data. We find that considering how the child’s great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins shape care availability, and modelling their influence using more flexible models, improves the prediction of childcare choices, particularly among more disadvantaged parents. Consistent with prior work, predictions are driven by parents’ and grandparents’ socioeconomic characteristics, but cousins’ age and daycare use are important yet understudied predictors. Other important predictors include parents’ self-employment, healthcare spending, and timing of daycare uptake.",

          "abstract": "The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) introduces, for the first time, a legal framework granting researchers access to data from very large online platforms and search engines. This represents a profound shift in how platform data can be obtained: access becomes a regulated right rather than a technical workaround. Yet the DSA’s promise of transparency depends on the ability of researchers to meet stringent legal and technical requirements for security, confidentiality, and data protection. Few researchers can do so individually.\nThis commentary argues that the emerging DSA regime makes research infrastructure a precondition for meaningful and lawful data access. Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and other institutional arrangements can mediate between three actors — researchers, platforms, and Digital Services Coordinators — ensuring trust, compliance, and accountability. In this role, infrastructures become not just technical means but governance interfaces that translate regulatory obligations into practical research conditions.\nThe shift from ad hoc data collection to regulated access requires more than new rules; it demands a reorientation of the research community itself. Building and sustaining infrastructures is now integral to enabling independent, transparent, and reproducible platform research. The DSA, we suggest, inaugurates a new phase in the politics of data access — one in which infrastructures mediate the relationship between science, regulation, and the digital platforms that shape public life.",

          "abstract": "This article analyzes how editorial processes in leading International Relations (IR) journals reproduce global epistemic inequalities. It focuses on International Security (IS) and International Studies Quarterly (ISQ) to identify two interrelated dynamics: editorial bias, which privileges scholars affiliated with Western institutions, and editorial blindness, which narrows thematic scope despite broad declared aims. Using original empirical data and a novel formal framework—the Probabilistic Article Acceptance Model (PAAM) and Editorial Blindness Index (EBI)—the study finds that 95.5% of IS and 92.3% of ISQ primary authors affiliate with Western institutions. Furthermore, it demonstrates that IS narrows its thematic focus toward traditional and U.S.-centric security concerns, while ISQ maintains thematic plurality. These findings align with Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic capital and Kuhn’s paradigm theory, indicating that editorial decisions reflect social and institutional structures more than epistemic merit. The article introduces Epistemic Gatekeeping Dynamics (EGD) as a new theoretical framework, arguing that editorial processes act as selective mechanisms of epistemic legitimacy. It concludes by recommending structural reforms and editorial diversification to promote pluralism and inclusivity in IR publishing.",

This article examines how the migration decisions of highly skilled individuals are affected by state-sponsored mobilization. Using U.S.-trained Chinese scientists' return to the newly founded People's Republic of China after 1949 as a case, we construct an original dataset of all Chinese Ph.D. graduates in STEM fields from U.S. universities between 1945 and 1958, their return decisions, and the regional membership distribution of the Association of Chinese Scientific Workers (ACSW)---a key state-sponsored organization aimed at mobilizing returnees. Both fixed effects and instrumental variables analyses show that Chinese graduates' exposure to this organization significantly increases their likelihood of return. Further analyses reveal that ACSW's mobilization was more effective when channeled through scientists' own professional networks, and it influenced their aspiration to return more than ability. These findings unveil important political drivers behind one of the largest episodes of talent repatriations in history, with significant implications for global knowledge transfer and U.S.--China relations today.",

This paper proposes that resilience is best understood as hierarchical precision flexibility—the capacity of a predictive system to dynamically recalibrate confidence in prediction errors across embodied, affective, and meaning-related levels of inference.\nDrawing on predictive processing and the Free Energy Principle, we argue that resilience does not consist in reduced stress reactivity, but in context-sensitive modulation of precision within hierarchical inference. Defensive rigidity and adaptive flexibility are reframed as alternative configurations of precision dynamics rather than distinct psychological capacities. Dysregulation arises when prediction errors are weighted inflexibly, whereas resilience emerges from coordinated recalibration across hierarchical levels.\nThis account integrates developmental, neurobiological, and computational perspectives within a unified explanatory framework. By specifying resilience as a property of precision dynamics, it shifts the construct from descriptive classification toward formal mechanistic explanation and yields empirically testable predictions for computational psychiatry and clinical intervention research.",

This study aims to deepen understanding of the roles that diverse HWFP activities play within the broader set of strategies food-insecure households use to keep food on the table. We conducted interviews with 25 participants in two rural states in the northeastern United States, Maine and Vermont. On average, the study  participants reported having engaged in 19 of a list of 41 coping behaviors, not including HWFP activities, in the last year. Overall, they described HWFP activities as socially legitimate food sources that provide multifaceted benefits beyond food. For these interviewees, HWFP can be an effective coping strategy for alleviating household food insecurity because it diversifies their food sources and allows for stockpiling non-market abundances. Yet, HWFP should not be mistaken for a coping strategy in the sense of an activity that households undertake only in response to hardship, because participants associated these activities with diverse, positive meanings such as joy, connection, and autonomy. The only negative aspects of HWFP that participants identified were challenges stemming from limited access to key resources needed for successful harvests, such as equipment, skills, and land access. We recommend policies and programs that ensure access to these prerequisites for HWFP success; people experiencing food insecurity should guide these efforts.",

          "abstract": "Reproducibility is central to research credibility, yet large-scale reanalysis of empricial data remains costly because replication packages vary widely in structure, software environment, and documentation. We develop and evaluate an agentic AI workflow that addresses this execution bottleneck while preserving scientific rigor. The system separates scientific reasoning from computational execution: researchers design fixed diagnostic templates, and the workflow automates the acquisition, harmonization, and execution of replication materials using pre-specified, version-controlled code. A structured knowledge layer records resolved failure patterns, enabling adaptation across heterogeneous studies while keeping each pipeline version transparent and stable. We evaluate this workflow on 92 instrumental variable (IV) studies, including 67 with manually verified reproducible 2SLS estimates and 25 newly published IV studies under identical criteria. For each paper, we analyze up to three two-stage least squares (2SLS) specifications, totaling 215. Across the 92 papers, the system achieves 87% end-to-end success overall. Conditional on accessible data and code, reproducibility is 100% at both the paper and specification levels. The framework substantially lowers the cost of executing established empirical protocols and can be adapted in empirical settings where analytic templates and norms of transparency are well established.",

Drawing on survey data (n = 129) and interviews (n = 20), the study applies Yosso’s (2005) Community Cultural Wealth framework alongside social network analysis to document the strengths students bring to college and the ways these assets relate to career attitudes and service use. Findings indicate that participants demonstrate high levels of Aspirational, Navigational, Familial, and Resistant capital, with family-centered networks playing a central role in sustaining hope, coping, and community commitment. Students report a moderate sense of belonging and relatively strong work volition. The report also shows that students' engagement with formal career services varies by year in school, sense of belonging, network characteristics, and career values. Cluster analyses reveal meaningful within-group differences in both career orientations and forms of cultural wealth, underscoring the heterogeneity of Hispanic/Latino students’ experiences. The report concludes with asset-based recommendations for faculty, advisors, and student services professionals to strengthen institutional practices, better connect campus resources to students’ existing networks and values, and support equitable college-to-career pathways.",

          "authors": "Jose Marquez; Jan-Emmanuel De Neve",
          "abstract": "Introduction: Recent evidence suggests a substantial temporal change in the traditional U-shaped age-wellbeing relationship in many countries. From a sustainable wellbeing perspective that emphasises intergenerational equity, we examine how wellbeing was reallocated across age groups in 28 OECD countries between 2008 and 2024. \nMethod: We analyse life evaluation (0–10 scale) data from the Gallup World Poll at four anchor years (2008, 2011, 2019, 2024), using country-specific models and two classification approaches (quadratic and confidence-interval-based). We assess cross-national heterogeneity, methodological sensitivity, and sustainable wellbeing implications through age-group reallocation patterns.\nResults: Age-wellbeing profiles varied greatly across countries, with classifications sensitive to functional form, age boundaries, and temporal pooling. We identified five patterns: (1) sustainable (8 countries including Eastern Europe, East Asia, Chile: broad-based gains across all age groups), (2) unsustainable (14 countries across North, Western and Southern Europe, North America, and New Zealand, characterised by early-adulthood decline alongside substantially better outcomes in late adulthood; Spain exemplified the starkest contrast (-1.34 point-change for ages 18-29, and +0.83 for ages 70-79)), (3) no significant age-based reallocation (Turkey, Israel), (4) reverse patterns (United Kingdom, Ireland: late adulthood fared worse than early adulthood), (5) mixed/unique patterns (Australia, Denmark).\nConclusion: Age-wellbeing profile classifications are sensitive to methodological choices, though reallocation patterns provide robust evidence about distributional dynamics. Half the sample showed unsustainable trajectories, raising profound intergenerational equity concerns. Eight countries achieved sustainable, broad-based gains, all starting from low baselines, which suggests that equitable trajectories may be more easily achievable when aggregate wellbeing is improving rather than declining. Addressing unsustainable patterns requires comprehensive policy attention and routine age-disaggregated monitoring.",

          "title": "Does Digital Platform Interoperability Deliver on Its Expectations? Evidence from User Switching on Mastodon",
          "authors": "Philipp Riederle",
          "abstract": "Users of centralised digital platforms (e.g., X, Instagram, TikTok) have little choice but to accept incumbent providers’ conduct or forgo participation. Digital platform interoperability is widely proposed as a remedy to reduce the economic and political power of centralised digital platforms by enabling user choice without sacrificing network connectivity. Despite its prominence in policy debates (e.g., EU’s Digital Markets Act, Art. 7), theoretical claims on its effects remain largely untested. This paper evaluates three theoretical expectations on platform interoperability: that it neutralises proprietary network effects; it facilitates individual user choice and switching; and that technical standardisation risks homogeneous services. To operationalise these concepts, this study analyses user switches within the interoperable social platform Mastodon. It draws on an unobtrusive, qualitative analysis of user posts documenting why individuals switched their interoperable providers. My findings qualify the theoretical promises and concerns: I find that interoperability is necessary but, on its own, insuﬀicient to achieve the intentions associated with policy proposals. I identify practical obstacles such as incomplete implementation, information costs, and persistent switching costs that preserve proprietary network effects and that hinder individual choice and switching. Further, I challenge the concern of anticipated service homogenisation. I identify avenues of vertical (e.g., quality) and horizontal (e.g., governance values) provider differentiation. These avenues form an emerging research agenda on new dynamics between differentiated but interoperable platform providers. Overall, this study contributes the first empirical evaluation of digital platform interoperability, identifies obstacles, and formulates recommendations, speaking directly to policy.",

          "authors": "Onur Yamaner; MUNIBA ALI",
          "abstract": "This paper examines the specifics of the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan from the perspective of the intersection of theories of recognition, justice, and the transition from realist to constructivist paradigms. The Baloch insurgency in Pakistan has always been explained through security and economic-aid policies by the Pakistan government. However, by exploring the intersection of structural, cultural, and psychological forms of exclusion, it is claimed that the conflict is fueled by these intersections of identity. This paper combines the theories of misrecognition and maldistribution from the work of Nancy Fraser in 2003 and the moral injury construct of Axel Honneth from 1995 and asserts that structural policies of the Pakistan government are denying the Baloch people recognition as complete citizens with recognized identity. The proposed study makes use of a qualitative research approach in which descriptive and explanatory content analysis has been used to examine the socio-political reality of Balochistan. The study is limited by the fact that the research has no prime field accessibility due to the constraints imposed by security considerations, which may pose challenges of bias arising from state or secondary histories. To address the implication, triangulation is used in the study by referencing official statistics and other international human rights reports to provide a balanced view. The study has been conducted by using a purposive sample of secondary sources ranging from peer-reviewed academic literature to policy reports related to the 18th Amendment and CPEC projects, along with human rights statistics obtained from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). The sources were considered as per their respective relevance to the twin paradigms of \"struggle for recognition\" and \"maldistribution.\" The period of investigation has been from accession in 1948 to modern development schemes. This paper derives its findings from a content analysis of already existing literature from 1948-2024 on the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan and includes the history of violence between the Baloch leaders and the central government of Pakistan and the \"moral injuries\" that are spurred by the exploitative use of Baloch Gas and Minerals by the Pakistani government. Through this change in focus, or paradigm shift, from simply addressing resource struggles to addressing struggles for dignity, this study shows that issues of economic and political justice are being used as primary wounds of invisibility and disrespect. Therefore, this study concludes that in order to pursue a justice-oriented path for eternal peace, there must be an understanding of the connected concepts of respect and recognition. \nKeywords: Conflict, Grievances, Misrecognition, Misrepresentation, Recognition and Redistribution.",

          "abstract": "An agent-based model with symmetric agents (N = 350; no pre-assigned enforcement roles; 3,246 runs) shows that enforcement concentration emerges endogenously from the structural geometry of codified moral systems. Five measurable institutional properties (legibility, substitutability, enforcement reward, institutional delegation, and exit cost) jointly determine which of four regimes a system enters: quiet, mixed enforcement, collapse, or capture. Institutional delegation and capital compounding reliably select a small minority into enforcement roles: the top 5 agents issue 67 to 92 percent of all punishment; endogenously appointed cadre members execute 92 to 98 percent. Two theoretically motivated retention mechanisms (sanctified suffering, membership reward) are inert across their full parameter ranges. Only degradation of the outside option converts concentration into capture: 466 of 1,080 drift-enabled runs transition to capture from conditions that otherwise yield mixed dynamics. The decisive falsifiable prediction: holding enforcement intensity constant, lowering outside-option quality increases the probability of capture. Cross-national analysis (36 countries) is consistent with this prediction: outside-option quality explains 4.4 times more variance in religious retention than enforcement intensity.",

          "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly accelerating scientific production, from literature synthesis to automated analysis. Yet this expansion risks creating a verification gap, in which the volume of scientific claims outpaces the community's capacity to check their reproducibility. We argue that the same LLM capabilities driving scientific output can be redirected toward scalable verification. As a concrete example, we demonstrate how an autonomous LLM-based agent can reproduce the core statistical results of a classic sociology paper, while identifying underspecified methodological details. This means that automated replication does not adjudicate scientific truth, but it localizes discrepancies and documentation gaps, lowering the cost of computational reproducibility checks. Thereby, we propose embedding LLM-assisted replication across the research lifecycle, such as pre-submission quality check, journal-integrated verification, post-publication audits, and forensic reconstruction of legacy studies. To prevent misuse and preserve trust, we call for transparent standards and community governance. If institutionalized responsibly, AI can serve not only to generate science, but to scale its self-correction.",

While influential in monitoring performance, engagement, and compliance, these approaches provide limited insight into how responsibility for learning is structurally distributed through pedagogical design, as accountability is inferred primarily from learner behaviour rather than institutional design decisions. This study examines institutional design responsibility as a distinct evaluand within educational evaluation by developing and applying the 5C Rubric, an artefact-based framework for analysing how responsibility for learning is embedded in course design. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and Self-Regulated Learning, the rubric operationalises five interrelated design principles: Coherence, Cognitive Load, Competence, Completion, and Connection. Applied to a semester-long corpus of educator-generated course artefacts, the analysis identifies a recurring structural pattern in which alignment and mastery progression are consistently embedded, while accountability, reflective integration, and load-sensitive scaffolding remain unevenly institutionalised. The study contributes an artefact-based and ethically proportionate approach to evaluation and accountability in technology-enhanced higher education.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Espinosa-Uquillas; Matthew Kling; Meredith Niles",
          "abstract": "The heterogeneity of different farmland sizes has been overlooked in the climate adaptation literature, yet it is crucial for identifying effective policy interventions to achieve national-scale climate resilience. Using U.S. Agricultural Census data from 2012, 2017, and 2022 aggregated by farm size groupings within states, we compare the temporal changes in adoption of three water-related climate adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage, and irrigation) across small, medium and large farms, individually. Specifically, we provide estimates of the role of multiple government programs and climate changes in shaping heterogeneous climate adaptation behaviors across farm sizes. Applying multilevel models within a Bayesian framework, we show that temporal changes of government programs and climate conditions correlate with temporal changes in adoption differently across farm sizes. For small and medium farms, insurance participation associates positively with adoption of cover crops and irrigation. Among large farms, federal programs correlate negatively with irrigation, while state programs and insurance are positively associated with cover crops. These results suggest the opportunity to enhance cover crops among small and medium operations by improving the distribution of insurance and state programs, where small farms often have low participation. Alternatively, crop insurance, and not climate, might be the major driver of irrigation expansion among smaller farms as a way to increase productivity and reduce premium subsidies. Finally, small farms’ adoption of irrigation and tile drainage shows uncertain or negative correlations with changing and uncertain climate, implying that diseconomies of scale might be limiting their adoption; meanwhile, uncertainty of returns under climate changes is preventing farms of all sizes from growing cover crops, specifically in the West for large and medium farms, and the Eastern regions for small farms. We conclude that encouraging the adoption of water-related climate adaptation practices may require adjusting current federal and local programs toward individualized farm-size policies.",

          "authors": "Elizabeth Espinosa-Uquillas; Roderick M. Rejesus; Meredith Niles",
          "abstract": "Despite cover crops been widely promoted for their on and off-farm benefits, their adoption is both low nationally and diminishing in some areas. Existing research has examined a suite of factors affecting the adoption of cover crops in the United States, yet understanding the role of multiple government programs and climate changes has not been fully investigated over time, especially across a national sample. Furthermore, the factors associated with cover crop disadoption have not yet been explored nationally. To fill these gaps in the literature, we combine multiple publicly available data sources to estimate the role of multiple government programs (i.e., crop insurance, state, conservation and working-lands programs) and weather and climate change conditions on county cover crop adoption and disadoption. First, we find that increasing crop insurance participation is associated with increasing cover crop adoption nationally and in the Midwest and Northeast, while increasing insurance premium subsidies are correlated with reduced cover crop adoption in the Midwest and increasing in the Southwest. Second, working-lands payments (including EQIP, CSP and commodity) are highly correlated with cover crop adoption in every region except the Northwest, although exclusively during the 2012-2017 period, when EQIP aggressively expanded cost-sharing cover crops. Third, cover crops might have been implemented as a climate-resilience strategy although constrained by a region’s particular agricultural system. For instance, increasing temperature variability is correlated with higher cover crop adoption in the Western regions, while water deficits are associated with more cover crops in the Midwest but lower cover crops in the Southeast. Finally, we quantify that 31% and 41% of counties had decreasing level of cover crops in 2017 and 2022, respectively, implying potential adoption saturation and concentration in fewer counties. Regionally, the probability of cover crop disadoption increases with land-retirement payments in the Northwest, insurance participation in the Southeast, and insurance subsidies in the Midwest, while it decreases with working-lands payments in the Midwest. We conclude that production risks from cover crop adoption could be potentially alleviated with the expansion of federal cost-sharing programs and crop insurance participation; yet the amount of premium subsidies should be assessed as possibly disincentivizing cover crops in the Midwest due to moral hazard triggers and risk-management redundancies under both practices.",

Standard accounts predict that minority officeholders should transmit constituent preferences, which favor housing development, into policy. Using city-council election data for large U.S. cities (2010--2021) and a regression discontinuity design in close elections, I find that electing a minority councilmember increases total residential permitting by 21-33%, but almost entirely through single-family construction; multifamily permitting does not increase commensurately. Evidence from 60 semi-structured interviews identifies the mechanisms: minority officials prioritize homeownership as an equity strategy to close racial wealth gaps while expressing skepticism toward developer-led multifamily projects associated with displacement. Institutional norms of district deference give individual members near-unilateral authority over development, providing a pathway to policy influence that does not require a critical mass. The findings demonstrate that descriptive representation has substantive consequences for land-use policy, but that minority officeholders act on priorities rooted in their communities' experiences with exclusion rather than simply channeling the housing preferences expressed by minority voters in surveys.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates how different types of social interactions are reflected in the archaeological record, specifically analyzing the extent to which artifacts can serve as proxies for past human interactions. Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using graph correlation and the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP), the effects of model parameters on correlation strength were analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs), and underlying network structures were compared using Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.",

In this study, we contribute to the literature on disparities in MAR by providing a multi-stage analysis of social gradients in MAR across a period of almost two decades. Specifically, we depict trends in annual education and income gradients in the take-up of MAR treatment, the probability of a MAR treatment leading to a live birth, and prevalence of MAR involvement in births. We use Danish administrative data covering all births and MAR treatments among women aged 25–45 residing in Denmark from 2006–2023. We employ linear probability models (LPM), which are adjusted for age groups, partnership status and duration, and stratify them by parity, treatment type, and clinic type. We document persistent social gradients in all three stages of the MAR process across parity and treatment type, apart from ART treatment take-up, where the educational gradient was evident only for second and higher-order parities. Moreover, we show that the educational gradient in treatment success persists across clinic type.  The results were robust across alternative specifications: Using income as the SES measure, pooling treatments across types, excluding migrants, and estimating unadjusted models. Furthermore, the gradients persisted in the high income-low inequality and heavily subsidized context of Denmark.",

          "abstract": "En esta disertación nos proponemos examinar críticamente la evolución reciente de la medición de la práctica deportiva en España a partir del análisis comparado de las encuestas oficiales de hábitos deportivos desde 1975 hasta 2025. A tal efecto, se hallan e interpretan los escenarios y las disquisiciones acaecidas a partir de la de 2015, identificando la ruptura metodológica introducida en 2015, que trajo consigo una discontinuidad en la serie histórica que compromete la comparabilidad longitudinal y puede estar produciendo una sobreestimación de los niveles reales de práctica deportiva. A partir de la revisión de los instrumentos de medición, las categorías de frecuencia empleadas y la forma de presentar los resultados —especialmente en términos de minutos acumulados de actividad—, planteamos que parte del aumento informado en la práctica responde a cambios en la definición y operacionalización del fenómeno más que a las transformaciones sociales y económicas equivalentes. Para demostrar la hipótesis, comparamos estos resultados con otros indicadores estructurales del sistema deportivo español —empleo, gasto público, gasto de los hogares, tejido empresarial y licencias federativas— que no muestran expansiones acordes con el supuesto incremento abrupto de la práctica desde 2015. Asimismo, apoyándonos en la discusión con otros estudios secundarios, comparamos los resultados sobre esta variable en la Encuesta de Hábitos Deportivos con los de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud, evidenciando con ello las divergencias en la estimación del cumplimiento de las recomendaciones de actividad física de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Estas diferencias las identificamos como una disfunción que da cuenta del resultado de marcos conceptuales y metodológicos distintos más que como reflejo de una mejora homogénea del comportamiento deportivo de la población española en los periodos observados. Finalmente, subrayamos la necesidad de reforzar la dirección científico-técnica de estas operaciones estadísticas mediante la participación de los profesionales de las Ciencias de la Actividad Física y del Deporte, así como de orientar las políticas públicas en función de las cifras agregadas, así como de un análisis riguroso de la demanda de actividad física y de las barreras de acceso en los distintos grupos sociales, amén de la realización estudios ulteriores basados en la comparación de casos y el rastreo de procesos que pongan el acento en la combinación de los factores que explican la práctica deportiva.

The analysis relies on a regional panel dataset, which is somewhat unbalanced, with an extensive set of socio-institutional, crime, and subjective well-being variables, such as social participation, trust in people, trust in the judiciary, pickpocketing, fear of crime, life satisfaction, pessimism about the future, and dissatisfaction with the regional landscape. The analysis combines classical panel data methodologies with machine learning techniques to check the robustness of the results and to detect regional latent patterns. In all models, namely, fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel, and weighted least squares, it is confirmed that objective crime variables, as well as subjective ones, play a crucial role in determining PRC. In particular, it is confirmed that, among the variables, pickpocketing and fear of crime are the most important positive determinants of PRC, while trust in people and trust in the judiciary have a significant mitigating effect on PRC. Variables concerning pessimism about the future and environmental dissatisfaction are also confirmed to have a positive effect on PRC. Among several machine learning alternatives, the regularized linear regression model is selected as the best-performing predictive model, which provides an interpretable and accurate representation of the relationships between the variables. In addition, model-based clustering allows us to detect different regional profiles characterized by different combinations of crime, trust, well-being, and security perceptions. In conclusion, the results confirm that PRC in Italian regions depends on the complex interaction between actual crime, emotional reactions, trust, and quality of life, suggesting that effective policies to address PRC should be based on the integrated action of crime control strategies, trust-building, social cohesion, and quality of the regional landscape.",

          "authors": "Dayne Brenna Alexander; Christopher John Bryant; Abby Couture",
          "abstract": "While research examining trade-offs between farm animal welfare (FAW) and environmental sustainability in agricultural systems is increasing, there is limited understanding of consumer responses to these explicit trade-offs. The central aim of this study was to investigate the relative importance of farm animal welfare (FAW) and environmental sustainability in U.S. consumer purchasing decisions. We conducted a survey of 1,200 U.S. residents that combined attitudinal questions with a series of choice experiments involving egg purchasing scenarios. Participants chose between products with varying FAW, sustainability, and price attributes. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square, ANOVA, and ordinal logistic regression modelling, were used to evaluate preferences, associations, and willingness to pay. The findings consistently reveal that while consumers value both attributes, they prioritize FAW over sustainability in direct trade-offs, with a majority selecting higher-welfare eggs over more environmentally sustainable options. Moreover, our analysis revealed consistent attitudes across key demographic groups, finding no significant difference in the preference for FAW over sustainability across income groups, political parties, or regions of the country. While willingness to pay for these attributes showed no significant difference across income or region, it did vary significantly by political party, with right-wing respondents being less willing than left-wing respondents to pay a premium for higher FAW. However, a majority of even the most right-wing respondents chose to pay more for higher FAW. Despite some consumer ambivalence, our primary finding is that a majority of consumers are not willing to compromise on FAW for sustainability benefits.",

          "abstract": "Educational attainment is a critical social determinant of health, yet relatively little research has examined how long-run academic patterns at the school level evolve through periods of macro socioeconomic disruptions or shocks. This study investigates longitudinal academic trajectories among public high schools in Georgia across 17 years (2004-2020), spanning the Great Recession (GR), using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to identify patterns in ACT performance and college scholarship eligibility. We also estimated the joint evolution of these outcomes. Differences in trajectory shape indicated academic pathways diverged in heterogeneous ways during the GR era, rather than exhibiting a uniform response across schools and communities. These distinct sets of trajectories were strongly patterned by socioeconomic and racial school and neighborhood composition—with schools serving higher-income and majority-White populations more likely to sustain higher academic achievement and access to merit-based aid, while schools serving more economically disadvantaged and racially minoritized populations were more likely to experience persistently lower or declining trajectories. Dual-trajectory analyses further show strong conditional associations between academic performance and scholarship eligibility, such that schools with more favorable achievement trajectories also had substantially higher probabilities of sustained access to merit-based financial aid. These findings indicate that long-run academic trajectories are patterned by existing social and institutional inequalities, with disparities remaining evident during periods of macro socioeconomic disruption. By highlighting heterogeneity in schools’ academic pathways before, during, and after a major economic downturn, this study underscores the importance of approaches that capture such heterogeneity for appropriate educational equity and community health planning.\nKeywords: academic trajectories; social determinants of health; structural inequality; educational inequality; Great Recession; group-based trajectory modeling; public high schools",

          "abstract": "Selectivity is a key explanation for immigrant health advantage, yet evidence is often inferred from comparisons that bundle selection with post-migration processes and leave unspecified what is being selected. This study isolates educational selectivity by quantifying how predicted immigrant–native differences change when contextual attainment—immigrants’ education percentile within origin-country cohort-by-gender distributions—is introduced. Using pooled 2002–2018 National Health Interview Survey data linked to mortality follow-up through 2019, we examine mortality, smoking, and activity limitation among first-generation Asian and Latino adults from China, India, the Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. We benchmark immigrants against both native-born non-Hispanic Whites and U.S.-born coethnics and estimate gap compression on the outcome scale. Accounting for contextual attainment attenuates immigrant advantages across outcomes and origins, with larger and more consistent compression under coethnic than White benchmarks; attenuation also persists across duration-of-residence strata. In origin-specific analyses, contextual attainment eliminates the coethnic mortality gap for Chinese immigrants and shifts the coethnic gap toward an immigrant disadvantage for Cuban mortality and Dominican activity limitation. These findings show that origin-relative educational rank captures a measurable component of selectivity and that reference-group choice is consequential for interpreting immigrant–native disparities.",

          "abstract": "Half of the United States’ foreign-born population are renters, yet rental affordability is an understudied dimension of immigrant integration compared to homeownership and other housing outcomes. This is particularly important as immigrants enter an increasingly unaffordable rental market. This study presents the most comprehensive national profile of immigrant rental outcomes in the twenty-first century. By analyzing rental costs and rent burdens, while considering transitions into homeownership over time, this study directly examines the rental housing outcomes of immigrant renters. Overall, immigrants pay higher rents and have higher rent burdens compared to native-born households after controlling for location, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics. The immigrant-native gaps in rent, rent burden, and homeownership reduce over time spent in the U.S., suggesting adjustment to the housing market. New arrivals are most likely to be renters and have higher rents and rent burdens. Supplemental analyses further show the new immigrant housing disadvantage is driven in part by higher housing costs that all recent movers face. As a result, recent immigrants are doubly disadvantaged as a recent mover and as a new arrival to the country.",

          "abstract": "Scholarship on collective memory shows that war commemoration shapes political legitimacy, national identity, and moral authority. Yet most research analyzes commemorative narratives while paying limited attention to the events through which memory is enacted. We shift the focus to public war commemoration as an event-based practice that overlaps with contentious politics and social movements: commemorative gatherings are organized, recurrent, symbolically charged, and can function as state-led movements when used to advance government agendas. We ask: Why do autocratic states hold war commemoration events at higher rates in some localities than others? Drawing on scholarship on state-led movements and research on the political consequences of war, we develop two mechanisms. First, similar to other state-mobilized activities, commemorations depend on a regime’s social bases and organizational infrastructures and should be more frequent where such networks are stronger. Second, war studies show that war-affected communities—including veterans, martyrs’ families, and districts with high fatalities—remain politically consequential long after conflict, creating incentives for concentrated commemorative activity. We analyze Iran’s postwar mobilization following the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), a paradigmatic case of prolonged conflict and sustained state-led activism. Using original subnational data on commemoration events, mosque membership, wartime fatalities, and measures of veterans' and martyrs’ families, we test these mechanisms. Negative binomial models show that commemoration is significantly more frequent in districts with stronger conservative support, denser mosque networks, larger student populations, and higher concentrations of war-affected constituencies. These findings show how postwar states transform the residues of war into patterned, state-led mobilization across space.",

Through a comparative analysis of three revolutionary episodes in Iran (2017–2022), each with a distinct trigger, we demonstrate how different triggers shape patterns of contention. Using event-history and spatial regression analysis of subnational protest data alongside socioeconomic and political variables, we show that a fuel price hike activated grievances in oil-producing areas, while a repressive event targeting a woman from an ethnic and religious minority mobilized protests in minority-populated districts. Our findings illustrate how triggers structure revolutionary mobilization, offering broader insights into the interaction between structural conditions and contingent events in contentious politics.",

          "abstract": "Travel time prediction is central to transport geography and planning's accessibility analyses, sustainable transportation infrastructure provision, and active transportation interventions. However, calculating accurate travel times, especially for driving, requires either extensive technical capacity and bespoke data, or resources like the Google Maps API that quickly become prohibitively expensive to analyze thousands or millions of trips necessary for metropolitan-scale analyses. Such obstacles particularly challenge less-resourced researchers, practitioners, and community advocates. This article argues that a middle-ground is needed to provide reasonably accurate travel time predictions without extensive data or computing requirements. It introduces a free, open-source minimally-congested driving time prediction model with minimal cost, data, and computational requirements. It trains and tests this model using the Los Angeles, California urban area as a case study by calculating naïve travel times from open data then developing a random forest model to predict travel times as a function of those naïve times plus open data on turns and traffic controls. Validation shows that this interpretable machine learning method offers a superior middle-ground technique that balances reasonable accuracy with minimal resource requirements.",

These groups differed significantly across all psychological variables, while age and time in NEET status were not distinguishing factors. Gender, educational attainment, and involvement in the justice system emerged as key differentiating factors. \nConclusion: Findings support the view that NEETs are not a psychologically homogeneous group, highlighting the cumulative effects of disadvantage and the protective role of psychosocial resources. Unpacking this heterogeneity provides new insights for research and strengthens the design of more tailored, developmentally sensitive interventions and policies.",

In an emerging world of prediction markets, it is important to not only identify market inefficiencies but also to understand the underlying behavioral factors, as this phenomenon may be present in other liquid markets. Using 12 seasons of NBA betting data (2008–2020) with Elo-based benchmarks, this study found betting markets tend to overprice dynasty underdogs by a mean bias of +10.43 percentage points (p &lt; 0.0001), while non-dynasty underdogs show no statistically significant bias (+0.08pp, p = 0.82), confirming the effect is identity-specific rather than general model error. This mispricing yields a betting strategy with +15.81% gross ROI (62.9% win rate) and persists across the full 12-season sample despite high market liquidity. These findings show that bettors systematically overweight team reputation, creating mispricings that persist despite being exploitable.",

These environments shape dietary exposure at scale, yet the organizational and structural determinants of nutritional quality in institutional meal provision are often treated as operational details rather than researchable systems variables. Two such determinants—food literacy and menu design—are frequently discussed in consumer-facing nutrition education or behavioral terms, but they also operate upstream through workforce knowledge, procurement practices, production capacity, and governance decisions.\nThis paper develops a conceptual framework linking (1) organizational food literacy, (2) menu architecture, and (3) institutional constraints to nutritional quality in institutional food environments. Drawing on public health nutrition, food systems scholarship, organizational studies, and choice architecture research, the paper synthesizes existing evidence and proposes testable propositions for future empirical work. The framework emphasizes how organizational capacity, including training, standardization, and cross-functional coordination, mediates the translation of nutrition standards and policy goals into actual food offerings.\nRather than providing clinical guidance or individual behavior interventions, this work focuses on structural mechanisms that can be evaluated using institution-relevant outcomes such as standards adherence, nutrient-dense option frequency, procurement quality, participation, and plate-waste patterns. By positioning food literacy and menu design as system-level variables, the paper supports interdisciplinary research agendas and practical policy discussions aimed at improving the nutritional quality of meals served in institutional settings.",

          "authors": "Ana Cristancho; Ben Bradford; Krisztián Pósch",
          "abstract": "This article examines whether the militarisation of policing undermines states’ commitments to human rights, focusing on extrajudicial killings as a severe form of state-led violence. Although militarisation is frequently justified as a necessary response to crime threats that exceed conventional police capacities, its broader implications for democratic governance remain insufficiently examined. Drawing on theories of repression, environmental criminology, and Bourdieusian perspectives on police habitus, we argue that militarisation reshapes the organisational logics of coercive institutions by normalising power projection, intensifying threat perception, and weakening institutional and normative constraints on the use of lethal force.\nUsing Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) on a global country–year panel dataset, the analysis demonstrates that higher levels of militarisation are associated with increased rates of extrajudicial killings, even after controlling for governance capacity, economic conditions, and political violence. These findings suggest that militarisation constitutes a distinct dimension of state power, associated with weaker constraints on lethal force and with shifts away from legitimacy-based policing practices, potentially eroding due process and normalising the use of lethal force. The study advances debates on policing, state violence, and human rights by providing cross-national evidence of a structural relationship between militarisation and extrajudicial killings.",

          "abstract": "This article proposes 'the Dorian Grayisation of the Black body' as a framework for analysing how racism created the infrastructure enabling imperial violence at unprecedented scale and durability through spatial and corporeal distribution: inscribing violence on Black bodies and Black land whilst maintaining metropolitan narratives of civilisation.\nDrawing on Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray as a conceptual apparatus, I demonstrate that racism was not incidental to imperial violence but its operational foundation: permanent hereditary status, legal property designation, visible inherited marking, and moral justification that endured across centuries. African bodies and African land functioned as quarantined spaces where violence required for European and American 'civilisation' could be perfected, allowing metropolitan centres to maintain narratives of enlightenment, progress, and moral superiority.\nThrough historical analysis of concentration camps, medical experimentation, bureaucratic genocide, and surveillance systems, I show that techniques perfected on Black bodies through this spatial and corporeal distribution are eventually deployed more broadly. The framework demonstrates how racism created an infrastructure within which powerful men could operate without constraint, refining techniques across generations through normalised administrative practice. Once operational, this machinery proved transferable beyond initial racial boundaries.\nContemporary developments in the United States (2025-2026) provide empirical evidence that this containment mechanism is failing. The portrait splits, and violence previously confined through spatial and corporeal separation enters white metropolitan life. This framework contributes to necropolitics, critical race studies, and analyses of how power operates through the spatial and corporeal distribution of consequences, demonstrating how violence enabled by racism ultimately threatens the societies that created it.\nKeywords: spatial and corporeal distribution, necropolitics, racial capitalism, systemic violence, Dorian Gray, imperial violence, concentration camps, medical experimentation, surveillance, epistemological violence",

          "abstract": "Missing data arising from sweep non-response is a major challenge in longitudinal cohort studies, threatening statistical power and the validity of inferences. In the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), non-response has increased substantially from sweep 1 (9 months old) to sweep 7 (17 years old), underscoring the need for robust strategies to handle non-response. We applied a systematic, data-driven approach to identify predictors of non-response at each sweep of the MCS, drawing on all available survey data at the time of analysis. The strongest and most consistent predictor of non-response was prior sweep non-response. Additional robust predictors included lower parental occupational social class, parental non-participation in the latest general elections, parent not being in paid work, higher cohort member’s age and lower cognitive test scores. We then evaluated whether incorporating the identified predictors of non-response as auxiliary variables in multiple imputation (MI) or as covariates in inverse probability weighting (IPW) improved sample representativeness. Validation analyses, using both external benchmarks (2021 Census) and internal comparisons to known early-life distributions, showed that MI and IPW models including the identified predictors substantially reduced or eliminated bias in key variables such as housing tenure and parental social class. Our findings demonstrate that the use of systematically identified auxiliary variables can improve the validity of inferences drawn from the MCS. The resulting predictor set offers a practical resource for applied researchers using MCS data and provides a replicable framework for addressing sweep non-response in other longitudinal studies.",

          "abstract": "Hymenal-related distress—experienced as fear, pain, or avoidance of penetration—arises from both physical factors, such as anatomical variations, and psychological influences, including cultural beliefs, limited anatomical knowledge, and experiences of abuse. Hymenectomy, a straightforward outpatient procedure that removes or modifies hymenal tissue, is a well-supported treatment for structural hymenal problems, with literature primarily supporting its use in the relatively rare cases where the diagnostic presentation is clearly physical. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding how the procedure functions when the primary source of fear or phobia is psychological and the anatomy is normal. Recent conceptual work distinguishes fear-based penetration avoidance without pain—termed vaginal penetration phobia (VPP)—as a separate clinical phenomenon (Rabinowitz et al., 2017), further underscoring the need to examine psychological contributors to penetration distress. Using a biopsychosocial‑spiritual framework, this review underscores that no empirical studies have examined individuals’ awareness of hymenectomy, their anticipated or lived experiences of the procedure, or how it is positioned in relation to psychological distress and perceived normalcy with vaginal penetration.",

Shift-share instrumental variables analysis shows that 5 years after migration, women from non-restrictive communities gain decision-making power in savings by more than 20%, while those from restrictive communities show limited or negative effects. Staggered difference-in-differences event studies, which reflect the self-selective nature of migration, suggest that women from restrictive communities experience a short-term increase in decision-making 3~7 years after migration timing, while women from non-restrictive regions do not necessarily increase power, possibly due to high initial levels. These findings underscore the role of migration selectivity and gender norms in determining migration’s potential for female empowerment.",

One growing line of research examines how climatic and environmental exposures in early life affect later-life outcomes, which can occur through biological, developmental, and socioeconomic mechanisms. We contribute a historical perspective to this literature by leveraging unique, linked census data from early twentieth-century America (1900-1940). We match these data to historical temperature and precipitation estimates from the PRISM project at the county level. We then fit a series of regression models to measure the effects of exposures to temperature and precipitation anomalies in utero and during early childhood (i.e., the year before birth through age 5) on migration, marriage, labor force participation, and occupational prestige for men in early adulthood (i.e., ages 20 to 24). Our results show that temperature is positively associated with labor force participation and occupational prestige but negatively associated with the likelihood of marriage. Precipitation is positively associated with occupational prestige and negatively associated with marriage. Temperature and precipitation exposures are not significant predictors of migration prior to stratification. Additional models test for effect heterogeneity, revealing differences by region, farming status, and race. These findings underscore the complex and varied ways in which early-life climate exposures shaped socioeconomic trajectories in early twentieth-century America.",

          "abstract": "Objective: To examine how dual-income parents coordinate coparenting schedules, how couple-level work characteristics shape these patterns, and how they relate to shared and individual well-being.\nBackground: Drawing on structural symbolic interactionism and time-geographic perspectives, this study conceptualizes coparenting as a dyadic process in which role expectations are enacted within structurally constrained daily time. In this context, demanding work characteristics constitute a key structural constraint.\nMethod: Using nationally representative 2009, 2014, and 2019 Korean Time Use Survey data of 758 dual-earner parents, we identified dyadic coparenting schedules using multichannel sequence and cluster analyses. Multinomial logistic regression and dyadic structural equation models assessed how couple-level work characteristics (work schedule irregularity, commute timing, and work hours) predicted coparenting schedules and how these schedules related to shared and individual well-being.\nResults: Five coparenting schedules emerged: mother-centered care with morning–evening peaks (47%), evening shared care (24%), mother-centered all-day care (12%), father-centered evening care (10%), and transition to shared care (7%). Shared caregiving clusters were more likely when wives worked longer, more irregular, or later schedules than husbands. These clusters reported lower shared time pressure and higher shared life satisfaction, with fathers benefiting beyond shared effects.\nConclusion: Understanding work constraints requires a couple-level perspective that foregrounds gendered dynamics in how paid work and caregiving are coordinated. Workplace and policy interventions that address these gendered dynamics may more effectively support coparenting.",

At the same time, unemployment increases physical activity (β = 0.173; p &lt; 0.001) and physical activity positively affects health (β = 0.046; p &lt; 0.001). We also find a positive indirect effect (IE= 0.008; p &lt; 0.001) that partly counterbalances the negative unemployment effect—implying that the effect is 13 percent stronger net of physical activity. The indirect effects hold for all phases of unemployment. Physical activity suppresses part of the health deterioration associated with unemployment.

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake.\n\nMethods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours.\n\nResults: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits.\n\nConclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.",

We investigate whether the impact of job insecurity on health is influenced by the level of unemployment protection provided by the welfare state. We consider the 2005 German welfare reform as a natural experiment and use a difference-in-differences propensity score weighting estimator to analyse repeated large-scale cross-sectional surveys from 1999, 2006 and 2012. Job insecurity is a binary treatment indicator derived from the self-assessed risk of dismissal. Health is measured by the number of health complaints during or immediately after work. We find that the reform has led to a statistically significant increase in the negative impact of job insecurity on health. In addition to this short-term effect, a long-term effect of a similar magnitude was also observed. Furthermore, the effects of the reform are statistically insignificant for low- and high-income employees, but statistically significant for middle-income employees. For female employees, the effect is smaller but still statistically significant at the 5 % level, while it is stronger and also statistically significant for male employees.",

We iteratively refined PaFRIA through participatory engagement with deployers, affected end-users, and experts.

          "abstract": "Nonparametric propensity score methods are being used more frequently in social research to address misspecification bias in parametric methods such as linear regression. However, these methods can still be vulnerable to misspecification if the propensity score is estimated using parametric methods. Various methodological innovations have been developed to reduce or eliminate misspecification bias in propensity score methods; however, they are underused in sociological research. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of these innovations compared with that of standard methods. The results show that while some of the more recently developed extensions or alternatives to propensity score methods can substantially reduce misspecification bias, some are biased even in the absence of misspecification. In addition, most methods are subject to bias amplification due to \"hidden dual misspecification\", a problem previously overlooked in methodological research. Among the estimators evaluated, entropy balancing was the most successful in both eliminating regular misspecification bias and reducing bias amplification. The covariate balancing propensity score and augmented inverse probability weighting performed well. This study concludes that these estimators deserve more attention in applied social research.",

A tal efecto, se hallan e interpretan los escenarios y las disquisiciones acaecidas a partir de la de 2015, identificando la ruptura metodológica introducida en 2015, que trajo consigo una discontinuidad en la serie histórica que compromete la comparabilidad longitudinal y puede estar produciendo una sobreestimación de los niveles reales de práctica deportiva. A partir de la revisión de los instrumentos de medición, las categorías de frecuencia empleadas y la forma de presentar los resultados —especialmente en términos de minutos acumulados de actividad—, planteamos que parte del aumento informado en la práctica responde a cambios en la definición y operacionalización del fenómeno más que a las transformaciones sociales y económicas equivalentes. Para demostrar la hipótesis, comparamos estos resultados con otros indicadores estructurales del sistema deportivo español —empleo, gasto público, gasto de los hogares, tejido empresarial y licencias federativas— que no muestran expansiones acordes con el supuesto incremento abrupto de la práctica desde 2015. Asimismo, apoyándonos en la discusión con otros estudios secundarios, comparamos los resultados sobre esta variable en la Encuesta de Hábitos Deportivos con los de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud, evidenciando con ello las divergencias en la estimación del cumplimiento de las recomendaciones de actividad física de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Estas diferencias las identificamos como una disfunción que da cuenta del resultado de marcos conceptuales y metodológicos distintos más que como reflejo de una mejora homogénea del comportamiento deportivo de la población española en los periodos observados. Finalmente, subrayamos la necesidad de reforzar la dirección científico-técnica de estas operaciones estadísticas mediante la participación de los profesionales de las Ciencias de la Actividad Física y del Deporte, así como de orientar las políticas públicas en función de las cifras agregadas, así como de un análisis riguroso de la demanda de actividad física y de las barreras de acceso en los distintos grupos sociales, amén de la realización estudios ulteriores basados en la comparación de casos y el rastreo de procesos que pongan el acento en la combinación de los factores que explican la práctica deportiva.

This study examines gender disparities in social capital among job seekers using eighteen waves of the German Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) and a novel causal decomposition approach (Yu &amp; Elwert 2025). We distinguish between access to social capital (available network resources), activation (received job search resources), and returns (outcomes such as wages, job satisfaction, and job interviews). While women in the general population have more limited access to weak ties and high-status contacts, these differences narrow substantially among active job seekers. Consistent with this pattern, women and men receive similar levels of network-based job search support. Crucially, we find no evidence of a gender-specific returns deficit in wages or job satisfaction and only limited evidence for job interviews. Overall, the findings suggest that gender inequalities in job search outcomes are not primarily driven by differential access to, activation of, or returns from social capital.",

Using data from the Mexican Migration Project (2007–2019), we compare parents with migrant children to those whose children have not migrated across three health dimensions: chronic conditions, psychiatric problems, and self-rated health. Results show a consistent health penalty for parents with migrant children, especially with regard to mental health. Importantly, this negative association is moderated by factors such as socioeconomic status and community characteristics. Parents with limited economic resources and those from areas with a low US migration prevalence or urban areas are disproportionately affected by children’s migration. Remittances are not related to improved parental health. Overall, the findings underscore the emotional and health-related costs of migration borne by non-migrant family members.",

We combine annual GDP per capita data from the Maddison Project (1896–2022) with nearly 700,000 individual responses from Latinobarómetro and LAPOP (1995–2021) to construct life-course measures of positive and negative periods for respondents in 18 countries. Our identification strategy compares cohorts within country–year using models with country, survey-year, age, cohort, and survey fixed effects. Repeated positive macroeconomic periods systematically shift individuals toward the right on a left–right scale and improve subjective economic evaluations. In contrast, repeated negative periods do not produce a consistent leftward shift; instead, they increase economic insecurity, dissatisfaction with democratic performance, and anti-elite sentiment. Support for democracy as a principle remains stable. We confirm the generalizability of our main findings by replicating our analyses in 104 countries using the Integrated Values Survey (1980-2022).",

          "authors": "Helder Ferreira do Vale",
          "abstract": "This article develops a Crisis Cascade Framework to explain how sequential systemic shocks generate durable transformations in global governance. Conceptualizing global governance as a complex adaptive network, it theorizes crises as sequential mechanisms—rather than exogenous disruptions—that reconfigure institutional connections through three phases: trigger, framing struggle, and topological reconfiguration. The framework identifies four competing Governance Imperatives during crises—Efficiency, Security, Legitimacy, and Scientific Rationality— whose competitive prioritization shapes institutional responses. Drawing on the U.S. War on Terror, the Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis shows how security-driven pruning, institutional bypass, and crisis-induced fragmentation accumulate over time. These processes produce path-dependent erosion of coordination capacity despite growing institutional density. The article explains why contemporary global governance has become simultaneously more interconnected yet less governable: crisis cascades produce structural fragmentation rather than cyclical recovery, creating a 'topological trap' of stable fragmentation that undermines coordination capacity in an era of polycrisis.",

          "authors": "Ang Li",
          "abstract": "How does foreign direct investment (FDI) affect informal employment in the Global South? Existing scholarship has produced inconsistent findings, in part because it treats FDI as a homogeneous developmental input. We advance a “compositional framework” that links national labor market outcomes to distinct multinational corporate motivations: resource-seeking FDI creates enclave economies with limited local labor market integration; market-seeking FDI generates backward linkages that facilitate formalization; and efficiency-seeking FDI pursues labor cost arbitrage through flexible, informal employment arrangements. Using a novel dataset of 16 Latin American countries (2000-2018), we employ a relative-shift regression framework to isolate compositional effects from aggregate scale effects. Results reveal that, relative to market-seeking (service) investment, both resource-seeking (primary) and efficiency-seeking (manufacturing) FDI significantly increase informal employment, while aggregate net FDI inflows show no association with informality. These findings demonstrate that the structural composition of foreign capital, not merely its volume, shapes labor market stratification in the Global South.",

          "abstract": "Human choices are often both multi-dimensional and interactive. For example, a person deciding which of two immigrants is more worthy of admission to a country might weigh their education, and the weight placed on education may depend on other factors such as their age, country of origin, and employment history. We develop a response-adaptive experimental design that summarizes the range of effects of one attribute as a function of all other attributes. Our approach changes several aspects of the experimental design based on the ex ante choice to study the heterogeneous effects of one focal attribute (i.e., education). We update treatment assignment probabilities over the course of the experiment to search for the attribute vector at which the focal attribute has the most positive and most negative effects. By summarizing the full range of effects that exist, our approach complements existing approaches to conjoint experiments that typically aggregate over heterogeneity by marginalizing. We illustrate through two online experiments and provide customizable code infrastructure via a Docker container that other researchers can use to deploy adaptive randomization in online conjoint experiments.",

          "authors": "Aaron Helmbrecht",
          "abstract": "Truth is the first casualty of war.1 Russia has prioritized information warfare in its aggression toward Ukraine and the West, refining it for the digital age. The aim of information warfare is to manipulate an enemy’s psychic condition. Security analysts tend to apply semantics to the study of information warfare, attempting to combat lies with truth. Discourse analysts know that you’re supposed to fight manipulation with pragmatics. This makes discourse analysts uniquely qualified to combat the threat. This paper presents a pragmatic theoretical framework for discourse analysts to identify manipulation in political discourse as Russian information warfare. The framework is applied in a generic qualitative inquiry of current and historical political discourse. Results advance “false consciousness” as the most pragmatically plausible theory to widely discussed research questions about Trumpism and Russian influence in Western politics over alternative theories such as “nativism, authoritarianism and populism,” “ideological asymmetry,” and “lesser evilism.”",

This paper proposes that the greenium — the yield compression observed on green bonds relative to their conventional counterparts — is the monetised value of a diagnostic sign. Drawing on the mathematical semiotics of Kockelman (2025), I construct an ontology for the bond market in which the green label functions as a diagnostic instrument linking observable signs to hidden states of the world. The value of the labelling regime, 𝒱(S), measures the welfare gain an investor obtains from conditioning decisions on the label, relative to a world with no labels at all. This quantity depends on the reliability of the sign, the investor's prior uncertainty, and the stakes of misclassification; in the limit of pure greenwashing it collapses to zero. I then analyse the Deutsche Finanzagentur's twin bond concept as a natural semiotic experiment: by issuing matched pairs of securities identical in all financial dimensions, the twin architecture brackets the credit channel and isolates the greenium as a pure semiotic residual — the price of a posterior shift over what the bond funds, scaled by the investor's alignment preferences. The observed greenium is not a primitive market datum but a product of metapragmatic labour.",

Despite growing evidence, data on the feasibility of integrating PRS into routine hereditary breast cancer assessment remain scarce, particularly within European clinical pathways. Systematic evaluation of operational requirements, patient and provider acceptability, and organizational impact is essential prior to any broader implementation. This single-arm feasibility study will be conducted at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy) and is expected to enrol approximately 700 women attending the Medical Genetics Clinic. Eligible participants comprise: unaffected women with a documented family history of breast cancer or known pathogenic variants associated with hereditary breast cancer predisposition; women with unilateral breast cancer undergoing oncogenetic counseling for contralateral risk assessment. All participants will be offered testing for pathogenic variants in breast cancer predisposition genes and PRS, and integrated risk estimates will be generated using the CanRisk model. The primary outcome is the feasibility of implementing PRS within the clinical workflow, assessed through a validated questionnaire administered to participants and healthcare professionals. Secondary outcomes include PRS uptake, perceptions of the integrated pathway, impact on risk category reclassification, and qualitative insights into risk communication processes. This study will generate empirical evidence on the operational, organizational, and perceptual considerations associated with incorporating PRS-enhanced risk assessment into hereditary breast cancer services in Italy. By characterizing feasibility and acceptability, the findings will support the refinement of clinical pathways and inform the sustainable integration of PRS into routine preventive care.",

          "authors": "Torbjörn Rolandsson",
          "abstract": "While recent work has charted how journalistic values are inscribed into recommender systems, less is known about how such systems reshape news work after their implementation. Through an ethnography conducted at the Swedish public service broadcaster Sveriges Radio (SR) between 2018 and 2023, this paper examines how distinctiveness was operationalized through an algorithmic system for news distribution. The study shows how SR made their public service obligation to remain distinct and actionable through a classificatory schema for metadata annotation that prescribed the production of radio news intended to evoke a sense of radiophonic authenticity – sonic expressions conveying place-specificity and presence. Post-deployment, reporters oriented their work toward producing such authenticity through less deskbound reporting and creative sonic practices. The paper argues that the algorithmic system’s primary organizational effects did not stem from computational sorting, but from how its classifications valorized certain practices and embedded journalistic work in a feedback loop of data that facilitated continuous auditing and managerial interventions. These findings highlight the plasticity of public values in algorithmic environments and show how their production is accomplished through algorithms and people acting together, mediated by classificatory schemas that can substantially reorganize journalistic workflows.",

          "abstract": "This paper draws on ethnographic observations of Astrid, the Content Management Systems at the Swedish Public Broadcaster SVT, to examine how software design practices shape digital news work. Drawing on material-semiotic perspectives, the paper frames news workers as users, configured through design work. This dynamic unfolds through a process wherein designers draw on knowledge-generating techniques to generate insights about users, which produces an ideal imagined user, that designers subsequently tend to recreate by constraining the interpretive flexibility of an artefact. At SVT, the Astrid team was both agential in prescribing and defining desirable forms of work, while also acting as organizational intermediaries who translated several concerns into material design, which ultimately redrew the distribution of responsibilities and authority in SVT newsrooms. Journalistic work was collectivized through a co-writing feature, and editors' capacity to intervene in journalistic production processes was enhanced. The results reveal design as a practice that can reshape foundational aspects of news work by relying on understudied practices of knowledge production. The paper concludes by relating these insights to debates on AI in newsrooms, arguing that the relational framework of user configuration provides a useful lens for understanding power dynamics between designers, technological systems, and news workers.",

While the prevalence of miscarriage rates was similar across surveys, UKHLS systematically reported the lowest prevalence, while Next Steps recorded the highest. The prevalence of miscarriage substantially increased after age 34 in all surveys, however with disparities across surveys for pregnancies in the early 40s. \n\nConclusions: Overall, GB surveys provide miscarriage estimates consistent with previous clinical studies but with some heterogeneity across surveys. These differences can be attributed to incomplete collection of pregnancy histories and variation in the age and cohort composition of study populations. Researchers should pay careful attention to questionnaire design, and possible recall issues when using survey data for miscarriage research. Providing clear definitions of miscarriage may reduce heterogeneity in responses.",

Within this context, the human protagonist and the main narrator of the novel, Genly Ai, points out the complexities of Gethenian society. In this regard, Le Guin uses ambisexuality to underscore the implications of binary gender norms on society constructing a world excluding gender-based tension between men and women. According to that, The Left Hand of Darkness can be associated with almost all theories and assumptions in gender studies. Judith Butler’s idea of gender performance perfectly goes parallel with the criticizations of Le Guin. This article revolves around the diverse discrimination and inequalities between gender roles.",

Using linked geocoded US census records from 1880 to 1900/1910, we examine childhood outgroup exposure and subsequent marriage patterns for over 400,000 American, German and Irish men. To account for residential self-selection, we use machine-learning to identify “ethnic” neighborhoods and compare individuals living within the same residential contexts but having different next-door neighbors. In majority-minority dyads, outgroup exposure is consistently associated with a higher likelihood of marrying a member of that group, as well as a lower likelihood of ingroup marriage. The evidence is less robust for minority-minority dyads but nonetheless supports an overall pattern wherein childhood experiences can serve to erode ethnic group boundaries.",

          "abstract": "Background: Population health interventions may change physical, social or fiscal environments to shift health behaviours and often operate within a complex system of interacting factors. Systems methods are frequently suggested as a way to provide an overview of the interactions that determine behaviours or actions and may help to understand how or why interventions might (or might not) change health. However, there are few examples of how these methods have been used in empirical evaluations of public health interventions. \n\nMethods: We describe our application of a qualitative complex systems approach to evaluate a population health intervention: traffic restriction schemes, often referred to as School Streets, where motor vehicle access outside schools is restricted at pick-up and drop-off times. We intended to use systems methods across our evaluation; here we describe how we use these methods to build theory. Following the five-step approach outlined by Alvarado et al., (2023), we produced research propositions, systems archetypes and a causal loop diagram to understand the underlying system in which traffic restriction schemes are implemented and their potential impact on school-based active travel.\n\nResults: In bringing together diverse and multi-disciplinary evidence from different stakeholders we identified unanticipated systems interactions such as increased initial tensions and conflicts between users of different active travel modes (e.g. cyclists vs pedestrians). Using causal loop diagrams and systems archetypes, we developed research propositions focused on funding and implementation, safety, habit formation and the potential for unintended consequences. \n\nConclusions: Taking a complex systems approach has deepened our understanding of how traffic restriction schemes interact with their broader context and helped us develop a guiding theoretical framework for our ongoing evaluation. We intend this work to stimulate discussion, offer insights for future evaluations of population-level health interventions, and encourage public health researchers to adopt systems methods in their own evaluations.\n\nKey words: Complex systems approach, population health intervention, traffic restriction schemes, School Streets, Active travel, Causal loop diagrams, Systems archetypes, Qualitative systems methods, public health evaluation",

          "authors": "Oliver Maor",
          "abstract": "This exploratory study examines organized sexual events in Germany as structured leisure formats rather than as expressions of identity, morality, or relationship ideology. Using event descriptions, registration data, pricing information, and post-event participant comments published on a dominant German online platform, the analysis shifts attention from individual motivations to recurrent organizational configurations through which sexual practices are enabled. The dataset comprises 137 publicly advertised events conducted on three comparable Saturdays in late summer and fall 2025, enabling comparison with a prior 2023 sample. Quantitative analyses show that admission pricing, including gender-differentiated prices and age-related discounts, has no measurable effect on participant composition. Multivariate analyses identified four largely independent structural dimensions—demographic composition, participation structure, pricing relations by gender, and absolute pricing—and a three-cluster typology distinguishing large party-oriented events, couple-centered standard formats, and niche events with a large surplus of men. No evidence of a stable participant cohort across years is found. Qualitative analyses of event descriptions and participant comments indicate that sexuality is treated as a situational and pragmatic practice. Evaluations of events in the participants’ comments focus primarily on organizational coherence, spatial layout, music, catering, and staff performance. Sexual encounters are mentioned selectively, mainly where organizers explicitly curate sexual practices as part of the event design. Overall, the findings suggest that organized sexual events operate as bounded social settings in which the event format defines the purpose of participation, allowing sexuality to be enacted as a routinized form of leisure activity embedded in the spatial and service setting.",

          "abstract": "Background: Active travel to and from schools offers important health and environmental benefits, yet car use remains dominant, contributing to congestion, pollution and safety risks. Schemes to restrict private motor vehicles are increasingly being implemented around schools to address these issues, but evidence on how they might work to impact the school journey across different contexts is limited.\n\nAims and Objectives: To explore the mechanisms through which schemes might influence school travel behaviour and how the impacts vary across different contexts.\nMethods In-person walk-along and online interviews were conducted with 24 families, five teachers and four local authority representatives across three regions (Perth and Kinross, Haringey and Sheffield) across the United Kingdom between September 2024 and April 2025. Ethnographic observations were also carried out. Transcripts were analysed drawing on Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, guided by realist evaluation principles and ethnographic observations to identify contexts, mechanisms and outcomes using NVivo.\n\nResults: Common context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified reflecting congruent narratives across participants. For example, In contexts where families previously relied on driving for the school journey (Context), increased inconvenience functioned as a mechanism (Mechanism), encouraging a shift towards hybrid journeys and or a full shift to active travel (Outcome). CMOs were broadly captured by two themes: i) considering change and adapting routines: how families responded to schemes, and ii) navigating challenges and building momentum: how schemes evolved in practice. Participants highlighted the potential for schemes to promote active travel to school, improving experiences of the journey and their health, while also noting unintended consequences such as displaced traffic, pushback from some community members and challenges for families with specific access needs. These experiences showed how supportive infrastructure, meaningful consultation and framing around children’s health and safety shape the impact and acceptability of the schemes.\n\nConclusion: The capacity for schemes to promote healthier and more sustainable school travel, while also generating unintended consequences, suggests that effective implementation requires supportive infrastructure, sustained community engagement and alignment with broader policy priorities.\n\nKeywords: active travel; school journey; traffic restriction schemes; school streets; qualitative research; public health",

          "authors": "Antje Wegner",
          "abstract": "This article presents an empirically based typology of researchers’ rationales for choosing a mobility destination and challenges the commonly held assumption that research conditions the primary decision-making criterion. Theoretically informed by a structuration approach, I reconstruct (1) how researchers reflexively monitor, rationalise, and motivate their mobility actions and (2) how these processes relate to contextual settings in terms of individual life course and career perspectives and macro-level factors, e.g. such as the funding and scholarship landscape or unfavourable conditions in source countries. The analysis draws on 16 qualitative interviews and survey data from 1,532 foreign-educated post-doctoral researchers at German Higher Education Institutions. Based on a triangulation approach, I identify five distinct mobility rationales: ‘Consciously focused’, ‘Exiles’, ‘Sojourners’, ‘Opportunity oriented’ and ‘Familistic established’. The typology serves as a heuristic for science and higher education policymakers to design target-group specific measures for attracting researchers and fostering mobility.",

          "abstract": "Play is one of the inherent rights of children across the world. Play positively contributes to all aspects of a child’s development and brings a deep sense of connectedness and wellbeing for the child and their family. Australia has long recognized the importance of inclusion through foundational policies such as the Disability Discrimination Act (1992) and the National Disability Strategy (2010–2020). However, while the legislative intent is clear, significant gaps remain in translating these ambitions into tangible, accessible environments for children with disabilities. Although some advances have been made to address the physical barriers to play, the same progress has not been seen in purposeful design to include people with blindness and low vision (BLV) and their families. This research project aims to understand what is currently happening around the world in this area, to determine how increased inclusion and accessibility could enhance the lives of children with BLV. This paper provides an overview of an Australian project that is exploring how access to playgrounds can be improved for children with BLV by learning about playgrounds through audits and the user experience.",

          "authors": "Varun Karekurve-Ramachandra",
          "abstract": "This chapter traces the evolution and persistence of electoral gender quotas, focusing on India's transformation from categorical rejection to constitutional mandate. Early women's movements opposed reservations, viewing them as incompatible with formal equality and too closely associated with caste-based reservation policies. Drawing on constitutional debates, government records, and other primary sources, I show that quota adoption required the intersection of egalitarian pressure and strategic elite incentives. The chapter then addresses persistence and three reasons why quotas are rarely withdrawn despite being designed as temporary measures. First, quotas fail to eliminate root causes of discrimination; Second, attitudinal change requires longer time horizons than anticipated; and Third, implementation creates new political constituencies that render withdrawal costly. India's trajectory -- comprising women's mobilization, political upheaval, and expanding caste-based reservations -- culminated in the 1992 local quota laws. With nearly three decades of implementation easing the entry of approximately 700 million women into local political office, India provides a model case for understanding gender quotas and their consequences for women's descriptive and substantive representation.",

          "authors": "Mitch Browne; Michael Proctor; Mark Harvey; Jane Simpson; Robert Mailhammer; Harriet Carpenter; Naijing Liu",
          "abstract": "A minority of Australian languages contrast stops at the same place of articulation – oppositions described in a variety of ways: e.g. fortis vs lenis, geminate vs singleton – but not well understood due to a lack of instrumental data. To shed more light on these contrasts, acoustic phonetic properties of stops were analyzed in medial pre-vocalic environments in Kamu, Larrakia, Warlmanpa, and Warumungu. In all four languages, stops at the same place of articulation are differentiated primarily by duration, and also degree of voicing estimated using Harmonic Ratios. There is a degree of correlation between voicing and duration, but duration is found to be the property that most consistently differentiates stop modes. These data suggest that the opposition in these languages is best characterised as a length contrast, and that these stop oppositions are realized with complex interactions between duration and voicing.",

          "authors": "Alejandro Sarria-Morales",
          "abstract": "As political landscapes become more inclusive, long-established stigmatization dynamics based on hierarchical power structures evolve. This study examines how language related to disgust is used in the Colombian Senate following the 2022 presidential elections, a period marked by increased representation of traditionally marginalized groups within the legislative context. Disgust-related language, typically weaponized by elites against historically stigmatized outgroups in asymmetrical power scenarios, takes on new implications in this setting. Using word  embeddings to analyze semantic associations, I identify political minorities within the government coalition as emerging “disgust-relevant” groups. These findings challenge traditional expectations by revealing that disgust-related language can extend beyond social stigmatization to target individuals who embody multiple dimensions of ideological opposition. Notably, the analysis suggests that disgust relevancy compounds across intersecting identities, with female senators affiliated with left-leaning ideologies exhibiting a higher likelihood of being verbally and semantically linked to disgust. Additionally, this methodological approach offers a framework for detecting language-based violence in political\ntext, highlighting its relevance for protecting democratic discourse.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to analyze the representation of six learning approaches (pedagogy, andragogi, heutagogi, peeragogy, geragogy, and cybergogy) on popular content on the popular content of the guru-influencer account @guru.berbagi.ilmu on Instagram. This account is an elementary school teacher's account in Jakarta, Indonesia, with 111,000 followers by 2024. The research method uses qualitative content analysis with directed content analysis techniques, where the analysis category comes directly from six theoretical concepts. The three uploads with the highest engagement in 2024 are analyzed. The results of the study show that the six approaches do not appear in a balanced manner. Andragogy and cybergogy appear consistently in all uploads, while peeragogy appears on two uploads. Pedagogy, heutagogi, and geragogy are not indicated. This research is the first research in Indonesia to apply the six-gogy framework in reading teachergram content. This finding also has policy implications, that platform-based teacher training has the potential to be developed through the use of teacher-influencer content. Instagram in this context serves as a knowledge intermediary platform that facilitates the production, exchange, and legitimacy of teachers' professional knowledge outside of formal institutions.",

          "abstract": "This article introduces a computer-vision pipeline designed to support feminist qualitative analysis of image-based hate speech against women in public Telegram channels. Using data collected between January and December 2024, the study responds to persistent challenges in feminist media research on online misogyny, particularly the scale of visual data, the multimodality of online interactions, and the limited accessibility of computational tools. We processed and clustered 2,122 images from a single public Telegram channel to identify recurring visual and narrative patterns associated with online misogyny. Rather than treating automation as a substitute for interpretation, clustering is mobilized as a dimensionality-reduction strategy that enables exploratory engagement with large visual corpora while preserving feminist commitments to contextualization, reflexivity, and power-sensitive analysis. The analysis reveals dominant patterns such as screenshots from other platforms, manipulated images, memes, cartoons, and gamified representations that sexualize, ridicule, and surveil women. These visual patterns operate within a broader multiplatform ecosystem in which women’s digital traces are captured, decontextualized, and re-presented as evidentiary material for misogynistic claims. The findings show that online misogyny is structured through intersectional systems of gender, race, age, and embodiment, contributing to the normalization of symbolic violence in low-moderation digital environments.",

          "abstract": "Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) are increasingly used by diverse countries to support large-scale economic development. However, limited evidence exists regarding their national effects. I investigate SWF effects on GDP per capita ($ US 2024) and domestic savings share of GDP in Norway and Singapore, the two open economies with the largest SWFs, and Australia, a negative control unit with a much smaller SWF. The analysis estimates that Norway’s Government Pension Fund SWF added $816,089 per capita over the analysis period ($28,141/Year) to resource-rent pruned GDP per capita and 9.69% to domestic saving share of GDP (1995-2023). Singapore’s Temasek global SWF investments added $472,605 per capita over the analysis period ($22,505/Year) and 14.42% to domestic savings share of GDP (2003-2023). As expected, Australia’s smaller SWF had no significant effect on GDP. These synthetic control analysis estimates are robust to in-place and time placebos and negative control outcomes. The findings indicate that robust mandatory SWF-steered savings in open economies can accelerate economic growth beyond standard Solow model steady state equilibrium by adding a non-depreciating compound growth function to domestic investment.",

          "authors": "David Broockman; Christopher S. Elmendorf; Joshua Kalla",
          "abstract": "Voter opposition to dense housing development contributes to America’s housing shortage. Prevailing explanations emphasize homeowner self-interest and “NIMBYism.” We argue that sociotropic aesthetic judgments powerfully shape housing policy preferences. First, as motivation, we show that homeowners in already-dense areas largely support dense development in their neighborhoods, contrary to prevailing theoretical predictions, and that their distinctive aesthetic tastes likely contribute. Second, our evidence suggests that many voters oppose development due to sociotropic aesthetic concerns: for example, most voters think dense development doesn’t aesthetically “fit” in less-dense neighborhoods, even other than their own; likewise, people in dense neighborhoods are more supportive of dense development on their own block than in low-density neighborhoods. Finally, descriptively and with experiments, we show that aesthetic concerns are widespread, not pretextual, and causally affect support for development. Our findings offer a new lens for understanding housing policy preferences and suggest novel solutions for addressing America’s housing shortage.",
