          "authors": "Lotte Pummerer; Francesca Prati; Sven Michael Kasser; Nadira Sophie Faber",
          "abstract": "Humans like prosocial others who invest in the greater good, who decrease inequality and increase overall welfare. But to what degree do people endorse such prosocial others when their acts for the greater good puts a risk to their own position? We modelled this question in a triadic social dilemma paradigm where a decision-maker’s prosocial act towards one party entailed risk for another. In five pre-registered, incentivised behavioural experiments (total N=3,700, US and British samples), we measured judgemental and behavioural endorsement of others who invested in the greater good (i.e., decreased inequality, increased overall welfare) while putting participants under (financial) risk. We found that 1) endorsements were lower when investing in the greater good entailed risk for participants, 2) participants were sensitive to degrees of risk, and 3) anchored endorsement in their personal outcomes rather than general principles. At the same time, however, participants 4) endorsed others who invested in the greater good more compared to those keeping the (participant benefitting) status quo. And 5) existing impressions of others improved after investing towards the greater good, even at medium risk. Hence, even though people are sensitive to risk to their own outcomes, they endorse others who work towards collective welfare and reduce inequality – even at their own costs.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: Social media use has become a ubiquitous part of our lives, but it is increasingly linked to a number of mental health issues. Given the growing incidence of mental illness globally, it is crucial that the relationship between social media use and mental health be further investigated and mitigation strategies developed. \nMethods: A co-designed survey investigating mental health, social media use characteristics and impacts, and suggestions for digital strategies to improve mental wellbeing, was disseminated online via the Lived Experience Australia national ‘friends’ network.  \nResults: Findings revealed associations between all forms of social media use, fear of missing out, and social media addiction were significantly positively associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Participants reported perceived negative impacts of social media on mental health, specifically associated with social comparisons, doomscrolling, time wasting, and negative interactions. Connection to friends, family, and other support networks was reported as an important benefit of social media.  \nConclusion: The findings indicate a clear association between social media use and mental ill-health, an effect acknowledged by users themselves. Importantly, the nature of this impact is contingent on patterns of engagement, underscoring that usage context is a critical determinant of outcomes. These results highlight the need for further investigation into how specific modes of social media use shape mental health trajectories, with implications for both research and intervention design.",

          "abstract": "Gaining something of value often depends on decisions about how much effort to invest for potential rewards. Although perceptions of one’s financial state—whether affluent or scarce—are thought to be closely linked to such decisions, direct experimental evidence has been limited. Here, we tested whether feeling financially affluent is associated with a greater willingness to exert effort in pursuit of larger rewards. Using an effort-based decision-making task, participants repeatedly chose between solving easy, low-reward problems and difficult, high-reward problems. Individuals who perceived themselves as more financially affluent were more likely to select the difficult, high-reward option. This pattern held across different task domains and remained significant after controlling for demographic and psychological covariates. Moreover, participants with greater perceived affluence reported lower performance-related anxiety, which partially mediated their preference for high-effort choices. These findings reveal a robust link between perceived financial affluence and the tendency to invest more effort in rewarding outcomes, suggesting a psychological mechanism that may help explain the self-reinforcing cycle of wealth and achievement.",

          "authors": "Kyle Fiore Law; Christina Jinhee Capozzoli; Liane Young; Stylianos Syropoulos",
          "abstract": "How do people sustain concern for future generations when thinking about existential threats that will face those to come? Across two longitudinal studies spanning 12 months, we examine the stability and behavioral relevance of “intergenerational futures thinking,” a constellation of psychological constructs theorized to motivate long-term prosocial action: intergenerational concern (IGC), impartial intergenerational beneficence (IIB), obligation to future generations, moral concern, and legacy motivation. Supporting their theorized but underexplored role as durable dispositions, all constructs show high temporal stability. And, although based on reported real-world behavior over the course of the year, IGC predicts greater future-oriented collective action but not general charitable giving. Moral concern and legacy motivation, in contrast, predict both charitable giving and collective action, while obligation predicts collective action only. Because reported donations were general rather than future-targeted, this design allowed us to test which intergenerational traits spill over into broader prosociality, speaking to ongoing debates about whether prioritizing future generations reduces concern for the present. Relatedly, we find that IIB, which captures sustained regard for future people regardless of their temporal distance, associates with greater moral concern for present-day outgroups and nature. This suggests that concern for the future and present can coexist, aligning with a theorized view of a “moral circle” that expands increasingly outward from the self. Finally, while showing trait-like stability, IGC also exhibits reciprocal relationships with both obligation and moral concern, suggesting that components of intergenerational futures thinking may mutually reinforce one another to sustain long-term ethical engagement.",

          "authors": "Stan de Visser; Sarah-Jayne Blakemore; Antonia Hamilton; Sara De Felice",
          "abstract": "Social interaction plays a key role in human learning.  De Felice et al. [1] showed that learning during a contingent (live) video call outperforms learning from a pre-recorded video of the same session. However, contingent exchanges – when people are part of a live social context – can vary widely in how interactive they are, that is, in the extent to which interlocutors provide mutual, moment-to-moment feedback. In this preregistered study, we performed a post-hoc analysis of De Felice et al. [1]’s dataset and asked whether the learning benefit is driven by the degree of interactivity between learner and teacher. Interactivity was quantified through behavioural annotation of video calls (n = 49) using an annotation scheme developed for this study. The interactivity score reflected a multimodal dyadic measure of teacher-learner verbal grounding (utterances reflecting understanding), non-verbal grounding (nodding and smiling) and questions. Linear mixed-effects models revealed no relationship between interactivity and performance, suggesting that interactivity may not be necessary to drive the social learning advantage. Learning with others may be beneficial because individuals can interact. The potential to interact may prompt cognitive processes specific to live exchanges, such as mutual prediction, that support learning, even if little interaction actually takes place.",

          "authors": "Yasamin Rahmati; Imogen van Jaarsveldt; Christopher Jarrold",
          "abstract": "Abstract\nThe current study examined regulatory control across autism, Down syndrome, and Williams syndrome. A bespoke 84-item parent-report questionnaire was developed, integrating effortful control and executive function across cognitive, emotional, and social domains—and extended with sensory regulation as a fourth domain. Parents of children aged 5–13 with these conditions and neurotypical peers participated (N = 233). Factor analyses showed different structures depending on data source: a three-factor model (Responsive/Reactive, Sensory Regulation, Proactivity/Initiation) in neurotypical parent data, and a six-factor model distinguishing cognitive, emotional, social and proactive regulation, plus sensory seeking and sensory avoidance in neurodiverse groups. Bayesian analysis of the three-factor model showed neurodiverse groups differed from neurotypical children on each factor. In the six-factor model, neurodiverse groups scored lower on sensory seeking and emotional, cognitive, and proactive regulation. For social regulation, only autistic children differed meaningfully from neurotypical children, while on sensory avoidance, children with Down syndrome did not. Cluster analyses indicated grouping by regulatory profiles rather than diagnoses, supporting a transdiagnostic view. These findings highlight both shared and condition-specific challenges, suggesting that diagnosis provides an initial guide to regulatory profile but should be supplemented by a needs-based assessment to better inform personalized intervention.",

          "abstract": "Self-report and behavioral task data have demonstrated alterations in decision-making performance in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) relative to non-psychiatric controls (NPCs). However, little work has characterized the phenomenology of cognitive decision styles. Accordingly, we used the Decision Styles Questionnaire (DSQ; Leykin &amp; DeRubeis, 2010) to compare decision styles in 30 people with OCD and 30 NPCs. We then examined the relationship between decision styles and OCD symptom severity as well as decision-making in the context of two behavioral decision-making tasks–the Beads Task and the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Compared to the NPC group, people with OCD reported more anxiety around decision-making, greater avoidance of decisions, a greater tendency to brood over decisions, more dependence on others and less use of intuition when making decisions, and less confidence in themselves as decision-makers. Greater self-reported anxiety, avoidance, and brooding around decision-making were significantly related to elevated OCD symptom severity, although only the anxious style survived correction for multiple comparisons. Self-reported anxious and respected decision styles were associated with increased risk-aversion and risk-taking on the BART, respectively, although neither relationship survived correction. Higher self-reported decisional anxiety, avoidance, brooding, dependence, and lower confidence were related to greater self-reported distress during the Beads Task, with all relationships aside from self-reported dependence surviving correction. Future work should continue to test how self-reported decision styles relate to decision-making in naturalistic settings and explore whether decision styles may serve as a novel target for intervention.",

          "abstract": "Badassness is attributed to radically different kinds of people, from peaceful advocates to fierce warriors. In four experiments (total N = 2,020), we investigated this conceptual puzzle by applying a theoretical framework according to which certain “dual-character” concepts have two different sets of criteria: one superficial and concrete, the other deeper and abstract. Study 1 found that badass is such a dual-character concept. Study 2 found that people attribute badassness on the basis of both “outer” and “inner” forms of toughness. For instance, warriors might be considered badass because of their outer toughness, whereas peaceful advocates might be considered badass because of their inner toughness. Studies 3-4 explored qualities that constitute inner toughness, revealing effects of overcoming social pressure, acting morally, pursuing difficult challenges, and succeeding in one’s efforts. In addition to clarifying this specific concept, the findings contribute to broader discussions about dual-character concepts and the roles that they play in social cognition.",

          "authors": "Fatih Serin; Benedikt Zoefel; Matthew H. Davis; Richard Henson",
          "abstract": "Episodic memory formation requires integrating multisensory information. Inspired by animal research on how hippocampal theta oscillations modulate long-term potentiation, recent human studies have demonstrated that memory for auditory and visual stimuli modulated synchronously at theta frequency (4 Hz) is better than when those stimuli are modulated asynchronously; the so-called Theta-Induced Memory Enhancement (TIME) effect. However, recent failures to replicate the TIME effect question its robustness and dependence on other variables. One such variable may be inter-individual differences in neural sensitivity to the precise phase lag between auditory and visual streams. In this online study, we therefore test a wider range of phase lags between 4 Hz modulated audio and visual stimuli to test whether the TIME effect shows a different optimal phase lag in each participant. Using simulation methods from Zoefel et al. (2019), we estimated the sample size to achieve 90% statistical power to detect a participant-dependent effect of phase lag. Finding such an effect would provide further support for the role of theta oscillations in associative memory in humans, and could potentially inform future experimental designs to investigate this further.",

          "abstract": "While the Big Five Inventory-2 offers efficient assessment of personality domains and facets, continuous psychometric evaluation remains crucial to ensure valid personality assessment. The present study examined whether the dimensional structure and measurement properties of the German BFI-2 remain invariant across offline and online contexts and methods (self- and other-ratings). Data from 403 self-raters and 151 informants were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory structural equation modeling, and measurement invariance testing. Reliability was generally good, and the Big Five structure was largely replicated, though several items showed context- or method-specific deviations, particularly within Agreeableness and Negative Emotionality. Partial scalar invariance was achieved at facet level, although model fit was poor for other-ratings, while only metric invariance emerged at domain level. Exploratory analyses revealed that correlations between self-ratings across contexts were highest, and that self-other agreement was stronger online than offline. Regression models predicting internet use showed that traits often exhibited opposite effects across contexts, with online traits explaining incremental variance, although overall explained variance was small. Findings highlight that both context and method affect the properties of the BFI-2, underscoring the importance of psychometric evaluation across diverse conditions.",

          "authors": "Sonja Grelle; Wilhelm Hofmann",
          "abstract": "Systemic climate policies are essential for addressing environmental crises, but often face public resistance due to their intrusiveness. Drawing on the Integrative Public Policy Acceptance (IPAC) framework, we examine how the Desire for Governmental Intervention (DGI) shapes climate policy acceptance as a function of regulatory depth. Across two online studies (NStudy1 = 565, Nobs = 11,300; NStudy2 = 971, Nobs = 11,652), participants evaluated climate policies across multiple environmental domains. As expected, higher regulatory depth reduced policy acceptance, while higher DGI increased it. Crucially, DGI buffered the negative effect of intrusiveness: individuals with a strong DGI were more likely to accept even highly intrusive measures such as taxes or bans. This buffering effect was consistently observed, with the evidence strongest at the between-person level. These findings highlight DGI as a key motivational factor for climate policy acceptance. Strengthening this desire may be crucial for increasing public support for ambitious yet necessary systemic climate interventions.",

          "authors": "Shir Sivroni",
          "abstract": "erceptual decisions arise from neural activity distributed across multiple brain regions, yet it remains unclear how inter-area interactions and local population activity differentially contribute to choice across time. Here, we analyzed simultaneous multi-region Neuropixels recordings from the Steinmetz et al. (2019) dataset to compare the predictive power of cross-area correlations versus local firing rates for behavioral choice in mice performing a visual discrimination task. We found a striking temporal dissociation: during the pre-stimulus period, both inter-area correlations and local activity predicted choice at modest but significant levels (~54%, p &lt; 0.001), with no difference between signal types. In contrast, during the post-stimulus period, local population activity dramatically outperformed inter-area correlations (64.5% vs. 57.2%, p &lt; 0.0001), rising to 69% accuracy by 250-500 ms post-stimulus. This temporal switch—from symmetric contribution before stimulus onset to local dominance afterward—demonstrates that the neural basis of perceptual choice shifts from distributed network states to localized evidence coding as sensory information becomes available. Our findings provide direct quantitative evidence for a dual-mechanism model of perceptual decision-making in which pre-stimulus inter-area dynamics set the stage for post-stimulus local computation.",

          "abstract": "Short-form video platforms like TikTok play a central role in adolescents’ lives, yet little is known about the actual content they engage with. This study presents a large-scale, computational approach to analyze adolescents’ TikTok feeds using hashtag-based topic modeling applied to user-donated archives from 102 Dutch adolescents (ages 15–19). Using BERTopic, we identified 304 coherent topics, organized them into 32 higher-order content categories, and validated both through a structured human validation study. Analyses reveal that adolescents’ feeds are dominated by entertainment and leisure content, with ‘Media productions,’ ‘Sports,’ ‘Style and appearance,’ ‘Hobbies,’ and ‘Gaming’ as the most prevalent categories. At the same time, there is marked individual variation: niche areas such as K-pop, anime, and specific fandoms are central to some users’ feeds. Latent profile analysis identified six distinct, gendered content-consumption profiles. Together, the findings shed light on adolescents’ TikTok exposure, revealing predominantly benign but highly personalized media diets in which appearance-focused content stands out as a potential risk domain. In all, our approach offers a scalable, efficient way to map short-form video content. Linking these maps to individual users’ media diets opens new possibilities for examining how different content patterns relate to user experiences and outcomes.",

          "abstract": "Standard formulations of the free-energy principle treat adaptive agents as pure surprise minimisers, but in non-stationary niches this can drive brittle, energetically costly behaviour. This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation.\n\nKeywords: free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience",

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) serves as a critical statistical methodology for identifying latent dimensions. Accurately determining the number of factors constitutes a pivotal technical challenge in EFA; under- or over-extraction of factors invariably yields detrimental consequences. To address this challenge, the present study conceptualizes eigenvalues as sequential data and employs a deep neural network architecture based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Comprehensive evaluation metrics (including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Kappa) all exceeded 83%. Rigorous validation through extensive simulation studies and empirical analyses confirmed the robust performance of LSTM across diverse data conditions. Results demonstrate that LSTM achieves substantially higher accuracy than Comparison Data Fit (CDF), Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC), and Parallel Analysis (PA) methods, with a mean improvement rate of 48.50% and a peak improvement of 171.09%. Furthermore, LSTM exhibits smaller bias and superior robustness relative to CDF, EKC, and PA. Researchers may utilize the R package LSTMfactors to apply the LSTM model trained in this study to empirical data analysis.",

          "abstract": "Bayesian models of the mind suggest that we estimate the reliability or ‘precision’ of incoming signals to guide perceptual inference and to construct feelings of uncertainty about our percepts. However, accurately estimating precision is likely to be challenging for bounded systems like the brain. One way observers could overcome this challenge is to form expectations about perceptual precision and use these to guide awareness. Previously, we found that agents were able to acquire and use probabilistic expectations about the strength of visual signals – with expectations altering their confidence and subjective awareness without altering perceptual performance. Here we test whether the same principles hold in the domain of auditory speech perception. Participants made perceptual decisions about the clarity of different speech sounds, which they could expect to be clear or ambiguous. We found that these expectations biased subjective clarity ratings – such that listeners judged speech as clearer when clearer signals were expected. Computational modelling revealed that this effect could be well-explained by a predictive learning model that infers the precision (strength) of current signals as a weighted-combination of incoming evidence and top-down expectations. These results support an influential tenet of Bayesian models of cognition: agents do not only ‘read out’ the reliability of information arriving at their senses but also take into account prior knowledge about how reliable or ‘precise’ different sources of information are likely to be. We thus reveal that expectations about precision influence subjective impressions across sensory domains, pointing to a general principle that can explain how we come to trust or doubt our senses.",

          "abstract": "Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain frequently co-occur. Growing evidence suggests that this comorbidity may be partly attributable to pain-intrusions, defined as chronic pain manifesting in the same body regions as the pain experienced during the traumatic event. This positions chronic pain as potential PTSD re-experiencing symptoms. However, little is known about how chronic pain, and especially pain-intrusions, relate to re-experiencing and other PTSD symptoms.\nObjective: The present study used a network modeling approach to examine how chronic pain and pain-intrusions are embedded within the established DSM-5 PTSD symptom network consisting of criteria B-E (re-experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and hyperarousal).\nMethods: A total of 330 trauma survivors reported on PTSD symptoms and peritraumatic and chronic pain in 108 body regions. Chronic pain was separated into chronic pain in trauma-related (i.e., pain-intrusions) vs. non-trauma-related body regions. We estimated two network models using a Gaussian graphical model approach: (1) with chronic pain in general and (2) with pain-intrusions and non-trauma-related chronic pain as distinct constructs.\nResults: Chronic pain in general was linked to hyperarousal. When pain-intrusions and non-trauma-related chronic pain were examined as separate constructs, pain-intrusions were associated with re-experiencing, while non-trauma-related chronic pain was associated with hyperarousal. Neither pain construct was related to avoidance or negative alterations in cognitions and mood.\nDiscussion: These findings support the view that pain-intrusions represent a somatosensory component of re-experiencing in PTSD. In contrast, chronic pain in non-trauma-related body regions may reflect broader, more stress-related physiological processes such as autonomic arousal and heightened muscle tension. Results highlight the importance of considering the spatial correspondence between peritraumatic and chronic pain to better identify the underlying mechanisms of posttraumatic chronic pain and to tailor interventions to these processes.",

          "abstract": "Adolescence is characterised by rapid physical, psychological, and social changes, and is a critical period for the onset of internalising mental health difficulties. Yet research has often examined risk factors and symptoms in isolation, overlooking their complex, dynamic interrelations. Using three waves of data from the #BeeWell project in Greater Manchester (26,921 adolescents aged 12-15; 50% female; 65% White), we applied a cross-lagged panel network (CLPN) model to explore within- and between-person effects in the interrelations between eleven self-report modifiable psychosocial risk factors (e.g., bullying victimisation, stress) and internalising symptoms.\n\nWithin-person networks were dense, indicating substantial interrelations among symptoms and risk factors and providing evidence of the complex, mutually reinforcing nature of adolescent internalising symptoms over time. Many risks and symptoms were interrelated both directly and indirectly in the temporal network, reflecting mutually reinforcing patterns over time. The between-person network displayed some negative associations absent from within-person models, suggesting different dynamics at individual and group levels. Together, these findings support complex designs, such as multi-target prevention and intervention strategies, caution against simplistic models, and highlight the importance of distinguishing within- and between-person processes for public health practice.",

Infants are viewed as unconditioned by social experience and therefore a source of insight into the initial state of psychological organization. This paper outlines three constraints on this approach focusing on limited sample diversity, insufficient predictive and convergent validation of methods, and overreliance on single exposures or unreplicated findings. It argues for a shift from an emphasis on universality towards a focus on variation. Large-scale multi-site collaborations, longitudinal designs, and cross-method convergence across culturally diverse settings as key components of this goal. These approaches can advance a more ecologically valid and culturally situated science of infancy.",

          "abstract": "Misinformation continues to pose a substantial societal problem, but the measurement of misinformation susceptibility has often been done using non-validated tests. Furthermore, research shows that misleading content (implied misinformation) is much more common than outright false content (explicit misinformation). However, there is very little research on the predictors of belief in implied misinformation, and it is unknown if susceptibility to direct and implied misinformation are psychologically similar. In addition, psychometric scale development focuses primarily on English-speaking samples, and cross-cultural scale validation remains rare. To address these questions, we ran four studies (N1 = 487, N2 = 547, N3= 490, N4= 19,773) in which we developed and validated the Manipulative Online Content Recognition Inventory (MOCRI), a test measuring a person’s ability to distinguish between misleading and neutral content, across 12 European countries. This test substantially outperforms other known predictors of misinformation susceptibility in terms of its predictive value for people’s ability to correctly identify misleading content. We also show that susceptibility to misleading and false content are psychologically different from one another, although being related. Additionally, we show that people who score high on the MOCRI are much better than low MOCRI performers at discerning manipulative from non-manipulative statements, but that this ability does not necessarily translate to better discernment in the quality of their sharing decisions, or their willingness to reply to manipulative vs. non-manipulative messages. Finally, we found the MOCRI scale to be psychometrically stable across 12 countries, meeting configural, metric, and partial scalar invariance.",

          "abstract": "Human perception is inclined towards detecting and attending to negative stimuli – a bias potentially rooted in evolutionary pressures. We investigated whether this bias also exists in the perception of visual art. Study 1 established stimulus norms for 60 selected artworks. One-hundred-five participants rated each artwork for artistic value, affective valence and arousal. We also included objective measures of artwork fame and image complexity. Principal-component analysis yielded three orthogonal dimensions at item-level: Aesthetic Stimulation (image complexity, artistic value, arousal), Artistic Prominence (fame, artistic value, arousal), and Negativity (negative affective valence). Study 2 was preregistered and employed these components to predict artwork-viewing times and post-stimulus ratings in a new sample of 324 participants whose general knowledge of the arts was assessed via Cotter et al. (2023)’s Aesthetic Fluency scale. Following self-paced viewing, participants rated each of the 60 artworks for personal liking and familiarity. Analyses revealed that all three item-related components independently increased artwork-viewing times. Emotionally more negative artworks were indeed viewed for longer, confirming that negativity holds perceivers’ attention. This effect did not reliably interact with participants’ Aesthetic Fluency. Moreover, in spite of increasing viewing times, negatively-valenced artworks were rated lower for liking and familiarity, highlighting a negativity-specific dissociation between attentional engagement and personal appreciation. We conclude that the negativity bias also extends to the perception of cultural artefacts that have no immediate survival value.",

          "abstract": "Human cooperation often involves performing joint tasks, where success relies on how collective rewards are allocated among cooperating parties based on their individual performance and contributions to task outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether differences in individual performance and contribution give rise to self-related biases in such allocation decisions. Here, we developed a novel performance-based social allocation task that manipulated the influence of individual performance on joint outcomes. Across two experiments, participants consistently exhibited a robust self-allocation bias: they allocated more rewards to themselves and disproportionately disregarded their own performance — particularly when their performance did not contribute to the joint outcome. This self-allocation bias was more pronounced in individuals with stronger individualistic social preferences, as measured by social value orientation. At the neural level, self-relevant (versus self-irrelevant) allocation decisions were associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex extending into the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Moreover, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and TPJ tracked trial-by-trial variations in performance with respect to different levels of individual contribution. These findings suggest the cognitive and neural mechanisms of a previously unidentified self-allocation bias, revealing how self-interest governs the integration of performance and contribution information during cooperative decision-making, and highlighting the role of prefrontal and TPJ regions in balancing self-interests and evaluations of individual performance and contribution.",

          "authors": "Brage Andreas Håvik; Gabriel Olaru",
          "abstract": "There is conflicting evidence regarding the personality profiles and motivations of skydivers and extreme sports participants more broadly. While the dominant view portrays skydivers as ‘adrenaline junkies’ and thrill-seekers, emerging qualitative research suggests motivations may include community, skill development, and transcendental experiences. The discrepancy between these perspectives may be explained by differences in experience levels, but the empirical data are scarce. We thus asked 305 skydivers of varying experience about their sensation seeking levels and motives for skydiving—both with a pre-defined scale and open questions. We found that the skydivers had overall higher sensation seeking levels compared to norm samples, and that sensation seeking levels were comparable across experience levels. However, the motives of “thrill-seeking”, “trascendence” and “overcoming fear”—rated as most important for less experienced skydivers—decreased significantly in relevance over experience levels. In contrast, “community” and “improving skills” increased in importance across experience levels and were most important to highly experienced skydivers. These patterns were also reflected in the qualitative findings, where most skydivers reported that they initially began skydiving for the thrill or as a personal challenge, but now did it for the community, skill development or experienced mindfulness. The results challenge the prevailing thrill-seeker stereotype, indicating that thrill and fear motives diminish as experience grows. Overall, these findings clarify how motivations may evolve over time and highlight the importance of considering experience when researching skydivers and participants in extreme or high-risk sports.",

The results showed that explicit reading goals enhanced strategic processing in all three groups, with a more specific impact in adolescents with ADHD and ASD, and that planning was the key executive function associated with this adaptation.

To illuminate its development, we examined how adolescents’ momentary emotion differentiation (mED) varies in response to varying socio-emotional contexts. We also asked whether mED patterns differ following exposure to caregiving-related early adversities (crEAs). Adolescents (N=81, 10-17 years-old) with/without crEAs completed a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (4-5 surveys/day), reporting on their emotions and social contexts. mED for negative emotions showed a significant reduction following negative contexts related to parents (compared to other contexts). The standard deviation of these momentary emotions suggested negative interactions with parents were followed by a phasic intensification restricted to a few negative emotions. However, a history of crEAs exposure attenuated these effects. These data illustrate the potential of measuring discrete parental interaction influences on emotional development during adolescence and highlight the importance of early caregiving experiences in adolescents’ momentary emotion differentiation.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates how physicians’ selective phrasing influences individuals’ attitudes toward “do not attempt resuscitation” (DNAR) orders. Within the framework of libertarian paternalism, nudges have been proposed as a way to guide choices while preserving autonomy, often by leveraging cognitive biases such as framing effects. Nudges are often discussed as a promising means of promoting patients’ best interests without undermining autonomy; however, their practical use in real medical contexts remains limited. Instead, this study focuses on a more direct form of intervention: physicians’ selective phrasing. Specifically, it examines how the use of selective phrasing in DNAR explanations influences patients’ decisions. Using a series of online experiments, we found that people’s consent to DNAR in hypothetical medical scenarios is influenced by slight linguistic differences in the physician’s explanation. The results show that briefly noting the potential harms of CPR, or associating the decision not to perform resuscitation with “naturalness,” contributes to higher acceptance of DNAR. These findings underscore the power of physicians’ language in shaping patients’ decisions without imposing particular options or restricting freedom of choice, or the potentiality of nudging in a broader sense.",

This meta-analysis (n = 115 studies, k = 923 effects) examined associations between EI and 20 common regulation processes, considering three major EI streams and four ability branches. EI was positively associated with putatively adaptive processes (direct situation modification, positive reappraisal, deep acting, seeking help), negatively associated with putatively maladaptive processes (avoidance, denial, surface acting, catastrophizing, self-blame, expressive suppression, substance use), and positively associated with religious coping and humor. EI stream moderated effects for direct situation modification, acceptance, positive reappraisal, distraction, and seeking help (weaker for ability EI than other streams; weaker for mixed EI than self-rated EI). EI branch moderated associations of ability EI with direct situation modification and seeking help, with stronger effects for emotion management. Overall, findings indicate that emotionally intelligent individuals primarily regulate emotions by addressing problems (direct modification, seeking help) or reframing situations (positive reappraisal), reflecting a tendency to use engagement rather than disengagement regulation processes. Test format (ability vs. rating scale) and theoretical model (ability vs. mixed) significantly influenced effect sizes.

Mediante el análisis cualitativo de entrevistas semiestructuradas con personas sordas usuarias de lengua de señas y datos cuantitativos de la Escala de Actitudes hacia la Cultura Sorda (EACS), identificamos patrones de opresión internalizada y discriminación intragrupal que constriñen la percepción enactiva. Los resultados revelan una correlación inversa entre la familiaridad con las comunidades sordas y la manifestación de disaffordances, con los contextos educativos institucionales reforzando restricciones perceptuales. Emergieron cuatro dimensiones clave: inferiorización lingüístico-cultural, normalización de prácticas exclusivas, asimilacionismo y sesgo hacia modelos comunicativos orales.

However, this framing overlooks a crucial insight from computational theory: that determinism does not entail predictability. We propose that the phenomenological experience of free will — the felt sense of open alternatives and genuine deliberation — corresponds to a real feature of complex systems: computational irreducibility. Drawing on Wolfram's taxonomy of computational complexity, we argue that human decision-making exhibits Class 4 computational behavior, meaning that outcomes cannot be determined without step-by-step simulation. This creates an epistemic gap between determinism (metaphysical closure) and predictability (epistemic openness) that grounds the phenomenology of agency. We defend this position against four major objections, including concerns about Libet's neurophysiological experiments, and conclude by proposing testable hypotheses for neuroscience and implications for artificial intelligence, moral responsibility, and the philosophy of mind.",

          "abstract": "With over 5.24 billion active accounts globally, social media platforms significantly shape emotional experiences. Problematic social media use (PSMU), which has been defined as a maladaptive pattern of compulsive checking and preoccupation, is consistently linked with increased anxiety. However, this association varies depending on the user, their usage patterns, and the online environment. The literature review aimed to identify the behavioural and subjective markers linking PSMU to anxiety-like symptoms and synthesise these findings into a unified, mechanistic model. Following PRISMA principles, an intensive literature mapping process was conducted, resulting in the retention and synthesis of 80 empirical studies.\n\nThe synthesis generated a holistic conceptual model identifying five primary mechanistic pathways through which social media use contributes to anxiety. The most consistently supported mechanisms are Social Evaluation Threat (n=42), Overload leading to Fatigue (n=17), Intolerance of Uncertainty and Perceived Lack of Control (n=11), and Mood Regulation and Absorption (n=11).  Sleep Disruption (n=7) was identified as a critical meta-mediator, amplifying downstream anxiety. Furthermore,  Life Events (n=14) function as a meta-moderator, shaping the severity and direction of the pathways. Importantly, there are consistently bidirectional relationships, where anxiety acts as both a precursor and a consequence of problematic engagement, creating self-reinforcing cycles. This review advances a novel relational, mechanistic model that moves beyond simple exposure models of social media use. This model offers a guide for future longitudinal research and provides direct implications for targeted interventions and safer platform design policies",

          "authors": "Meg Aum Warren; Michael Thomas Warren; Erika T. H. Lutz; Camille A Fogel; Louise Lambert; Ryan Niemiec",
          "abstract": "A diverse account of allyship suggests that many individuals can be allies and that some allyship strategies fit their personalities and character strengths better than others. Allyship can be categorized into Committed Strategies (e.g., publicly highlighting women’s strengths) that involve social risk or personal sacrifice, and Relationship-Building Strategies (e.g., active listening) that build supportive and trusting bonds with marginalized group members. Latent profile analyses of survey data from two randomly split samples of 1,814 and 1,813 men from 103 countries were used to examine mean differences across Big Five personality profiles on Committed and Relationship-building allyship strategies toward women in the workplace. Results indicated that people with Well-Adjusted personalities (high on all Big Five traits except low in neuroticism) viewed both Committed and Relationship-building strategies as better-fitting to their personalities, relative to the other three personality profiles that emerged in our data. Hierarchical regression analyses further found that five key character strengths (bravery, kindness, fairness, social intelligence, and perspective) explained additional variance beyond the Big Five in both Committed and Relationship-building strategies, reinforcing the value of character strengths in allyship. Exploratory bivariate correlations revealed that among the Big Five, agreeableness and openness were the strongest and most consistent predictors of 10 Committed and Relationship-building allyship strategies. In a first of its kind, the current study broadens the scope of who allies are as well as what allyship can look like and offers an additional path for allyship training through consideration of personality traits and character strengths.",

          "abstract": "Empathic accuracy refers to the ability to correctly infer the thoughts and feelings of others as they unfold in real time. Although widely studied across psychology, neuroscience, and clinical science, the literature is fragmented due to diverse conceptualizations, measurement approaches, and research contexts. This scoping review provides the first comprehensive synthesis of studies using the two paradigms with the highest construct validity for measuring empathic accuracy: the Ickes paradigms, which assess accuracy for discrete thought-feeling content, and the Dial paradigm, which captures continuous affective inferences. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we identified 172 empirical studies published through September 2022 that used either paradigm. Studies were coded for theoretical focus, design and task characteristics, participant and stimulus features, analytical approaches, and open-science practices. We also mapped the intellectual structure of the field using co-authorship networks and extracted major research themes using topic modeling refined through manual review. Findings indicate substantial growth in empathic accuracy research, especially in Dial-based studies after 2015, yet limited integration across research communities. Most work examines interpersonal cues, relational contexts, clinical or neurodevelopmental populations, and close relationships. Methodological practices vary widely, including substantial heterogeneity in design choices such as interaction structure, stimulus content, reporting procedures, and analytical treatment of accuracy. Open-science practices remain rare, with few studies reporting preregistration, data sharing, or sample-size planning. Together, the review maps the conceptual and methodological landscape of empathic accuracy research, identifies gaps and inconsistencies, and highlights opportunities for theoretical refinement, methodological standardization, and broader application.",

          "abstract": "Thoughts, feelings, and behaviors constantly change in everyday life, and dynamic personality theories emphasize the role of these short-term changes for understanding how momentary states give rise to more enduring personality patterns. Although the growing use of the experience sampling method (ESM) has made it more feasible to examine such dynamics in situ, methodological challenges limit the inferences that can be drawn about temporal personality dynamics. This paper describes the rationale, procedure, and first half of the dataset of the Personality and Contextualized Experiences (PACE) Study, a large, multi- site ESM study which currently comprises 1,126 undergraduates (76,823 observations) across Canada, Germany, and the United States. Of these, 421 participants completed the entire study (baseline survey, ≥ 100 ESM surveys, and follow-up survey). The study advances what can be learned from ESM data by combining (a) a relatively large sample featuring a relatively high number of observations per person with (b) experimental comparisons of two sampling designs, (c) retrospective assessment of missed states, and (d) a personalized assessment of situational information. The PACE Study further includes a newly developed global self-report questionnaire intended to capture aspects of individuals’ dynamic patterns of states without requiring ESM data. Overall, the PACE Study enables modeling temporal dynamics in a nuanced manner, relating these dynamics to a range of variables, and comparing different types of self-reports for capturing dynamic patterns of states.",

          "abstract": "Reading enjoyment is typically studied as a stable trait, yet enjoyment fluctuates within individuals. We examined how both trait- and state-level reading enjoyment shape engagement and eye movements during naturalistic reading. Seventy-six adults read 40 book synopses, rated their enjoyment, answered comprehension questions, and decided whether to wait to view the book cover, while their eye movements were recorded. Mixed-effects models disaggregated between-participant (trait) from within-participant (state) enjoyment. Both levels predicted greater willingness to wait and higher comprehension. Trait enjoyment was associated with longer passage and word reading times. State enjoyment was linked to longer passage times, increased word skipping, faster early word processing, and increased regressions, suggesting more efficient first-pass reading accompanied by increased rereading. These findings suggest that momentary fluctuations in intrinsic motivation dynamically shape reading strategies, revealing a close link between perceived value and the allocation of cognitive resources during text processing.",

          "abstract": "Recent decades have seen a surge of research revealing the core, early-emerging psychological building-blocks for navigating human societies. Yet, how such core motives operate across life, undergirding political ideology, remains unknown. Here we use the same kind of minimal, abstract group stimuli across the lifespan to show that gendered preferences for majority groups manifest among preschoolers and adults alike (but not among preverbal infants) and that they motivate support for sustaining intergroup hierarchies (e.g., ethnic persecution, militarism, and social welfare opposition) among adults. Preschool (N = 317) boys, but not girls, preferred majority rather than minority members, whereas infants (N = 180) chose randomly between the two. Among adults (N = 3467), males also liked the majority more than females and these coalitional preferences correlated robustly with political ideology. These results indicate that gendered motives for intergroup formidability are rooted in earliest childhood once children begin navigating peer relationships independently.",

          "abstract": "Background: A major challenge for the newborn child is to acquire the capacity to regulate internal states (physiological, emotional, and cognitive) and behavior. The child’s self-regulation stems from successful co-regulation between the baby and its caregiver(s) and constitutes the basis of mental health. Regulation problems (RP) in early childhood, characterized by difficulties with sleeping, eating, and excessive crying, are considered potential precursors to developmental psychopathology and long-term mental health challenges. Based on growing empirical and clinical evidence, we hypothesize that child RP largely result from/persist through co-regulation difficulties within the child-parent dyad, which itself is largely impacted by stress and regulation difficulties of the parent. Hence, reducing stress and enhancing parents’ regulation abilities may be an optimal gateway for improving self-regulation in the child, thereby potentially preventing future mental health problems. To date, however, there is a dearth of scientific research on this topic, both with respect to (1) the characterization, definition, detection and understanding of early regulation (problems), and (2) the organization of preventive care around early regulation in young children (0-2 years old). \nObjectives and methods: The Co-regulation as the foundation of PReventive Infant MEntal health care project (Co-PRIME, see www.Co-PRIME.be) will address these gaps in four studies aimed at: (1) quantifying micro parent-infant self- and co-regulation dynamics within a ‘biobehavioral synchrony framework’ in a cohort of dysregulated children and their families enrolled in an intensive intervention program, as compared to matched controls; (2) understanding the prevalence and contextual risk and protective factors of RP by combining a longitudinal panel study among a cohort of parents at three developmental time points (infant age: 3, 6 and 12 months), and semi-structured interviews; (3) pinpointing the missed opportunities in the preventive care for young children with RP by interviewing parents, childcare teachers and health care providers; and (4) developing and testing a 0th/1st line evidence-based health care program empowering parents in the co-regulation process with their child by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT). \nResults: This project is embedded within the Flemish (Belgium) context, designed and executed within a multidisciplinary and interuniversity research consortium, and received funding by Flemish FWO-SBO (Strategic Basic Research). In this article, we present the rationale, overall design and methodology and timeline of the Co-PRIME project, that runs from October 2023 until September 2028. \nConclusion: Together with our committed stakeholders, this multidisciplinary project aims to be a game changer in the early prevention of mental health care in the Dutch speaking part of Belgium and beyond.

          "abstract": "Objectives: The neurocognitive social-transactional model posits that interpersonal adversity during childhood heightens risk for mental health difficulties by altering how individuals engage with their social world. We conducted a scoping review to map current evidence for four candidate mechanisms, Trust, Mentalizing, Agency and Interpersonal Emotion Regulation (IER), linking interpersonal\nchildhood adversity to mental health outcomes.\n\nMethods: We systematically searched four databases and identified quantitative studies that measured interpersonal childhood adversity, one or more of the candidate mechanisms, and mental health outcomes in the same sample. A second reviewer independently assessed 10% of records at each screening stage.\n\nResults: 78 studies met inclusion criteria. For Trust (15 studies), interpersonal childhood adversity was associated with greater distrust and credulity which in turn predicted internalizing, externalizing and personality disorder symptoms. For Mentalizing (37 studies), it was associated with heightened uncertainty and reduced accuracy in understanding mental states, which was consistently linked with\ninternalizing, externalizing, psychosis and personality disorder symptoms. For Agency (26 studies), it was associated with a more external locus of control, which was associated with internalizing and psychosis symptoms. Evidence for IER was limited (3 studies) but suggested potential links to internalizing symptoms. Across mechanisms, findings were largely cross-sectional and based on self-\nreport, with few longitudinal or task-based studies.\n\nConclusion: Trust, Mentalizing and Agency emerged as promising transdiagnostic social-transactional mechanisms through which interpersonal childhood adversity shapes mental health outcomes, with more limited evidence for IER. Despite methodological gaps, these mechanisms may represent tractable targets for intervention research and trauma-informed clinical practice.",

          "authors": "Ilenia Falcinelli; Chiara Fini; Anna M. Borghi",
          "abstract": "Concepts, typically classified into more abstract (e.g., “chair”) and more concrete (e.g., “friendship”), are the mental shortcuts that people commonly use to organize knowledge and navigate their inner and external world. Research on categorization highlights social interaction as crucial for the acquisition and use of abstract concepts. Behavioral evidence shows that people typically learn abstract concepts primarily through language; even after acquisition, they feel less confident about their meaning and tend to rely more on others to refine or negotiate them. Neuroscientific studies support this evidence by showing a greater activation of social and linguistic brain areas for concepts higher in abstractness. However, existing literature relies on constrained experimental methods, testing participants mainly in isolation (“single-brain” approach) or, when using more interactive (conversational) paradigms, they have two main limitations: (I) using non-naturalistic settings; (II) extracting only behavioral indices. Within the emerging “second-person neuroscience” panorama, we contend that hyperscanning—a technique consisting of the simultaneous recording of brain activity from multiple individuals—may be ideally suited to adding evidence on the link between abstract concepts and social interactions by capturing Inter-Brain Synchronization (IBS) of individuals during real-time social exchanges. The availability of portable devices further broadens hyperscanning potential, allowing for the study of brain-to-brain coupling in more ecological environments. Drawing on prior hyperscanning evidence from learning to free conversations, we contend that using hyperscanning in naturalistic settings, with the due care, may offer a novel and interesting lens to investigate the role of social interactions for abstractness, thus enriching categorization research.",

          "abstract": "Rhythmic structure enables precise temporal expectations that are essential to human communication, including speech and music. Computational models have been developed to account for how humans perceive, produce, and learn rhythmic sequences. However, it is unclear how different types of models relate to each other and how they can be evaluated. In this review and perspective, we discuss how three major classes of models – entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models – have been used to study rhythmic expectations. We critically assess each model class in terms of its level of explanation, the rhythmic behaviors it captures, its ability to account for learning and enculturation, and its ability to integrate other features, such as pitch. We show that entrainment, probabilistic, and timekeeper models differ substantially in the aspects of rhythmic expectations they can capture. To move the field forward, we propose that model comparison and integration are crucial. We identify key challenges to this effort, such as the varying nature of the input and output signals and divergent modeling goals. To address these challenges, we arrive at several practical recommendations: to equate input and output signals when comparing models, to consider several model outcomes beyond goodness-of-fit measures in model evaluation, to use model-integration efforts to inform theory building, and to make code and data openly accessible. Ultimately, understanding how models of rhythmic expectations relate, and how features in these models account for behavioral, neural, and cognitive aspects of rhythmic expectations, will deepen our understanding of a core aspect of human behavior.",

          "authors": "Ali Mair",
          "abstract": "Current theories of autobiographical memory (AM) emphasise the involvement of several non-memory auxiliary processes, such as executive function and mental imagery. However, the contribution of these processes to AM retrieval under different circumstances remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of ageing. The extent to which different AM tasks rely on auxiliary processing could explain variability in age-related AM deficits across different contexts. The current study explores the effect of cues varying in format (words, questions, sentences, photos, and videos) and content (e.g., event cues, evaluative cues, imagery cues) on AM retrieval rates in young and older adults. In Experiment 1, young and older adults (n=101) retrieved AMs in response to a set of 208 cues; dependent variables were the proportion of cues that produced a memory, and ratings of the characteristics of the retrieved memories. Results showed that retrieval rates were influenced by both cue format and cue content, with cues that most closely mapped the task requirements producing the largest proportion of memories, regardless of other cue features (e.g., detail, imagery). Study 2 collected data from a separate group of 106 adults concerning their interpretation of the same cues, and analysed the responses in relation to the data from Experiment 1. Both retrieval rates and memory characteristics were related to features of the cues, such as specificity, theme, and emotional content. Data suggested that less easily accessed memories tended to be more autobiographically important. All materials and data – including 2500 brief descriptions of participants’ autobiographical memories – are freely available for further exploration.",

This paper re-examines a previously reported finding that firstborns report less romantic jealousy than laterborns. We present data from four samples (total n &gt; 950) with a MANOVA design, mirroring the study on which this original claim was based. Across all samples and multiple robustness checks, we found no statistical support for the claim that firstborns report less jealousy than laterborns. Both frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses did not support a birth order effect on jealousy (frequentist estimate:  r = .08, 95% CI [-.018, .172]). These findings challenge the notion of birth order as a significant predictor for romantic jealousy and suggest that research on romantic relationships may yield greater insight by focussing on other individual difference variables than birth order.",

In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Aggressive and cooperative responses can both be adaptive depending on the intentions and the appearance of the interaction partners. However, few approaches combine dynamic decision-making between aggression and cooperation with controlled and realistic social cues. We developed two virtual grid aggression tasks (GATs) to study how competitive versus cooperative intentions of non-player characters (NPCs) of different appearances shape behavior, affect, and physiological responses.\nIn a screen-based study (Experiment 1; N = 30), participants interacted with geometric NPCs in a grid-foraging task permitting both mutual gain and competitive blocking. In an immersive VR version (Experiment 2; N = 57), NPCs were rendered as life-sized avatars varying in affiliative appearance, via facial manipulation of apparent trustworthiness in stylized male characters, or participant-specific photorealistic “doppelgangers” (NPC avatar styles “T-NPC” and “D-NPC”). Across both studies, participants adjusted cooperation to NPC intention: cooperation increased toward cooperative NPCs and declined toward competitive NPCs. Competitive NPC intention also elicited higher anger evaluations in both environments.\nIn VR, affiliative appearance predicted self-reported identification with NPCs in the hypothesized direction, independent of avatar style. In addition, intimidation responses and stress-related physiological measures differentiated avatar styles: stylized trust-manipulated avatars induced higher intimidation, heart rate, and respiration, and lower heart rate variability, whereas photorealistic doppelgangers elicited lower arousal and greater visual engagement. Trait aggression predicted anger ratings for competitive but not cooperative NPCs. Exploratory moderation effects with gender appeared appeared in specific VR conditions for trait aggression and self-reported identification with NPCs variables.\nThese results support virtual GATs as experimentally controllable platforms for studying aggression and cooperation-related affect in immersive social environments. Thus GATs can be used to investigate interpersonal predictors and the role of identification in dyadic interactions that allow for cooperation and aggressive competition. The presented approach links social decision-making to perceptual, physiological, and identification-based responses within a unified framework.",

However, this study has never been replicated. This study aimed to replicate and conceptually extend Kallinen and Ravaja (2006). Participants (N = 60, mean age = 31.93) listened to 12 one-minute music excerpts selected a priori to express one of four basic emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear), and provide ratings for 16 emotion adjectives (to calculate dimensions of valence, arousal, positive activation, and negative activation), first for emotions perceived in the music, and second for emotions felt by the participant. Participants completed trait inventories including behavioural inhibition and activation scales, neurotic-anxiety and sensation-seeking questionnaires, and trait empathy measures. Our replication largely reproduced results from the 2006 study: Felt valence was overall more positive than perceived, with opposite patterns found for arousal, positive activation and negative activation; emotion ratings also varied across music expressing joy, sadness, and fear. However, no effects of individual trait characteristics were replicated. Although successful, this replication differs from the original research in its interpretation of how data support the empirical hypotheses, suggesting little support for any hypothesis. Findings highlight complexities of replicating psychological research, and the importance of hypothesis-driven research to develop from theoretical models that enable specific predictions and outline the conditions for relevant evidence.",

Across three studies conducted in the Netherlands (N=984), the United Kingdom (N=1,001), and the United States (N=1,000), we show that feeling thermometers function as measures of valence and that valence and arousal represent empirically distinct dimensions of affective reactions. We then demonstrate that the level of emotional arousal provides incremental validity over traditional, valence-based measures of affective polarization, yielding additional and often stronger associations with key political correlates such as political engagement, ideological extremity, and democratic attitudes. These findings advance the conceptualization and measurement of affective polarization by incorporating arousal as a distinct dimension and clarifying when and why affective polarization is most strongly linked to political behavior and democratic attitudes.",

However, to mitigate their potential risks and ensure public trust, they must be designed according to ethical principles aligned with human values. While utilitarian and deontological frameworks have traditionally guided ethical decision-making in artificial agents, we propose a contractualist framework as a more effective alternative. In this study, we investigated how different ethical frameworks, utilitarianism, deontology, and contractualism, affect perceptions of both robots and humans in terms of their moral trustworthiness, reliability, moral agency, complexity, and intentionality. Our results indicate that agents using a contractualist approach are perceived as more reliable, morally trustworthy, and morally agentic than those using a utilitarian framework. Additionally, contractualist agents were viewed as more reliable than deontological ones. These findings suggest that contractualism may offer a more favorable ethical foundation for the design of socially acceptable and trustworthy AI systems.",

          "abstract": "Life and social adversities experienced before adulthood are decisive drivers of later life health inequalities, which hinge on immune, endocrine and epigenetic changes that reflect an individual’s interaction with the environment. Since monozygotic (MZ) twins share the same genetic background and perinatal environment, they provide a robust approach to identify environmental influences on biological features while controlling genetic confounders. We screened MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs (aged of 17 to 32 years) from the German TwinLife study for recent and time-distant adversities in their psychosocial environment (PSE). Here, we present three statistical approaches we developed to quantify adverse experiences in 739 twin pairs (349 MZ, 390 DZ). We calculated divergence scores based on score differences between each twin pair. By combining these approaches, we identified adversity-divergent twins (144 MZ, 173 DZ), suggesting that in approximately 41% - 44% of twin pairs, there was a clear divergence in their adversarial experiences and how they interpreted their PSE. Variance modelling suggested that 43% of the adversity experienced by the twins was due to their unique environment, while 23% was from their shared environment while 33% of the variance was explained by genetic factors.",

          "abstract": "Accurately quantifying belief strength in heuristics-and-biases tasks is crucial yet methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce an automated method leveraging large language models (LLMs) to systematically measure and manipulate belief strength. We specifically tested this method in the widely used “lawyer-engineer” base-rate neglect task, in which stereotypical descriptions (e.g., someone enjoying mathematical puzzles) conflict with normative base-rate information (e.g., engineers represent a very small percentage of the sample). Using this approach, we created an open-access database containing over 100,000 unique items systematically varying in stereotype-driven belief strength. Validation studies demonstrate that our LLM-derived belief strength measure correlates strongly with human typicality ratings and robustly predicts human choices in a base-rate neglect task. Additionally, our method revealed substantial and previously unnoticed variability in stereotype-driven belief strength in popular base-rate items from existing research, underlining the need to control for this in future studies. We further highlight methodological improvements achievable by refining the LLM prompt, as well as ways to enhance cross-cultural validity. The database presented here serves as a powerful resource for researchers, facilitating rigorous, replicable, and theoretically precise experimental designs, as well as enabling advancements in cognitive and computational modeling of reasoning. To support its use, we provide the R package baserater, which allows researchers to access the database to apply or adapt the method to their own research.",

          "abstract": "Computational capacity and knowledge of humans are less than those of large language models (LLMs). However, in buzzer quizzes, human trivia experts can often identify the correct answer even from insufficient information such as only a few words. Investigating how they can make fast and accurate judgments is expected to highlight new characteristics of human intelligence, but little is known about that. We predicted that trivia experts and LLMs differed in terms of which words/phrases in a question were important to lead to the answer. Then, we compared experts’ performance with LLMs’ performance in solving Japanese trivia questions through LLM-as-a-judge approach: We regarded LLMs as evaluators and then used their outputs as benchmarks for experts’ evaluations. First, we constructed a quiz question processing system that tokenized question texts based on morphological analyses and then numerically evaluated the importance of each token using GPT-4o/GPT-4.1. Then, we conducted a behavioral experiment wherein actual trivia experts were asked to numerically evaluate the importance of each token, as LLMs performed. As a result, trivia experts regarded various words/phrases as important even if each word/phrase did not seem to have strong associations with the answer. Therefore, experts’ evaluation scores tended to be accumulated faster than LLMs’ ones. It is implied that experts were superior in making inductive inferences (e.g., finding a common concept even from few items) compared to LLMs. Our findings will be a scaffolding toward designing more advanced question-answering systems because AI designers can apply human cognitive processes to implement LLMs’ information processing.",

Robust predictors of faith development included low agreement with the truth of texts and teachings subscale of the Religious Schema Scale (RSS), low frequency of prayer, and high openness to experience (NEO-FFI), while xenosophia/inter-religious dialog emerged as a moderately significant predictor. Predictive validity of FDI was demonstrated, though with limited strength.

Exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency metrics, and convergent and predictive validity tests were conducted to evaluate the scale’s psychometric properties.\nResults: Factor analysis yielded a four-factor solution—Misgendering, Anxiety, Effort, and Satisfaction—with all subscales demonstrating strong internal reliability. TNB participants scored significantly higher than cisgender participants on Misgendering, Anxiety, and Satisfaction. The SInG Scale showed moderate correlations with independent measures of speaking- and singing-voice gender incongruence.\nConclusion: The SInG Scale provides a psychometrically supported, multidimensional measure of singing-related gender dysphoria. This tool may help clinicians, educators, and researchers better identify and address the unique challenges faced by TNB singers.",

In the present study, we explored children’s early understanding of age and how it is informed by features including size, facial and bodily morphology, and numerical knowledge. Across two pre-registered experiments, we tested 215 3- to 5-year-old children on their identification of which of two figures is older. Like previous studies, we found that children often confound age with size. However, we also found that this tendency was eliminated when children were provided with less extreme differences in size, had access to information regarding numerical age, or when facial and bodily cues to age were more pronounced. We also found that, overall, children’s age judgments were related to their mastery of number words, suggesting a role for numeracy in understanding age. These results suggest that, rather than conflating age with size, children use multiple converging cues to reason about age beginning early in development.",

          "authors": "Murat Kezer; Sara D. Hodges",
          "abstract": "Perspective taking is often assumed to be morally beneficial and a key method for resolving conflicts. This research investigated two primary questions regarding the role of perspective taking in moral judgments in conflict situations. First, does taking the perspective of an opponent in an interpersonal conflict affect one's own moral judgments of that person? Second, does observing an individual engaging in perspective taking during an interpersonal conflict influence a third-party observer's moral judgments of that individual? Across three studies (1a, 1b, and 1c), participants who described a memorable interpersonal conflict were instructed to include the other person's thoughts and feelings (perspective-taking condition) or were given no such instruction (control condition). Results consistently supported the first hypothesis. Individuals in the perspective-taking condition judged the other party in the conflict as less wrong compared to those in the control condition. This effect was observed in between-subjects (Studies 1a and 1c) and within-subjects (Study 1b) designs, using both student and online samples. However, exploratory analyses indicated that despite taking the other person's perspective, participants still judged themselves as significantly more right than the person with whom they had the conflict. In Studies 2 and 3, third-party observers read conflict descriptions (collected from Studies 1a/1b or an online source) that either included or did not include perspective taking by the author of the description, or varied the degree of perspective taking. Contrary to the second hypothesis, observers did not judge perspective-takers as more right (or less wrong) in the conflict compared to non-perspective-takers. This finding was consistent even when the amount of perspective taking was manipulated. In conclusion, taking another person’s perspective serves as a useful tool for those involved in a conflict to mitigate their own harsh judgments of their opponent, but merely observing this act does not influence third-party moral judgments regarding who is right or wrong in the conflict.",

          "abstract": "A defining feature of electroencephalography (EEG) data is its 1/f-like spectral structure, wherein power decreases as frequency increases. This feature captures non-oscillatory activity, referred to as aperiodic activity, and has gained renewed attention as an indicator of neural mechanisms such as excitation-inhibition balance and neural noise, with a functional role in cognitive processing. However, despite its increasing use in cognitive neuroscience, the extent to which aperiodic EEG parameters reliably relate to cognitive functions remains unclear. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review examined research exploring the relationship between aperiodic EEG features in cognitive processes in healthy adults, aged ~18–65. The results obtained from 45 studies are presented within three domains: (i) processing speed, perception, and attention, (ii) memory, working memory, and executive functions, and (iii) language, learning, and complex processes. Across studies, aperiodic EEG parameters, particularly the aperiodic exponent, showed relatively consistent associations with cognitive processing. Steeper spectra were typically observed during conditions requiring inhibitory control, conflict resolution, and encoding of information. Instead, flatter spectra accompanied sensory engagement, cognitive flexibility, and memory recall. Both resting-state and task-related measures indicated that aperiodic activity reflects a combination of stable, trait-like neural efficiency and flexible, state-dependent adaptability. The reviewed evidence supports the functional relevance of aperiodic EEG parameters as indices of cortical state regulation, reflecting shifts in excitation-inhibition balance, neural noise, and arousal. Future work should prioritize methodological standardization and extend investigations across developmental and clinical populations to clarify the generality and mechanistic basis of the aperiodic-cognition relationship.",

The FESRS demonstrated strong internal consistency and a confirmed three-factor structure consisting of Sexual Desire, Orgasmic Capacity, and Altered States of Consciousness with significant positive associations between mindfulness and expanded sexual response. The exploratory analysis also showed significant higher scores for the older age groups in the Orgasmic Capacity subscale compared to the younger age group, possibly due to increased body awareness, or reduced performance anxiety.

The recent emergence of ultra-realistic avatars generated by artificial intelligence presents new and pressing questions for educators and instructional designers. What is the true impact of these virtual pedagogical agents on learning performance? Do they genuinely enhance knowledge acquisition, or do they represent a significant risk of inducing extraneous cognitive overload?\t\nThis paper presents a study investigating the impact of a realistic AI-generated avatar in an educational video on learners' performance and cognitive load, compared to an identical condition with no avatar. The study was guided by the hypothesis that the avatar's presence would be detrimental to learning by increasing the cognitive load imposed on the learner.\t\nAn experiment was conducted with 27 participants who were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. The results showed no statistically significant differences in either learning performance or perceived cognitive load between the groups.\t \nWhile these findings align with the \"persona zero effect,\" the analysis revealed a critical methodological insight: 81.5% of participants (22 out of 27) completed the experiment on a mobile phone. This massive skew towards mobile use likely diminished the avatar's visual presence and impact, offering a concrete explanation for the observed lack of effect. This paper thus highlights the viewing device as a critical confounding variable in research on pedagogical agents.",

We propose that retaliatory incivility – i.e., incivility in response to someone else’s incivility — is seen as more virtuous than instigatory incivility, and consequently generates more social rewards for actors. To test these hypotheses, we used observational data from Reddit (2,252,607 comments) to compare how many social rewards users were granted when they responded uncivilly to civil or uncivil posts from other users. We then experimentally confirm our hypotheses in a sample of Reddit users, as well as five samples of participants from different contexts of group incivility; hockey fans, baseball fans, employees, workplace teams. Together, our findings challenge conventional wisdom: retaliatory incivility can be a surprising path to social rewards. Thus, as incivility rises internationally, our findings have far-reaching theoretical and practical implications.",

          "authors": "Samuel David Jones",
          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

Ecological momentary interventions (EMI) offer potential for timely support, yet their mechanisms and optimal delivery contexts remain unclear.\nAim: To examine dynamic symptom networks, proximal effectiveness, engagement predictors, and distress forecasting in adults with CMD.\nMethods: This secondary analysis of a randomized trial (N=77) compared mindfulness and mentalization micro-interventions triggered by personalized symptom thresholds. EMA data were collected 4x/daily for 28 days. We utilized Dynamic Exploratory Graph Analysis, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) for proximal effects, and mixed-effects logistic regression for engagement and prediction.\nResults: Dynamic networks revealed stable communities (interpersonal threat, social connection, affective states) with mood as a key bridge. No significant proximal intervention effects were observed. Non-engagement was significantly predicted by high stress (OR = 1.21), elevated mood (OR = 1.22), and perceived criticism (OR = 1.22). Conversely, cumulative symptom triggers (OR = 0.69) and social contact (OR = 0.83) facilitated engagement. The dynamic prediction model achieved fair performance (AUC = 0.66) for next-beep distress. Beyond autoregressive effects, perceived support paradoxically predicted future distress (OR = 1.14), while warmth was protective (OR = 0.87).\nConclusion: Micro-interventions operate through stable networks but yield cumulative rather than immediate benefits. That high stress and criticism impede intervention use despite high need highlights the necessity for context-sensitive, low-friction adaptive designs to align clinical need with receptivity.",

          "abstract": "Instrumental variables (IV) methods are central to econometrics, yet their connection to psychometric structural equation modeling (SEM) has remained largely unexplored. This article extends Browne’s weighted least squares (WLS) theory to multi-stage estimation of models that partition parameters into interdependent blocks, each estimated sequentially while conditioning on results from earlier stages. Within this unified framework, we show that the standard econometric estimator—two-stage least squares (2SLS)—is a special case of a multi-stage mean and covariance structure estimator. Under multivariate normality, SEM-based standard errors (SEs) are algebraically identical to econometric SEs under homoscedasticity, and Browne’s residual-based test coincides with Sargan’s overidentification test. Likewise, asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) SEs correspond exactly to heteroscedasticity-robust SEs, and Browne’s ADF residual test is asymptotically equivalent to Hansen’s J test. By revealing the mean–covariance structure underlying 2SLS, we clarify the conceptual and statistical unity between econometric IV estimation and psychometric SEM. The results demonstrate that both traditions rely on the same moment conditions, differ only in scope and inference, and can be viewed as complementary approaches within a single multi-stage estimation framework.",

          "abstract": "In 73% of the world’s countries, adults under 30 years of age report the highest life evaluation (i.e., happiness). A notable exception has emerged in North America and Northern Europe, where this pattern has reversed, with older adults reporting greater life evaluation than the young. We analyzed Gallup World Poll data from 2006–2024, covering 2.6 million respondents worldwide and 16,009 in Norway, to examine shifts in the age gap in life evaluation and their determinants. Norway is a particularly valuable case for illustrating this reversal: since ranking as the world’s happiest country in 2017, it has declined in both absolute terms and relative rankings, with national statistics revealing a pronounced well-being gap between young and old. We found that the decline in life evaluation scores in Norway largely reflects decreasing scores among young adults (18-30 years), whose scores have dropped significantly since 2017 (p &lt; .001; d = 0.37) and are now markedly lower than those of older adults (p &lt; .001; d = 0.41). We further confirmed that this trend is limited to a small set of countries; of all 2,508 linear correlations between age and life evaluation in different countries, 83% were negative, and only 2% were r &gt; .10, which was the case in Norway 2022–2024. We examined potential explanations of the observed change in Norway. Only a few of the 70 variables in the Gallup World Poll seem potentially relevant for the increased age difference in life evaluations in Norway. Across multiple analyses we find the most important variables are i) stress-related factors (e.g., feeling well-rested and stress), and ii) economic standards (e.g., standard of living satisfaction and household income satisfaction). The study emphasizes the imperative for highly developed countries to prioritise the well-being of their young despite overall prosperity and high living standards.",

INTs form a cortical hierarchy for multi-scale temporal processing, and differences in this hierarchy are linked to social impairments across neuropsychiatric conditions. The rTPJ dynamically integrates fast mirroring and slow mentalizing processes; inter-brain synchrony there predicts success in social interactions, while mismatched timescales between individuals cause communication breakdowns. We propose that this INT and rTPJ framework unifies dual-process theories within a single neurophysiological mechanism, providing a novel, testable account of social interactions and their impairments.",

          "abstract": "As a need state, hunger alters how we evaluate the rewarding perceptual properties of food. Whether this modulation targets specific components of food reward and to what extent it depends on the sensory modality through which food cues are presented remains understudied. This study examined whether hunger selectively modulates wanting versus liking for food, across visual and olfactory cues. Participants (N = 43) rated food, non-food, and disgusting stimuli during fasted and sated sessions, across the dimensions of liking and wanting. Our results show that hunger resulted in stronger increases in wanting for food cues than in liking. Contrary to expectations, this hunger-induced increase in wanting was more pronounced for food pictures than for food odors. Liking and wanting ratings for non-food cues remained unaffected regardless of state, though exploratory analyses suggested heightened wanting for aversive odors during hunger. Overall, our findings demonstrate that hunger selectively modulates motivational rather than hedonic components of reward in a content- and modality-specific manner. Taken together, our study highlights the need to consider both reward components and sensory modality when examining food reward. Systematic manipulation of these factors could enhance our understanding of multisensory reward integration in relation to food intake and provide insights that could inform interventions for maladaptive eating behaviors.",

          "authors": "Silvia Seghezzi; Elisabeth Parés-Pujolràs; Patrick Haggard",
          "abstract": "Making each action at the right time is crucial for motor control. In this study, we investigated how two prominent motor preparatory processes identified in human EEG — beta-band desynchronization and the readiness potential (RP) — might each contribute to determining the time of a simple voluntary action. In our paradigm, participants learned when to act in each block of trials, based on probabilistic trial-by-trial feedback. A reward schedule reinforced a specific optimal time to act in some blocks, but allowed greater variability around the same mean action time in other blocks. We found that contralateral motor beta-band power at the beginning of each trial increased with the mean waiting time in each block. Computationally, this pattern is consistent with a neural implementation of distance-to-bound for a noisy accumulation process, in which baseline motor activity starts off closer to an action-triggering bound when fast actions are required. In contrast, the RP was independent of the mean waiting time before action, but its slope increased when participants developed a precise motor plan. We suggest that beta desynchronization and the RP track distinct, complementary processes involved in the temporal control of action. While beta-power activity at trial onset is consistent with a neural implementation of urgency, the RP captures an internal decision variable that reflects a noisy accumulation process. Simulations suggest that acting at the right time may involve increasing the strength of the input to this accumulator, which can cause the decision variable to drift towards the decision bound.",

          "authors": "Wouter Wolf",
          "abstract": "Humans are highly skilled at establishing mental state alignment through communication during collaborative interactions. Yet there is still much debate about how they do this effectively. Recently, scholars have argued that the capacity to understand others’ communicative intent facilitates mental state alignment by constraining the meaning of communicative expressions to a domain of mutual relevance. Although this constraint is likely an important facilitator of human communication, it is unlikely to completely resolve the interpretative indeterminacy inherent to humans’ open-ended communication systems (i.e., inferring the intended meaning of arbitrary signals amid quasi-infinite interpretive possibilities). Here, I argue that understanding communicative intent facilitates mental state alignment in a crucial, previously underappreciated way. Understanding the cooperative intention underlying ostension solves the problem of ‘ambiguous affective reference’ inherent to emotional expressions in response to communicative acts. Specifically, it constrains the interpretation of these expressions to be about the communicative act’s content (i.e., ostensive feedback). Consequently, ostensive negative feedback facilitates the negotiation of mental states during perceived mental misalignment (disagreement) until both individuals use positive ostensive feedback (affirmation) to indicate that they deem their mental states sufficiently aligned for the purposes of their interaction (agreement). I argue that this capacity facilitates much of humans’ sociality.",

In an initial exploratory study (Experiment 1), undergraduates at a small North American university (N = 83) were asked to (1) give open-ended explanations for prompts about musical strengths, then (2) rate the causal contribution of genetic (e.g., inheritance), environmental (e.g., parent support), and personal choice (e.g., effort) factors for those same attributes. In Experiment 2, we replicated and extended Experiment 1 by asking participants recruited from Prolific (N = 92) to rate the causal contribution of genetic, environmental, and personal choice factors to musical strengths as well as weaknesses. Overall, participants tended to rate personal choices highest and genetic factors lowest in importance for musical strengths, but no such pattern was observed for musical weaknesses. Genetic contributions were considered more important for singing and rhythm than other musical strengths. Overall, participants emphasized the role of practice and effort in musical abilities, but had nuanced beliefs about contributions of genetic and environmental factors to different musical characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Spatial navigation is the ability to purposefully move from one location to another. Central to many theories of navigation is the proposal that we build a ‘cognitive map’ of our external environment. We identify three conceptions of cognitive maps, with a modal view that these maps are mental representations coding for the spatial relations between locations and landmarks in a coherent, long-term, stable manner. Reviewing the literature, we show that many navigation behaviours thought to require a coherent cognitive map can be supported by the interaction of specific navigation strategies with minimal, fragmentary knowledge of the environment. Further, we argue that the range of navigation behaviours, strategies, individual differences, and navigational aids and systems used during navigation point toward representations that are more flexible than the conception of a coherent cognitive map allows. We propose that navigation should be studied as a situated and embodied process where representations are (re)constructed dynamically. The form and complexity of these constructed representations are tightly connected to the dynamic interaction between the navigator, including the strategies and aids they are using, and the environment. We link this proposal to the literature on spatially tuned neurons in the medial temporal lobes, emphasising that the heterogeneity of these functional neurons and their adaptation to changes in environmental structure and navigational goals supports our proposal that cognitive maps are dynamically (re)constructed representations. Therefore, cognitive maps are not relatively coherent, stable representations of spatial environments, but instead are dynamically and flexibly (re)constructed representations of the given navigational moment.",

While diversity of opinion is vital for democratic engagement and can promote innovative solutions, social science research shows that such disagreements can undermine social cohesion and erode social trust if they turn into identity-based conflicts. The present research examines the potential importance of social norms that promote equality-based respect, dialogue, and unity (inclusivity norms) in mitigating these negative outcomes. In a pre-registered representative survey of 12,041 individuals in twelve European countries, we find that perceived inclusivity norms are associated with increased tolerance, greater willingness to collaborate, and lower tendencies to avoid people who hold opposing opinions. In most countries studied, this pattern holds among respondents who strongly disapprove of the opposing viewpoint, endorse anti-pluralist opinions, hold anti-egalitarian preferences, and identify more strongly with their opinion-based group relative to society. These findings support the potential of inclusivity norms to preserve social trust and cohesion amid opinion diversity.",

Exercise combined with cognitive training (CT) has emerged as a non-pharmacological option for managing symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined whether integrating exercise with CT offer additive benefits in improving ADHD symptoms and executive functions (EF).\nMethods: OVID databases and Web of Science were searched to January 2025 for peer-reviewed studies in English administering CT alone, exercise alone, or both combined. Where possible, random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Morris’s d estimated effect sizes across outcomes, stratified by intervention type. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane ROB 2.0 tool.\nResults: Combined interventions tended to outperform controls on cognitive EF measures and ADHD symptom ratings. Meta-analysis showed that combined interventions significantly improved set-shifting with a moderate effect (SMD = -0.46, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.17; I² = 0%), but not inhibition. Risk of bias was generally high or raised some concerns, largely due to lack of blinding, reliance on subjective outcomes, limited preregistration, and handling of missing data; trials using objective, computerised tasks or blinded assessors more often fell into some concerns rather than high risk.\nConclusion: Cognitively engaging exercise, such as interactive sports and exergames, may offer added benefits over exercise or CT alone through simultaneous engagement of cognitive and motor systems. However, the small number of available combined trials means that larger, high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm additive effects on EF and ADHD symptom outcomes.",

Key theoretical frameworks (the Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, COM B) provide structure, while empirical evidence is drawn from screening uptake, blood‐testing adherence, dental‐care utilization, and broader preventive behaviors. Intervention evidence is reviewed, showing that multi‐component, theory based interventions are typically more effective than single‐focus approaches. The principal conclusion is that motive‐structures for not caring for health are multi‐faceted and interactive: cognitive, motivational, affective, and structural factors combine; hence effective intervention must address multiple levels simultaneously.\nLimitations in the literature (heterogeneity, intention behavior gap, equity issues) and interdisciplinary collaboration, as well as future research directions are discussed.",

          "abstract": "Background: Psychological First Aid (PFA) is one of the most widely disseminated mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) interventions in humanitarian emergencies. Yet despite its global uptake, evidence on its effectiveness remains fragmented, and little is known about which aspects of PFA work well, or fail, in crisis settings. \nMethods: We conducted a systematic review using the LISTEN method, which integrates collaborative qualitative analysis with digital text-network analysis to synthesise large, heterogeneous datasets. We searched three peer-reviewed databases and two grey literature databases, and key humanitarian organisations’ websites. One hundred publications met inclusion criteria. We examined co-occurring patterns in PFA reported strengths, weaknesses and effectiveness indicators, and incorporated insights from experts by experience to contextualise findings.\nResults: Across studies, early, low-threshold support was the most consistently reported strength, closely linked to accessibility, service integration and reduced burden on overstretched health systems. Weaknesses clustered around insufficient provider training, limited evaluation capacity and inconsistent definitions of what constitutes PFA. Although many studies reported reduced distress and positive participant feedback, only 16% used validated mental health measures. Stakeholders emphasised that several interventions labelled as PFA deviated from the core model, particularly when delivered as multi-session programmes rather than a rapid response within 72 hours. Text-network analysis highlighted strong associations between training gaps and weaker effectiveness outcomes.\nConclusion: PFA interventions show promise in humanitarian emergency contexts, particularly in providing rapid, accessible support. However, inconsistency in definitions and over-reliance on acceptability rather than high quality evaluations limit effectiveness conclusions. Strengthening training, embedding standardised outcome measures, and clarifying PFA models are essential for improving practice. LISTEN offers a scalable approach for synthesising evidence in time-sensitive humanitarian contexts. The development of innovative research methods and incorporating experts by experience in research processes has proven key to contextualise findings with field-based realities.",

          "abstract": "Humans typically move and vocalize in a time-synchronized fashion, aligning prominence-lending hand movements to acoustically emphasized syllables. This requires complex coordination. When speaking a foreign language, learners often place prominence on the wrong syllable in a word, which contributes to a noticeable foreign accent. In this pre-registered kinematic-acoustic study, we test whether a foreign accent is present in the timing of co-speech manual movements. Results demonstrate a ‘kinematic accent’ in Dutch learners of Spanish producing Spanish cognates (e.g., Spanish profeSOR - Dutch proFESsor). Dutch learners time the maximum extension of their co-speech movements closer to the prominent syllable in their native Dutch (i.e., on -fes), even when acoustically emphasizing the correct Spanish syllable (-sor). Conversely, when incorrectly acoustically emphasizing the Dutch syllable, the maximum extension of their hand movement is attracted to the Spanish target syllable. This reveals competing timing processes between movement and vocalization systems for foreign language learners, demonstrating that not only your spoken accent but also your co-speech manual kinematics can give away your native language.",

Across animation styles, temporal order memory showed an asymmetric boundary effect: frame pairs occurring before a global turning point were remembered less accurately than pairs spanning or following the boundary. More frequent segmentation predicted poorer order and recognition memory. Aligning boundaries with the group norm, however, reduced this cost and improved recognition. Continuous animations elicited fewer and less synchronized boundaries but yielded higher recognition accuracy than stepwise animations. \n\nThese findings demonstrate that animation design, through its event structure, influences memory for dynamic maps, with smoother animations tending to better support memory than stepwise displays.",

While an efficient re-use of neural resources, this overlap leads to the question of how imagery and perception are kept apart. One hypothesis is that signal strength determines perceptual reality judgements such that when activity in the visual cortex is strong enough to cross a ‘reality threshold’, that activity is inferred to reflect reality. Here, we aimed to test the causal role of sensory strength in perceptual reality monitoring by attempting to push mental imagery over the reality threshold using non-invasive brain stimulation. We used a combination of psychophysics, mental imagery and subthreshold Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): a technique that is assumed to increase subthreshold neuronal activity. We applied subthreshold TMS to early visual cortex while participants simultaneously imagined and detected visual stimuli in noise. Both imagining the stimulus as well as brain stimulation to the early visual cortex (compared to vertex) increased reports of perceiving a real stimulus when none was presented. However, there was no interaction between brain stimulation and imagery, indicating that TMS failed to push imagined signals over the reality threshold. We discuss various explanations for our results and suggest how these methods could be used to investigate the causal mechanisms of perceptual reality monitoring in future research.",

          "abstract": "Background\nMenopause can be a challenging time for health and wellbeing. Research suggests that autistic people may experience menopause differently to non-autistic people, although no explanatory mechanisms for this have been examined. Using a longitudinal approach, we examined whether menopause representations (i.e. thoughts, beliefs and feelings about menopause) are associated with the severity of menopause symptoms, poorer mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms) and quality of life over time in autistic and non-autistic people.\n\nMethods\nWe measured menopause representations, menopause symptom severity, quality of life, depressive and anxiety symptoms using self-report standardised scales in 476 autistic and 425 non-autistic participants aged 40-60 years. We collected data over five consecutive weeks. Using mediation analyses, we examined associations between menopause representations and health and wellbeing outcomes (perceived menopause symptom severity, anxiety, depression and quality of life) across all timepoints. \n\nResults\nAutistic participants reported more severe menopause symptoms, greater anxiety and depression, and poorer quality of life, across all timepoints. Sense of control and sense of coherence in relation to menopause, two aspects of menopause representations, were significant predictors of health outcomes over time. Feeling less in control and having a less coherent understanding of menopause mediated relationships between being autistic and increased menopause symptoms, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and reduced quality of life, across all timepoints.\n\nConclusion\nFindings suggest that menopause representations partially explain poorer health outcomes in autistic people who are peri- or postmenopausal, and acknowledge that other mechanisms exist through which aspects of being autistic are associated with these poorer outcomes. While further investigation is needed to identify the mechanisms of health inequalities during and after menopause, our findings suggest that feelings of control and coherence are important for wellbeing during menopause, highlighting the importance of appropriate information and support to help autistic individuals navigate this life stage confidently.",

          "abstract": "Telephone triage has received relatively little attention in the patient safety research space, especially in non-emergency settings. Existing healthcare contributory factors frameworks for investigating safety are often designed with face-to-face and secondary care settings in mind. As a result, the unique safety challenges associated with telephone triage (e.g., lack of visibility of the caller, onus on caller to perform clinical tests) may not be identified when these frameworks are applied to incident investigation. Previously, a systematic review and best-fit framework synthesis using SEIPS 2.0 (Holden et al., 2013) identified existing evidence of factors contributing to patient safety outcomes in non-emergency telephone triage (Poots et al., 2025). There was limited research in the UK setting, NHS111, and Integrated Urgent Care. Therefore, a modified Delphi panel of 23 telephone triage and safety experts from England and Wales was assembled, to ascertain the appropriateness of the synthesised factors, and the utility of a preliminary framework for understanding safety in the NHS111 (which triages upwards of one million calls per month in the UK) and similar systems. There was high agreement with synthesised and suggested factors which resulted in 186 items for inclusion in the NETTSPF, suggesting there are common contributory factors across non-emergency telephone triage systems. To increase framework usability, individual items were grouped into 18 themes using thematic analysis. The items presented can be adopted to support safety training and incident investigation in telephone triage and other call-centre based healthcare settings. Future research and evaluation should focus on NETTSPF’s efficacy for improving elements of incident investigation (e.g., identifying contributory factors, writing recommendations). A structural framework was also developed and requires additional refinement.",

Controlling for gender, intended academic programs, science degree status, and standardized test scores, Asian American applicants (n = 18,001) were more behavioral (e.g., “I do”) and less mentalistic (e.g., “I think/feel”) in their self-framing, used fewer agentic traits (e.g., confidence), and referenced more moral and familial processes than their Euro-American counterparts (n = 30,402); this interdependent model of self-presentation was associated with a higher likelihood of admission. This work calls attention to the cultural shaping of self-presentation in high-stakes evaluative contexts.",

          "abstract": "The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care recommends cognitive and social activities as protective against dementia risk in middle-aged and older adults. However, a lack of conceptual clarity makes it challenging to adequately assess these concepts in research and practice. Currently, a wide variety of measures are used, which complicates cross-study comparison and leads to fragmented evidence about protective effects. Using an integrative review, we analysed definitions across 43 academic and 37 grey records to formulate provisional definitions. We observed substantial heterogeneity in terminology to describe concepts and their attributes. Nine higher-order attributes were identified: interacting with others, cognitive functions, information processing, cognitive demand, novelty, personal control, purpose, quantitative aspects, and context. A main finding was the overlap between cognitive and social activities, as both inherently involve information processing and cognitive functions. Despite the overlap, they also had distinct attributes. Specifically, cognitive activities often involve novelty, while social activities involve interaction with others and often a sense of purpose. The findings indicate that currently available measurements over-rely on assessment of quantitative aspects such as frequency and duration, while neglecting the more subjective attributes such as perceived novelty, autonomy, and purpose. These provisional concepts support the development of measurement instructions and more comprehensive measurement instruments. Better measures allow for pinpointing what makes cognitive and social activities protective and may be useful to determine which participants could improve their activity engagement. This is essential for developing tailored interventions that effectively promote engagement in activities that foster healthy brain aging.",

          "abstract": "As a need state, hunger alters how we evaluate the rewarding perceptual properties of food. Whether this modulation targets specific components of food reward and to what extent it depends on the sensory modality through which food cues are presented remains understudied. This study examined whether hunger selectively modulates wanting versus liking for food, across visual and olfactory cues. Participants (N = 43) rated food, non-food, and disgusting stimuli during fasted and sated sessions, across the dimensions of liking and wanting. Our results show that hunger resulted in stronger increases in wanting for food cues than in liking. Contrary to expectations, this hunger-induced increase in wanting was more pronounced for food pictures than for food odors. Liking and wanting ratings for non-food cues remained unaffected regardless of state, though exploratory analyses suggested heightened wanting for aversive odors during hunger. Overall, our findings demonstrate that hunger selectively modulates motivational rather than hedonic components of reward in a content- and modality-specific manner. Taken together, our study highlights the need to consider both reward components and sensory modality when examining food reward. Systematic manipulation of these factors could enhance our understanding of multisensory reward integration in relation to food intake and provide insights that could inform interventions for maladaptive eating behaviors.",

The FESRS demonstrated strong internal consistency and a confirmed three-factor structure consisting of Sexual Desire, Orgasmic Capacity, and Altered States of Consciousness with significant positive associations between mindfulness and expanded sexual response. The exploratory analysis also showed significant higher scores for the older age groups in the Orgasmic Capacity subscale compared to the younger age group, possibly due to increased body awareness, or reduced performance anxiety. These findings highlight the potential of the FESRS as a psychometric tool for assessing multidimensional sexual response, emphasizing the interplay between mindfulness and sexual well-being, with implications for both clinical and research settings.",

          "abstract": "Recent studies using the variable choice paradigm for word-association learning task suggest that reward prediction errors (RPEs) enhance one-shot declarative learning. However, these studies may confound true associative learning with an “RPE bias,” where high-RPE items become more salient or fluent and are therefore chosen during recognition. This study tested whether such a bias exists and whether RPEs genuinely strengthen word-pair learning. Across three sessions, participants (N = 48) completed a modified version of the variable choice paradigm in which English-Swahili word pairs were learned under either high-RPE or no-RPE conditions. Results provided moderate evidence against an RPE bias: high-RPE words were not more likely to be selected when incorrect. In contrast, correctness strongly predicted choice, and correct translations associated with high RPEs were moderately more likely to be chosen than correct translations without RPEs, indicating a true learning benefit. Confidence analyses mirrored this pattern, showing clear effects of correctness but inconclusive effects of RPE. Together, these findings demonstrate that RPEs improve associative memory without producing choice biases. Our results validate previous conclusions about RPE-driven declarative learning benefits.",

          "abstract": "Adolescents’ communication with friends increasingly occurs online. Research on online communication with friends in adolescence has primarily focused on the quantity rather than the quality of interactions, such as feelings of support or rejection. Since offline friend support and rejection affect adolescents’ well- and ill-being, it is essential to understand how these dynamics unfold in online contexts, particularly for adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms, who may be especially sensitive to these experiences. In this preregistered 100 day diary study, 479 adolescents (Mage = 15.98, 54.9% girls; 96.9% Dutch) reported daily on their experiences of online friend support and rejection (cyberostracism), time spent communicating online with friends, and their well- and ill-being. Results showed that time spent communicating online with friends did not relate to adolescents’ well- and ill-being. Online friend support resulted in higher well-being and lower ill-being, while cyberostracism was related to lower well-being and higher ill-being. Adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms experienced intensified effects, both positive and negative, suggesting more vulnerability to everyday online social experiences but also increased benefit from online support. Altogether, this underscores the importance for parents and clinicians to foster open conversations to help adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms navigate their digital social world.",

          "abstract": "A common feature of contemporary sports-betting apps is ‘instant cash-out’, which allows users to settle a bet early in exchange for a discounted immediate payout. Despite high prevalence and links with gambling-related harm, relatively little is known about how personality traits associated with gambling, such as impulsivity, predict instant cash-out usage. To address this question, we recruited 145 general-population adult participants (69 men, 66 women, 10 non-binary or undisclosed; Mage = 36.3, SD = 10.7; participants resided in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, or the USA) to complete five self-report questionnaires related to impulsivity, as well as the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), and a validated cognitive task measuring individual differences in cash-out frequency. We then assessed how cash-out frequency in the behavioral task was associated with both self-reported impulsivity and PGSI. We found that cash-out frequency was negatively correlated both with PGSI scores and with a number of impulsivity-related traits including Dysfunctional Impulsivity, Lack of Premeditation, Positive Urgency, Sensation Seeking, and Fun Seeking. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that higher scores on a latent ‘Dysfunctional Impulsivity’ factor were negatively associated with cash-out frequency overall, whereas higher scores on an ‘Inhibition and Inflexibility’ factor predicted higher cash-out frequency specifically for bets with a low win probability. Taken together, results suggest that instant cash-out may primarily appeal to less impulsive people and those with lower PGSI scores. This raises the possibility that instant cash-out may specifically facilitate increased gambling behaviors among people with less prior experience of gambling.",

In the present paper we aim at reducing the gap between research, clinical practice, patients’ and their caregivers’ needs regarding disorders of consciousness. \nBy implementing a multidisciplinary and multidimensional approach, the paper focuses on disorders of consciousness: it starts from the review of some of the most promising measures of consciousness from brain activity (i.e., spectral measures, measures of functional connectivity, complexity-based measures). Next the paper introduces brain responses to illusions as a new indicator of consciousness (i.e., a feature that facilitates the attribution of consciousness), and illustrates the clinical operationalization of the indicators of consciousness through the case of virtual reality. Finally, the paper analyzes a set of urgent ethical issues and describes a model for assessing and dealing with those issues, concluding by elaborating key recommendations for improving the clinical treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness through a better translation of research into clinics.",

          "abstract": "Blue spaces such as coastlines and beaches are linked to psychological well-being, yet regular access to these spaces is often limited. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a way to simulate these environments, and multisensory presentations may enhance their restorative effects. Prior research in a virtual forest setting found evidence for supra-additive effects – where the combined influence of multiple modalities exceeds the sum of their individual effects. This study examined whether a similar effect occurs in a VR coastal scene. Seventy-nine participants experienced one of three five-minute conditions via a head-mounted display: visual-only (360° coastal video), auditory-only (ocean sounds in a neutral room), or combined visual-auditory presentation. Measures of positive and negative affect, affective valence and arousal, and nature connectedness were collected before and after exposure, whereas presence and immersion were assessed only post-intervention. The results reveal that exposure to visual input led to improvements in affective valence and nature connectedness, as well as a reduction in negative affect. The visual-auditory condition outperformed auditory-only exposure but showed no advantage over visual-only, indicating no supra-additive effect. Subjective ratings of beauty, pleasantness, restoration and presence were higher for visual and visual-auditory conditions compared to auditory-only. These findings suggest that in visually rich VR coastal settings, visual cues might dominate restorative outcomes, with limited incremental benefits from matching ocean sounds. The results inform VR nature intervention design, highlighting a potential context-dependent role of multisensory integration.",

One neurocognitive mechanistic model of ketamine’s antidepressant effect focusses on its impact on negative affective memories, namely making negatively valenced memories less salient. Here, we synthesise translational evidence from human and rodent studies which suggests that affective memory recall engages a distributed network areas including the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortical regions, with subgenual cingulate cortex potentially playing a key role in how NMDA receptor antagonists modulate the connectivity across this cognitive pathway. We discuss how experimental studies based on reinforcement-learning and value-based recall could be used to probe these systems and build mechanistic models of affective memory recall and fast-acting antidepressant action.",

Our integrated approach revealed that PD risk is influenced by an association of physiological, socioeconomic, and behavioural factors. Key predictive variables included cardiovascular measures (blood pressure patterns, cardiovascular fitness status), weight-related factors (weight at age 25, weight history), pain indicators (low back pain), and socioeconomic determinants (poverty-to-income ratio, education level). The model achieved a precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.81, demonstrating robust performance in distinguishing individuals at risk for PD. Our findings revealed associations between basic cardiovascular measures (blood pressure patterns, cardiovascular fitness) and PD risk, alongside socioeconomic and behavioural factors.

          "abstract": "This final chapter takes a broader look at the role of internal and external factors in the statistical analysis of natural language data. The distinction, it will be argued, helps us handle issues that are bound to arise when dealing with observational data. The focus will be on two problems that can arise in corpus-based variationist research: (i) representativeness, that is, the question of whether the sample mirrors the target population on relevant characteristics, and (ii) (multi-)collinearity, that is, a non-negligible level of association between predictor variables. This chapter demonstrates that the internal–external dichotomy allows us to approach these issues in a linguistically informed way. We start by arguing that the two types of factors differ fundamentally as regards questions of representativeness. Then we describe how the dichotomy allows us to deal with collinearity issues in a principled manner, using a model of the causal relations between predictor variables. As we will see, the non-trivial task of outlining such a model is facilitated by the distinction between internal and external predictor variables. The aim of this chapter is to submit a number of broader heuristics that may provide orientation for corpus-based research on language variation and change.",

Traditional research in creativity psychology minimizes researcher interference to maintain authenticity, primarily using post-factum interviews. In contrast, the RAO approach situates researchers as “obstacles” within the artist’s creative environment, providing close access to the artist’s “creative engine”, the underlying creative dynamic. Researchers intervene in real-time to capture shifts in pre-reflexive gestures and emerging meaning before they become conscious or verbalized. Drawing from anthropology and psychology, this framework emphasizes the value of researcher presence as a structured obstacle. This approach offers researchers a powerful tool for capturing creative processes in real-time, rarely accessible through traditional methods, by granting artists a finer awareness of their creative dynamics. This awareness can also serve as a valuable resource in art-based contexts.",

It is theorised that mixed contentions of bilingual advantage are brought about by an overgeneralised classification of bilinguals. Thus, the present study will adopt Green and Abutalebi (2013) Adaptive Control Hypothesis in evaluating bilingual advantage across different language contexts; single-language, dual-language, and monolinguals. Participants were 366 undergraduate psychology students who completed a combined Go or no-go arrow Flanker task to measure interference control and selective response inhibition. Then, participants were asked to complete a language questionnaire to determine which language group they belong to. We found no significant difference between language groups in flanker effect (p = .014) and no-go accuracy (p = .007) which signifies no difference in inhibitory control among single-language-context, dual-language-context, and monolinguals. Therefore, the present study rejects the notion of bilingual advantage on EFs. Nevertheless, study results might have been confounded by potential error in language classification and types of scale used to operationalise inhibition.

Pretenders accurately mimicked broad aspects of genuine play, including the number of guesses required to reach a solution, as well as subtle patterns, such as effects of decision uncertainty on decision time. While peers were unable to detect pretense, statistical analysis and computational modeling uncovered traces of ‘over-acting’ in pretenders’ decisions, suggesting a schematic simulation of their minds.

          "abstract": "Everyday navigation requires people to use landmark information online while forming longer-term spatial representations. The present study asked whether attribute amnesia (AA) – a failure to report recently attended, task-relevant features – also occurs during landmark-guided navigation, and how it affects spatial memory. In two experiments (N = 80), participants navigated virtual mazes by following colored arrows at intersections, either on a desktop display (Experiment 1) or in immersive VR (Experiment 2). In an Identity-Test group, surprise identity probes asked for the color of the landmark at critical intersections; a Navigation-Only group performed the same navigation without probes. Across both display formats, navigation accuracy was perfect, yet identity reports on the first surprise trial were at chance and recovered only once testing was anticipated, demonstrating robust AA in a continuous, ecologically embedded navigation task. A second maze without identity tests assessed whether landmark identity was incorporated into longer-term spatial representations via color recall and route reconstruction. Landmark colors were remembered poorly overall, indicating that behaviorally critical identity information was largely excluded from durable spatial representations. Probing landmark identity impaired the consolidation of a complete route scaffold on the desktop but not in VR, where route memory remained intact. These findings show that AA generalizes to navigation and that embodied cues in immersive VR can buffer its costs for route knowledge.",

I call this new interdisciplinary approach ‘autistic linguistic justice’, and introduce five concepts to help initiate research and advocacy on this topic. The concepts I introduce are: the sociolinguistics of securitization, language revitalization, linguistic human rights, language policy and planning, and language ethics. Each concept is briefly introduced, and examples are given of how they can be applied to accommodating autistic communication. In the conclusion, I provide recommendations for how families, practitioners (such as teachers, doctors, etc), autism researchers, and autistic people use these concepts to help build autistic linguistic justice together. Given that many of the concepts I draw on have been developed by other minoritized communities, I emphasize the need for building respectful and mutually beneficial solidarity with these communities.",

We developed a two-stage topic-modeling pipeline with BERTopic and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct to extract and optimize clinically meaningful themes from participants’ qualitative descriptions of suicidal urges. We identified 13 (Study 1) and 15 (Study 2) topics reflecting the content of suicidal thoughts (e.g., Active Suicidal Ideation, Family/Friends Reactions, Depressed/Exhausted), which varied across severity ratings. Within- and between-person consistency followed a U-shaped pattern, with the highest agreement at endpoints and greater variability and ambiguity in the middle of the scale. Together, our findings revealed remarkable heterogeneity in the interpretation of suicidal urge severity, and highlight the potential of LLMs as a scalable method for advancing our understanding of how people interpret and respond to self-report rating scales.",

          "authors": "Jay Joseph",
          "abstract": "The mainstream psychiatry literature contains the ubiquitous and mostly unchallenged claim that schizophrenia is roughly 80% heritable. A 2003 twin study meta-analysis by genetic researchers Patrick F. Sullivan, Kenneth S. Kendler, and Michael C. Neale is often cited in support of this claim. The author argues that the 81% heritability estimate Sullivan and colleagues produced is invalid because (1) schizophrenia twin studies should not be interpreted genetically because they are based on the unsupported assumption that reared-together MZ (identical) and same-sex DZ (fraternal) twin pairs grow up experiencing “equal environments”; (2) especially in the older studies, schizophrenia was not reliably identified (diagnosed) for research purposes; and (3) among other problems, heritability estimates do not indicate the “strength” or “magnitude” of supposed genetic influences. The author then discusses how Sullivan and colleagues performed their meta-analysis and their decisions on which twin studies to include or exclude. They failed to mention three schizophrenia twin studies, two of which were known to at least one of the co-authors. They decided to “relax” their original meta-analysis inclusion criteria because only four studies qualified. This decision led to their inclusion of mid-20th-century studies conducted by researchers with strong genetic confirmation biases, who did not define schizophrenia or make blindfolded diagnoses. The author concludes that Sullivan and colleagues’ 81% schizophrenia heritability estimate should be disregarded in the context of a proposed replication crisis era re-evaluation of behavioral twin studies and their underlying assumptions. More than six decades of failed DNA-based attempts to identify genes that cause schizophrenia support this conclusion.",

          "abstract": "Objective. To develop and validate a computational framework that infers\nindividualized attention strategies and latent distraction states to support personalized\nmodeling of multitasking behavior and intervention.\nBackground. Driver distraction from in-vehicle systems is a growing safety\nconcern. However, the level of distraction is often latent and varies significantly across\nindividuals. Existing models typically overlook these differences, limiting their effective use\nfor personalized interventions.\nMethod. We introduce a Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process\n(POSMDP) to model hidden attentional dynamics and attention allocation decisions. Using\nbehavioral data, including glance behavior, velocity, and pupillometry, from a high-fidelity\ndriving simulator with 18 participants, we estimate personalized reward functions that\nreflect each driver’s subjective valuation of secondary task utility versus safety cost.\nResults. The method accurately infers distraction states and recovers\nparticipant-specific utility weights governing the trade-off between secondary task benefit\nand driving cost. Compared to a well-established 2-second glance rule, it improves\ndetection of distraction events and reveals individual variability in attention strategies.\nSome drivers exhibit highly conservative profiles, while others assign greater value to\nsecondary tasks, even under high distraction. Counterfactual simulations show how\nperceived task importance could modulate visual attention behavior across individuals.\nConclusion. Our POSMDP-based framework provides an interpretable and\nindividualized account of driver attention allocation, capturing both latent states and\nbehavioral variability.\nApplication. This model enables the development of personalized, risk-sensitive\ndriver assistance systems that adapt to individual attention strategies, enhancing road\nsafety through context-aware, graded interventions.",

In this brief paper, I illustrate this bias using a recent example: namely, a study that found evidence for ''disinhibition'' and ''distractibility'' being implicated in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, yet erroneously concluded that this is evidence for ''personality pathology'' being implicated in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. It is important to emphasise that my critique here does not aim to be a judgemental nit-picking of this particular study. Instead, my critique aims to highlight how widespread this bias is in the hopes of making research on personality (pathology) more scientifically accurate and humane.",

The PM decision control (PMDC) model quantifies the dual mechanisms of cognitive control (proactive and reactive, Braver, 2012) that support PM. Here, we test a key prediction of the dual-mechanisms theory: that cognitive control will shift from proactive to reactive as the need for control lessens due to PM targets being infrequent. Participants made lexical decisions (ongoing task) and were presented blocks of trials which either contained no PM targets, a high PM target frequency (19% of trials), or a low PM target frequency (5%). We fit the behavioural data with an extended version of PMDC that was augmented to specify the ongoing-task habituation and PM learning dynamics required to account for the way in which participants adapted their behaviour as a function of task practice and expected PM target frequency. PM costs (ongoing task response slowing in PM conditions relative to no PM target condition) were observed only in the high frequency condition, explained by PMDC by an increase in proactive control. PM accuracy was similar across high and low frequency conditions early in the experiment, but later an advantage emerged for the lower frequency PM task. PMDC accounted for this with stronger reactive control in low frequency condition that increased over practice. Our results confirm the prediction that control shifts from proactive to reactive with lower target event frequency, respond to recent calls from the PM literature for theory to account for across-trial dynamics.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) has emerged as a promising technology for non-invasive, spatiotemporally precise modulation of human brain activity, offering access to deep structures beyond the reach of electromagnetic methods. Yet, its parameter-effect relationships remain poorly understood, particularly across different anatomical targets. Here, we systematically synthesize human LIFU studies to compare how acoustic parameters—especially pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and duty cycle (DC)—shape neuronal and behavioral neuromodulatory outcomes in cortical versus subcortical regions. Cortical stimulation shows a nonlinear parameter landscape, with facilitation emerging in low-PRF/low-DC and high-PRF/high-DC regimes, and suppression predominating in the intermediate PRF-DC combinations. By contrast, subcortical stimulation exhibits a more monotonic trend along the DC axis: suppression dominates at lower DC across a wide PRF range, while facilitation is largely confined to higher DC regimes. These divergent landscapes delineate clearer parameter boundaries between cortical and subcortical targets. We interpret these target-dependent differences through cellular, cytoarchitectural, network-level, and acoustic mechanisms. Together, these findings sketch emerging principles for a mechanistically grounded parameter framework for human LIFU neuromodulation",

This study compares classical prediction models—probit regression and latent‐variable structural equation models (SEM)—with instrumental‐variable (IV) extensions to examine both prediction and causal inference in the context of a validated risk protocol (RisCanvi) used in Catalonia. Guided by a large automated meta-analysis of over 300,000 publications on violence and recidivism, we selected four core criminogenic domains—antisocial traits, antisocial history and peers, work/social instability, and substance use—and modelled 3-year recidivism in a cohort of individuals assessed with RisCanvi between 2015 and 2023. Classical SEM achieved the highest discrimination (AUC ≈ .74) but poor calibration, whereas probit models were well calibrated but had very low sensitivity. IV-SEM preserved discrimination while substantially increasing the estimated effects of criminogenic needs and achieving the highest sensitivity, at the cost of worse calibration. IV-probit produced calibrated probabilities and modest gains in discrimination over classical probit. These findings illustrate a methodological “division of labour”: classical models provide transparent, well-calibrated risk estimates for routine decisions, while IV-based models offer stronger evidence on which criminogenic needs are true levers for change, informing the design and targeting of interventions and policy in recidivism reduction.",

          "abstract": "Bilingualism is known to affect lexical retrieval speed, particularly in second language (L2) production, but its impact on native language (L1) naming remains unclear. We investigated how word-level properties (lexical frequency and cognate status) and individual experience with L2 (AoA, proficiency, use, and immersion history) shape L1 naming. English–French bilinguals were overall slower than English monolinguals, with the largest L1 naming costs being observed for low-frequency non-cognates, consistent with frequency-driven weakening of lexical representations. Exploratory individual-difference analyses revealed that current L2 use (but not L2 AoA, proficiency, or immersion history) predicted L1 slowing. Further, greater L2 use was associated with disproportionate slowing for high-frequency non-cognates. Together, the findings support two complementary mechanisms of bilingual lexical regulation: (a) long-term representational weakening that affects low-frequency, L1-unique words, and (b) short-term inhibition associated with active L2 use that slows highly accessible L1-unique words. These findings indicate that L1 naming costs are not global but emerge from the interplay of lexical characteristics and bilingual language experience.",

          "abstract": "The correlates of mind wandering are well studied in younger adult samples. However, little is known about the correlates of mind wandering among older adults. The current study took a comprehensive approach to investigating age-related differences in the correlates of mind wandering. Participants (N = 150 younger and N = 150 older adults) completed a series of attention tasks. During some of these tasks, participants were periodically probed to report on their mind wandering experiences. Additionally, participants completed several questionnaires capturing theoretically relevant constructs such as motivation, affect, and dispositional factors. We used confirmatory factor analysis to assess correlations between our predictors and mind wandering at the construct level. We found that some factors (e.g., task-based motivation) were significantly correlated in both age groups, while other factors were significant correlates in one age group but not the other. Despite these apparent differences, many of the correlations did not statistically differ across the groups. We did find, however, that the association between behavioral attention lapses and mind wandering was significantly stronger in younger adults compared to older adults. A secondary aim of the current study was to replicate and extend prior work examining the mediating factors in the age-mind wandering relationship. Consistent with prior findings, we showed that motivational and affective factors only partially mediated the relationship between age and mind wandering. Our findings can help inform and refine theories of mind wandering by showing that key predictors of mind wandering are largely consistent across younger and older adults.",

          "abstract": "Humans frequently pursue moving objects that temporarily disappear from view, yet the control strategies underlying successful interception remain debated. While some theories emphasize on-line guidance via optic flow, others propose that interception is maintained through internal models of target motion. We tested a two-stage hybrid control hypothesis in which individuals initially rely on optic flow to guide movement but switch to model-based prediction when visual input is withdrawn. In two immersive virtual reality experiments, participants intercepted a moving target (a bunny or hare) that disappeared partway through its trajectory. In Experiment 1 (N = 18), participants walked to intercept a cartoon bunny under varying path (linear or zigzag) and visibility conditions (fully visible, disappear-reappear, or disappear). Interception performance decreased following disappearance but remained above chance, and curved walking trajectories only emerged when participants began moving before the target appeared, challenging classic optic-flow–based models. In Experiment 2 (N = 41), participants attempted to “shoot” a hare after it disappeared, with visible time and distance factorially manipulated. Capture success increased linearly with visible time but plateaued with visible distance, suggesting that temporal exposure, not spatial extent, determines the quality of predictive control. Together, the findings support a two-stage, effector-invariant interception strategy in which brief visual exposure (~1–1.5 s) seeds a predictive controller that allows action to continue when visual information is lost.",

          "abstract": "Antisemitism, a persistent form of cultural prejudice, is increasingly manifesting in subtle and modernized forms within contemporary society. This study examined how cultural representations of Jews are encoded in large language models (LLMs), which absorb societal discourse through training on vast corpora of human-generated text. To investigate these representations, we developed an indirect methodology: generating character biographies using Jewish and non-Jewish names, removing overt identity markers, and prompting the LLM to evaluate a range of psychological and sociocultural traits. Characters associated with Jewish (vs. non-Jewish) names were consistently rated as more competent, privileged, dominant, self-controlled, future-oriented, hierarchical, and obsessive—and as less likable and less collectivistic. When these trait profiles were mapped onto fictional characters, they aligned with archetypes historically associated with antisemitic tropes. These findings demonstrate how latent stereotypes can persist in AI systems despite explicit bias mitigation, highlighting the adaptability of prejudice and the structural embedding of cultural archetypes in contemporary technologies.",

The theory posits that Asian Americans, more than any other racial group in the United States, are uniquely juxtaposed against Black people both historically and social-cognitively. The racial contrast between Asian and Black Americans serves two interrelated functions: to maintain White supremacy (i.e., the ideology that centers White people and Whiteness as the ideal and unspoken default) and to justify anti-Black racism (i.e., the ideology that Black people and Blackness are inferior). This paper reviews the unique juxtaposing role that Asian Americans play in perpetuating these two ideologies, and it describes how racial contrast theory can synthesize and organize seemingly disparate social psychological theories. By moving beyond the traditional Black-White framework to emphasize the contrasting roles of Asian Americans in perpetuating White supremacy and anti-Black racism, racial contrast theory challenges traditional approaches to intergroup dynamics.",

(2022) demonstrated that participants preferred speech samples exhibiting a pronunciation pattern that was associated with a “teacher” over that of a “student” in a simulated language classroom context, indicating that language learners differentially weigh their input based on characteristics of the speaker. We extend this work by investigating whether preferences for the teacher’s pronunciation could be modulated by attributing “favorable” versus “unfavorable” social characteristics to the teacher regarding their teaching experience, teaching effectiveness, and linguistic background. We found that participants still tended to prefer the teacher’s pronunciation, but that this preference was reduced when the teacher had been characterized unfavorably. We thus provide evidence that preferences for speech input from teachers are modulated by beliefs about the social characteristics of the teacher, contributing to our understanding of linguistic stereotyping and its impact on language teaching and learning.",

          "abstract": "Does visuospatial attention influence temporal cognition? In Study 1, we investigated whether gaze direction can modulate different aspects of temporal processing. Participants performed a Mental Time Travel (MTT) task judging the likelihood of past and future life events while their visuospatial attention was oriented by facial gaze cues directed leftward, rightward, or centrally (Experiment 1). To test whether visuospatial attention modulates representation of temporal duration (e.g., age estimation), participants completed an Age Judgment task estimating the age of face stimuli under the same gaze manipulations (Experiment 2). Results showed direction-specific effects in the MTT task: leftward gaze enhanced probability judgments for past events, while rightward gaze enhanced judgments for future events. In the Age Judgment task, gaze systematically biased perceived age, with leftward cues yielding younger estimates and rightward cues yielding older estimates. In Study 2, we tested whether these gaze-related effects require a lateralized bodily stimulus (a face) or reflect a general modulation of visuospatial attention. We used optokinetic stimulation (OKS) to shift visuospatial attention without lateralized bodily cues. OKS produced weaker direction-specific effects on the MTT task compared to gaze, but generated similar biases in the Age Judgment task. These findings indicate that visuospatial attention shapes temporal cognition through partially distinct neurocognitive routes: embodied cues like gaze facilitate self-projection during MTT, whereas body-unrelated manipulations such as OKS are sufficient to modulate temporal estimation along a Mental Time Line. Overall, these results reinforce the view that time is processed within a visuomotor architecture linking space, time, and the body.",

          "abstract": "Striving for social status is a fundamental human motive, yet individuals vary considerably in their status-seeking tendencies. Drawing on attachment literature and life history theory, we propose that attachment anxiety drives status pursuit through heightened intrasexual competition. Across six preregistered studies (N = 4,456) spanning five countries, we found that attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, predicts stronger status strivings. This relationship is mediated by intrasexual competition—competing with same-sex rivals—rather than, as previously documented, by materialism or general competitiveness. Experimental evidence confirmed causality: inducing attachment anxiety (vs. avoidance) increased desire for high-status cars and houses through heightened intrasexual competition. A moderation-of-process design demonstrated that experimentally manipulating intrasexual competition correspondingly enhanced or reduced the effect of attachment anxiety on status strivings, but only for high-status possessions. These effects held for both men and women. Our findings show that anxiously attached individuals pursue status to compensate for relational insecurities, and they do so by competing with same-sex rivals. This research extends attachment theory to status pursuit and clarifies whether, when, and why individual differences in attachment patterns predict people’s status strivings.",

          "abstract": "For face-to-face communication to flow smoothly, people engage in various activities, such as taking turns rapidly, using hand gestures, and aligning in word choices and gestures, to name a few. Nowadays, many conversations occur on videoconferencing platforms, making them important settings for social interactions. However, it is underexplored how these multimodal conversational features compare across modes of communication. By analyzing two corpora of multimodal interactions—one for co-present face-to-face interaction and the other for video-mediated interaction—we found strikingly similar patterns of speech and gesture production across modes of communication. In particular, we found a great amount of overlap in the distributions of floor transition offset (FTO), turn-length, the frequency and size of co-speech gestures, and the frequencies of lexical and gestural alignment, across conversational rounds. However, there were also differences: Online video-mediated communication was associated with (i) longer floor transfer offsets (454 ms) and fewer overlaps, (ii) a greater reduction in the number of words over time, (iii) a lower lexical alignment rate at the beginning of the conversation, and (iv) a greater proportion of alignment of iconic gestures with similar forms than face to face communication. These findings suggest that the fundamental dynamics of conversation are nearly identical between co-present face-to-face and video-mediated interactions, but video-mediated communication modulates some aspects of speech-related interactive language use more than those of co-speech gestures.",

          "abstract": "Aims. This study aimed to examine the effects of chronic and acute stress and racial discrimination on daily alcohol craving and compare these associations between Black and White young adults. \nDesign. Participants completed baseline assessments followed by a 17-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol.\nSetting. Non-treatment seeking, community sample from Western Pennsylvania, United States\nParticipants. Young adults aged 21-30 (n = 166), who reported at least weekly alcohol use and at least three occasions of consuming 4+/5+ drinks for female/male participants in the past three months. 41.57% of participants identified as Black/African American and 58.43% of participants identified as White; 68.64% were assigned female at birth. \nMeasurements. Baseline assessments included sociodemographic characteristics and measures of chronic stress and racial discrimination. EMA protocol captured acute stress, discrimination, and craving. Linear multilevel models tested main and interactive effects of chronic and acute forms of stress and discrimination on daily craving. \nFindings. Between-person acute stress predicted higher craving (B = 1.25, SE = 0.27, p &lt; .001). Craving also increased within person on high-stress days, particularly among those with greater chronic stress (B = 0.33, SE = 0.15, p = .025). Chronic (B = 0.55, SE = 0.17, p = .001). Within-person acute discrimination (B = 2.21, SE = 0.90, p = .014) predicted higher craving among Black, but not White, participants. This was qualified by a significant three-way interaction showing that for Black participants, higher chronic discrimination weakened the association between within-person acute discrimination and alcohol craving (B = –0.64, SE = 0.28, p = .024).\nConclusion: Chronic stress may enhance the impact of acute stress increasing craving and ultimately alcohol use. Additionally, both chronic and acute discrimination experiences were related to elevated craving. Further research examining domains of chronic and acute stressors beyond general and discrimination is needed given the differential findings and treatment implications.",

          "abstract": "Some impossible things are more impossible than others. Magically levitating a feather is easier than levitating a rock, even though both are impossible in the real world. But within the things that are inconceivable—e.g., \"the concept of red writing a play\" or \"a girl being a prime number\"—are some things more inconceivable than others? We first established that people have graded, systematic judgments about the likelihood of inconceivable events (Experiment 1). We then examined three hypotheses as to how people make such judgments: the likelihood of the event description string (Experiment 2); the ease of a metaphorical interpretation (Experiment 3); and the difficulty of transforming a nonsense statement into a sensible one, as measured by distance in a type hierarchy (Experiment 4). We found that graded judgments of inconceivability are not captured by string likelihood, nor by metaphorizability, but do correspond to a measure of distance in a type hierarchy. Our results suggest that inconceivability is graded, and the perceived likelihood of an inconceivable event may be a product of one's ontology of the world.",

          "abstract": "Many Latino and Asian Americans have ingrained the ethos of meritocracy to justify their arduous attempts to achieve the elusive American Dream. Such staunch meritocratic ideology, however, insidiously motivates individuals to support policies that may discriminate against them. In a current political landscape that is increasingly anti-immigration, Latino and Asian Americans are particularly vulnerable to deportation efforts. However, the concern (and even support) for deportation is not universally shared among the two largest immigrant groups in the United States. This research examined the extent to which meritocratic ideology predicts stronger support for deportation policies and alleviates deportation fears for oneself and close others among Latino and Asian Americans. Using data from the 2020 and 2024 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Surveys, we found that stauncher meritocratic ideology among both Latino and Asian Americans predicted greater support for deportation policies and less concern about deportation. This research demonstrates that meritocratic ideology may promote attitudes that disproportionately impact Latino and Asian Americans’ own racial ingroup.",

          "abstract": "In many real-life situations learning is an active process of engaging with new information, experimenting and integrating new experiences to build meaningful understanding. However, learning can have either a more active or more passive form and several factors may influence how effectively individuals learn  new information in both cases. One such factor is the sense of agency, which refers to the subjective feeling of control over one’s actions, and it distinguishes active experience from passive observation. The present study aims to investigate whether differences in the sense of agency affect learning, as evaluated using the artificial grammar learning task. Participants were assigned to either an active condition, where they had full control over responses, or a passive condition, where they mostly passively observed the computer performing the task and were learning through observation. At the end of the experiment, they rated their perceived control. Results showed that participants in the active condition reported a stronger sense of agency and demonstrated higher accuracy from the very beginning of the task compared to those in the passive condition. Although both groups improved with repeated trials at a similar rate, the initial advantage for the active group persisted throughout the experiment. Overall, our study suggests that sense of agency can influence learning, and that learning is more effective when individuals feel in control of their actions.",

          "authors": "Benjamin Motz; Anna Chinni; Audrey Barriball; Danielle McNamara",
          "abstract": "Extensive research has demonstrated that testing enhances long-term memory by strengthening retrieval processes for the tested memory traces. Such memory models explain why learners benefit from repeated testing but do not account for how learners construct understanding across multiple ideas. In contrast, theories of discourse comprehension emphasize the construction of inferences, whereby learners actively connect ideas into a coherent mental representation. These two perspectives—memory-based retrieval versus inference-based integration—make distinct predictions about what learners retain and understand. The present study tested these predictions by comparing self-testing, self-explanation, and reading strategies on both fact memory and inference performance. In Experiment 1 (n = 254), despite superior retention of individual facts, self-testing produced lower inference performance than self-explanation. Experiment 2 (n = 68), a preregistered replication with a minimum 24-hour delay, confirmed and extended these findings: repeated retrieval improved recall of facts but did not facilitate the assembly of coherent knowledge structures. A mixed-methods analysis revealed that generating inferences during learning specifically predicted inference performance, whereas noting facts predicted fact recall, providing converging evidence that these strategies produce qualitatively different mental representations. Furthermore, participants generated fewer inferences when self-explaining science texts compared with narratives, highlighting domain differences in the ease of knowledge integration. Together, these results demonstrate that while self-testing strengthens memory for discrete information, it fails to foster the integrative processing necessary for comprehension. Effective learning requires more than strengthening retrieval processes—it depends on the active generation of inferences that bind ideas into coherent mental models.",

          "abstract": "Abstract \nBackground \nBehavioural studies suggest atypical/delayed development of “theory of mind” (ToM; our ability to reason about others’ mental states) following preterm birth. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether behavioural differences are likely the result of preterm birth specifically impacting neural ToM development, as evidenced by differences in brain regions recruited for ToM reasoning (“ToM network”). \n \nMethods \nUsing fMRI and behavioural ToM tasks with five-year-old children born at 24-42 weeks’ GA, we tested for an effect of gestational age (GA) on behavioural ToM performance, functional maturation of the ToM network, response magnitude to ToM movie scenes, and inter-region correlations. Additionally, we leveraged an open dataset and intersubject correlation analyses to measure similarity of neural ToM responses within and across preterm- and term-born children; including younger (3–4-year-old) children via the open dataset enabled testing for evidence of developmental delays among children born preterm. \n\nResults \nBehaviourally, preterm-born children scored lower on our primary behavioural ToM task, and on a measure of receptive language, compared to term-born children. Neurally, ToM network responses during a short movie were similar across preterm- and term-born children. There was no effect of GA on functional maturation or on the response magnitude in ToM regions to two of three ToM scenes. Response magnitude in ToM regions to a third scene was lower among preterm-born children relative to term-born children, but responses to this scene were also low among adults. Both term- and preterm-born children showed functionally distinct ToM network responses. While ToM network responses were more heterogenous among preterm-born children, responses in individual preterm-born children were most similar to (correlated with) same-age term-born children, relative to other preterm-born children or younger (3–4-year-old) term-born children. \n\nConclusions \nPreterm birth does not preclude broadly similar functional development in ToM brain regions by age five years.",

          "authors": "Armin Klaps; Birgit Ursula Stetina",
          "abstract": "The internet has become a transformative space for marginalized and stigmatized populations, providing anonymity and a platform for community building. Zoophilic communities, often hidden from mainstream discourse, use online forums to connect, share resources, and seek emotional support. This study examines the so-called hidden population of individuals with zoophile interests, aiming to analyze the psychological needs within these digital environments. Using a mixed-methods design that employed grounded theory in collaboration with an active zoophile forum, 30 narrative interviews were conducted with community members, and 2234 respondents were surveyed online (a subgroup from a larger research project), focusing on their reasons for participating in zoophilia forums. The interview analysis resulted in a code system that was applied to the survey data set using MAXQDA software. The results reveal three main psychological needs that drive participation in zoophilic forums: autonomy (freedom to express one's identity), competence (sharing information and activism), and relatedness (emotional support and community). These needs align with the Self-Determination Theory, which emphasizes how online communities provide a safe space for individuals to satisfy psychological needs that are often unfulfilled offline. The findings reveal that online forums serve as crucial spaces for zoophiles to satisfy fundamental psychological needs, particularly in the face of societal stigma and marginalization. Understanding these dynamics can inform more nuanced approaches to mental health support for this specific group and potentially hidden populations in general.",

          "abstract": "Care for youngsters in residential settings is often disorder focused rather than based on a holistic understanding of their unique developmental histories. In this study, we used a lifeline drawing method, inspired by complex systems theory, to map the life histories and broader developmental contexts of young people with residential living experience. Lifelines of wellbeing were analyzed for distinct dynamic patterns to arrive at a process explanation of how person-environment interactions shape the onset and maintenance of psychological suffering and recovery. Lifeline interviews were conducted with seven adolescents with residential living experience. Each lifeline was segmented and coded for the functioning of the person and their environment. We then sought for dynamic patterns that were repeated within and across cases. The overall line shape showed that youth experienced the majority of their lives as hardship and that their psychological problems worsened over time. While idiosyncratic in content, we found general dynamics (patterns of stability, fluctuations, and diverse change patterns) that could be linked to distinct developmental mechanisms. Fluctuating patterns pointed towards periods of instability (or crisis), during which youth appeared more sensitive to external stressors, and which typically marked the start of recovery. Whereas the worsening of youths’ problems typically occurred fast, recovery was a much slower process which required an autonomy-supported living environment, psychological interventions, and/or changes in youths’ school or living environment. We call for an interaction-based approach to diagnosis and care, in which psychological suffering is understood in the light of a person’s history and developmental context.",

          "abstract": "Rapid advancements in technology have sparked growing interest in cognitive enhancement methods and in their potential to improve cognitive abilities, such as attention, memory, and intelligence. While these methods—such as brain stimulation, pharmaceutical interventions, and gamified brain training—have yet to consistently demonstrate their effectiveness in improving broader cognitive abilities, they are the subject of increasing exploration and application. Understanding who would be willing to enhance their cognitive abilities and why is crucial as these technologies become more popular and accessible in society.\nThus, in two preregistered lab studies, we investigated individuals’ acceptance (i.e. willingness to make use) of various cognitive enhancement methods, tested predictors thereof, and explored individuals’ motives to utilize enhancement methods or be reluctant to do so. \nIn Study 1 (N = 203), we found considerably higher acceptance for more active (i.e. more involved) than passive enhancement methods. Lower age, greater interest in science fiction, and stronger investigative interests (partially) predicted participants’ acceptance of cognitive enhancement, while personality traits, self-assessed and measured intelligence did not.\nIn Study 2 (N = 197), we aimed to (conceptually) replicate key findings from Study 1, and in addition qualitatively assess the motives for the acceptance and rejection of enhancement. Our findings confirmed the higher acceptance of active than passive methods. Additionally, we found that greater interest in science fiction and (partially) higher psychometric intelligence predicted participants’ acceptance of cognitive enhancement, while personality traits and self-assessed intelligence did not. Qualitative analyses provided exploratory insights into the motives for accepting or rejecting active and passive enhancement methods.\nAcross these two studies, our findings indicate that attitudes toward cognitive enhancement are complex and influenced by multiple factors. We emphasize the importance of studying situational factors, such as person-environment fit, to better understand the willingness to make use of cognitive enhancement.",

Using semi-structured interviews with 20 girls aged 13–21, the study examined how family dynamics and parental neglect shape help-seeking behavior. Participants described experiences of anxiety, emotional distress, trauma-related symptoms, and reliance on maladaptive coping strategies. A dominant theme was the intergenerational pattern of emotional avoidance within families, where mental-health conversations are discouraged or dismissed. Contributing factors included conservative norms, fear of judgment, limited parent–child communication, and low awareness of mental-health resources. The findings indicate that emotional unavailability at home restricts adolescents’ willingness to disclose distress, leading them to seek support from peers, online communities, or strangers. These results highlight the need for family-centered mental-health literacy initiatives and early interventions that promote open dialogue within households.",

          "abstract": "Prejudice and stereotypes are central constructs in social psychology; however, the instruments used to measure them vary in terms of their quality and conceptual clarity. This preregistered systematic review presents the first comprehensive, cross-method synthesis of the psychometric properties and theoretical foundations of measures assessing racial and ethnic prejudice and stereotypes. Following PRISMA and COSMIN guidelines, we screened 13,363 records and included 263 studies published between 1951 and 2024. We evaluated, among other things, reliability, validity, factor structure, measurement invariance, and conceptual alignment across explicit, implicit, and behavioral instruments. Our findings reveal a field that is methodologically diverse but psychometrically fragile. Most measures were developed with U.S. samples, rarely assessed temporal stability, discriminant or predictive validity, and often lack theoretical–empirical coherence. The GRADE synthesis indicated that only 4% of methods achieved high-quality evidence, while the majority showed serious inconsistency and risk of bias. Conceptually, only one-third of studies clearly defined prejudice, and most operationalized it narrowly at the cognitive, individual level, neglecting affective and behavioral dimensions. The review highlights how conceptual ambiguity and inadequate validation threaten the interpretability of decades of prejudice and stereotype research. We recommend greater construct clarity, multimethod integration of explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures, and stronger adoption of transparent research practices. Taken together, these findings call for a new generation of measurement tools that are psychometrically rigorous, theoretically coherent, and culturally sensitive—capable of capturing prejudice as a dynamic, multidimensional phenomenon.",

However, previous research has been limited in geographic scope and often overlooks how broader societal stressors beyond school influence adolescent wellbeing. \n\nObjectives: This study examined the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among Kenyan adolescents and investigated associations with exposure to political violence, climate change anxiety, and COVID-19-related stress.\n\nMethods: This cross-sectional study surveyed 5,592 students aged 12–23 years from 42 secondary schools across four Kenyan counties. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Separate cohorts completed measures of climate change anxiety and COVID-19 stress (n=2,856) or exposure to ethnic-political violence (n=2,727). Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, and multivariate regression models controlling for age, gender, co-curricular activities, and parental education.\n\nResults: Overall prevalence of clinically significant depression and anxiety symptoms (cutoff ≥10) was 27.7% and 23.8%, respectively. Female participants reported higher rates in moderate to severe depression (25.2% vs 20.0%) and anxiety (24.0% vs 19.1%) categories; however, gender differences in reporting may reflect both differential symptom manifestation and greater help-seeking or emotional literacy among girls. Climate change anxiety and COVID-19 stress demonstrated the significant associations (p&lt;.001) with both depression (r=0.31, r=0.19, respectively) and anxiety (r=0.40, r=0.26, respectively). Political violence exposure was widespread, with 52.5% reporting exposure to violent media content and 25% reporting discrimination; however, individual political violence items showed small to moderate correlations with mental health outcomes (r=0.12-0.22). Indirect or second-hand experiences of political violence—such as having a friend or family member affected—were strong predictors of depressive symptoms. Older adolescents and girls consistently reported higher distress across all stressors. Father's education showed protective associations with anxiety, while mother's education demonstrated mixed or positive associations. \n\nConclusions: Kenyan adolescents are contending with multiple, overlapping stressors that compound mental health risks, with climate change and COVID-19 stress appearing as particularly salient contributors. Girls and younger adolescents appear particularly vulnerable. Addressing these challenges requires gender-responsive, school- and community-based interventions that integrate trauma-informed care, climate education, and media literacy, alongside longitudinal research to track the evolving impact of global crises on youth mental health.",

Touch observation plays a pivotal role in social cognition, as tactile interactions convey emotional and social information essential for interpersonal understanding. However, research in this domain is hindered by the scarcity of standardised databases and the heterogeneity of experimental controls. To address these limitations, we developed the Socio-Tactile Picture database, which includes positive tactile gestures (Social Touch), along with two control conditions: a Social No-Touch condition (to isolate social interaction effects) and a Non-Social Touch condition (to control for human tactile specificity). The novelty in the database resides in the inclusion of stimuli from the three aforementioned conditions, combined with gender balance achieved through three actor dyads.\nThe database was validated via an online experiment, where participants rated stimuli on valence, arousal, and naturalness across two sessions. Results showed that the database presented good intra-subject and inter-actor consistency. Moreover, social touch pictures were consistently rated as positive in valence, as hypothesised. \nThe database is publicly available to support future research on the perception of observed touch, offering a robust tool for experimental investigations.",

          "abstract": "The psychology of conspiracy theories is built on convenience samples of individuals who mostly reject conspiracy theories. Inference about strong conspiracy believers – who are largely absent from research samples – rests on two generalisability assumptions. The first, interpretation generalisability, assumes a sample’s average level of conspiracy (dis)belief does not significantly alter the theoretical interpretation of relationships. The second, range generalisability, holds that statistical relationships observed among low-to-moderate conspiracy believers are generalisable to stronger believers. Recent work on contradictory conspiracy beliefs shows that these assumptions can be misleading, highlighting the need to reflect on the conditions of generalisations. In the case of interpretation generalisability, we propose that relationships observed among low-to-moderate believers might be better interpreted as capturing differences in plausibility perceptions – because what differentiates people who “neither agree nor disagree” with a conspiracy theory from people who reject it is arguably the fact that they are open to the possibility that it could be true. Such relationships are informative, yet the differences between perceptions of plausibility and factuality (i.e., the sense that a conspiracy is true) should be considered before generalising conclusions to strong believers. As for range generalisability, we argue for a case-by-case evaluation for the possibility that relationships might be non-linear across the full range of agreement scores.",

          "abstract": "Does visuospatial attention influence temporal cognition? In Study 1, we investigated whether gaze direction can modulate different aspects of temporal processing. Participants performed a Mental Time Travel (MTT) task judging the likelihood of past and future life events while their visuospatial attention was oriented by facial gaze cues directed leftward, rightward, or centrally (Experiment 1). To test whether visuospatial attention modulates representation of temporal duration (e.g., age estimation), participants completed an Age Judgment task estimating the age of face stimuli under the same gaze manipulations (Experiment 2). Results showed direction-specific effects in the MTT task: leftward gaze enhanced probability judgments for past events, while rightward gaze enhanced judgments for future events. In the Age Judgment task, gaze systematically biased perceived age, with leftward cues yielding younger estimates and rightward cues yielding older estimates. In Study 2, we tested whether these gaze-related effects require a lateralized bodily stimulus (a face) or reflect a general modulation of visuospatial attention. We used optokinetic stimulation (OKS) to shift visuospatial attention without lateralized bodily cues. OKS produced weaker direction-specific effects on the MTT task compared to gaze, but generated similar biases in the Age Judgment task. These findings indicate that visuospatial attention shapes temporal cognition through partially distinct neurocognitive routes: embodied cues like gaze facilitate self-projection during MTT, whereas body-unrelated manipulations such as OKS are sufficient to modulate temporal estimation along a Mental Time Line.

          "abstract": "Cognitive differentiation effects describe differences in the strength of the correlations among cognitive performances depending on general ability level and age. In this context, variations in the contribution of general intelligence (g) to specific cognitive performances have attracted significant interest, yet have not been investigated meta-analytically. The present study provides an examination of moderated g-factor loadings through a two-stage individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of 29 samples from 20 German test standardizations in children and adolescents (N = 42,207). Standardization samples ensured population representativeness, sufficient sample size, and representation of different cognitive tests. Using nonlinear factor analysis, we examined the moderation of g-loadings by age, ability, and their interaction. Subsequent multi-level meta-regressions revealed decreasing g-loadings with increasing ability levels (meta-analytic λ2 = –.046 [95% CI -.064, -.028]). Age moderation effects were inconsistent and nonsignificant (meta-analytic λ3 = .003 [95% CI -.024, .030]). A negative age × ability interaction was present in some samples but not significant meta-analytically (meta-analytic λ4 = –.005 [95% CI -.012, .002]). Moderator analyses indicated that effects differed between test families but rarely between CHC abilities. The results highlight ability level as a key source of differences in the contribution of general intelligence to specific cognitive performances, underscoring the need for conditional reliability estimates in cognitive assessment and for cognitive theories on the nature and development of general intelligence to account for this effect. Age differences in g-factor loadings were less consequential, suggesting limited relevance. The study was funded by the German Research Foundation.

Quantitative systematic reviews offer researchers a method to synthesise large bodies of literature, helping to clarify inconsistent findings, identify research gaps, and refine theoretical models. However, existing tutorials often assume prior knowledge and/or experience, often overlooking foundational concepts. To address this gap, a comprehensive walkthrough of the systematic review process is presented, covering pre-registration, literature search and retrieval, screening, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction following the PRISMA framework. We then present detailed guidance on how to conduct both traditional and multilevel meta-analyses in R. Specifically, the tutorial explains how to estimate overall meta-analytic effect sizes when effect sizes are independent (traditional meta-analysis) and when effect sizes are nested within labs (multilevel meta-analysis). Procedures for assessing heterogeneity, testing for publication bias, and conducting moderation analyses are also covered. To accompany this tutorial, we supplement annotated R scripts and R notebooks to support transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility for researchers of all levels of experience.",

          "abstract": "A key assumption in collective memory research is that group members are particularly inclined to preserve history that reinforces the ingroup’s positive identity. Yet, this assumption lacks solid empirical support, as research has rarely measured the identity-protective potential of historical events considered important to remember. Theoretically, this support is essential because group members may engage with history for reasons other than benefiting their ingroup. We complement existing literature by systematically testing the identity-protective tenet using a bottom-up approach. After sampling of a broad set of historical events, we assessed the identity-relevant characteristics attributed to the events and examined how these characteristics relate to group members’ willingness to remember them. Across a preregistered study conducted in seven different national contexts (N = 2,045 participants; N = 7,665 ratings of 360 unique events), we found that events viewed as involving the ingroup in an agentic manner were considered important to remember in most countries. At the same time, we observed notable cross-national variation in the willingness to preserve events in which the ingroup caused positive consequences, behaved morally, or experienced threats, with a stronger tendency to remember ingroup-favoring history in less individualistic or less globally connected countries. We discuss how these findings bridge a crucial empirical gap by demonstrating that identity protection likely represents only one component of collective remembrance, whose importance appears to vary considerably across countries.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: The Evaluation of Auditory Responses to Speech (EARS) test battery is an important tool in the assessment of auditory development in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients in different linguistic and cultural contexts. Recognizing the lack of instruments that are culturally and linguistically adequate to assess Lebanese children with hearing impairments, the current study aimed at adapting and validating the EARS test battery to the Lebanese Arabic. Design: The adaptation process entailed the necessary linguistic, cultural, and psychometric changes to make the tool relevant for the target population. This was performed through the selection of stimuli representative of Lebanese vocabulary and syntax, consultation with experts in the field, and pilot testing of the adapted tests on a normal-hearing cohort of 2 to 11-year-olds. Then, a cohort of 88 Lebanese-speaking children with prelingual bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and unilateral cochlear implants were assessed using the adapted battery called LEARS. The LEARS includes measures of auditory development, word recognition, sentence understanding and functional auditory integration. Results:  Our results revealed that LEARS reliably evaluates auditory skills and tracks progress in CI recipients, respecting the cultural and linguistic nuances of Lebanese Arabic. Conclusions: The LEARS test battery constitutes a culturally valid and scientifically robust instrument for the assessment of auditory abilities in Lebanese children with cochlear implants, providing clinicians and policymakers with essential insights into auditory development and facilitating informed decisions in clinical, educational, and research contexts. \nKeywords: cochlear implant, audiology, children, auditory perception, LEARS assessment tool, Lebanese Arabic",

          "abstract": "Activation of primary motor cortex (M1) has been observed in some neuroimaging studies of\nmental rotation (MR). However, the functional relationship between M1 and MR remains\nunclear. Multiple studies suggest that M1 has a causal relationship with MR, while others\npropose that M1 activation is merely an effect of other brain regions’ activities. The present\nstudy utilises a neural noise Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) approach to investigate\nthe relationship between M1 and MR. Sixty participants, both male and female, with ages\nranging from 18 to 30, were equally divided into two experimental groups, each performing MR\ntasks of either Shepard figures or hands. They were presented with side-by-side stimuli and were\ninstructed to determine whether they are identical or mirror images of each other. The\nexperiment was divided into six experimental blocks comprised of randomised identical and\nmirrored stimuli. A real TMS was applied on odd blocks and a sham TMS was applied on even\nblocks. Average mean RTs for TMS and sham blocks for both hands and Shepard figures were\nobtained and compared using a one-tailed paired samples t-test. A significant mean RT\ndifference between TMS and sham conditions would be suggestive of an M1 and MR causal\nrelationship. A significant difference was found between sham and TMS trials in the hands\ncondition (p = .002) and the Shepard Figures condition (p &lt; .001). This suggests that M1 has a\ncausal role in MR performance of both hands and Shepard Figures.\nKeywords: primary motor cortex, mental rotation, transcranial magnetic stimulation",

We take a new approach to apply the learner to morphological convergence, lexical priming, and word integration. We build on data from an online experiment in which participants have to play a word-matching game using nonwords with an artificial co-player. These data show that participants pick up lexical, as opposed to word-level, patterns from training with the co-player and apply these patterns to previously unseen nonwords in subsequent testing. We show that the Minimal Generalisation Learner can capture this shift in participant behaviour if, instead of building new generalisations on the nonwords in the training data, we use these words to update existing generalisations, built on real language data. This result breaks new ground in the use of the Minimal Generalisation Learner in modelling elicitation and learning tasks that go beyond Wug tasks and corpus studies.",

In the correlational study, moral anti-realism showed a positive correlation with moral leniency, whereas no relationship was found between leniency and moral relativism. In the experimental study, we replicated the finding of a significant positive correlation between anti‑realism and moral leniency and again observed no significant correlation between relativism and leniency. Our meta‑ethical framing manipulation provided no evidence of a causal link between anti‑realism and moral leniency. Another finding was that CRT scores were unrelated to moral leniency in both studies. Exploratory analyses revealed a moderate negative correlation between free will beliefs and moral leniency in both studies; this finding might help to explore the nature of moral leniency.",

To better understand these processes and address the call for falsifiable theories, we propose a formalized expectancy-value model of interpersonal likability in politics (EVIL-P). It argues that people (dis)like targets with (dis)similar political views (i.e., value), especially if these views are rare (i.e., expectancy). By reanalyzing data from the American National Election Studies (N = 38,868), the British Election Study (N = 24,522), and nine studies on ratings of societal groups that vary in political views (N = 6,587), we find support for EVIL-P. Expectancy and value interacted to predict people’s attitudes. Moreover, targets with moderate political views were liked most on average, and targets with more extreme political views had more extreme fans and haters. We discuss how EVIL-P contributes to research on affective polarization and helps testing related phenomena.",

We address mathematical inconsistencies in Piaget's structuralism by reconceptualizing groupings as specific groupoids where objects form partial join-semilattices, with reversibility represented as morphism invertibility and compositional operations as lattice operations.  Then, we propose a new line of research program about children’s subjective experience using category theory. Specifically, we propose a line of empirical research comparing children's and adults' subjective experiences through a structure analysis. Our first step of this program has already revealed a counterintuitive discrepancy between children’s color naming abilities and color similarity structures, suggesting fundamental importance in distinguishing subjective experience and reports about it in cognitive developmental research. This category theory based structural approach opens possibilities for unified theories as interconnected categorical domains, potentially enabling prediction of developmental trajectories and identification of critical intervention periods through precise mathematical relationships governing cognitive architecture.",

Several extended models related to multilevel modeling are also introduced. We then clarify the correspondence between each model and likelihood-based estimation methods. In addition, we examine the modeling assumptions involved in Bayesian estimation for these models.

          "abstract": "The prenatal period is a critical window for the emergence of sensorimotor coordination and early relational processes. Within this framework, yawning—a stereotyped behavior linked to arousal regulation and social contagion—offers a unique opportunity to explore maternal-fetal relationships before birth. While contagious yawning has been extensively studied in postnatal contexts, its presence and developmental role in utero remain unexplored. This study investigated whether fetal yawning behavior is modulated by maternal yawning, suggesting a primitive form of behavioral contagion within the dyad. Thirty-six pregnant participants were exposed to video stimuli designed to elicit yawns, while fetal facial movements were recorded using 2D ultrasound. Maternal and fetal yawning frequencies were analyzed across four conditions: baseline, maternal still-face, maternal mouth opening/closing movements, and maternal yawning. Fetal and maternal time series were further examined using Cross Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA), and an LSTM-based neural network was employed for automated behavioral classification. Results showed a significant increase in fetal yawns following maternal yawning, but not during control conditions, indicating selective behavioral responsiveness. CRQA revealed stronger temporal structure in true mother–fetus dyads than in bootstrap-shuffled pairings, suggesting non-random coordination. The LSTM model accurately distinguished yawning from other facial actions, supporting the reliability of the behavioral data. These findings provide the first evidence of prenatal yawning contagion and support the notion that behavioral alignment may reflect embodied mechanisms of attunement that precede postnatal social engagement, offering new insights into the developmental origins of intersubjectivity.",

          "abstract": "Every month, scores of new measures and constructs enter the behavioral science literature. Researchers struggle to keep an overview of their subfields, let alone the wider field, with an estimated number of allegedly different constructs now exceeding 30,000. Proposing constructs is easy, finding redundancies and overlaps is not. The effort of finding redundancies using participant responses grows quadratically with the number of measures. This cost motivates the use of language models, which can simplify and speed up the process without requiring new data collection. Earlier work employed latent semantic analysis (LSA) to make use of the textual nature of questionnaires in the social and behavioral sciences. LSA's reliance on word co-occurrences, however, can produce misleading similarity estimates that fall short of accuracy and may even reproduce the very jingle-jangle fallacies it aims to detect. Recent advances demonstrate that transformer-based sentence embedding models offer a more viable solution for predicting empirical relatedness between survey items. In the presented work, we use a fine-tuned language model, the SurveyBot3000, to introduce the Synthetic Nomological Net, an open-access web application for systematic detection of conceptual overlap. The application indexes over 470,000 items across 74,000 scales from approximately 31,500 instruments in the APA PsycTests database.",

Virtual reality (VR) offers a promising solution to deliver portable, engaging rehabilitation services, particularly for rural populations with limited access to care. However, its adoption among older adults may be hindered by key barriers, including technological unfamiliarity or concerns about visually induced motion sickness (VIMS). Overcoming these initial acceptance barriers is a critical step for implementing this gerontechnology which could deliver physical and mental health support directly to the homes of older adults. \n\nResearch aim. We aimed to determine the feasibility of using brief, low-resource interventions, either an informational handout or a short immersive VR experience, to improve attitudes toward VR in rural older adults. \n\nMethods. In this comparative feasibility study, sixty-four rural adults aged 60 and older received either an informational handout describing VR or completed four immersive VR activities using hand tracking on a consumer headset. Attitudes toward VR and VIMS symptoms were assessed using pre-post intervention surveys.\n\nResults. The immersive VR experience did not result in a significant increase in VIMS symptoms, demonstrating high tolerability. Both the informational handout group and the VR experience group showed significant positive improvements in attitudes toward VR.\n\nConclusions. Brief, low-resource interventions can increase technology acceptance for VR among rural older adults. The finding that a simple informational handout can be as effective as a hands-on immersive experience has significant, practical implications for the scalable and cost-effective deployment of VR-based technologies in clinical and home-based gerontological settings.",

Thirty-two healthy adults (18 – 52 years, 22 female) completed two Stroop variants: Task A measured manual left or right button presses, and Task B measured vocal “left” or “right” responses. Each Task included Pure (100% congruent, or incongruent trials), Mixed (70% congruent/30% incongruent trials), and Baseline (100% arrow-only or 100% word-only trials) blocks. Manual responses were faster to arrows than words, and incongruent arrows further slowed responses to words. Yet, the presence of any word slowed manual responses to arrows. Vocal responses showed a different pattern – faster to words than arrows, and incongruent words slowed responses to arrows, but arrows did not affect word responses. For both tasks, interference effects were stronger when congruent and incongruent trials were interleaved in Mixed blocks. The manual Stroop task is a robust measure of inhibitory control, demonstrating the interaction of two sources of interference: automatic word processing and cross-domain translation between spatial and language representations.",

However, we believe that additional within-person research is also needed for social-cognitive measures, in addition to personality measures based on trait models, as most psychometric research on these measures has been cross-sectional and/or at the between-person level. We also hope that research can continue to advance understanding of the significant overlap across personality and social-cognitive models and measures. In addition to highlighting important areas of overlap, we also describe how general assessments of personality and related constructs can provide helpful information, in initial treatment planning phases, especially for screening; strengthening diagnostic formulations; and collaboratively establishing general profiles of client strengths, functioning, and areas of need in a structured manner.",

          "abstract": "Background: Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) provide digital health support that is timely and adaptive: intervention delivery is tailored to rapid changes in internal and external biological and behavioral variables (i.e., “tailoring variables”). JITAIs make decisions on how to tailor support using “decision rules.” Decision rules specify which intervention option should be selected (e.g., whether to send a text-based intervention) based on tailoring variables. JITAI decision rules are typically designed via expert opinion – informed by domain knowledge and statistical analyses of past data – and then kept the same throughout a JITAI’s deployment. \n\nPurpose: A challenge for JITAIs is that decision rules can become stale or outdated due to differences in the recipients of a JITAI from one deployment to the next or due to broader societal shifts (e.g., post-pandemic alterations in behavior). As a result, JITAIs may suffer from reduced effectiveness in deployment. In this paper, we describe how online learning and decision-making algorithms create “personalizing JITAIs” (pJITAIs) to address this gap, enabling within-deployment optimization of decision rules based on streaming data collected during deployment. This streaming data provides up-to-date insights on how relationships between tailoring variables, intervention options, and outcomes may differ.\n \nMethods: We detail key concepts for online learning and decision-making algorithms, unifying two dominant perspectives in JITAI literature: reinforcement learning (RL) and control engineering. \n\nConclusions: Although RL and control engineering approaches have progressed parallelly in the literature, we elucidate the substantial overlap and unify lexicon to streamline the collaborative design of online learning and decision-making algorithms for pJITAIs.",

          "abstract": "Research on static scene perception using simulated scotoma paradigms suggests both central and peripheral vision are sufficient for scene gist perception (Larson &amp; Loschky, 2009), but it is unknown whether this applies to dynamic scenes. This study investigated whether peripheral vision and foveal vision can independently support road hazard detection in dynamic real-world road scenes. Two types of gaze-contingent scotomas were simulated in separate blocks: a peripheral scotoma, where the video was only visible through a central circular aperture, or a central scotoma, in which a gray circle occluded the central visual field. Within a block, the size of the scotoma varied based on a 3-up/1-down staircase to estimate the maximum tolerable scotoma size while maintaining 80% hazard detection accuracy. Echoing the static scene literature, both peripheral and foveal vision are independently sufficient for this dynamic hazard detection task, demonstrating the utility of peripheral vision. Again, in line with data from static scenes, the central scotoma condition required larger visible area than the peripheral scotoma condition. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was found between the two conditions, suggesting individuals’ hazard detection capabilities are generalized across the visual field. Our work broadens current accounts of peripheral vision to time-limited dynamic scenes, demonstrating that drivers can obtain sufficient information from non-foveal input. These results suggest that accounts centered only on where drivers fixate miss key components of the information acquisitive process.",

From hope to despair, shared emotions within representations of the future can motivate farsighted decisions and facilitate social coordination.

Nevertheless, humans readily imagine their futures together. Here, we test the hypothesis that such collaborative imagination (co-imagination) of shared future experiences promotes emotional convergence in future event representations among individuals. Analyzing data from two experiments run in 2019 and 2021 involving university and Prolific participants (N=204), we use natural language models to code individual narratives for a rich and complex array of emotional states. These studies demonstrate that co-imagination in novel dyads fosters alignment in the emotions partners express within their individual representations of the shared future, more so than independently imagining future events using the same cues.

          "abstract": "This chapter addresses the problem of conscious subjective experiences from a developmental perspective. The aim is to argue that tackling the nature of conscious experiences from the priviledged standpoint of adult (mostly) visual perception is misleading. Instead, I claim, the realy interesting question is : how do we open the doors of bodily sensory experiences at the dawn of our conscious life? How self, body and world perception gets off the ground? Humans rely on high level cognitive abilities to investigate sensory perception, yet bodily sensory perception is present and functional in developing individuals way before we are able to build scientific models of it as adults. Hence we must start with the body, and specifically with the developing body. I then introduce two notions of experience and suggest that this distinction may help us dissipate some of the foggy mystery around the “hard problem” of consciousness.",

The present work explores the relationship between identification with all humanity (IWAH) and three constructs largely overlooked in related work: perceived moral similarity across humanity, perceived similarity of oneself to animals (PSSA), and hope for society (i.e., social hope). Two studies reveal unique patterns for each construct in predicting IWAH across levels (i.e., community, country, &amp; all humanity): while perceived moral similarity predicts IWAH across levels, social hope predicts IWAH within community and country, and PSSA predicts IWAH globally. Study 2 experimentally manipulated each construct and found that the social hope task increased IWAH across levels. Both perceived moral similarity and PSSA tasks increased IWAH within community, with smaller but similar effects on global IWAH. These findings provide novel insight into causal mechanisms underlying IWAH, with implications for interventions fostering global human identification.",

          "abstract": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence-driven social chatbots has generated intense debate about their psychological and social implications, particularly for younger generations who are most likely to adopt these technologies. This study presents findings from a comprehensive survey of 534 Italian adults examining attitudes toward and experiences with social chatbots, with a specific focus on the 18-34 age cohort. Results reveal that young adults represent the primary adopter group (51.2% usage rate versus 40.4% for adults 35+), yet their engagement remains predominantly instrumental rather than relational. The majority use chatbots for study assistance (57.6%) and exploration (55.8%), deriving measurable practical benefits in mood improvement and self-confidence without developing significant emotional attachments. Notably, young adults exhibit a distinctive paradox: they are simultaneously more open to emotional communication with AI (mean score 2.39/5 versus 1.95/5 for older adults) yet more concerned about social stigma (3.30/5 versus 2.59/5). These findings challenge dystopian narratives about AI replacing human relationships while highlighting the importance of understanding generational differences in human-AI interaction. The study contributes to the growing literature on social AI by providing empirical evidence from a European context and demonstrating that young adults are adopting these technologies strategically as tools rather than substitutes for human connection.",

          "abstract": "Peripersonal space (PPS) is defined as a sector of space surrounding the body, serving as a sensory-motor system for hand-object interaction. This portion of space, delimited by our skin and the reach of our limbs, is mapped through the integration of multisensory stimuli arising from the body. Although touch is crucial for the multisensory integration processes within PPS, only a few studies have explored the distinct contributions of the sensory system’s dual pathways. These are represented by large myelinated Aβ nerves enabling fast discriminative touch and C-Tactile unmyelinated fibers involved in the low-pressure, slow, caress-like tactile stimulation. To overcome these lacks, we carried out three experiments in which participants underwent audio-tactile tasks, each designed to assess PPS processing under different tactile conditions. In Experiment 1 (Classic Task), we estimated PPS through the traditional task in which participants responded to discriminative tactile stimuli at different temporal delays while ignoring looming sounds. In Experiments 2 (Discriminative Task), we adapted the Classic Task by using an auditory cue as a target stimulus, while administering the discriminative tactile stimulation. This allowed us to assess PPS boundaries by reversing the sensory modality of the target stimulus, with no difference found between Classic and Discriminative Tasks. In Experiment 3 (Affective Task), we used the same protocol as in Experiment 2 applying affective touch. Results showed that PPS boundaries in the Affective Task were significantly larger than both Classic and Discriminative Tasks, suggesting the unique role of caress-like touch in shaping body-space representation.",

          "authors": "Lauren Treiman; Wouter Kool",
          "abstract": "The decoy effect is a classic example of irrational decision making, where adding an inferior third option (the decoy) shifts preference toward a similar, superior option (the target) over an otherwise equally attractive competitor. Although robust, the underlying mechanisms of this effect remain debated. Evidence from decision science suggests people make multi-option choices through pairwise comparisons: they first compare two options, then pit the winner against the remaining option. However, theories disagree on which comparison sequence produces the decoy effect. One account argues the effect only emerges when people first compare the competitor and decoy, because the target then needs to win only one comparison instead of two. In contrast, evidence from attention research suggests people compare the target and decoy first because of their similarity. We propose a mechanism that reconciles these accounts. Our framework assumes that the act of choosing increases the subjective value of the option that wins the first comparison and that individuals differ in the magnitude of this boost. Through simulations, we showed that when this increase is small, the decoy effect emerges only when the competitor and decoy are compared first, but when it is large, it emerges only when the target and decoy are compared first. We tested this prediction in a preregistered sequential-choice version of the decoy paradigm and found that first comparisons influenced target selection differently across individuals. Behavioral results and computational modeling confirmed that participants with larger value increases showed stronger decoy effects when the target and decoy were compared first. This work proposes that choice-induced value changes provide a unifying mechanism that accounts for existing theoretical contradictions and explains individual differences in the decoy effect.",

          "authors": "Samuel David Jones",
          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

Using qualitative content analysis, we analyzed open-ended responses from N = 626 German citizens (ages 14-65) on how Germany should engage with the Nazi past. Applying latent class analysis to the content-coded responses, we identified three response classes: those advocating for continued remembrance, those rejecting remembrance and showing ingroup-defensive tendencies, and those supporting remembrance while still engaging in defensive responses, such as relativizing German crimes or attributing them to coercion. We discuss how particularly the finding of the third, ambivalent class extends existing literature on identity protection and collective remembrance by reflecting a commitment to confronting the ingroup’s atrocities, a practice highly endorsed in the country, without fully acknowledging responsibility. Situated beyond the binary of either endorsing remembrance or disengaging from ingroup wrongdoing, this class highlights the complexity of remembrance desires within a society navigating the legacy of mass atrocities.",

          "abstract": "Under the theory of memory reconsolidation, memory reactivation induces a temporary window of destabilisation during which memories become malleable. Behavioural reconsolidation interference has been proposed as a method for weakening maladaptive emotional and pain-related memories; however, evidence for its efficacy remains mixed. In this study, participants (N = 51) completed a three-day reconsolidation interference paradigm. On Day 1, they underwent a pain conditioning procedure in which visual cues (conditioned stimulus; CS) were paired with moderately painful electric shocks (unconditioned stimulus; US). On Day 2, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Reactivation + Working Memory (R+WM), Reactivation Only (RO), or Working Memory Task Only (WMO). An adaptive emotional n-back task served as the WM interference, which consisted of negatively valenced word stimuli. On Day 3, all participants underwent extinction learning. Learning was assessed via explicit expectancy ratings and skin conductance responses (SCR). On Day 1, conditioning produced robust discrimination between reinforced and non-reinforced cues in both expectancy ratings and SCR amplitudes. Overall, expectancy ratings declined from conditioning to extinction, but this did not differ across groups. Similarly, SCR amplitudes decreased over time during extinction, consistent with CS-US unpairing, but with no group differences. These findings suggest that WM interference following reactivation does not impact later pain recall or extinction. This contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of behavioural reconsolidation interference. The null effects observed here underscore the need to clarify the so-called boundary conditions of reconsolidation and better understand neural mechanisms underlying pain memory and learning.",

In this Perspective, we describe two ways in which psychological reasoning depends on physical reasoning. First, people represent the bodies of animate agents as objects, and their actions as physical events. Second, people use physical knowledge to make inferences about other minds, including what other people want, feel, and know, how hard they are trying, and how much danger they are in. We review research from developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience that provides evidence for the interaction between these two systems, and Bayesian computational models of theory of mind that articulate a formal hypothesis about how they work together. We propose that from early in human development people navigate the social world by using two distinct but interacting systems for reasoning about other agents’ ethereal minds and their physical bodies.",

The findings showed that identity distress and positive self-presentations can follow maladaptive, adaptive, or stable co-trajectories over time, depending on the identity domain, adolescents’ demographic and social media use characteristics.

While longitudinal studies suggest that an active lifestyle and emotional well-being may be beneficial for cognitive function, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Recent work emphasizes momentary assessments for capturing everyday cognitive functioning. In this ten-day experience-sampling study, 325 university students completed thrice-daily surveys on stress, mood, social, cognitive and physical activities, subjective memory lapses, and performed a working memory task. Memory lapses and working memory performance were unrelated at both between- and within-person levels. Memory lapses were more likely during periods of increased activity, worse mood, and higher stress. Participants engaging in more cognitive activities reported more memory lapses. Higher average physical activity and increased momentary social activity were associated with lower working memory performance. Daily memory lapses in university students appear primarily driven by current affective states and activity levels rather than cognitive performance limitations. These results advance our understanding of cognitive processes in young adults and highlight different time scales in cognitive functioning.",

Previous research indicates that nose-tip temperature increases with parasympathetic activation, whereas periorbital temperature reflects sympathetic arousal. However, facial thermal fluctuations during resting state have not yet been systematically investigated, which represents the aim of the present study. \n Here we examined the relationship between regional facial temperature - measured from nose-tip and periorbital regions using functional infrared thermal imaging - and cardiac parasympathetic activity, indexed by high-frequency (HF) power and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heart rate variability (HRV). Analyses included (i) grand-average correlations to identify overarching physiological patterns, (ii) within-subject correlations to explore the strength of individual-level associations, and (iii) between-subject correlations to examine inter-individual variability of the cardiac and thermal signals. \nAcross 32 participants during a 13.5-min resting-state session, HF power showed a positive association with nose-tip and a negative association with periorbital temperature, whereas RMSSD showed weaker effects. A differential temperature index (nose-tip minus periorbital) was the most robust correlate of HF power.  These findings suggest that facial thermal dynamics mirror vagal modulation at rest and that the differential index converging the information from different facial areas may provide a sensitive, contactless indicator of autonomic activity.",

We synthesize findings from existing frameworks, including the Entropic Brain Hypothesis and Dendritic Integration Theory, which explain changes in brain connectivity, dynamics, and neuronal integration under anesthesia. However, neither framework fully addresses how agency and subjectivity may become dissociated. To bridge this gap, we review Irruption Theory (IT) as an emerging conceptual and methodological approach that may offer a novel lens for interpreting measurable changes in neural signals, encouraging further empirical research to distinguish the neural signatures of agency and subjectivity.",

Traditional detection methods fail because they target low-effort humans while AI produces high-effort patterns. Economic incentives are powerful, and the threat recursive: AI-mediated responses become training data for models that mediate future responses, creating feedback loops toward model-shaped consensus.

          "abstract": "The feeling of togetherness, which we understand as creating something larger than oneself with others, often emerges in creative, open-ended interactions, such as dancing or making music. We ask what states of mind are associated with this felt togetherness and what interactional skills can be used to foster it. To investigate this, in this study, we record eight short dance improvisation duets in controlled conditions. Video recordings are used as prompts for in-depth interviews with dancers involved and with expert dance improvisation teachers. Based on the interviews, we portray togetherness as a state of mindful attunement to one’s partner, with a focus on building a relational unity. This form of unity goes beyond typical dialogue dynamics rooted in turn-taking. We associate togetherness with moments in dance when dancers’ attention is focused on the process happening “in between” individuals, and they feel that the “dance dances itself”. To achieve this state, dancers use deliberate strategies, such as shifting attention focus to peripheral vision, adjusting the speed of their actions, and expanding the field of trust. Our results show that, if theories of social cognition are to be congruent with human experience, they should explain both individual- and collective-level processes.",

Although recent advances have shown where and how planning should be engaged to aid adaptive behavior, little is known about when planning should be engaged. Here, we investigate how individuals choose to engage or delay planning. For this purpose, we developed a task where, at certain decision points in a multistep decision problem, it is optimal to delay planning and relinquish control because all actions are equally likely to reach an instructed goal. Across two studies, we show that humans can optimally delay planning and improve in their ability to do so with experience. To explain this behavior, we formalize a model of the underlying meta-control computations. In doing so, we demonstrate that meta-policies to engage or delay planning are not simply learned from experienced outcomes, rather, they are constructed by searching a cognitive map of the task to determine at which points it is more valuable to delay control. We thus establish that humans can optimally delay planning, and learn to do so by means of a cognitive map.",

          "abstract": "The many-analysts approach has demonstrated a surprising diversity in analytic choices and outcomes given a single research question and dataset. As a result, the approach has gained traction as a tool for revealing and understanding epistemic uncertainty. Despite its growing popularity, there is still limited practical guidance for team leaders on how to execute such studies. In this perspective, we propose ten strategies to improve the many-analysts methodology. The proposed strategies were build based on insights from past projects and our own experience as team leaders and are organized around six themes: (1) moving many-analysts projects beyond merely exposing analytic variability; (2) creating structured opportunities for participating teams to share their insights; (3) recognizing analytical quality and expertise; (4) uncovering sources of variability through meta-regression and complementary methods; (5) addressing epistemic uncertainty on a smaller scale; and (6) developing comprehensive models of uncertainty. To showcase their practical application, we illustrate these strategies using data from the Many-Analysts Religion Project.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive biases may affect physician decision-making. We sought to: 1) delineate which cognitive biases in physicians have been investigated, 2) report the prevalence of cognitive biases, 3) determine their impact on physician decisions, 4) characterize interventions that aim to reduce the impact of cognitive biases in physicians, and 5) highlight the role of individual differences. A PRISMA-compliant systematic review was performed using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. Of 4177 resultant articles, 61 were included (46 on group level outcomes and 15 on individual differences). The most common specialties were internal medicine (15, 24.6%), emergency medicine (11, 18.0%), and psychiatry (5, 8.2%). Studies provided evidence for the existence of hindsight bias, anchoring, framing effect, outcome bias, and availability bias. Prevalence varied by bias. Of five studies examining how cognitive biases affected physician diagnosis, 4 (80.0%) found a negative effect. Interventions to reduce the impact of cognitive biases were limited. Individual differences in susceptibility to cognitive biases may relate to length of experience, similarity to previous cases, and case complexity. This systematic review of studies of moderate quality and with moderate risk of bias indicated cognitive biases are prevalent in physicians and often negatively impact decision-making.",

Using Friston’s Free Energy Principle, we develop a conceptual model of this phenomenon that can be applied to both LLMs and humans, providing a single framework for comparison and understanding. We explore this in terms of LLM information-processing dynamics, which are structurally oriented toward minimizing uncertainty and maintaining coherence.

In addition, the model makes new predictions on how LLMs should be trained to avoid this problem.",

The present research disentangles the role of social support in shaping resilience in immigrant and refugee populations. Across three studies, we experimentally manipulated perceived social support (Studies 1 and 2) and modeled the relationship between sources of perceived support and resilience outcomes with the types of support as mediators (Study 3). Though experimental manipulations did not affect resilience, perceptions of support varied by source and context: community and societal support were consistently linked to better resilience, particularly in facilitating refugee integration. Family support was rated highest overall, except among refugees, who reported it as the lowest.  These findings underscore the importance of context and lived experience in shaping the impact of social support on resilience. There is an increased reliance on formal support mechanisms due to the refugees’ circumstances.\n\nKeywords: Social support, resilience, wellbeing, integration, refugees",

          "abstract": "Although multi-scale, multi-directional feedback between genes, brain, cognition, and behaviour is the cornerstone of well-evidenced interactionist models of human development (e.g., Gottlieb, 2007), contemporary theories of neurodevelopmental variation and disorder characteristically describe only unidirectional cascades across this hierarchy. To complement this view, I present a new theory of the cognitive and behavioural origins of individual differences in human development. This account is grounded in the ideas of restricted search and satisficing that are central to bounded rationality (Simon, 1955, 1956, 1990), and which set this account apart from claims that adaptive agents optimise utility functions or maximise their learning. Using the foundational model of bounded rationality (Simon, 1955) as a reference point, I integrate a broad contemporary literature on adaptive, restricted search and satisficing, and reciprocal influences on development and learning. This work motivates the novel position that, although adaptive, restricted search and satisficing not only amplify neurodevelopmental differences beyond their primary genetic and neurobiological origins but also provide a route by which disparate primary causal processes are anchored to common phenotypes. While the focus of this paper is on early developmental variation and conditions of clinical significance, I argue that bounded rationality offers a general paradigm through which to understand the emergence of individual differences across the lifespan, from psychopathology to expertise. The recommendation of this report is that cognitive and behavioural feedback should be embedded more widely into causal process models of the origins of individual differences in human development.",

Thus, we conducted two studies to analyze the impact of myths about cyber-sexual violence (AMCYS) on the relationship between cyber-sexual violence victimization and emotional impacts. In Study 1 (N = 310), women with higher levels of AMCYS and greater cyber-sexual violence victimization reported higher levels of anxiety and depression, as well as lower self-esteem. Study 2 (N = 393) replicated these results and also examined the effect of cyber-sexual violence victimization through the lens of objectification theory. Results showed that women with higher AMCYS scores and more cyber-sexual violence victimization reported higher levels of anxiety, depression and body shame, as well as lower self-esteem and body appreciation. Importantly, these relationships occurred through the indirect effect of body surveillance (self-objectification). Both studies indicated that AMCYS play an exacerbating role in the emotional impacts reported by women who have experienced more frequently cyber-sexual violence, while also highlighting the framework of objectification theory in understanding these results. These findings can be useful to develop interventions and prevention campaigns against cyber-sexual violence.",

          "abstract": "Engraved ochres and ostrich eggshells from the South African Blombos Cave and Diepkloof Rock Shelter are among the earliest expressions of human symbolic behavior. They appear to document a continuous practice of mark-making across ~40.000 years. During this time, the engraved markings change from simpler unstructured patterns to more complex markings such as cross-hatchings. Previous work examining the cognitive implications of these changes concluded that the engravings were likely used as decorations and may have served as group identity markers but not as denotational symbols. To inform discussions of the emergence of symbolic behavior, we conducted a two-part experimental study inspired by these engravings and based on the assumption that artifact use will motivate incremental adaptive refinements. Part 1 combined a delayed reproduction task with a transmission chain design to simulate an enduring mark-making practice. Eleven transmission chains were seeded with four drawings derived from the early Blombos and Diepkloof engravings and reproduced over eight generations. Transmission chain drawings showed a tendency to become increasingly regular, organized, and symmetric. Part 2 subjected a sample of the transmission chain drawings to a suite of psychophysical experiments to assess the cognitive implications of the accumulated structural changes. We found that the drawings became easier to discriminate, looked more like they had been intentionally made, and became easier to remember and reproduce, but there was no evidence of a systematic change in saliency or stylistic properties. Finally, we compared the results from the transmission chains with a similar analysis of the drawings derived from the original engravings. Although we observe interesting qualitative similarities between the original engravings and the experimental drawings, our findings suggest that cognitive biases and working memory constraints are not sufficient to generate the patterns observed in the archaeological record, highlighting the significance of social and functional contexts in shaping early symbolic artifacts. By integrating archaeological and experimental research we can better inform inferences on sparse records of early symbolic behavior. Our study thus leads to a broader consideration of the role, strengths and potential limitations of the transmission chain approach in analyzing trajectories of early symbolic behavior.",

          "abstract": "Objective: Trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder) is a body-focused repetitive behaviour characterised by the recurrent and compulsive pulling of one’s own hair, where both the act of pulling and the visible consequences of hair loss cause distress and impairment. Shame has been identified as central to adult hairpulling, increasing the urge to pull and reinforcing the cycle of behaviour. Yet little is known about how adolescents experience this emotion, despite adolescence being the typical point of onset of trichotillomania and a developmental period marked by heightened sensitivity to shame. Hence, the present study explored how adolescents with problematic hairpulling experience, navigate and make sense of shame.\n\nDesign: A qualitative methodology was employed. \n\nMethod: Twelve adolescents with problematic hair-pulling aged 16–19 participated in online semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis.\n\nResults: An overarching theme of “There’s something wrong with me” – The Stigmatised Self captured how experiences of pervasive stigma were internalised as shame, permeating participant’s inner lives and social worlds. Under this, five themes were generated: The Flawed Self; The Scrutinised Self; The Misunderstood Self; The Isolated Self; and The Disempowered Self.  Shame was experienced as an enduring, identity-shaping emotion that triggered, maintained, and exacerbated hairpulling. \n\nConclusions: These findings extend our understanding by positioning shame as a central process in adolescent hairpulling and highlight the developmental vulnerability of this age group. Clinically, the results underscore the need for interventions that target shame, and for family and social contexts to be addressed alongside behavioural symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have experienced a rapid increase in fame due to their versatile capabilities, including document processing, image generation, and even providing psychological support. Autonomous agents—defined as entities such as robots or LLMs that perceive and respond to environmental stimuli—are increasingly integrated into human teams. These agents are capable of interacting and collaborating with both humans and other autonomous systems to solve problems and achieve shared objectives. As human reliance on autonomous agents grows, understanding the mechanisms of trust becomes critical, given its central role in team effectiveness.\nThis study investigates two dimensions of trust in autonomous agents: a cognitive component, uncertainty communication, and an affective component, anthropomorphized language. It was hypothesized that both communicating uncertainty and anthropomorphized language would contribute to trusting the LLM. A total of 606 participants were recruited via the online platform PanelClix. Participants viewed video scenarios depicting a first responder interacting with a Chatbot that employed either anthropomorphized or machine-like language. Additionally, participants were exposed to varying levels of reliability information: no reliability cue, a numerical reliability estimate (approximately 75% certainty), or a colour-coded reliability indicator (dark blue for ~75% certainty, light blue for 25% certainty).\nThe findings revealed that neither anthropomorphized language nor uncertainty communication significantly influenced trust in the Chatbot. However, trust was positively associated with perceived intelligence, general propensity to trust artificial intelligence, and perceived liveliness of the Chatbot. These results suggest that both cognitive and affective factors contribute to the development of trust in autonomous agents, albeit in more nuanced ways than initially hypothesized. Implications and future directions are discussed in the concluding section.",

In the present study, however, we sought to verify whether this link is indeed ‘inevitable’. Specifically, we examined the ‘liberalizing’ potential of cognitive control processes (i.e., the ability to regulate thoughts, emotions, and actions in accordance with one’s prespecified plans and goals), and we advanced the hypothesis that the RWA-prejudice association is curbed among those high in cognitive control. Two experimental studies (total N = 876) provided only weak support for our key hypothesis. In Study 1 (a university student sample), we found that proactive (but not reactive) control moderated the RWA-explicit prejudice association, such that this relationship was reduced to insignificance among those high in proactive control. By contrast, in Study 2 (an online panel sample), no significant RWA x cognitive control interactions emerged for any of the operationalizations of cognitive control. In addition, we did not observe any cognitive control moderation effects on the RWA-implicit prejudice link across both studies. Taken together, our findings cast reasonable doubt on the liberalizing potential of cognitive control, while at the same time they provide further support for the robustness of the RWA-prejudice association.",

          "abstract": "Depression in adolescence is associated with poorer outcomes than adult-onset depression. While effective treatment can prevent difficulties from persisting into adulthood, current interventions for adolescent depression are often limited in effectiveness, likely because they fail to address the specific mechanisms underlying depression during this developmental stage. Access to treatment for adolescents presents an additional challenge. Effective, practical, and targeted treatments are urgently needed. To achieve this, we must identify key mechanisms of adolescent depression and develop interventions that address them directly.\n\nGrowing evidence highlights reward function as a key mechanism in adolescent depression. At the same time, research suggests that Behavioural Activation (BA), with its emphasis on reward-focused behavioural changes, may be an effective treatment for adolescents with depression. To integrate these lines of research, we used a narrative approach to synthesise cross-disciplinary literature on reward function and BA in adolescent depression.\n\nThis review found encouraging evidence for the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of BA in adolescents. BA also shows potential for those with co-occurring autism or anxiety. However, the mechanisms through which BA works in adolescence are still unknown, and questions remain on its optimal delivery. Further research is needed to clarify how reward function influences both adolescent depression and response to BA, as well as how adolescents themselves wish to engage with BA therapy.",

While separate literatures have documented advantages in perception and cognition for information associated with the self and information of positive valence, gaps remain in understanding the relationship between these effects. Across three experiments combining evaluative priming and shape-label matching tasks, the current research examined whether intrinsic self-positivity and self-negativity are underpinned by bidirectional expectations between self and emotional information.  Results revealed asymmetric bidirectional relationship: positive emotion primes inhibited stranger-related target processing, enhancing self-bias magnitudes (Experiment 1a), whilst self-primes facilitated positive emotion targets, enhancing positivity-biases (Experiment 2). Critically, no interactions emerged with negativity (Experiment 1b). These findings suggest that intrinsic self-positivity is maintained through facilitatory self-positive interactions and inhibitory other-positive interactions, with the dominant mechanism depending on relationship directionality. This distinction indicated that whilst the self solely leads to the expectation of positivity, positivity is associated with the self and extended self (i.e., friend). The theoretical and practical applications of these results are discussed.",

Based on international guidelines, regional regulations and examples of public domain, open licensed and commercial tests, we distinguish between simply administering an instrument, reproducing its protected content and creating derivative works such as translations or adaptations. We show that, in non-commercial academic contexts, administering lawfully acquired or openly licensed tests usually does not require additional permission, as long as items, keys and manuals are not reproduced or altered. In contrast, copying item banks, publishing reagents, adapting instruments without authorization or disseminating content from proprietary kits and neuropsychological batteries generally requires explicit permission.

          "abstract": "In perception experiments, researchers often collect multiple perceptual judgements from the same stimuli and participants to answer their research questions. While the way in which perceptual judgements are collected may affect the data, research rarely considers task design when investigating this topic. In our experiment, we investigated how two frequently used ways of collecting multiple ratings for affect perceptual judgements, focusing on first impressions of faces. One participant group provided ratings of seven person characteristics (e.g. femininity, youthfulness, trustworthiness) blocked by characteristic, rating faces for one person characteristic at a time, across seven blocks. Another participant group completed one block in which they rated all seven characteristics simultaneously via a list of rating scales. The listed presentation format reduced task duration by 22%, but affected the perceptual ratings in several ways, pointing to reduced data quality. Inter-rater agreement was lower for some person characteristics (youthfulness, femininity, and trustworthiness) in the listed format. Variance in ratings was also reduced for youthfulness, femininity, and dominance, with ratings clustering closer to the middle of the scale. Importantly, correlations between different person characteristics became universally positive in the listed format, indicating reduced independence of judgments. These findings highlight that while presenting multiple judgements at the same time may offer efficiency, this approach can introduce systematic biases and potentially reduce the reliability of perceptual data. We therefore suggest using a blocked presentation format and consider how these trade-offs would impact experiments looking at multiple perceptual judgements collected from the same participants.",

We show how these concepts improve polysemy and synonymy issues, and together constitute a useful set of descriptive tools for the associationist framework. As they allow more transparent articulation of results and theories concerned with associations in both biological and artificial systems, they facilitate comparison of findings from different fields. The proposed terminology aims at promoting dialogue and interdisciplinary collaboration.",

          "abstract": "Hunger leads to less healthy decision-making, but its effect on decision-making in non-food domains is less clear. To close this gap, we investigated to what extent hunger state affected choice across domains by examining attentional patterns and cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making across different domains. We implemented a within-subject design in which participants completed a food choice, an intertemporal discounting, and a social preferences task in hungry and sated states while their eye-movements were recorded. Hungry participants were more likely look at and subsequently select tasty over healthy food items, while attention and choice remained unaffected in the non-food tasks. Cognitive modelling indicated that hunger state selectively affected attention-driven evidence accumulation processes in the food choice task. Altogether, our results are consistent with a domain-specific view, indicating that attentional and decision-making processes in non-food domains remain unaffected to states of elevated hunger.",

          "abstract": "Standard formulations of the free-energy principle treat adaptive agents as pure surprise minimisers, but in non-stationary niches this can drive brittle, energetically costly behaviour. This article proposes Trident G, a near-critical control architecture in which brains (and other intelligent agents) defend a non-zero metabolic–accuracy budget F★ and regulate a viable operating band on an asymmetric cusp. The state axis x = F − F★ tracks instantaneous deviation from this budget, while engagement ξ = G − F★, where G is expected free energy under the current generative model, and inference tilt δ (Convergent vs Divergent) function as control parameters that define three operational regimes: a subcritical Autopilot shaft, a near-critical Ψ-band that supports flow and fluid intelligence, and a supercritical Trident region with exploitation and exploration wells. General intelligence is reframed as the navigable volume 𝒢 of this landscape, decomposed into Control Range, Navigability (captured by a meta-efficacy η), and Niche Coupling (indexed by coherence χ and environmental feedback λ). I sketch how this cusp geometry can be instantiated from cortical columns to whole-brain control networks, and extended conceptually to teams and institutions, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, sketch falsifiable neural and behavioural signatures of Ψ-band occupancy and collapse, and argue that Trident G’s viable-band regulation offers a more resilient target for AI agents, cognitive training, and institutional design than pure free-energy minimisation.\n\nKeywords: free-energy principle, near-criticality, general intelligence, allostasis, cusp catastrophe, cognitive resilience",

Building on the validated Italian version of the Smartphone Impact Scale (SIS), we tested its validity and reliability in English-and French-speaking populations. The SIS measures seven aspects of smartphone use, capturing both positive (e.g., task support) and negative (e.g., loss of control) behaviors. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the seven-factor structure identified in the Italian version. Measurement invariance (MI) and construct validity were evaluated across three linguistic groups: Italian (n = 739), English (n = 1,078), and French (n = 2,045). MI analyses demonstrated that the SIS subscales met criteria for configural, metric, and full or partial scalar invariance across languages and gender. The results also indicated good construct validity. Overall, the SIS is a psychometrically sound tool for assessing the impact of smartphoneuse across languages and can be used in cross-cultural research to examine smartphone behaviors in diverse populations. We found lattent differences in use across cultures and gender suggesting a nuanced impact of smartphone use.",

          "abstract": "The Knowledge-Learning-Instruction (KLI) framework is a cognitive framework describing the causal interplay between knowledge, learning, and instruction. It has an explicit cross-domain scope and has had considerable impact in the learning sciences. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been applied in research on instructed second language (L2) learning. This is notable because, although L2 research is sometimes siloed within the learning sciences, it has undergone a cognitive turn emphasizing domain-general learning mechanisms.\nWe propose that a KLI-informed cognitive view on instructed L2 learning helps to systematically integrate the field into the learning sciences, encompassing not only domain-general learning mechanisms but also domain-general perspectives on knowledge and instruction. Importantly, this integration may generate novel, testable hypotheses in L2 research, grounded in an interdisciplinary understanding of knowledge, learning, and instruction.\nWe present a cognitive KLI-based perspective on instructed L2 learning and discuss challenges of this perspective, including the fundamentally integrative nature of language knowledge, the inherently expressive character of language (verbal, written, signed), and the limited relevance of understanding and sense-making processes in instructed L2 learning. Moreover, we provide an illustrative KLI-informed analysis of two empirical L2 studies. Based on these analyses, we discuss novel, testable hypotheses generated through the KLI lens that offer interdisciplinary approaches to known issues in L2 pedagogy, such as integrating multiple induction- and refinement-enhancing instructional principles to mitigate individual differences in L2 classrooms.",

Maladaptive personality traits may further exacerbate loneliness. In this preregistered 14-day Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) study, we examined loneliness across social contexts and timescales (momentarily, daily) in relation to maladaptive personality traits among N = 294 adolescents aged 12-21 years (Mage = 17.5, SD = 2.64; 58.5% female; 86.73% born in Germany). Loneliness (βmomentary = 0.51; βdaily = 0.67) was higher when participants were alone, yet only the presence of close others (e.g., friends)—not weaker ties (e.g., classmates)—reduced loneliness (β = –0.39 to –0.62). Interestingly, youth who were alone more frequently did not report higher overall loneliness. Maladaptive personality traits were associated with higher (βmomentary = 0.32; βend-of-day = 0.40) and more variable (βmomentary = 0.31; βend-of-day = 0.34) loneliness but amplified the effect of being alone on loneliness only on the between-person level (β = –1.13). Detachment and Negative Affect showed unique patterns. Exploratory analyses indicated that social satisfaction partially mediated the association (β = 0.50). These findings underscore the importance of both structural and qualitative aspects of social environments, as well as personality-related vulnerabilities, to better understand loneliness-dynamics in youth.",

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition marked by atypical social and emotional processing, has been linked to altered sensitivity and responsiveness to affective touch. However, systematic understanding of how affective touch is processed in ASD, particularly across behavioural and neural levels, remains limited. This review synthesises current findings on affective touch perception in individuals with ASD, with reference to both behavioural studies and neurophysiological evidence. In order to explain the observed abnormalities, we propose an integrated neurocognitive developmental framework that connects early physiological atypicalities to the mature cognitive-affective profile. This review highlights significant implications of the developmental trajectory of affective touch in ASD and directs the translation of these findings into targeted intervention strategies aimed at enhancing social-affective communication.",

          "abstract": "Lexical causative verbs are traditionally assumed to pattern uniformly: they specify only a result state, leaving the manner of causing unarticulated, like the overt cause. We argue that this view obscures a fundamental division within English causative verbs. Building on Rose et al. (2021), we show that a substantial subset of causatives – thick causatives such as burn, melt, break, bury – encode information about the way a change is brought about, and that this specification yields systematic semantic and pragmatic restrictions. Thick causatives in their physical sense resist subjects that denote absences, facts, degrees, or events that fail to instantiate the appropriate productive (force- transmitting) mechanism, in contrast to thin causatives like kill, destroy, and change, which readily combine with such subjects. Using corpus evidence from a representative sample of 37 frequent English causatives, we demonstrate (i) that most thick causatives pattern like Embick’s 2009 break-causatives – compatible with strong adjectival resultatives and requiring production-based causation – while (ii) some thick causatives (e.g., bury) encode the relevant manner information via the state they lexicalize rather than via an event predicate. We develop a pragmatic competition account linking the production constraint to the directness constraint, yielding a unified explanation for the distribution of thick vs. thin causatives in English.",

As a species, humans find uncertainty aversive and excessive. Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for emotional disorders. One way to resolve uncertainty in novel situations is to rely on memories of past similar experiences, yet this process is largely unexplored in social contexts. A novel social decision-making task showed that individuals recruit both memories and incremental experiences of social rewards to guide decisions under social uncertainty. Further, individuals with elevated depressive symptoms showed better integration of positive social memories if they also had high levels of autobiographical memory specificity. These findings suggest that successfully recalling past positive social experiences improves navigation of social uncertainty, and may confer preventative advantages for those with high levels of affective disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Recent work has proposed that there are symbolic beliefs. These beliefs do not serve primarily to track the facts in the world but rather to express the believer’s own identity. On this view, several disparate features of belief – from whether a belief is important to identity to whether it is sensitive to evidence – would be related to an underlying “symbolicness” dimension. We converted the features potentially related to symbolicness into items and asked people to rate their own beliefs on them. Study 1 found that beliefs which were high on one feature (importance) were rated higher on all the items, except for sensitivity to evidence. Study 2 found that ratings of any beliefs on almost all the items loaded onto a single, symbolicness factor, except again for evidence insensitivity. Study 3 asked participants to rate their own beliefs on all the items in Study 2 and several additional items which got at whether a belief was subjective. We recovered the symbolicness factor, but found it was largely orthogonal to the subjectivity and evidence insensitivity items. These findings suggest that most of the features we tested relate to an underlying symbolicness factor, which corresponds to whether a belief represents identity. But, surprisingly, this factor was not related to items that get at whether a belief represents facts about the world. It would seem that some beliefs express identity and track facts; some beliefs only do one of these things; and some beliefs do neither.",

          "abstract": "Inferential narrative comprehension is an important, understudied element of listening comprehension. Research has rarely examined predictors within a unified theoretical framework and has yet to explore autism traits in a neurotypical sample. We address this gap by applying the Direct and Indirect Effects of Text (DIET) model to investigate predictors of inferential narrative comprehension in 113 neurotypical Australian children aged 4-8 years. We assessed foundational cognitive (non-verbal intelligence), oral language (vocabulary, grammar), and social-cognitive skills (theory of mind and autism traits) as predictors of inferential narrative comprehension. Analysis using hierarchical regression found chronological age, vocabulary, and grammar predicted significant variance in inferential comprehension. Theory of mind and autism traits correlated with inferential narrative comprehension but did not explain unique variance beyond existing DIET predictors. Findings support the DIET model’s emphasis on foundational oral language skills and highlight the importance of including age in future models. Findings contribute novel evidence from an Australian context and underscore the need for further research into social-cognitive influences on inferential comprehension. Implications include the potential for early identification of children at risk for comprehension difficulties and the need for further longitudinal and intervention research to clarify developmental pathways.",

          "abstract": "With the long-term care costs for people living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias estimated to increase to $16.9 trillion and 115.8 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost annually by 2050, the human toll of this devastating neurodegenerative disorder is immeasurable. Prominent research has identified blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, triggered by neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, as a critical biomarker in the onset and progression of AD. Its interference with the expression of key receptor and transporter proteins in the BBB may accelerate the formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to progressive neurological decline. Investigating BBB dysfunction and abnormal expression of receptor and transporter proteins—including LRP-1, GLUT-1, Pgp, and RAGE—may lead to early diagnosis of the disease, which is critical to monitoring and administering treatment to slow the decline in cognitive abilities of AD patients. This investigation attempts to determine the viability of current interventions that aim to address the cycle of Aβ accumulation and BBB dysfunction by regulating LRP-1, GLUT-1, Pgp, and RAGE. Exploring BBB receptors and transporters as key therapeutic targets may play a critical role in addressing the cycle of Aβ aggregation and BBB dysfunction, allowing researchers to discover clinical interventions to treat the pathology and progression of Alzheimer’s disease in the human clinical context.",

This knowledge is crucial to conceptualizing and realizing internal systems change in practice.

          "abstract": "When children learn novel words, referential ambiguity is a constant challenge. However, despite facing this uncertainty, children acquire their vocabulary with remarkable ease. One possible key to their success might be that children use active learning strategies and employ their developing metacognitive skills. To test this idea, we assessed whether 4- to 5-year-old preschoolers (and adults) are aware of their own uncertainty during referent identification, and to what extent they can effectively use this information to guide their learning process. Participants encountered a series of labeling events that varied in referential ambiguity: from minimal (e.g., hearing a familiar label), to medium (hearing a novel label in presence of a familiar and a novel object, resolvable via mutual exclusivity), to maximal (hearing a novel label in presence of two novel objects). Following this, they received counterevidence to their initial word-object-mappings and decided which mappings (learned in more vs. less ambiguous contexts) to update. Results revealed three key findings: First, both children’s and adults’ explicit and implicit uncertainty increased with the amount of referential ambiguity. Second, when confronted with uncertainty, children spontaneously aimed to resolve this by seeking additional information. Third, while adults preferentially updated words learned in higher ambiguity, children instead tended to revise information that was learned less recently, leaving open questions about whether and how contextual uncertainty shapes their updating strategies. The pattern of results provides insights into the skills and mechanisms that enable children to learn correct word meanings under uncertainty.",

          "abstract": "Emerging research highlights reward probability (i.e., access to and pleasure derived from environmental reward) as a potential explanatory factor in posttraumatic stress (PTS). This study examined the explanatory utility of reward probability for PTS severity and specific symptom clusters while controlling for depression. In a cross-sectional design, 428 undergraduates completed the DSM-5 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and the Reward Probability Index (RPI) subscales: Reward Probability (RPI-RP) and Environmental Suppression (RPI-ES). Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested three models: (1) associations between RPI subscales and PTSD symptom clusters (Intrusion, Avoidance [AAR], Negative Alterations in Cognition and Mood [NACM], Hyperarousal); (2) the same model controlling for depression; and (3) exploratory indirect pathways from RPI-RP/ES to PTSD clusters via depression. All SEMs demonstrated robust psychometric structure. In Model 1, RPI-RP was positively associated with Intrusion and negatively with NACM, whereas RPI-ES was negatively associated with all clusters. In Model 2, controlling for depression, RPI-RP remained positively associated with Intrusion and AAR, while its association with NACM became nonsignificant; RPI-ES remained negatively associated with all clusters. Depression was positively associated with all clusters except AAR. In Model 3, depression partially accounted for the association of RPI-ES on all PTSD clusters and of RPI-RP on Intrusion, and fully accounted for the associations between RPI-RP and NACM/AAR. Findings support the utility of the RPI, specifically the RPI-ES subscale, in understanding PTS symptom severity beyond depression. Further research is needed to clarify the ambiguous associations between RPI-RP and PTS symptoms.",

The present study aimed to assess mental health and the effectiveness of stress-coping strategies during the 34th month of the ongoing conflict. The sample consisted of 2,962 residents from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary, selected through stratified random sampling. Data were collected using an online panel survey. The findings indicate that the highest levels of stress-related disorders, anxiety, and depression were observed in Poland, whereas the lowest levels were found in the Czech Republic. Across all countries, respondents most frequently adopted problem-focused coping strategies, while emotion-focused strategies were used less often. Linear regression analyses showed that younger age, lower perceived quality of life, and emotion-focused coping strategies were the strongest predictors of mental health disorders. Among Polish respondents, problem-focused strategies were associated with reduced psychological distress. Overall, the results suggest that the Russo-Ukrainian War has had a negative impact on mental health in Central and Eastern Europe. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring by health services and the development of effective interventions to support the psychological well-being of populations living near Ukraine.\nKeywords: mental health, distress, anxiety, depression, coping strategies, Central and Eastern Europe.",

          "abstract": "The rapidly developing research field of brain-body neuroscience faces methodological challenges, as analysts continue to develop new analysis strategies for robust statistics in the absence of established best practices. This quest for robust statistics is further complicated by the (naturally) circular data involved in the study of phase-locked effects, e.g. in respiration-brain coupling. Circularity of respiratory data particularly affects the problem of multiple comparisons in phase-related inferential statistics. In this tutorial, we propose a robust pipeline for respiration-related analyses based on a circular extension of cluster-based permutation testing we developed. We highlight and offer guidance on critical parameters in the analysis, systematically compare various approaches being used in the field today, and provide open-access software code for flexible use and future development of our proposed pipeline.",

          "abstract": "Accurate predictions about the future are crucial for optimizing policy choices, but finding skilled forecasters is challenging. Large forecasting tournaments can identify generalist superforecasters who make reliably accurate predictions across domains, but such tournaments take months to complete and do little to explain why these forecasters perform at a consistently high level. We solve these problems by developing a one-hour Forecasting Proficiency Test (FPT) that explains 75% of the variance in forecasters' accuracy about a wide variety of events and provides new evidence about the mechanisms that make some people better forecasters than others. Specialized cognitive abilities, including base rate sensitivity and Bayesian reasoning, uniquely predict forecasters' accuracy even when controlling for more traditional measures of general intelligence. The FPT also includes carefully chosen real-world forecasting questions that produce interpretable and exchangeable test scores. The top 20% of testees made forecasts with accuracy comparable to previously identified superforecasters; and two-thirds of superforecasters had FPT scores above the 75th percentile. The creation of an effective test of forecasting proficiency expands our understanding of human intelligence and provides an important tool for decision-makers who rely on accurate probabilistic predictions to make high-stakes decisions that impact the lives of millions.",

Studies have been conducted on the role of learning and education for the two types of epistemic curiosity, diversive and specific curiosity. The Japan version of the Epistemic Curiosity (J-EC) scale, which measures these two types as a personality trait, has been developed based upon empirical studies using the J-EC scale. We thought it was necessary to develop an English version of the J-EC scale, in order to be able to make international comparisons of levels of curiosity among Japanese people. In this study, we translated the J-EC scale into English and assessed its factor structure, reliability, and validity. Results of factor analysis and correlation analysis validated the factor structure of diversive and specific curiosity, and the reliability and validity of diversive and specific curiosity subscales almost perfectly in accordance with our hypotheses.",

          "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) provides significant benefits but also risks psychological overdependence, termed AI addiction (AIA). Understanding the mechanisms underlying this emerging form of addiction is thus essential. Anchored in the Interaction of Person–Affect–Cognition–Execution (I-PACE) model, we conceptualize general attitudes toward AI (GAAI) as “person-level” dispositions and the sense of agency (SoA) as the “cognitive-affective” response that mediates AIA. Study 1 (NSample 1 = 500; NSample 2 = 896) adapted and validated a concise Chinese General Attitudes toward AI Scale, confirming a stable two-factor structure with good reliability. Study 2 (N = 780) applied this scale to a parallel mediation model linking GAAI to AIA via positive (SoPA) and negative (SoNA) facets of SoA. Results revealed that positive attitudes towards AI (GAAIP) indirectly mitigated addiction by enhancing SoPA and reducing SoNA, whereas negative attitudes towards AI (GAAIN) positively associated with GAA through diminishing SoPA and increasing SoNA. These findings extend the application of the I-PACE framework in the AI field, by demonstrating the association between GAAI and AIA, and the mediating role of SoA. Our findings also have the potential to guide the development of cognitive or attitudinal interventions for AIA.",

          "authors": "Issei Ichimiya; Hiroko Ichimiya",
          "abstract": "Background. Dichotic listening, in which different sounds are simultaneously presented to each ear, can evoke perceptual phenomena that are not noted during monaural or diotic listening. A well-known example is the scale illusion, in which listeners perceive coherent melodic streams that vary from the actual auditory input. This illusion underscores the interaction between pitch proximity-based grouping and laterality cues. However, the original scale illusion is complex, which makes it challenging to isolate specific perceptual mechanisms. Previously, we introduced simplified tonal sequences that allowed for a clearer evaluation of how pitch proximity and laterality interact. This study explores two questions: (1) to what extent pitch proximity-based grouping dominates over laterality in dichotic listening and (2) whether dichotic presentation decreases the perception of roughness, an unpleasant auditory sensation caused by overlapping frequencies.\n\nMethods. This study included 20 adults with normal hearing (eight men and 12 women; mean age: 35.6 years). In Experiment 1, participants listened to pairs of tone sequences (dichotic and diotic) and chose the one in which an ascending scale was perceived more clearly. In Experiment 2, the participants determined the tone pairs that sounded rougher. The two dichotic tone sequences were named 2S and 2J, respectively. The 2S consisted of the C major scale with ascending tones presented to the right ear, whereas the pitch of the simultaneously presented tones to the left ear was two whole tones lower. Furthermore, 2J was created by swapping every other tone between the right and left ears in 2S. The diotic versions included one in which the tones from the right and left channels of 2S were mixed in both ears (DO) and one in which the tones of the right channel of 2S were heard from both ears (S).\n\nResults. In Experiment 1, the participants most clearly perceived the diotic version S. Regarding dichotic tonal sequences, no considerable differences were observed in perception between 2S and 2J. In the diotic version of the DO, pitch perception varied across individuals. In Experiment 2, the DO was rated as substantially rougher than in all other conditions, including 2S and 2J.\n\nConclusion. Our results showed two perceptual benefits of dichotic listening in individuals with normal hearing. First, dichotic listening supports the perception of coherent melodic patterns, with pitch proximity dominating the location of the sound input. Second, the dichotic presentation considerably reduced roughness, likely owing to the separation of frequency processing in the cochlea of each ear. Despite being a preliminary investigation, this study underscores the potential of dichotic listening to improve auditory clarity and comfort.",

          "abstract": "Striving for social status is a fundamental human motive, yet individuals vary considerably in their status-seeking tendencies. Drawing on attachment literature and life history theory, we propose that attachment anxiety drives status pursuit through heightened intrasexual competition. Across six preregistered studies (N = 4,456) spanning five countries, we found that attachment anxiety, but not attachment avoidance, predicts stronger status strivings. This relationship is mediated by intrasexual competition—competing with same-sex rivals—rather than, as previously documented, by materialism or general competitiveness. Experimental evidence confirmed causality: inducing attachment anxiety (vs. avoidance) increased desire for high-status cars and houses through heightened intrasexual competition. A moderation-of-process design demonstrated that experimentally manipulating intrasexual competition correspondingly enhanced or reduced the effect of attachment anxiety on status strivings, but only for high-status possessions. These effects held for both men and women. Our findings show that anxiously attached individuals pursue status to compensate for relational insecurities, and they do so by competing with same-sex rivals. This research extends attachment theory to status pursuit and clarifies whether, when, and why individual differences in attachment patterns predict people’s status strivings.",

          "abstract": "AI-generated deepfake videos, which mimic real recordings of individuals, enable the impersonation of public figures and the widespread dissemination of misinformation. According to previous research, people are not only poor at detecting deepfakes but also often overestimate their detection ability, highlighting the need for effective interventions. Despite this, evidence on how to improve deepfake detection and calibrate metacognitive judgments remains limited. In this preregistered 2 x 2 experiment, we examined the effects of an educational infographic, cognitive load, and their interaction on deepfake detection accuracy and metacognitive overestimation (absolute and relative). We also investigated age, cognitive reflection, and general trust as potential moderators. A total of 229 participants were randomly assigned to infographic versus control conditions and high versus low cognitive load conditions, viewed 12 political videos (deepfakes and authentic videos), and rated videos’ authenticity and their perceived performance. The results showed that participants exposed to the infographic showed higher detection accuracy and more accurate relative performance judgments, whereas cognitive load did not produce significant main effects. An interaction suggested that the infographic’s metacognitive benefits weakened under higher load, although this finding requires caution due to an inconclusive manipulation check. None of the individual differences moderated the findings. Lastly, participants slightly underestimated their absolute performance but considerably overestimated their relative standing, with the lowest performers showing the strongest overconfidence. Overall, the results suggest that concise and engaging guidance, such as infographics, can enhance deepfake detection and promote more calibrated self-assessments, providing a scalable tool for strengthening resilience to synthetic media.",

          "abstract": "Humans excel at leveraging relational knowledge (e.g., relative features or locations) to facilitate object processing. This knowledge is thought to emerge gradually through associative learning over the course of experience. While extensive research has shown how experience shapes attentional biases toward non-social regularities, far less is known about whether the learning of social relationships – the most consequential form of relational knowledge for humans – tunes attention toward social entities. Across four experiments (N = 144), we examined this question by training participants to associate face pairs with either interacting (face-to-face) or non-interacting (back-to-back) configurations. In a subsequent cueing task, direct-gaze face pairs from interacting configurations captured attention more strongly than those from non-interacting configurations, an effect abolished for upside-down faces. This bias persisted even when individual faces from learned dyads were tested in isolation. In contrast, this bias did not occur for arrows, ruling out domain-general cueing, and for animal faces, even when training promoted identity-level processing, indicating its specificity to human faces. Our findings demonstrate that social relationships can be internalized through experience as emergent attributes of face representations, highlighting a key role of social learning in shaping attention to social information.",

Study 1 (n = 1099) revealed that stronger orthographic imagery correlates with heightened between-cluster semantic associations and reduced semantic conformity to group norms, suggesting a role in generating novel conceptual links. Study 2 (n = 875) linked orthographic imagery to lower sensory processing sensitivity, suggesting its function as a top-down sensory filter. Unexpectedly, Study 3 (n = 487) found that visual imagery—not orthographic—predicted reduced engagement with reading apps, suggesting a cognitive-mismatch effect. These results position orthographic imagery as a unique mechanism that expands semantic networks while attenuating sensory influx, with implications for creativity research and clinical interventions for sensory hypersensitivity.",

          "abstract": "The tendency to overweight low probability events and underweight high probability events stems from the categorical distinction between ``not happening,'' ``a chance,'' and ``happening.'' We demonstrate that there exist multiple intermediary categories within the probability space that produce additional inflection points. Across preregistered studies, sensitivity jumps when probabilities cross these boundaries. With numeric probabilities, left-digit changes amplify certainty equivalents (Study 1) and shift risky choices in incentive-aligned gambles (Study 2). With visual probabilities, pie-chart partitions at halves and quarters have the same effect (Study 3). Hierarchical CPT fits reveal systematically negative residuals at boundary-crossing pairs, and a reanalysis of Wu &amp; Gonzalez (1996) exhibits the same signature (Study 4). Thus, probability weighting is not smooth between 0 and 1—it is punctuated by context-dependent inflection points that distort the space. Recognizing these format-specific categories clarifies when behavior shifts and offers actionable guidance for judgment and decision-making theory.",

Studies examining the long-term impact of repeated bully victimizations have found that victimization in childhood and adolescence leads to poor mental health outcomes such as anxiety disorders later in the life course (Carlisle and Rofes, 2007; Copeland et al., 2013; Stapinski et al., 2014).  Unfortunately, few studies have investigated this association across categories of sex and race/ethnicity despite documented differences in reported rates of general anxiety disorder. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 data, the present study explores the relationship between childhood bullying victimization and generalized anxiety disorder in middle adulthood. The results suggest the impact of experiencing repeated bully victimizations in childhood and adolescence had a positive association with general anxiety disorder and this association was general across categories of sex and race/ethnicity.

In contrast, most recent studies of visual working memory (VWM) using continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous scales, do not distinguish between memory variability and decision-process variability in characterizing retrieval errors and are silent on decision times. We combined a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions, the circular diffusion model (CDM), with a peaked, heavy-tailed distribution of memory representations, the Jones-Pewsey distribution, to characterize the speed and accuracy of continuous-outcome decisions about the hues of saturated and desaturated color patches in four experiments that varied the difficulty of the decision task and the memory load of the VWM task. The CDM provided a good account of the marginal and joint distributions of response times and response errors and the anisotropies of stimuli in different parts of the color space across all experiments. VWM precision followed either an inverse square-root law or power law in set size, depending on saturation, as predicted by sample-size and attention-weighted sample-size models, respectively. The results support a model in which the capacity limits of VWM reflect the statistical properties of a population of noisy neurons that are divided among items in memory under attentional control and determine the precision of recalled items.",

          "abstract": "Scale-free temporal structure in resting-state intrinsic neural activity has been proposed to support the interaction between internal and external cognition, but its role in decision making remains unclear. We examined whether individual differences in the dynamics of resting-state alpha activity are related to how much people rely on externally reinforced options versus internally generated preferences during free choice. Participants first performed an externally guided reward-learning task, in which they learned through feedback which abstract shapes tended to yield rewards. They then completed an internally guided preference-judgment task, repeatedly choosing between these previously rewarded shapes and new shapes without feedback. Resting-state electroencephalography was recorded before, between, and after the two tasks. A computational model provided trial-by-trial estimates of stimulus value in preference-judgment task, and long-range temporal correlations in the alpha-band amplitude envelope were quantified using detrended fluctuation analysis. We replicated the superiority of intrinsically learned value: the most preferred new shape acquired a higher final value than the previously rewarded shapes, despite their higher initial values derived from external reinforcement. Stronger scale-free temporal correlations in resting-state alpha activity were associated with a larger superiority of intrinsically learned value, primarily reflecting lower final values for previously rewarded stimuli and relatively higher values distributed across multiple intrinsically learned options. These findings suggest that scale-free temporal dynamics in resting-state alpha activity reflect an intrinsic neural bias that favours internally generated preferences over extrinsically reinforced values in free choice.",

Yet societies rely on rigid rules—obligations and prohibitions that apply categorically, even when case-by-case reasoning could yield better outcomes. Why would a species capable of such flexibility bind itself to inflexible rules? We propose that rigid rules arise as social technologies for managing ambiguity around noncooperation. People often have legitimate reasons for failing to cooperate, yet those reasons are typically opaque to observers, allowing opportunists to disguise selfishness as justified hardship. We formalize this idea with an evolutionary game-theoretic model. Two cooperative equilibria emerge: a flexible norm that accommodates legitimate excuses but is vulnerable to exploitation, and a rigid norm that closes this loophole by mandating cooperation even when inefficient. Comparing these equilibria reveals an efficiency–robustness trade-off: flexibility maximizes welfare when trust is secure, whereas rigidity preserves cooperation when trust is fragile. This explains why rigid rules prevail in low-trust settings—interactions with strangers, formal institutions, or tight societies—where flexibility is more common in high-trust contexts.",

          "authors": "Mohammad Ali Kadivar; Saber Khani; Danial Vahabli; Vahid Abedini; Samira Barzin",
          "abstract": "What drives the uneven geographic spread of revolutionary episodes? While structural approaches emphasize pre-existing fault lines, contingency approaches highlight emergent processes. We synthesize these perspectives, arguing that specific triggers shape a revolutionary episode’s social geography by activating certain fault lines while leaving others dormant. Through a comparative analysis of three revolutionary episodes in Iran (2017–2022), each with a distinct trigger, we demonstrate how different triggers shape patterns of contention. Using event-history and spatial regression analysis of subnational protest data alongside socioeconomic and political variables, we show that a fuel price hike activated grievances in oil-producing areas, while a repressive event targeting a woman from an ethnic and religious minority mobilized protests in minority-populated districts. Our findings illustrate how triggers structure revolutionary mobilization, offering broader insights into the interaction between structural conditions and contingent events in contentious politics.",

          "title": "Exploring the Complex Challenges of Internally Displaced Persons: An Inquiry into the Realities and Responses of Non-Camp IDPs in Ibadan, Nigeria",
          "authors": "Samuel Pelumi Davis",
          "abstract": "Internal displacement is a pressing global problem that has escalated to an appalling scale, especially considering that over 71 million individuals were forcibly displaced by the end of 2022. Nigeria is one of the nations within sub-Saharan Africa that report the highest number of cases of internally displaced persons (IDPs), mostly caused by cyclical conflict and catastrophic floods. Although information related to the presence of IDPs in formal camps or staying with host families is abundant, there is a conspicuous gap in the literature concerning those individuals, living in non-camp settings, who have already established themselves within communities and are often not visible to formal support networks. This paper set out to illuminate the peculiar issues and plight of such non-camped IDPs in the Ibadan metropolis, Nigeria. The study took a qualitative approach, rooted in interpretivism, and employed a case study design. Given that this particular subset of the population was difficult to identify, the researcher used snowball sampling, ending up with a sample of 14 respondents, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), key informants, and mendicants. They gathered data by using key informant interviews (KIIs) and semi-structured interviews and analysed the data using thematic analysis. The results shed light on three major thematic areas: challenges faced, effects of non-camp environment on various aspects of the lives of IDPS and survival strategies. Data from the interviews revealed that the bulk of the problems that non-camp IDPs face are lack of basic amenities, extreme health problems, extreme financial instability, daily insecurity, and social isolation. The vulnerability this group faces in the form of theft, violence and harassment is compounded by the lack of formal protection. Besides, living conditions are unstable and have a significant impact on livelihood, education interruption, and housing instability. To endure, the IDPs employ various survival tactics, such as supplementing random jobs with mendicancy, resorting to self-medication and informal social groups to stay healthy, and maintaining safety by staying in groups. The paper concludes that non-camp IDPs are caught in a web of vulnerability that is compounded by the absence of formalised support systems, which make their situation distinctively unique to that of formal camp settings. The results suggest that the most effective approach to helping this peculiar population is a combination of various interventions, such as increased access to healthcare, livelihood support, improved community security, and better housing to help them recover and experience social integration in the long term.\n\nKeywords: Internal displacement, internally displaced person (IDP), non-camp, integration, challenges",

          "authors": "Joshua Rotondo-Valentine; Jeremy K. Yamashiro",
          "abstract": "With research into the relationship between memory and imagination broadening to include collective identities (i.e. race, nationality), and recent polarization in modern American politics, it is important to understand the way people think and strategize about political change from a collective standpoint. Based on what Klugman (2011) describes as a \"theory of change\", and informed by Trobe &amp; Liberman’s (2003) original findings on abstract and concrete construals of events, the present study offers support for previous studies that have found patience and other temporal constraints to be an important predictor of how people conceptualize political change, including Wang's finding that an individual's patience is predictive of when they join a protest movement (2019), as well as various articles supporting the role temporal discounting plays in policy preferences (Barnfield, 2024) and moral future thinking (i.e. Law et al., 2024). In particular, it was found that the faster you desire social change to occur, as well as the more idealistic (i.e. abstract) you are about the type of system used to achieve political change (i.e. creating a new system vs. working within the current system), the more anxiety you have about your government's future response to issues you care about.",

          "abstract": "Nous proposons ici une approche énactive et pragmatiste de l’enseignement et de la pratique de la redirection écologique, formalisant la pratique du jeu sérieux dans le cadre du module «Gestion de Crises» du MSc «Statégie et Design pour l’Anthropocène». Nous introduisons d’abord le paradigme neuro-computationnel de l’Inférence Active, lequel décrit la cognition humaine comme un processus prédictif régulant action et perception via l’énaction d’un modèle implicite du monde intégrée dans les dynamiques agent-environnement. Sur cette base, nous décrivons ensuite l’engagement social humain comme étant régulé par des contraintes sociales, prémisses publiques pour l’action sociale, ou encore un champ commun intégrant les attentes contextuelles liées à un contexte social et matériel donné. Finalement, nous suggérons la pratique du jeu sérieux comme une méthodologie permettant un accès privilégié à de telles prémisses publiques, et donc comme un outil précieux pour la redirection des pratiques sociales. Nous proposons de plus des pistes concrètes pour le design et l’accompagnement d’une démarche d’enquête co-opérative par le jeu sérieux visant à réfléchir sur les enjeux et les pratiques d’une communauté ou d’un réseau donné. Par ce travail, nous espérons offrir un cadre socio-cognitif pour formaliser les enjeux sous-jacents à la pratique du jeu sérieux, et ainsi participer au cadre méthodologique de la redirection écologique.\n\nWe propose an enactive and pragmatic approach to teaching and practising ecological redirection, formalising the practice of serious games as developed within the « Crisis Management » module of the MSc in « Strategy and Design for the Anthropocene ». We first introduce the neurocomputational framework of Active Inference, which describes human cognition as a predictive process regulating action and perception through the enaction of an implicit model of the world integrated into agent-environment dynamics. On this basis, we then describe human social engagement as being regulated by social constraints, public premises for social action, or a common ground defining contextual expectations embedded in a given social and material context. Finally, we suggest the practice of serious games as a methodology allowing a privileged access to such public premises, and therefore as a valuable tool for redirecting social practices. We also propose concrete avenues for the design and facilitation of a cooperative inquiry process through serious games aimed at reflecting on the issues and practices of a given community or network. Through this work, we hope to offer a socio-cognitive framework for formalising the processes underlying existing practices of serious games, and thus contribute to the methodological framework of ecological redirection.",

          "abstract": "This study highlights two interrelated needs for reinterpreting silence in contexts where\nindividuals depend on overlapping social, medical, or housing systems. First, silence should\nbe understood structurally rather than solely as a symptom of trauma or abuse; people\nmay remain quiet not because of psychological inhibition but because speaking up risks\ndestabilising essential aspects of their living conditions or access to care. Second, it is\nnecessary to identify, analyse, and design responses to environments that structurally compel\nsilence, irrespective of the specific service domain. These considerations position silence not\nas an individual deficit but as a rational adaptation to constrained capabilities and limited\nchoice sets.",

          "authors": "Leor Roseman",
          "abstract": "The recent mainstreaming of psychedelics has distanced itself from the countercultural image of the past, yet the question of whether psychedelics are political remains pressing. What happens when psychedelics meet politics?\nOn one hand lies the politics of the unitive mystical experience: harmony, beyond good &amp; evil, beyond space &amp; time, and with love to all. Studying ayahuasca groups of Palestinians and Israelis, I observed that such mystical unitive ethos can bypass political tensions. Yet, I also noticed revelatory-revolutionary events with liberatory aspirations. Prophetic. Such micro-messianic states of consciousness are charged with moral urgency, and are active, historical, political, and sometimes full of ego. \nIn this paper, I continue to inquire into the psychedelic messianic phenomenology and dynamics through a literature review . Focusing on the micro-messianic movements of Allen Ginsberg, Master Irineu, and John Wilson (Moonhead)—figures associated with the diffusion of LSD, Daime (ayahuasca), and peyote respectively—I trace how revelatory events generate waves of transformation, in fidelity to the revelation, seeking redemption.\nI propose that, in moments of political anxiety, psychedelics can catalyze micro-messianic events: bursts in the status quo that fuel collective and personal movements animated by hope, mission, and meaning. These revelatory-revolutionary dynamics not only inspire redemptive actions but also drive the diffusion of psychedelic practices across social, cultural, and political boundaries.",

Based on survey data from 178 Portuguese employees, results reveal that family businesses foster cultures of support and identity but exhibit higher resistance to change, whereas non-family firms emphasize rules and innovation. No significant differences emerged in perceived performance. Moreover, resistance to change negatively affected perceived performance in family firms, while organizational culture showed an independent role.

          "abstract": "This paper presents a critical audit of the Spanish-speaking Twitch ecosystem, comparing the platform’s performance during November 2024 and 2025. The results evidence a structural contraction of the platform: viewership has decreased by 33%, while active content creators diminished by 10.26%. Cohort analysis reveals a massive attrition rate of 75.23%, driven by extreme inequality (Gini coefficient of 0.87 and an audience concentration of 90% within the top 20%). The data confirm the existence of a digital ’poverty line’: streamers who abandoned the platform averaged merely 3.74 viewers in 2024. However, the ecosystem’s deterioration is not exclusive to small creators; the study identifies a generalized impoverishment of established streamers (present in both November 2024 and 2025), who, despite remaining active, suffered a 27.4% loss in their average audience, dropping from 17.67 to 12.83 viewers. These findings suggest a supply-demand mismatch that threatens the sustainability of medium and small creators and disincentivizes participation in the platform.",

          "abstract": "In the past two decades, a growing number of ranked-choice voting (RCV) elections have been conducted in various jurisdictions across the United States. However, tabulated results of RCV have been reported and stored in widely different styles across places and years, making it infeasible for researchers to perform systematic analyses of vote tabulations. We introduce ARCHIVE: a database of standardized tabulated results for over 7600 round-level candidate vote counts from 514 American RCV elections, 2004-2024. To construct the database, we develop a methodological procedure based on large-language models that semi-automatically collect, standardize, and store candidate vote counts while instantly validating the resulting information. Our database releases multiple levels of data, including election metadata, round-level attributes, and candidate-level information with consistent election identifiers, allowing users to address key questions in electoral competition under RCV. To illustrate, we show how users may estimate the effective number of candidates per round.",

          "authors": "Hollye Kirkcaldy; Keren MacLennan; Christina Demski; Annayah Miranda Beatrice Prosser",
          "abstract": "Climate adaptation systematically excludes Disabled people from policymaking, despite their disproportionate exposure to climate-related harms. Recent climate scholarship demonstrates this exclusion constitutes epistemic injustice, yet the mechanisms producing it remain under-examined. We argue adaptation frameworks generate epistemic injustice by categorising Disabled people as inherently vulnerable, devaluing both them and their knowledge, while claiming false objectivity – what Haraway termed the God Trick – to present privileged ableist perspectives as universal truth.  We show that Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) operationalise the God Trick at scale by embedding ableist assumptions as objective inputs and excluding the heterogeneous adaptation knowledge Disabled people hold. This exclusion reflects entrenched structural inequalities that marginalise Disabled people throughout society. Without insights from those most affected by extreme weather, adaptation interventions fail to address, and actively worsen, the heightened climate risk faced by Disabled people. Achieving epistemic justice requires more than tokenistic inclusion; it demands conceptual transformation that rejects false objectivity, methodological transformation that includes situated modelling and creative research approaches, and institutional transformation that dismantles structural barriers to Disabled people’s participation as essential knowers.",

          "authors": "Janis Umblijs; Are Skeie Hermansen",
          "abstract": "Personal names are visible markers of ethnic identity that can shape access to economic opportunity. While field experiments provide ample evidence that foreign-sounding names limit immigrants’ access to employment, far less is known about how names shape career trajectories beyond the point of hire in naturally unfolding labor market settings. Using unique administrative data with longitudinal information on personal names, we investigate how changing from a foreign-sounding to a name more typical in the native-born majority improves the labor market outcomes of immigrants and their children. Covering the entire population in Norway, these data allow us to calculate names’ ethnic distinctiveness and observe when individuals pursue a name-assimilation strategy. We exploit the timing of name changes in a difference-in-differences event study design following individuals before and after name change, with individuals who changed their names later as the control group. We find that adopting a mainstream name increases non-Western immigrants’ earnings by approximately 30 percent. These gains stem primarily from movement into stable, higher-paying jobs rather than wage growth within firms, indicating that name assimilation reduces barriers to job entry rather than influencing advancement within workplaces. These findings provide rare causal evidence on the economic payoff of symbolic assimilation and show how ethnic signals continue to structure opportunity in contemporary labor markets.",

          "abstract": "A vast literature examines how geopolitical alignments influence militarized conflict, trade, investment, aid, and other outcomes in international relations. Yet considerable ambiguity remains regarding how such alignments are conceptualized and how existing measures correspond to distinct theoretical understandings. This article clarifies the conceptual foundations of geopolitical alignment along two key dimensions. First, some measures capture ideological contestation over the global order, whereas others reflect political agreement or rivalry over specific issues, such as territorial disputes. Second, some conceptualize alignment as \\textit{agreement}, for example similarity in UN voting, while others treat it as a \\textit{relationship}, such as alliances or arms transfers. These distinctions correspond to alternative understandings of alignment that carry important implications for empirical research. For instance, Saudi Arabia appears aligned with China when alignment is defined ideologically, but with the United States when defined by security ties. The article provides guidance on selecting appropriate measures for different conceptualizations and introduces a new indicator based on the ideological profiles of a state’s arms suppliers.",

Drawing on an original survey of 3,015 respondents conducted in June 2024, it examines how political identities are embedded in cultural practices. Using statistical techniques for dimension reduction and clustering, the study identifies two dominant lifestyle formations—Progressives and Conservatives—that mirror Spain’s main ideological cleavage. These groups diverge not only in moral and political orientations, but also in cultural engagement, leisure activities, mobility, and attitudes toward minorities, underscoring the social embeddedness of political conflict. A secondary analysis further disaggregates this divide into four clusters—Progs, Tepids, Moderates, and Disengaged which capture heterogeneity in cultural participation, political alignment, and daily practices. Extending lifestyle polarization research into a multiparty European context, the article contributes to political and cultural sociology by showing that divisions in Spain are increasingly lived through routine behaviors and cultural tastes.",

Through a detailed critique of the EKC and the impacts of capitalist economic\nstructures, this paper highlights the flaws of these models, particularly their failure to account for\nirreversible environmental damage and the insufficient role of policy interventions in mitigating\necological harm. Furthermore, the research explores how international competition and the\ncapitalist drive for profit exacerbate environmental degradation, pushing nations to weaken\nenvironmental regulations in pursuit of economic advantage. The paper advocates for a shift\ntowards sustainable economic models that integrate both economic growth and environmental\nconservation, stressing the need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation.\nThe findings underscore that, while economic and environmental objectives have historically\nbeen seen as mutually exclusive, a balanced approach is not only feasible but essential for\nachieving long-term prosperity and ecological stability",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates the influence of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors on financial development, using Domestic Credit to the Private Sector by Banks (DCB) as the core indicator of credit market development. To effectively market the research within the broader literature on finance and ESG issues, the authors employ an approach combining econometric analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), cluster analysis, and network analysis. By analyzing the impact through the estimation of the model parameters through the impact of instrumental variable estimation on the model parameters (using Two-Stage Least Squares (IV), Random Effects (IV), and First-Differenced (IV) methods), the study confirms that access to clean fuels and natural resource depletion impact the model margins significantly. However, across all the models used in the analysis, the impact of access to clean energy is positive. By analyzing the significance of the issue using the KNN model throughout the research process on the impact of ESG on credit market dynamics across countries, the research demonstrates that the issue is significant.

          "abstract": "How does femonationalism, defined as the selective invocation of gender equality to promote exclusionary anti-immigrant policies, affect citizens? While increasingly common across Western democracies, its impact on citizens’ preferences remains underexplored. This paper provides evidence from a preregistered survey experiment with 3,118 U.S. citizens, showing that femonationalist rhetoric can enhance opposition to pluralist policies in defense of progressive gender achievements. The effect is conditional on citizens’ prior immigration attitudes: anti-immigration individuals liberalize their gender views, while pro-immigration individuals demand stricter integration policies. The findings suggest that citizens are not consistent in their ideological preferences, especially when political elites frame liberal values as conflicting.",

          "abstract": "Urban market modernization projects in African cities are often celebrated for their architectural achievements, yet their actual performance can fall short once confronted with the everyday practices, mobility constraints, and gendered experiences of traders especially women. Drawing on Gender Geography and fieldwork conducted in the modernized C2D markets of Bafoussam and Bertoua in Cameroon, this article shows how spatial design, accessibility gaps, and exclusionary governance reproduce inequalities that undermine development effectiveness.\n\nThe analysis reveals that successful development depends not only on funding or technical expertise, but on integrating gendered lived realities as central pillars of multisectoral projects. Markets function as microcosms of wider urban society, concentrating inequalities, negotiations, and solidarities within their daily rhythms. A gender-geographical lens therefore provides a critical diagnostic tool for rethinking modernization processes in African intermediate cities.",

Sin embargo, la información disponible en estos espacios no proviene siempre de fuentes científicas confiables sino de contenidos moldeados por algoritmos de recomendación que priorizan la popularidad y la viralidad del contenido por encima de su veracidad y sustento científico. Estos sistemas automatizados seleccionan y jerarquizan las publicaciones según los intereses propios del usuario, generando las conocidas “cámaras de eco” donde se refuerzan ideas afines y se excluyen perspectivas diferentes, generando una percepción errónea de consenso, así como dificultad para aceptar la evidencia. Mediante una revisión exhaustiva de la literatura, se encontró que en las principales redes sociales del mundo (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok) los algoritmos de las redes sociales son responsables directos de la creación y mantenimiento de cámaras de eco que facilitan la propagación de desinformación nutricional. Este ensayo tiene como objetivo estudiar los mecanismos mediadores de estas conductas para proponer estrategias eficaces capaces de mitigar los efectos negativos en la nutrición que las redes sociales están generando en sus usuarios, los cuales finalmente impactan en la salud pública",

Se plantea que, aunque estas plataformas se originaron como espacios de comunicación e interacción, han evolucionado hasta convertirse en escenarios donde se construyen y exhiben estilos de vida idealizados asociados con la salud, la felicidad y el éxito personal. A través de la revisión de estudios recientes y del análisis crítico del discurso mediático, se argumenta que el bienestar promovido en redes sociales es una representación superficial e inalcanzable que prioriza la apariencia sobre la experiencia genuina. Este ideal digital genera efectos negativos en la salud mental y emocional de los usuarios, al incentivar la comparación constante, la búsqueda de validación externa y la creación de un “yo ideal” desvinculado de la autenticidad. Asimismo, se evidencian consecuencias específicas como la insatisfacción corporal, los trastornos alimentarios y el deterioro de la autoestima, especialmente en las mujeres jóvenes. En conclusión, el ensayo propone que la verdadera cultura del bienestar debería orientarse hacia la aceptación personal, la vulnerabilidad y la autenticidad, más allá de los filtros y las métricas de aprobación social.",

          "abstract": "This paper focuses on the design and development of a decision support system (DSS) for the\ngovernance of intralogistics processes and, in particular, devoted to optimize capacity management\nand the workload of activities characterizing freight entry. This research activity was carried out as\npart of the Logistics Research and Development 4.0 Project launched by La Logistica Srl, a new\nplayer in the distribution of hydro-thermo sanitary products, with the support of the Puglia Region.\nThe purpose of this study is to provide managers with a range of customized process information to\nimprove workforce efficiency and management in receiving, controlling, and storing goods entering\nthe newly established logistics hub. Other researchers’ work had shortcomings, as did the lack of this\nstudy’s practical approach. This study aims to overcome these constraints. To do so, the study\nintroduces the Content Load Parameter (CLP) index. This index integrates three variables relevant to\ndefining the workload, such as quantity, size and weights of the goods to be handled, using a single\nstandard value. This makes it easier for managers to estimate the required capacity all along the work\ncycle. As part of the system development, a module analyzes and simulates operational scenarios.\nSimulation facilitates the management of analysis capacity by allowing alternatives to be compared\nand evaluated to bridge the gap between demand and availability of production capacity in various\nsituations. Scenario simulation, combined with tools for concise and effective visualization of results,\ntherefore allows organizations to identify critical capacity points and take preventative measures to\nmanage overhead and minimize consequences. In summary, this study demonstrates how integrating\nthe Content Load Parameter index into a decision support system can significantly contribute to\nmaking intralogistics process management more effective. By addressing quantifiable workload\nparameters and facilitating scenario-based operational analysis, the proposed system provides\nmanagers with useful information for capacity optimization. These advances not only overcome the\nlimitations of previous research but also help develop resilient and efficient logistics operations, thus\nstrengthening the critical role of empirically informed decision-making in contemporary logistics\ngovernance.",

Findings from this literature review informed the construction of the DD-AI. Subsequently, a theo-retical model comprising eight hypotheses was established to assess AI-related digital divides. The instrument's development followed an established scale development process, including a comprehensive pre-test involving the think-aloud method with three students and a survey of n=106 students.

We propose a new probabilistic approach for identifying fertility transition stalls based on the results of the 2024 revision of World Population Prospects (United Nations, 2024a) and apply it to all countries for periods when total fertility is above 2.1 live births per woman. Our method is not restricted to inter-survey intervals; it uses all available data from all available data sources, incorporates biases and measurement errors, and provides probabilistic estimates of fertility stalls. We compared our findings for sub-Saharan Africa to those in the literature and found that the probability of many previously identified stalls is quite low based on the data available. We also identify several stalls (or reversals) in fertility decline across all regions since 1950 and discuss potential reasons for these changes in fertility trends.",

          "authors": "Matthias Hümmer",
          "abstract": "This conceptual paper develops an integrated framework for understanding how multi-dimensional project complexity management capabilities mediate competitive dynamics in Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) industries. Drawing on systematized narrative review of literature from 2020 to 2025, combined with foundational complexity theory, two complementary models are constructed: an ascending pathway depicting how emerging contractors systematically build technical, organizational, and environmental capabilities to achieve global EPC leadership; and a descending pathway characterizing how established leaders experience capability erosion when organizational and environmental complexity management capabilities deteriorate faster than technical knowledge persists.\nThe core theoretical contribution demonstrates that sustainable EPC competitive advantage increasingly derives from the ability to simultaneously manage high technical, organizational, and environmental complexity, rather than technical knowledge alone. This insight is operationalized through a Technical-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) complexity framework, mapping how capability phases correspond to distinct complexity profiles and identifying critical junctures where strategic intervention can alter trajectory.\nThe framework is applied diagnostically to the German Large Industrial Plant Manufacturing Industry (GLIPMI), identifying distinct subsectors in different phases of capability erosion and specifying sector-specific vulnerabilities and intervention points. Eight testable propositions are formulated connecting complexity management capabilities to competitive outcomes.\nThe paper provides both theoretical grounding for capability-based competition in EPC markets and practical implications for firms, industry associations, and policymakers. However, it needs to be acknowledged that this framework represents theory-building rather than empirical validation; the propositions require future primary research to test causal mechanisms and boundary conditions. The analysis suggests that complexity management capability is necessary for sustained EPC leadership but may not be sufficient when confronted with asymmetric subsidization, pricing pressures, or structural financing disadvantages.",

          "abstract": "With the rise of social media as a central arena for identity construction and social interaction, employers increasingly use social media information to evaluate candidates’ job fit. While such digital recruitment practices promise efficiency and precision, they also conceal underlying social risks such as the erosion of trust and the rise of surveillance capitalism. This raises an urgent question of how to balance individual rights, organizational efficiency, risk management, and fairness within the digital labor market. Yet existing studies have largely approached this issue from legal or managerial perspectives, without systematically examining the underlying logic of surveillance capitalism and its impact on social trust from a sociological standpoint. Drawing on an integrated analysis of existing theories and cross-national literature, this paper investigates the practice of social media screening from the perspectives of candidates, employers, and society. Building on this analysis, the paper delineates the ethical and regulatory boundaries of social media screening and identifies policy pathways toward a more inclusive and equitable digital labor market.",

          "abstract": "Background\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common and linked to relationship difficulties. It may affect the likelihood and timing of parenthood, yet its implications for fertility remain unclear.\nMethods\nUsing Finnish population registers, we followed 759,430 individuals born in 1982–1993 to examine how ADHD is associated with the likelihood and timing of a first birth among young adults. ADHD diagnoses were identified from healthcare and prescription records. Discrete-time event-history models were estimated separately for women and men. Interaction analyses assessed whether a partner’s ADHD modified associations.\nResults\nIn age- and cohort-adjusted models, ADHD was linked to lower odds of a first birth (men OR 0.92; women OR 0.90), but after adjusting for partnerships the association was reversed (men OR 1.07; women OR 1.09). At ages 18–23, ADHD was associated with a higher likelihood of having a first birth, whereas an opposite association was observed at ages at 24–30 and 31–38. Thus, ADHD was related to a higher likelihood of first birth at young ages and lower likelihood at older ages. Both partners having ADHD does not seem to intensify the association.\nConclusions\nADHD is associated with earlier entry into parenthood but a lower risk of first birth at later ages. The results highlight the importance of accounting for partnerships: before this adjustment, ADHD was negatively related to the likelihood of becoming a parent, whereas after adjusting for partnerships the association reversed. This underscores partnership formation as a key pathway and suggests that supporting stable unions may help mitigate ADHD-related disparities in first births.\nKeywords: first birth, child, family formation, ADHD, partnerships",

Yet, many universities continue to focus remediation narrowly on disability services pages, leaving their broader digital presence inaccessible to students, faculty, and the public. This paper presents a teaching strategy that leverages the Accessible Name and Description Inspector (ANDI), a free audit tool developed by the U.S. Social Security Administration, as both an instructional and governance\nmechanism. By training IT staff and content authors to use ANDI, institutions can identify recurring accessibility barriers, connect them to WCAG 2.1 AA and Title II obligations, and establish governance routines that foster sustainable compliance. The method is illustrated through a multi-institution audit of higher education websites, including a case study showing how false positives can serve as teaching moments. This contribution is explicitly positioned as a teaching note, offering a practical and scalable model for embedding accessibility education into institutional governance\nand compliance.",

          "abstract": "Digitalisierung und Corona-Pandemie haben Auswirkungen auf die Hochschulbildung, die gleichermaßen mit Chancen wie mit Herausforderungen einhergehen und diese offenlegen. – Eine Entwicklung, die längst nicht abgeschlossen ist und im bildungswissenschaftlichen Diskurs über digitale Bildung auch mit Blick auf die universitäre Fernlehre zu Recht Beachtung erfährt.\nDie Fernlehre als technologiegestütztes Lernumfeld, dem eine räumliche Trennung der Akteur*innen inhärent ist, bietet dank der damit verbundenen Flexibilität und Individualität des Lernens besonders einer nicht-klassischen an Hochschulbildung interessierten Klientel die Möglichkeit, heterogene Lebenslagen zu verbinden. Hier zeigt sich nicht nur die Wichtigkeit der Betrachtung digitaler Bildung aus Sicht der Lernenden, sondern auch, dass die Fernlehre eine zentrale Forderung an die Hochschule adressiert: sich zu einer offenen Institution zu entwickeln, die selbstgesteuerte Bildungsprozesse ermöglicht und die Teilhabe an Bildung fördert. Gleichzeitig kommt in der Fernlehre der Unterstützung der Lernenden eine große Bedeutung zu, insbesondere, wenn die Lehre auf schriftlicher Kommunikation basiert. Der Diskurs über die Betreuungsbedürfnisse beim Lernen im Fernstudium sowie über eine entsprechend bedürfnisorientierte Gestaltung der Betreuung stellt sich jedoch als randständig geführt dar. Daher bildet die Sicht der Lernenden auf diese Bedürfnisse die Leitperspektive der vorliegenden Arbeit. Verschränkt wird diese Sicht mit der Einschätzung der Betreuenden hinsichtlich der Möglichkeiten, die artikulierten Bedürfnisse in der Praxis zu berücksichtigen.\nUntersucht werden diese Perspektiven mittels einer empirischen Studie in Form eines Mixed-Methods-Designs, welches sowohl auf qualitative als auch auf quantitative Erhebungs- und Auswertungsmethoden zurückgreift und mit der integrierenden Darstellung aller Erhebungsergebnisse eine umfassende und mehrperspektivische Explikation des Gegenstandsbereiches erlaubt. Im Ergebnis kann dabei besonders die Bedeutung einer individuellen und flexiblen Betreuung Studierender herausgestellt werden, die individuelle Anforderungen, Lernstile und Ressourcen einbezieht und fachlich fundiertes Feedback beinhaltet. Diesbezüglich besteht Konsens zwischen Lernenden und Lehrenden. Angesichts der real existierenden Ressourcen zeigt sich seitens der Lehrenden jedoch ein Spannungsfeld zwischen Wollen und Können.\nInsgesamt leistet die Arbeit einen Beitrag zur Weiterentwicklung der Fernlehre hinsichtlich der adäquaten Erfassung der Bedürfnisse Studierender und der Professionalisierung der Betreuenden unter Berücksichtigung dieser Bedürfnisse. Sie trägt damit zur besseren Passung zwischen digitalen Bildungsangeboten und deren Zielgruppe bei. Eine offene Frage ist, wie sich mit Blick auf steigende Studierendenzahlen eine Skalierbarkeit der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse herstellen lässt.",

Using a difference-in-differences design exploiting eligibility rules, we find null effects on support for incumbents. To explain, we develop a framework of experience-based accountability, arguing that the electoral effect of adaptation is path-dependent: prior crisis experience sets the standard for what voters perceive as a sufficient policy. Consistent with this, we find modest electoral rewards where prior insurance disruption was limited, but none where it was chronic. Survey evidence indicates that, prior to the policy, residents of high-disruption areas already held more negative and crystallized views of the governor. We offer a framework for the politics of adaptation, showing that credit depends on perceived sufficiency: a standard set not only by the policy, but also by voters’ prior experience with the crisis.",

          "abstract": "This study estimates the near-term risk of renewed Israel–Iran escalation using a modular, multi-model framework that converts expert judgments and open-source indicators into probabilistic scenarios over a 90-day horizon. We elicit LOW–CENTRAL–HIGH priors from domain experts across 18 indicators spanning air/missile, land, maritime, cyber, diplomacy, information, and proxy alignment (including Israeli standoff and air-strike activity), then fuse evidence via Bayesian updating and infer a weekly escalation state on a seven-rung ladder with a light stocks/flows scaffold for magazines, interceptor use, and repair/re-supply constraints. We triangulate forecasts across three complementary stacks (Bayesian state-space, statistical ensemble, and game-theoretic signalling). At the analysis cut-off (2025-10-22, UK), All three models agree that S1 (Managed Conflict) is modal, S2 (Northern War with Maritime Squeeze) is the principal alternative, and S3–S4 remain lower-probability tails. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the S1&lt;-&gt;S2 margin is most responsive to air/missile defence saturation and combined launch/strike pressure together with maritime war-risk stress, with mediation activity providing the strongest stabilising counterweight. We also formalise tail-risk triggers for potential state fracture and specify how crossing them would reweight S4. The result is a transparent, updateable, and non-partisan forecast designed for decision support: it communicates where risk mass sits, what could move it, and which levers plausibly bend trajectories while avoiding operationally sensitive detail.",

          "abstract": "Objectives: To develop, calibrate, and evaluate a machine learning (ML) classifier designed to reduce citation screening workload for COVID-19 research.\nMethods: Citations from the WHO COVID-19 Research Database were used to train a logistic regression classifier, which was then calibrated using another independent dataset. A lower threshold was set, below which, records could be excluded from manual screening, and an upper threshold, above which, records could be automatically included into the database. The classifier was then validated on eight COVID-19 reviews to assess workload reduction and recall.\nFindings: The WHO-Cochrane-EPPI classifier was calibrated for 99% recall, with an upper threshold of 70% and a lower threshold of 39%. During validation, it achieved 98.6% recall across eight reviews. A smaller set of three reviews estimated a 12.5% workload reduction, with 1,390 of 11,153 records below the lower threshold. For database use, workload reduction was estimated at 80%, with 8,955 out of 11,153 records being automatically screened.\nConclusion: The WHO-Cochrane-UCL classifier significantly reduces manual screening workload with minimal risk of missing studies. It serves as a model for integrating machine learning into curated resources like the WHO COVID-19 Research Database, improving sustainability by reducing manual screening efforts. The classifier can also be adapted for systematic reviews on COVID-19 and other topics.",

Such approaches, however, are unlikely to offer actionable guidance to those developers (and their institutions) who are looking for strategies to minimise potential bias. This paper presents findings from a systematic literature review exploring existing work on how AI developers can mitigate bias in the field of engineering biology. A systematic search was conducted on the Scopus and Web of Science databases for relevant articles published between 2015 and 2024. The findings from 51 reviewed articles showed that recommendations for bias mitigation within healthcare tended to be grouped around seven key themes, namely diversity in teams, training and education, awareness and responsibility, diversity of data, collaboration with end users and beneficiaries, monitoring and evaluation, and transparency. While these recommendations provide useful suggestions for reducing bias, they generally fail to provide actionable guidance or empirical evidence about how these strategies can be operationalised in a real-world setting. More research is needed to test the effectiveness and practicality of these recommendations across different scientific and clinical contexts as well as among different types of development teams.",

          "abstract": "This paper investigates whether concentrated liquidity in decentralized exchanges protects liquidity providers (LPs) against toxic swaps, relative to traditional AMM liquidity provision mechanisms. To address this question, we develop a model of LP competition and uncover a fundamental toxicity-competitiveness trade-off: toxic swaps yield payoffs independent of other LPs’ strategies, whereas non-toxic swaps generate payoffs that depend on strategic competition among LPs. We demonstrate that concentrated liquidity increasingly outperforms traditional mechanisms as swap toxicity rises, while at low toxicity levels, competitive pressure can instead worsen LP payoffs. Comparative statics further show that equilibrium liquidity provision rises with toxicity, volatility, and LP competition but falls with fees. Together, these patterns suggest how LPs should optimally adjust their strategies to market conditions.",

          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

This qualitative study explored the factors contributing to teacher attrition and identified strategies to improve retention. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with 28 teachers across 16 U.S. states who had either left the profession or were actively considering departure. Thematic analysis revealed four primary drivers of attrition: unsustainable workloads, inadequate administrative support, particularly regarding student behavior, insufficient compensation, and diminished professional autonomy. Participants also reported experiences of moral conflict and burnout, shaped by systemic challenges and shifting expectations following the COVID-19 pandemic. While some teachers indicated they would not return under any circumstances, others identified potential interventions, including increased pay, stronger leadership support, and reduced non-instructional responsibilities. These findings suggest that teacher attrition stems from multiple factors, highlighting the need for systemic reforms to support teacher well-being and retention.",

Using a difference-in-differences design exploiting eligibility rules, we find null effects on support for incumbents. To explain, we develop a framework of experience-based accountability, arguing that the electoral effect of adaptation is path-dependent: prior crisis experience sets the standard for what voters perceive as a sufficient policy. Consistent with this, we find modest electoral rewards where prior insurance disruption was limited, but none where it was chronic. Survey evidence indicates that, prior to the policy, residents of high-disruption areas already held more negative and crystallized views of the governor. We offer a framework for the politics of adaptation, showing that credit depends on perceived sufficiency: a standard set not only by the policy, but also by voters’ prior experience with the crisis.",

We categorize publishers according to their institutional and organizational characteristics and assess their coverage in WoS, Scopus, and OpenAlex. Our findings show that educational institutions are the dominant publishers in most countries, accounting for over 75% of journals in Colombia and Brazil and over 50% in Mexico, Argentina, and Poland. Finland is an exception, where scientific and professional associations lead (62.0%). Commercial publishers play a minor role, with their highest shares in Turkey (12.1%) and Poland (8.2%). Regarding database coverage, OpenAlex indexes over 50% of journals in most of the covered countries, while WoS and Scopus index only a small fraction.

          "abstract": "Southern Central America played a key role in the continent-wide transition to the Neolithic and the transmission of its culture between South and Mesoamerica. Nevertheless, there has been a notable decline in linking processes within this region to contemporary developments in the rest of the continent. Here, there are early indicators of the Neolithic, besides evidence of the movement of cultigens and likely information about pottery manufacturing towards the other continent. Using a co-adaptive framework, I examine the social and ecological changes during the Archaic and Early Formative American Neotropics and adjacent regions, highlighting surprising networks that moved plants, goods and cultural systems during these periods. I focus mainly on the behaviors that link humans with their natural environments, beyond mere social changes occurring at the level of the producer. Finally, I present a Bayesian analysis of 161 radiocarbon dates from 39 sites in Costa Rica and Panama from the Late Archaic through the Middle Formative. These methods can identify anomalous dates and generate probability distributions regarding chronological questions about eight different material culture complexes: In Tilaran-Arenal, Fortuna* and Tronadora; in the Costa Rican Atlantic Watershed, La Montaña, in Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete* and Black Creek; and in Gran Coclé, the Preceramic B tradition and Monagrillo (archaic assemblages denoted with an asterisk*). I argue that there exists evidence for the early presence of ceramic from 4840-4144 BC cal, representing a correction to the established chronology of 1000-3000 years. Early ceramic complexes commonly interpreted as Formative coexisted with Archaic-period assemblages for hundreds, if not thousands of years before the abandonment of archaic-style complexes. Therefore, the presence of ceramics is not a sufficient marker of social processes commonly associated with the Formative. Resumen: El Sur de Centroamérica jugó un papel crucial en la transición al Neolítico y en la transmisión de la cultura neolítica entre Sudamérica y Mesoamérica. A pesar de ello, se ha disminuido la relación de procesos en esta región con el resto del continente. Aquí se encuentran tempranos indicadores del Neolítico, evidencia del tránsito de cultígenos y probable información sobre alfarería hacia el otro continente. Examinando los procesos sociales y ecológicos durante el Arcaico y Formativo temprano en el Neotrópico Americano y regiones aledañas desde una perspectiva co-adaptiva, destaco la sorprendente movilidad de plantas, bienes y sistemas culturales durante estos periodos. Me enfoco en los comportamientos que vinculan a los humanos con sus ambientes, más allá de los procesos sociales a nivel productivo. Un análisis Bayesiano de 161 determinaciones radiométricas de 39 sitios en Costa Rica y Panamá, desde el Arcaico tardío hasta el Formativo medio, permite identificar las determinaciones aberrantes y generar distribuciones de probabilidad sobre cuestiones cronológicas para ocho diferentes complejos: en Tilarán-Arenal, Fortuna* y Tronadora; en el Vertiente Atlántico Costarricense, La Montaña; en el Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete*, y Black Creek; y en el Gran Coclé, Preceramic B* y Monagrillo (complejos arcaicos marcados con asterisco*). Argumento que existe evidencia de la presencia temprana de alfarería desde 4840 - 4144 a.C. cal, representando una corrección en la cronología establecida de 1000-3000 años. Los complejos cerámicos frecuentemente interpretados como Formativos coexistieron con los complejos Arcaicos durante cientos, sino miles, de años antes del abandono de complejos asociados con la caza-recolección. Así, la presencia plena de alfarería no puede considerarse como un marcador de los procesos sociales asociados con el periodo Formativo.",

Nine policy instruments stood out for their high perceived potential, feasibility, and independence from economic growth: phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, greening credit regulations, North-South technology transfer, carbon consumption taxes, long-term warranties, repair infrastructure, cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, ecological education, and environmental justice-focused education. Perceptions of higher policy potential were closely associated with greater perceived feasibility and a degrowth orientation in respondents’ own work.

Drawing on frameworks from other emerging literacies, we conceptualize demographic literacy as a multidimensional competence grounded in both demographic knowledge and its practical application.\nEmpirically, we focus on demographic literacy about ageing, operationalized through the knowledge of two key demographic processes that characterize post-transitional societies: the increase in the older population and the decline in younger cohorts. Using a nationally representative survey of 1,575 adults (Ipsos–Osservatorio Senior, 2023) living in Italy - one of the world’s most aged societies - and adopting a Machine Learning (ML) approach, we examine the socio-demographic patterns of demographic knowledge about ageing. Results reveal that nearly one-third of respondents lack basic knowledge of population ageing, with marked educational and economic gradients: low education and low income significantly reduce the probability of correct understanding and reinforce each other in predicting demographic illiteracy. The pronounced social gradient in demographic knowledge limits the capacity of some groups to apply it, reducing their potential to convert knowledge into agency. These findings call for policies that promote demographic literacy as a lever for inclusion, empowering citizens to better understand and respond to population change.",

A\nfrequent output of an ABM model is a grid with points of one or more classes that\nrepresent the agents’ configuration over time. A canonical example is the Schelling\nsegregation model, where agents of two types follow a simple relocation rule based\non their tolerance to the proportion of different agents in a given location, resulting in\na segregated configuration that is visually revealing but not quantitative. In this work,\nwe propose assigning a quantitative measure of entropy, based on the spatial configuration\nof the steady state of the Schelling model, to a range of population values in\nthe model using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) techniques.

          "abstract": "Weather forecasts provide substantial economic value for society, but differences in forecast accuracy across regions can potentially exacerbate existing---and create new---economic inequalities. These differences are particularly important given the role of weather forecasts in helping prevent damage from future climate change. In this paper, we provide a global analysis of the accuracy of numerical weather predictions of temperature and relate our findings to existing economic inequalities. We report two stylized facts: First, temperature forecasts are much more accurate in high-income countries compared to low-income countries. A seven-day-ahead forecast in a high-income country is, on average, more accurate than a one-day-ahead forecast in a low-income country. Second, while forecast accuracy has improved steadily since 1985, a persistent gap remains between high and low-income countries. These disparities result from both differences in the inherent scientific challenge of weather predictability across regions and from unequal weather observing infrastructure. Poorer countries have fewer land-based weather stations and radiosondes as well as lower reporting rates from existing infrastructure. Low-income countries also appear to have lower institutional capacity to issue official, local weather forecasts. Remedying the differences in monitoring infrastructure could help reduce the gap in forecast accuracy between rich and poor countries.",

Four key areas of contention are identified: the definition and conceptualization of obesity; the methods used to measure it; the approaches deemed most effective for treatment; and the question of responsibility. These debates reflect fundamentally divergent perspectives that cannot be fully reconciled— and arguably should not be. Each viewpoint contributes valuable insights into how obesity is understood and addressed in contemporary society. By examining these controversies, the article reveals the complexity and discomfort that often accompany public and professional discourse on obesity.",

          "authors": "Emily H Emmott; Benjamin Theobald; Mark Dyble",
          "abstract": "Adolescence is widely recognised as a key life stage, yet its meaning and experience remain under-explored due to the complex interplay between biological and social transformations. While researchers across fields such as psychology and public health increasingly frame adolescence as a “critical period,” anthropology offers distinctive insights that challenge simplistic and reductionist accounts. This special issue introduces the Anthropology of Adolescence, situating the discipline as an important contributor to the emerging interdisciplinary interest in adolescence. Drawing on a century of anthropological engagement, we emphasise adolescence not simply as a passage between childhood and adulthood, but as a dynamic biocultural stage through which broader social, political, and ecological processes can be understood. The contributions presented here span different forms of anthropology, employing varied methods from structured interviews and focus groups to multimodal ethnographic research. Together, they demonstrate the breadth of anthropological research, foregrounding themes such as spatiality, intersectionality, and socialisation. In doing so, this issue illustrates why anthropology and adolescence go together, and how the discipline can enrich wider debates on this vital life stage.",

          "authors": "Francesco Rampazzo; Jakub Bijak; Agnese Vitali; Ingmar Weber; Emilio Zagheni",
          "abstract": "Accurate and timely estimates of migrant population stocks, disaggregated by age and sex, are critical for population projections and for understanding migration dynamics. This study proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model that extends previous work by incorporating age and sex disaggregation, using data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and digital traces from the Facebook Advertising Platform. A Bayesian multinomial–Dirichlet–Dirichlet model harmonizes age and sex profiles from the two sources, leveraging the Rogers–Castro framework to characterize migration age schedules and utilizing the conjugate nature of Dirichlet priors to ensure computational efficiency. We illustrate the framework using data on migrant populations in the United Kingdom for 2018 and 2019, based on the two sources: the Labour Force Survey and Facebook. The analysis identifies three distinct migrant groups with differing age and sex profiles: younger Western and Southern European migrants, slightly older Central and Eastern Europeans, and a predominantly older Irish migrant population. Facebook data enhances the coverage of younger migrants, who are often underrepresented in traditional surveys, while the LFS provides broader demographic context and helps benchmark the estimates to standard population definitions. The findings highlight the utility of integrating traditional and digital data sources to address gaps in migration statistics. This framework enables more accurate disaggregation of migrant population stock data and offers a scalable, computationally efficient methodology for improving migration estimates, particularly in contexts lacking ground-truth data. The approach also yields insights into migration patterns and demographic structures, with potential applications in policy planning and demographic research.",

          "authors": "Jihun Yeo",
          "abstract": "This study aims to trace the cause of an emerging welfare cleavage under circumstances where discourses on economic growth have been dominant in Korean politics. On the basis of the theories of interaction between changing social structure and social-norm dynamics, this paper explores the causes of an emerging welfare cleavage in the case of South Korea during the late 2000s. To analyze the change of economic structure and public awareness regarding public welfare, I used the data of macro-economic indicators and public opinion polls and utilized press releases to analyze discourses of political actors.\nThe linked-policies effects of an immature “developmental welfare regime” and neo-liberal economic policies caused social polarization and expansion of the poverty stratum in the course of a slowdown in economic growth in the 1990s and foreign exchange crisis in 1998. The existing norm (i.e., economic growth could solve problems concerning people's livelihood) that had been maintained in the era of rapid economic growth was weakened. A conflict between an education superintendent and the Gyeonggi-do Provincial Council triggered a debate on free meals and welfare in 2009. Civil society groups were organized on a national scale, and they started a discourse struggle to replace individual interests with public interests and to obtain social legitimacy. Political parties gradually accepted the welfare issue as the primary electoral pledge for their political interests after public preference regarding growth and distribution changed when confronted with political crises.\nThis study draws an implication that general factors affecting Western welfare states (e.g., power alliance and democratic institutions) influence East Asian welfare states by analyzing the case of South Korean welfare politics. It means that studies of East Asian welfare states can use explanatory building blocks partly from existing welfare theories rather than stressing the exceptionalism of East Asian welfare states. However, owing to the different economic and political structures of East Asian states from those of Western countries during the formative stage of welfare states, studies of East Asian welfare states need to consider path dependency in the historical context of East Asian political economy.",

          "authors": "Gyanendra Kumar",
          "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of internet technologies has substantially transformed sexual socialization among Indian youth, with digital platforms providing unprecedented access to pornography. This study investigates patterns of pornography consumption, perceptions toward it, the influence on sexual and gender identity, and associated psychosocial impacts among 100 youth respondents, primarily college students aged 18 to 30, across diverse backgrounds.\n\nFindings reveal that 13% of participants use pornography daily, demonstrating significant frequent engagement, while a majority also access it with varying less frequent patterns. Early exposure during adolescence is common, with 59% reporting first exposure before age 18. Smartphones (75%) and websites (74%) dominate access. Youth demonstrate divided moral perspectives, with 31% viewing pornography as morally wrong and an equal proportion (31%) considering it normal or acceptable. Guilt or anxiety is prevalent, reported by 65%. Approximately 29% report negative effects on self-esteem, body image, and sexual confidence, with 30% indicating functional impairments in education, work, or time management. The effects of pornography on sexual identity differ; 60–70% indicate no alteration in gender or identity confidence, while 20–28% report an expanded understanding or exploration, and some express confusion or diminished confidence. Gender differences emerge clearly: males tend to consume pornography more frequently and predominantly prefer heterosexual content, while females and non-binary youth display more diverse consumption patterns and greater variability in content preferences.\n\nThe study highlights a critical moral-behavior disconnect and points out that it requires comprehensive sex education, destigmatization, and mental health support tailored to digital sexualities. These insights contribute to the sociological discourse on youth and sexuality in India, offering empirical evidence to inform policy, educational practice, and future research directions.",

          "abstract": "In this research, we present the Indigenous Circular Economy (IndCE); not as a novel framework, but as an enduring system of stewardship, resilience, and relationality practiced by Indigenous communities for generations. As Indigenous (Yurok/Hoopa) and non-Indigenous co-authors, we draw on historical analysis, forest science, Yurok oral tradition, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to demonstrate how IndCE repairs the ecological and cultural harm of capitalist economies by weaving together forest health with human health. Through a case study of the Yurok Tribe in Northern California, we highlight how IndCE is not just a cultural or local economic alternative. It is a paradigm shift away from economic perspectives that ignore culture, history, land, and non-human &amp; human relationships. The Yurok stewardship practices that support its IndCE (e.g. Good Fire) provide a slew of benefits: wildfire risk mitigation, ecosystem restoration, economic revitalization, and cultural resilience. The Yurok case reveals the urgency of legitimizing and resourcing Indigenous-led ecological governance. We identify persistent policy and funding barriers that undermine this work and offer concrete paths forward to support it. This paper contributes to broader debates on sustainable economics, Indigenous rights, and community-led conservation. It also raises critical questions for non-Indigenous communities about how some state systems may sometimes obstruct, rather than support, regenerative land stewardship, cultural continuity, and ecological care. The Yurok model shows that another type of economy is not only possible; it already exists.",

This article challenges that assumption by tracing the long and\nparadoxical history of rights as epistemic technologies that both consolidate and contest power.\nRights emerged alongside enclosure and colonization, long defining who counts as a legal\nsubject. At the same time, they have been strategically reclaimed by the subjugated and\nmarginalized in moments of rupture as instruments of survival and material advancement.\nBeginning with divergent case studies from Ecuador, the United States, and Aotearoa New\nZealand, this paper places these RoN efforts in dialogue with critical histories and contemporary\ndebates around rights. Rather than asking whether nature can hold rights, it interrogates whether\nrights themselves can reasonably engender liberatory multi-species politics without reinscribing\nthe very legal orders they aim to transcend.",

          "abstract": "Social media platforms play an increasingly important role in political campaigning, enabling parties to bypass traditional media and mobilize support directly. While prior research highlights the online prominence of far-right and radical populist actors, most studies are limited to single platforms or national contexts. This study presents the first cross- platform and cross-national analysis of digital campaign communication by 401 parties across all 27 EU member states during the 2024 Euro- pean Parliament election. Using data from Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, and YouTube, we examine party activity and audience engage- ment. By linking digital trace data with expert surveys, we test whether populist radical right parties disproportionately succeed in raising engage- ment online. Our findings confirm strong platform-specific advantages of radical populist parties, particularly on TikTok, YouTube and Facebook. We also observe high engagement for far-left populist parties with similar emotional and anti-elitist communication strategies. The more Eurosceptic positions a party holds, or the more frequently experts describe them to use emotional appeals or anti-elitist communication, the more audience engagement they received across several platforms. Overall the findings emphasize a disproportionate online support for radical populist parties across the European Union.",

          "abstract": "Despite growing representation in medicine, women physicians continue to face persistent inequities in pay, leadership, and recognition. To gain a deeper understanding of their lived experiences, we conducted interviews and surveys with 22 women physicians from across the United States and Canada. We analyzed 309 narrative excerpts using a mixed-methods thematic analysis. Seven key themes emerged: early influences and role models, family and life-course pressures, gendered dynamics in daily practice, structural inequities, wellness and burnout, leadership and mentorship, and visions for the future of medicine. Participants described how career demands often conflicted with family responsibilities, how bias and misidentification shaped legitimacy, and how systemic burdens intensified burnout. Yet they also emphasized the strength of resilience, mentorship, and optimism regarding technology, as well as collective advocacy. These narratives suggest that achieving gender equity in medicine is essential not only to ensure justice among clinicians but also to sustain compassionate, high-quality patient care.",

          "abstract": "This study introduces and operationalizes the novel concept of demographic literacy, defined as the ability to access, understand, and critically interpret demographic information and to use it for informed life-course decisions. Drawing on frameworks from other emerging literacies, we conceptualize demographic literacy as a multidimensional competence grounded in both demographic knowledge and its practical application.\nEmpirically, we focus on demographic literacy about ageing, operationalized through the knowledge of two key demographic processes that characterize post-transitional societies: the increase in the older population and the decline in younger cohorts. Using a nationally representative survey of 1,575 adults (Ipsos–Osservatorio Senior, 2023) living in Italy - one of the world’s most aged societies - and adopting a Machine Learning (ML) approach, we examine the socio-demographic patterns of demographic knowledge about ageing. Results reveal that nearly one-third of respondents lack basic knowledge of population ageing, with marked educational and economic gradients: low education and low income significantly reduce the probability of correct understanding and reinforce each other in predicting demographic illiteracy. The pronounced social gradient in demographic knowledge limits the capacity of some groups to apply it, reducing their potential to convert knowledge into agency. These findings call for policies that promote demographic literacy as a lever for inclusion, empowering citizens to better understand and respond to population change.",

The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents new prospects for improving teaching and learning in this field.

Secondly, AI tools, including general large language models like ChatGPT and specialized tools for historical education, were commonly employed. And their functions in teaching cover a wide range, from knowledge imparting and understanding to exploration, feedback, and assessment, permeating the entire process of classroom learning. Thirdly, the research finds that the application of AI enhances students’ cognitive, emotional, and behavioral abilities. However, it also faces significant challenges such as technical thresholds and insufficient reliability of generated content. This review reveals the potential and limitations of AI application in historical education. Future research can optimize research methods, enhance the evaluation of AI-generated content, and emphasize AI’s role in supporting teachers’ instructional design and professional development.",

          "abstract": "This study investigates gender differences in online toxicity towards a sample of candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.\nWhile a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.\nThese results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",

Although regression approaches frame these as mutually exclusive, the underlying theoretical expectations concern differences at the extremes of the genetic distribution, as measured by a polygenic index (PGI). Here compensation and reinforcing dynamics are mapped to socioeconomic (SES) differences in the rate of overachievers (low-PGI individuals who attain a degree) and underachievers (high-PGI individuals who do not). Using three representative datasets from the US and UK, the findings show that compensatory and reinforcing dynamics can operate simultaneously: high-SES students are more likely to overachieve despite a low PGI - suggesting compensation - and less likely to underachieve - supporting Scarr-Rowe hypothesis. This framework challenges the presumed trade-off between equity and efficiency, and, in reconciling longstanding hypotheses on GxE interactions, possibly explains inconsistent findings from the literature.",

Prior decomposition studies have focused on employment duration or cross-sectional indicators, neglecting the timing, sequencing, and complexity of both work and family life courses, and assumed common support across gender. Using German Socio-Economic Panel data, we study West Germans aged 50–59 with an innovative two-step approach addressing these shortcomings. First, life-course feature selection identifies key wealth predictors, such as education and unemployment experiences, but also family life-course characteristics and homemaking. Second, we apply the Ñopo decomposition to quantify their contribution to the gender wealth gap. Results show that family-related factors, including homemaking, and the sequencing and timing of life-course transitions decisively shape women’s lower wealth. Gender-exclusive experiences, for which there is no counterfactual, account for much of the gap, underscoring how entrenched life-course inequalities translate into lasting economic disadvantage for women.",

          "abstract": "Political polarization in America has intensified beyond mere disagreement to what scholars characterize as sectarianism – a condition where partisan identity fundamentally shapes moral judgments. A key marker of sectarianism is asymmetric moral standards for violence, where aggression against political opponents is considered more justified than identical violence targeting one's own group. Using a survey experiment featuring a realistic political rally scenario, we find compelling evidence in support of such sectarianism: partisan bias in the US extends to evaluations of political violence. By manipulating the partisan affiliations of perpetrators and targets, as well as provocation severity, we find that both Democrats and Republicans exhibit substantial and symmetrical partisan bias. This double standard is particularly pronounced among strong partisans, who are nearly three times more likely to justify violence against the opposition than violence targeting their own party. These results extend sectarianism theory beyond policy preferences to physical violence, suggesting partisan identity now functions as a powerful perceptual filter that can legitimize political aggression when directed at opponents.",

          "authors": "Gloria E Casanova-Molina",
          "abstract": "This preprint presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding intersex bodies through the lenses of corporality, subjectivity, and emotions. Drawing from anthropological, feminist, and philosophical traditions, this work challenges the biomedical construction of intersexuality and proposes embodied approaches that center lived experience and agency. The analysis traces genealogies of bodily thought—from Cartesian dualism through phenomenology to contemporary feminist theory—while examining how power structures, medical discourses, and cultural norms shape intersex experiences. By articulating sociological and individual levels of analysis, this framework reveals intersexuality as a contested field where expert knowledge confronts activist voices, and where bodies become sites of both disciplinary control and transformative resistance. This theoretical contribution provides essential tools for ethnographic research on intersex lives and broader questions of bodily difference, gender variance, and biomedical normalization.",

          "authors": "Alisher Faizullaev",
          "abstract": "This study examines negotiation effectiveness through AI-mediated simulations. Eight models – four contemporary (Principled Negotiation, 3D Negotiation, Voss, Shell) and four spiritually inspired (Confucian, Daoist, Sufi, Tibetan Buddhist) – were tested across 8,506 simulations conducted by three AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok) acting as interpretive agents. The analysis spanned bilateral, multilateral, distributive, integrative, crisis, and communication-constrained scenarios, revealing a “context paradox”: models effective in one setting often faltered in another. Spiritually inspired approaches excelled in emotionally complex and relational contexts, while tactically optimized models thrived in structured, goal-driven situations. Under language barriers, models emphasizing authenticity and emotional intelligence showed greater adaptability, highlighting communication resilience as a key negotiation capability. Conversely, contemporary approaches proved particularly effective in maximizing quantifiable outcomes and sustaining strategic coherence under competing priorities. These findings challenge the outcome-centric orientation of mainstream negotiation research and support a pluralistic, context-sensitive understanding of negotiation effectiveness, showing that contextual variation fundamentally shapes negotiation practice.",

          "abstract": "Background: The belief that the frequency of births increases during the full moon or new moon (the so-called \"lunar effect\") persists among the general public and some medical professionals, despite a lack of established medical evidence. This study statistically investigates whether lunar phases influence the timing of childbirth in Japan using a dataset of 135,748 birth records collected via the web service charapla.net between 2010 and 2017.\n\nMethods: Lunar age (0–29) at birth was calculated for each individual, and expected frequencies were derived via a calendar-based simulation reflecting astronomical cycle length. The goodness-of-fit was analyzed using the Chi-square test and effect size (Cohen’s w).\n\nResults: The distribution was nearly flat, with no increased births near the New Moon or Full Moon. Although a statistically significant deviation was detected (χ²(29) = 55.43, p = 0.0022), the effect size was negligible (w = 0.02).\n\nConclusion: These results demonstrate that there is no substantial association between lunar phases and birth rates in the contemporary Japanese population. The findings challenge popular belief and reinforce evidence-based medical and social decision-making.",

          "abstract": "Technology-driven disruptions are reshaping the business landscape at an unprecedented pace. This white paper presents a governance-focused approach to scenario planning as a strategic tool for boards of directors to anticipate and navigate disruptive technological changes. We outline a six-stage Adaptive Tech Scenario Governance Cycle that integrates scenario planning into board oversight processes, ensuring organizations remain resilient and proactive amid uncertainty. The proposed approach bridges academic foresight techniques and practical board governance needs, providing clear guidance on conducting annual technology disruption scenario workshops and embedding their outcomes into corporate strategy and risk management. Scenario case studies – covering artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and climate-tech disruptions – illustrate how boards can use scenario planning to uncover emerging risks and opportunities. Finally, the paper offers implementation templates and checklists to operationalize this approach, along with a discussion of limitations and future directions. The goal is to equip governance practitioners with a concrete, repeatable method to enhance strategic foresight and organizational preparedness for the next wave of tech disruption",

          "authors": "Michael Swinton",
          "abstract": "AI adoption varies systematically across generations, with differential exposure to technology shaping patterns of engagement, reliance, and risk. I propose that generational priming skews the anthropomorphism baseline, producing cohort-specific tendencies in adoption and vulnerability. Older adults, shaped by the scarcity and novelty of early digital systems, anthropomorphize minimally and face risks tied to misunderstanding and misinformation. Bridge cohorts, transitioning from analog to digital, exhibit situational anthropomorphism and mixed vulnerabilities. Younger generations, immersed in digital environments from birth, often default to relational engagement with AI, raising identity-level concerns such as coherence erosion, dependency, and epistemic drift. While most existing evidence is cross-sectional or short-term, converging findings from developmental, design, and clinical studies suggest stronger emotional engagement, blurred human/AI boundaries, and heightened sensitivity to linguistic and interface cues among youth. Policy, regulation, and design can leverage these generational differences through measures such as transparent AI disclosures in youth-facing platforms, funding longitudinal studies that track identity development under AI exposure, and creating interdisciplinary advisory panels that bridge HCI, developmental psychology, and clinical research.",

          "abstract": "Nous proposons ici une approche énactive et pragmatiste de l’enseignement et de la pratique de la redirection écologique, formalisant la pratique du jeu sérieux dans le cadre du module «Gestion de Crises» du MSc «Statégie et Design pour l’Anthropocène». Nous introduisons d’abord le paradigme neuro-computationnel de l’Inférence Active, lequel décrit la cognition humaine comme un processus prédictif régulant action et perception via l’énaction d’un modèle implicite du monde intégrée dans les dynamiques agent-environnement. Sur cette base, nous décrivons ensuite l’engagement social humain comme étant régulé par des contraintes sociales, prémisses publiques pour l’action sociale, ou encore un champ commun intégrant les attentes contextuelles liées à un contexte social et matériel donné. Finalement, nous suggérons la pratique du jeu sérieux comme une méthodologie permettant un accès privilégié à de telles prémisses publiques, et donc comme un outil précieux pour la redirection des pratiques sociales. Nous proposons de plus des pistes concrètes pour le design et l’accompagnement d’une démarche d’enquête co-opérative par le jeu sérieux visant à réfléchir sur les enjeux et les pratiques d’une communauté ou d’un réseau donné. Par ce travail, nous espérons offrir un cadre socio-cognitif pour formaliser les enjeux sous-jacents à la pratique du jeu sérieux, et ainsi participer au cadre méthodologique de la redirection écologique.\n\nWe propose an enactive and pragmatic approach to teaching and practising ecological redirection, formalising the practice of serious games as developed within the « Crisis Management » module of the MSc in « Strategy and Design for the Anthropocene ». We first introduce the neurocomputational framework of Active Inference, which describes human cognition as a predictive process regulating action and perception through the enaction of an implicit model of the world integrated into agent-environment dynamics. On this basis, we then describe human social engagement as being regulated by social constraints, public premises for social action, or a common ground defining contextual expectations embedded in a given social and material context. Finally, we suggest the practice of serious games as a methodology allowing a privileged access to such public premises, and therefore as a valuable tool for redirecting social practices. We also propose concrete avenues for the design and facilitation of a cooperative inquiry process through serious games aimed at reflecting on the issues and practices of a given community or network. Through this work, we hope to offer a socio-cognitive framework for formalising the processes underlying existing practices of serious games, and thus contribute to the methodological framework of ecological redirection.",

          "abstract": "Computational social science (CSS) is an evolving field with transformative potential to expose and address pressing societal challenges. Yet, because CSS, much like other scientific disciplines, operates within structural contexts addressing social bias remains a critical issue requiring attention in the field. Social bias, defined as the systematic discrimination and stereotyping of groups and individuals, relates to CSS in multiple ways. Drawing on literature, we critically examine these connections across three perspectives: understanding, detecting, and mitigating social bias. First, we provide a foundation for understanding how social bias shapes both CSS as a research field and its methodology. Second, we highlight how social bias can be detected not only within the CSS methodology itself but also through CSS applied to broader societal domains. Finally, moving forward, we propose strategies to mitigate social bias in the CSS methodology and CSS as a research field. With our contribution, we seek to demonstrate the breadth of ways in which social bias and CSS intersect and to chart paths toward a more equitable and robust CSS.",

          "abstract": "The 2024 Nepal floods provided a context to examine the effectiveness and challenges of social media–based disaster response among young adults. Utilizing survey responses from 50 Nepali youth residing primarily in Kathmandu and surrounding areas, this study explores (a) frequency of use, (b) value added across platforms, (c) contributions including information sharing and collective action, and (d) barriers to participation. Findings indicate high engagement with social media, with older participants showing higher usage levels (p = .006). Platform use was function-specific: Instagram and Facebook facilitated broad information sharing, while WhatsApp supported tactical grassroots organizing such as donation coordination. Despite widespread participation (64% shared verified information), efforts were undermined by rumours and a lack of two-way engagement with formal disaster agencies. These results have theoretical implications for understanding heterogeneity among digital natives in crisis contexts and practical implications for developing integrated communication protocols and digital literacy programs to strengthen community resilience.",

This research paper will also analyze legal documents related to interrogation of the Confession program to reveal why the Chinese immigrants felt compelled to take part in the program. Using the sources and evidence provided, the paper will dive into the process of Chinese immigrants leaving their home behind, the interrogation process and suspicions, the confession program itself and its legacies, and if the confession program was really worth throwing away everything they worked for. I chose to use the history of emotions for the research paper, in order to understand the conflicting feelings paper sons faced while going through the immigration process and living a false identity. The paper families took part in the Confession Program to be liberated from the burden of their false identity and reunite with their families by bringing them to America through the program.",

          "abstract": "Considering rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the growing demand for the convergence of disciplinary knowledge, ideas, and expertise, a paradigm shift toward context-based learning is necessary. This paper introduces the key principles and the relevant pedagogical practices for transitioning from content-driven to context-driven learning: dispositions, discernment, and productive inquiry. By engaging in an iterative cycle of discernment, prompt, prototype, and iteration within real-world challenge spaces presented in various degrees and forms, students cultivate their unique dispositions while practicing discernment and productive inquiry as tools for learning. Drawing on a case study from a cross-disciplinary school that helps students explore challenges at the intersections of technology, arts and design, and business, we illustrate how the challenge-based reflective learning (CBRL) framework equips learners to navigate complex sociotechnical entanglements and develop reflective practice essential in the age of AI. This learning framework emphasizes associative learning over progressive learning, focusing on cultivating a mindset equipped to address the real-world complexities. This paper discusses the role of humanities education across disciplines as a vital domain for interrogating ethical, social, and cultural dimensions of complex problems of the future.",
