          "abstract": "The purpose of this brief is to provide an introduction to an increasingly popular way of communicating outputs of research: the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. This model came into practice in the early 2000s, and it is now beginning to grow more rapidly. Here, we explain the model for the benefit of researchers, research funders, research institutions, and others in the scholarly communication ecosystem, and we provide data on uptake of the model to date.",

          "title": "Why Do Children Think Words Are Mutually Exclusive?",
          "authors": "Gabor Brody; Roman Feiman; Athulya Aravind",
          "abstract": "How do children learn what a word means when its uses are consistent with many possible\nmeanings? One influential idea is that children rely on an inductive bias that ensures that novel\nwords get assigned distinct meanings from known words – Mutual Exclusivity. Here, we explore\nthe possibility that Mutual Exclusivity phenomena do not reflect a bias, but rather information\nencoded in the message: learners might effectively be told when and when not to assume that\nword meanings are mutually exclusive. In three experiments (N=106, ages 2;0−2;11 from across\nthe United States), we show that 2-year-olds only assume that novel words have distinct\nmeanings if the words were spoken with 'focus', an information-structural marker of contrast.\nWithout focus, we found no Mutual Exclusivity; novel words were understood to label familiar\nobjects. These results provide a novel account of Mutual Exclusivity and demonstrate an early-\nemerging understanding of focus and information structure.",

          "authors": "Kelsey Medieros; David H Cropley; Rebecca L Marrone; Roni Reiter-Palmon",
          "abstract": "Much has been made of the apparent capacity for creativity of generative AI. However, as research expands the knowledge base regarding the capabilities and performance of this technology, the prevailing view is shifting away from “AI is creative” and towards a more balanced model of Human-AI co-creativity. Nevertheless, even this paradigm may be impacted by untested assumptions: for example, that generative AI will boost human performance on idea generation tasks. To test that assumption this study primed subjects with lists of words purportedly either from a human or from ChatGPT, and of varying degrees of creativity. Subjects then completed the Divergent Association Task (DAT). The results of this study found no evidence of any difference in divergent thinking resulting from either the source of priming (Human/ChatGPT) or from the level of creativity of the priming (low, typical and high), with one exception: a low-creativity prime, believed to be from ChatGPT, resulted in lower scores on the DAT compared to other priming conditions. This result was supported by a regression analysis, which found that only Openness and the perceived creativity of the prime were weak predictors of the subjects’ DAT scores. The consequences of these findings for Human-AI co-creativity are discussed.",

          "title": "Achieving Constant Hazard Rate in Psychophysics Experiments",
          "authors": "Megan A. K. Peters; Brian Maniscalco",
          "abstract": "In psychophysics, it is sometimes desirable for the temporal onset of an event to be unpredictable, e.g. to control possible effects of expectation and temporal attention in behavioral or neural data. One way of achieving temporal unpredictability is to make the hazard rate of the event constant. Roughly speaking, the hazard rate measures the odds that an event will occur now or later. If the hazard rate is constant throughout a temporal interval, then the time elapsed thus far provides the observer with no information for updating their expectation of when the event will occur. A constant hazard rate thus prevents the building of predictive anticipation that the event is about to occur even as time continues to unfold. Here we consider the question of how best to control hazard rates in psychophysics experiments with time considered as either a continuous or discrete variable. We argue that for computerized psychophysics experiments, it is both more appropriate and more convenient to model time as a discrete variable. We also consider that for practical reasons, experimenters may wish to impose upper bounds on the duration of random temporal intervals. We show how hazard rate can be exactly controlled for unbounded time intervals when time is treated as either a continuous or discrete variable by using the exponential and geometric distributions, respectively. We discuss complications in controlling hazard rate for bounded time intervals and present a solution yielding exact control of hazard rate for bounded time intervals with discrete time steps using a modified form of the geometric distribution. The latter approach is likely to be the most relevant for most psychophysics experiments that seek to control hazard rate.",

          "title": "Effect of auditory cues to lexical stress on the visual perception of gestural timing",
          "authors": "Chengjia Ye; James McQueen; Hans Rutger Bosker",
          "abstract": "Speech is often accompanied by gestures. Since beat gestures frequently co-occur with prosodic prominence, they can indicate stress in a word and hence influence spoken-word recognition. However, little is known about the reverse influence of auditory speech on visual perception. The current study investigated whether lexical stress has an effect on the perceived timing of hand beats. We used videos in which a disyllabic word, embedded in a carrier sentence (Exp 1) or in isolation (Exp 2), was coupled with an up-and-down hand beat, while varying their degrees of asynchrony. Results from Experiment 1, a novel beat timing estimation task, revealed that gestures were estimated to occur closer in time to the pitch peak in a stressed syllable than their actual timing, hence reducing the perceived temporal difference between gestures and stress by around 60%. Using a forced-choice task, Experiment 2 further demonstrated that listeners tended to perceive a gesture, falling midway between two syllables, on the syllable receiving stronger cues to stress than the other, and the auditory effect was greater when gestural timing was most ambiguous. Our findings suggest that f0 and intensity are the driving force behind the temporal attraction effect of stress on perceived gestural timing. This study provides new evidence for auditory influences on visual perception, supporting bidirectionality in audiovisual interaction between speech-related signals that occur in everyday face-to-face communication.",

          "title": "Acute Suicidal Ideation in Context: Highlighting Sentiment-based Markers through the Diary Entries of a Clinically Depressed Sample",
          "authors": "Damien Lekkas; Amanda C. Collins; Michael V. Heinz; Tess Z. Griffin; Arvind Pillai; Subigya Nepal; Daniel M. Mackin; Andrew T. Campbell; Nicholas C. Jacobson",
          "abstract": "Background: Despite major strides in conceptualizing and modeling the multifaceted nature of suicidal thought and behavior (STB) over the past few decades, the overall predictability of STB has not improved. This may be partly due to the dynamic nature of suicidal ideation (SI), which often fluctuates over hours, yet is largely overlooked in studies. Bolstered by the application and promise of natural language processing (NLP) across the mental health field, efforts toward richer operationalization of acute SI may include analyses on written data that occur alongside changes in SI, thus offering a better understanding of STB as it unfolds.\n\nMethods: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data consisting of thrice-daily SI severity scores and diary entries from 268 participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) were utilized to interrogate acute changes in SI. Using difference scores and probability of acute change thresholds, eleven acute SI phase trajectory types were defined to label change in SI over three consecutive EMAs. In total, 5,938 acute SI trajectories were paired with the temporally centered diary entries. The Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine (SEANCE) tool was applied to quantify the written content of each diary entry across eight established lexica. Entry results were grouped based on phase trajectory type, and the Kruskall-Wallis test was employed with post-hoc multiple hypothesis correction to statistically compare SEANCE features between all group pairs.\n     \nResults: There were 130 statistically significant (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05) pairwise differences between acute SI phase trajectory groups, implicating 31 NLP features. Consistent with the literature, results highlighted qualities of writing that are generally associated with heightened SI, including personal pronoun usage, passivity, and negative valence. Patterns of significance also uncovered novel contextual nuance in terms of how characteristics such as verbosity, hostility, anger, and pleasantness present in relation to SI over short change trajectories. \n\nConclusions: This work provides an accessible exploratory framework that capitalizes on the benefits of dense EMA sampling and NLP to profile and quantify acute SI trajectories. Future research should continue to focus on short timeframes as there are likely important signals and interpretative nuances in SI that have yet to be fully detailed.",

          "authors": "Ryan Donovan; Ruairi O'Reilly; Aoife Johnson; Aine De Roiste",
          "abstract": "Affective computing research aims to accurately detect users' emotional states to enhance human-computer interaction. While existing studies demonstrate the ability of affective computing models to accurately detect posed expressions of emotions, there is limited investigation into their validity in detecting natural or spontaneous emotional expressions. This study examines the validity of several models in accurately detecting six basic emotional states from spontaneous expressions. Data were collected from 114 participants who viewed emotionally provocative video clips, while multi-modal information on their emotional experiences was captured (questionnaires, video recordings, audio recordings, and text). Open-source software was used to detect basic emotional states from facial expressions (Py-Feat), text (National Research Lexicon), and audio (an LTSM-DNN model). The construct validity of these measurements was assessed by correlating their relationship to self-reported emotional experiences (positive convergent validity) and Big Five personality traits (both discriminant and negative convergent validity). Data analyses demonstrated limited construct validity for automatic detection of emotion through facial expression and text, and poor construct validity through audio. These results suggest that existing models are not yet capable of accurately measuring basic emotional states in real-life settings, highlighting the critical need for improving affective computing models using spontaneous emotional data to enhance their accuracy. The Personality-Emotion Mapping (PEM) dataset is provided as a resource for training and testing these models, with the aim of facilitating more effective human-computer interactions.",

          "authors": "Shensheng Wang; Robert Wilson; Natalie C. Ebner; Nichole Renee Lighthall",
          "abstract": "Humans frequently make decisions under uncertain conditions in everyday life. A constellation of cognitive biases may drive such decisions. To further our understanding of how these biases influence decision making, we developed a novel paradigm—the Florida-And-Georgia (FLAG) gambling task. In the FLAG task, 170 young adult participants chose between a deck, which yields variable outcomes, and a sure-thing offer. This approach allows us to model experience-dependent decision making as influenced by both learning processes (e.g.,  primacy-recency bias) and key factors drawn from Prospect Theory, including sensitivity to outliers and loss aversion. Our findings reveal that individuals in their decision making underweight outliers for both gains and losses and are biased by recent outcomes, but we found no evidence of loss aversion. The FLAG task strikes a balance between ecological validity and experimental control, providing insights into the cognitive processes involved in decision making. In closing, we discuss future directions for the FLAG task and its potential societal and clinical applications.",

          "abstract": "A reconstruction-of-order task illuminated the dynamics and strategies that underlie serial order recall. Following an initial baseline experiment, a second experiment orthogonally varied temporal and spatial positions. This experiment yielded large performance differences between recalling temporal and spatial information. In the temporal condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the temporal order of words that were positioned alphabetically within a vertical array. In the spatial condition, participants attempted to reconstruct the spatial positions of words presented in a temporal sequence based on their alphabetical order. After viewing each list, all the words appeared alphabetically, and participants reconstructed the order of the words according to their instructed condition. Compared to temporal recall, spatial recall exhibited superior performance and a more bowed symmetrical serial position function. Analyses showed the effects of temporal contiguity in the spatial condition and spatial contiguity in the temporal condition. These findings suggest that participants do not focus on the words' identities but rather on the temporal-spatial pattern in which the words occur during the study display.",

          "abstract": "Can false claims by political leaders be brushed aside as harmless, or does such rhetoric carry serious consequences? By applying large language models to U.S. Presidential speeches spanning 1850 to 2024, we find that presidential assertions of falsehoods as fact—which we term misplaced certainty—are associated with a subsequent rise in politically violent events. Underscoring the relevance of these findings, we identify a comparative shift toward such rhetoric in Republican versus Democratic presidents beginning around 1980, with Donald Trump exhibiting particularly extreme values. Providing experimental support, we find individuals’ support for political violence to increase after exposure to excerpts high in misplaced certainty from the 2024 Harris-Trump presidential debate. Our findings highlight the dangers of political leaders expressing unwarranted certainty in false claims.",

          "authors": "Melissa J Dreier; Sarah Horne; Evan Kleiman; Jessica L. Hamilton",
          "abstract": "Objective: Anhedonia is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts. Treatment for anhedonia (behavioral activation) involves engaging in rewarding activities. Social media use is a rewarding activity for adolescents, and thus, a possible behavioral activation tool for adolescents experiencing anhedonia, reducing further symptom escalation (e.g., suicidal thoughts). \n\nThe current study tested: 1) Is momentary anhedonia negatively associated with looking forward to checking social media (predicted pleasure)? 2) Is momentary anhedonia associated with subsequent experiencing less positive mood on social media (actual pleasure)? 3) Are within-person changes in positive mood on social media (actual pleasure) associated with reduced likelihood of suicidal thoughts, and does this vary by levels of anhedonia? \nMethod: Sixty-two adolescents (Mage = 16.15 (0.97); 49.3% girls, 16.4% boys, 34.4% nonbinary; 40.3% white) completed ecological momentary assessments three times daily for eight weeks. All prompts asked about anhedonia, predicted pleasure from social media, and actual pleasure on social media. Evening prompts assessed daily suicidal thoughts. Multilevel models tested the above research questions. \n\nResults: Adolescents experiencing momentary anhedonia above their average levels looked forward to checking social media less. However, more-than-usual momentary anhedonia was not associated with positive mood on social media (actual pleasure). Experiencing above-average positive mood on social media was associated with decreased risk of suicidal thoughts at the daily level. This relationship was not moderated by anhedonia. \n\nConclusion: For adolescents experiencing more-than-usual anhedonia, using social media for positive mood-boosting activities could be a behavioral activation tool and may be an important protective factor against suicidal thoughts.",

          "abstract": "Objective: The impact of social media (SM) use (‘screentime’) on adolescent mental health has been the focus of increasing concern, despite mixed findings from empirical research. Current methodological approaches rely on self-reported SM use, which has limited accuracy and obscure the dynamic interplay of SM use and mental health. Smartphone-based mobile sensing offers new opportunities to gain insights into adolescents’ SM use patterns and behaviors, particularly at an idiographic level. Considerations and challenges of smartphone sensing methods for capturing adolescents’ SM use patterns and behaviors in clinical psychological science are discussed in the context of a pilot study using smartphone-based sensing with adolescents. \n\nMethod: The pilot study included 19 adolescents (Mean age=15.84; 68% boys; 79% White) who installed a passive monitoring application (AWARE) on their phones for 31 (SD=5.6) days. \n\nResults: Descriptive data of sensing acceptability and feasibility are presented based on participant ratings and data yield ratio of usable data (74.18%). Sensing yielded 10,038 hourly observations collected from the ‘application foreground’ sensor across all participants from social media apps, and a total of 645 applications used. Categorization of SM apps were coded (kappa &gt;.90) into ‘social networking’ (N=20 apps) and ‘broader SM’ (N=41) and compared to both Play Store-defined SM apps (N=26) and popular SM apps based on Common Sense Media Survey (N=9). Descriptive data on extracted behavioral features (duration, checking) from SM use categories (binned hourly and daily) are presented. \n\nDiscussion: Challenges, opportunities, and future directions of sensing methods for SM use are discussed to inform our understanding of its impacts on mental health and to improve the rigor of SM research in clinical psychological science.",

          "authors": "Emily Esposito",
          "abstract": "Don’t ask, don’t tell. The closet. The Lavender Scare. Throughout history, LGBTQ+ people have been repeatedly told to hide who they are at risk of losing jobs, housing, family, and friends. Presently, new silencing laws are on the forefront of public discourse, with many states enacting “don’t say gay” laws that prevent discussion of sexual and gender diversity in public schools. However, these laws, like other anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, may only further stigmatize LGBTQ+ people and create cultural norms of anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes. This pre-registered study examines the effects of “don’t say gay” laws on state-level anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes through time. Though new “don’t say gay” laws do not affect the trajectory of sexuality attitudes through time, states with “don’t say gay” laws have more negative implicit and explicit sexuality attitudes overall. Importantly, this effect was most robust for earlier “don’t say gay” laws that were enacted in the 1980s and 1990s. This study shows evidence that “don’t say gay” laws may relate to negative attitudes towards sexual minority people, which is important as these laws continue to be proposed, debated, and enacted across the country.",

          "abstract": "Developmental dyslexia is a disorder marked by difficulties in reading, spelling, and connecting sounds to written language. The high-level visual dysfunction hypothesis suggests these difficulties may partially arise from abnormalities in high-level visual cognition such as the ability to integrate visual input for higher-order cognitive functions such as reading.  Here we examined dyslexic readers’ neural functioning as they recognized identities of nonlinguistic visual objects, specifically houses and faces. We measured two event-related potentials (ERPs), the N170 and N250, which are linked to face and object processing – N170 with early structural encoding and N250 with familiarity and identification. In this study, dyslexic readers consistently showed reduced N250 amplitude, potentially suggesting abnormal neural processes relating to the individuation or subordinate-level representation of visual objects. This was despite similar behavioral performance for dyslexic readers. Early neural processes in dyslexic readers were largely intact as shown by their N170.  These results highlight the distinct underlying neural processes that contribute to high-level visual cognition in dyslexia and help to further our understanding of how these neural processes might contribute to reading challenges that are characteristic of the disorder.",

          "authors": "Molly Grace Smith; Thomas Bradbury; Benjamin R. Karney",
          "abstract": "The development of generative AI that can sustain complex conversations has created a growing market for companion chatbots promising social and emotional connection with their users. In this review and analysis, we apply theoretical tools established by over 50 years of research on relationships to evaluate the extent to which relationships between humans and chatbots fulfill this promise. Indeed, interactions between humans and chatbots do possess some of the characteristic features of close relationships: humans and chatbots can influence each other, and can engage in frequent and diverse conversations over extended periods of time. Chatbots can be responsive to their users in ways that humans perceive to be appropriate and supportive, and such responses can generate feelings of authentic connection, as well as opportunities for self-expansion and growth. Yet AI-powered chatbots cannot yet fully replicate the experience of being in a relationship with another human being. Their responses can lack depth and their ability to recall and build upon prior interactions remains limited, rendering them predictable and boring to some users. Because chatbots do not make more than the most superficial requests of their users, relationships with chatbots do not provide the many benefits of having to negotiate, compromise, and sacrifice for a partner. Although the relationships humans form with chatbots are clearly meaningful to some users, and will be preferable to social isolation for some, they have not reached the level where they can replace human relationships.",

          "abstract": "Abstract: Gentrification is the influx of rich, often White people and businesses into a neighborhood causing displacement of current residents, and is a crucial concern in many cities across the globe. City planners may laud the potential economic benefits of gentrification, but displacement often threatens established communities with little social power. The present research examines the psychological impact of gentrification on members of marginalized groups. Participants reported their attitudes towards gentrification, then viewed 30 Google Street View images of both gentrified and not gentrified neighborhoods and reported the extent to which they felt like they would belong in each. Participants with positive attitudes towards gentrification reported greater feelings of belonging in gentrified versus non-gentrified places. Additionally, regardless of their attitudes, Latine participants reported lower feelings of belonging, and White participants reported greater feelings of belonging, in gentrified versus non-gentrified areas. Our findings highlight the psychological impact of gentrification on communities that are at risk of displacement.",

          "abstract": "When higher socioeconomic status (SES), often White people move into a neighborhood, a process called gentrification, a common consequence is displacement of the long-time residents, who are often lower SES and from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Another consequence may also be a decrease in belonging, with usual victims of gentrification being disproportionately affected by perceptions of gentrification. To understand the effects of gentrification, I examined what features of buildings and neighborhoods may relate to stronger perceptions of gentrification. Across two studies, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, I evaluated what building features (e.g., newness of business, type of establishment) impacted perceptions of gentrification, then how those perceptions, as well as building features and participant characteristics, affected belonging. As people try to remedy the negative impacts of gentrification on marginalized communities, it is important to better understand what gentrification looks like, and who it impacts the most.",

          "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nObjectives   To assess the impact of spin on the interpretation of the results and conclusions reported in abstracts describing randomized controlled trials investigating behavioural treatments for depression. \nDesign   This study was an online parallel-group randomized controlled trial. \nParticipants   We recruited clinicians and clinical researchers by sending 6794 email invitations. We received 190 eligible responses of which 91 were randomized into the ‘without spin’-condition and 99 into the ‘with spin’-condition. \nInterventions   We selected 10 abstracts from published RCTs that investigated behavioural treatments for depression. The RCTs had at least one nonsignificant primary outcome and an abstract conclusion that claimed a beneficial effect despite that nonsignificant primary outcome. We rewrote the abstracts to create a spinless version of each of the 10 abstracts. Participants were randomly assigned to read one version of one of the 10 abstracts and answer questions about the study described in the abstract. \nOutcome measures   The primary outcome was the participants’ perception of the effectiveness of the treatment proposed in the abstract, rated on a scale from 0 to 10. \nResults   The Bayesian analysis showed no convincing support for an effect of spin on the participants’ perception of the treatment effectiveness (posterior mean = 0.53, SE = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.01, 1.07]; posterior mode = 0.54, 95% HDI [-0.02, 1.06]). However, following the Bayes factor of 1.8, no convincing support for a null-effect was found either.\nConclusion   The presence of spin in abstracts did not convincingly impact the perceptions of clinicians and clinical researchers regarding the effectiveness of the proposed treatment.",

In the last decades, research followed a more dynamic approach to\nexplain such connections and has shifted from using stable traits to investigating\nmomentarily fluctuating states. Achievement motivation has been shown to 1) fluctuate at\nstate level and 2) be linked to specific situation perception variables, like Duty or Intellect,\nbut the direction of this relation is yet unclear.

Using random\nintercept cross-lagged panel models, we examined the directionality of the relation\nbetween situation perception and achievement motivation states. Cross-lagged parameters\nwere mainly substantial from situation perception to motivation. There were no significant\npaths for Intellect, but directional effects from Duty to achievement motivation states with\npositive valence.

This study examines gender differences in parental linguistic engagement and its effect on language outcomes. Using data from the French birth cohort Elfe (about 12,000 for early outcomes, 4,000 for later outcomes), parental questionnaires assessed linguistic engagement from ages 1 to 5. Children’s language outcomes were measured via the McArthur-Bates CDI at age 2, and literacy tests in preschool and first grade. Analyses showed parents engaged more with girls than boys (standardized β=0.10 to 0.17), and this engagement partially mediated the relationship between sex and language outcomes (mediation 6% to 19%). These findings suggest that parental language input contributes to sex differences in language development, with implications for designing interventions that ensure equitable language opportunities for all children.",

Building on the idea that subjective evaluations of SMU can shape well-being effects, this study examined how two social media mindsets—agency and valence—relate to self-reported and logged SMU, and four well-being indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, life satisfaction) among a sample of young adults (N = 1858, M = 21.01, SD = 3.14) in South Africa. The results replicate, extend and sometimes contradict previous findings in this regard. Agency mindsets (perceptions of control over SMU) negatively correlated with SMU and positively with well- being, while valence mindsets (perceptions about SMU effects) were associated with higher SMU but not to well-being. Logged SMU showed weaker associations with mindsets and well- being compared to self-reported SMU, suggesting differences between perceived and actual use. These findings highlight the importance of users' sense of control, more so than SMU duration or valence mindsets, in predicting well-being.",

          "abstract": "Typical late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compromises episodic memory, the ability to recollect past events. Much of the research on episodic memory in AD has relied on lab-based memory tasks (e.g., word lists, short stories). It is unclear how well these tasks characterize the impact of episodic memory impairments across different domains of everyday life, including conversational memory. In this scoping review, we followed the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis and PRISMA-ScR guidelines to establish what is known about conversational memory in AD (e.g., “I remember discussing medical decisions with my children and I said [...] and they responded [...]”). We retained 121 reports on conversation and 3 reports on conversational memory out of the 8,351 unique records found on PubMed, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase, and in relevant reviews. Included reports had to involve conversation in any format and on any topic, include an AD population, be peer-reviewed, in English, and published between 1990–2022. None of the studies investigated memory for spontaneous conversation. Given the rarity of studies on conversational memory, we primarily summarized existing knowledge about conversation and methodological considerations to inspire hypotheses for future research on conversational memory in AD and to illuminate decisions regarding study design. Between 10%-85% studies reported on demographic characteristics, hearing/vision acuity, screening tests, task instructions, and the duration of the conversations. Studies described a broad range of behaviors during conversation, such as repetitions, dysfluency, ambiguity, pauses, and gestures. This review revealed a wide gap in knowledge on conversational memory in AD and offers a path to accelerating research on the topic. Conversational memory may be an important factor in promoting independence, participation in healthcare, and social well-being.",

          "abstract": "To maintain and develop close relationships, people need to accurately represent the minds of close others. Although studies have characterized the development of children’s theory of mind and children’s theory of relationships, it is largely unknown whether and how children think about mental state reasoning within close relationships. In three experiments, we asked whether children think of accurate mental state reasoning as a cue to social closeness. In Experiment 1 (n = 145), we found that 4- to 9-year-old children inferred that characters who are socially close know about each other’s goals and desires. In Experiment 2 (n = 137), we found that 6- to 9-year-old children, but not younger children, inferred that characters who are correct about each other’s minds are socially close. Children did not make the same inferences, however, concerning knowledge about external states of the world. In Experiment 3 (n = 79), we conceptually replicated the main findings from Experiments 1 and 2, and we found that 6- to 9-year-old children did not form the same inferences concerning knowledge about observable features of individuals (e.g., an individual’s outfit); children’s inferences were specific to unobservable mental content. Thus, by 6 years of age, children apply their theory of mind and their theory of relationships to make sense of whether and how people are connected to each other, as well as the strength and nature of those connections.",

          "abstract": "Humans learn adaptive behaviors via a durable but incremental reinforcement-learning (RL) system and a fast but fleeting working memory (WM) system. Past work parsing these systems focused on reward learning alone. Hence, little is known about how they interact while simultaneously learning to avoid punishment, and whether arbitrating between these demands is disrupted by psychiatric symptoms. We administered a novel reward/punishment RL-WM task to an online sample oversampled for depression and anxiety symptoms (N=298; n=275 after quality control). We found participants avoided punishment during initial learning, yet poorly retained this avoidance. Computational modeling captured this pattern by allowing the fleeting WM system to facilitate punishment avoidance, while the durable RL system retained little about punishment. We also found individual differences in a previously documented tendency for WM to blunt the RL system. Specifically, while we indeed found that a subset of high-blunting participants paradoxically showed the worst (RL-based) ultimate retention when WM had facilitated initial learning, another subset enjoyed the greatest ultimate retention in this scenario. Importantly, we found that the retention patterns in the task could not be captured by a computational model in which the RL system was replaced by a stimulus-response one. Finally, we found that task performance (analyzed behaviorally and via computational modeling) was largely spared as a function of depression/anxiety and trait rumination. Overall, our findings provide insight into how WM and RL interact when facing the ubiquitous challenge of attaining reward while simultaneously avoiding punishment, and demonstrate intact behavior under internalizing-disorder symptoms.",

          "abstract": "Inequity aversion is a fundamental social preference. Concern for others’ welfare is yet another fundamental social preference. What do people prefer when maximizing others’ welfare creates an inequality that disadvantages them? Prior research has shown that people’s preferences depend on their level of agency, that is, their control over the allocation. Behaviorally, agentic decision makers have been shown to be more likely to prefer allocations that give another person more than them, compared to non-agentic ones. However, the cognitive processes underlying this shift of preference remain unclear. Here, we used mouse-tracking and reaction times to investigate how agency shapes social preferences in such cases. We examined decision conflict, the level of conflict experienced in arriving at a given choice, as a way to uncover whether different underlying social preferences are at play when one has versus does not have agency. We predicted an interaction effect of agency and choice on conflict, where choosing the prosocial option would be associated with less conflict in the Agency condition compared to the No-Agency condition, and that the opposite would be true for the equitable option. In our task, on each of trial, participants were presented with two allocation options: an equitable option (e.g., 50 cents for self, 50 cents for other) and an inequitable and prosocial option, favoring the other participant over oneself (e.g., 50 cents for self, 70 cents for other). Agentic participants chose one option to be implemented, whereas non-agentic participants indicated their preference, knowing that the lab manager had already made the decision. In two studies (N = 586), including a preregistered one, an interaction effect emerged in both mouse trajectory and reaction time analyses. These results suggest that agency alters social preferences during the decision-making process, and challenge traditional inequity aversion models claiming that people inherently dislike inequitable outcomes. Granting agency may be a powerful tool for maximizing social welfare in situations where equity and prosocial behavior are at odds.",

The new idea could have any name, but some names for it are clearly better than others. This paper builds upon existing research on the perceived relationship between label and word meaning to better understand the way that label choice affects language design, particularly conceptual engineering. Across three experiments, the paper finds that when learning novel concepts, the labels serving as vehicles for the novel concepts affect how people perceive the novel concepts’ content. In particular, the experiments find that labels influence people’s perception of novel concepts’ valence. Not all forms of information are readily extracted from labels, however, and subtle forms of information, particularly phonesthemes, do not appear to be noticed by people learning new concepts. Accordingly, conceptual engineers and other forms of language designers need to do careful research into how a given label will affect how their novel concept is interpreted by others.",

Qualitative interviews with 13 participants who believed they had gotten better revealed clinically relevant findings. We review two domains: (1) the perceived outcomes of therapy and (2) the clients’ own explanations of the discrepancy. Participants reported increased insight and self-awareness, learning coping strategies, interpersonal improvements, symptom reduction, increased resilience, moralization and motivation, and improved self-concept. They explained the discrepancy between the OQ-45 and their subjective report by citing extratherapeutic factors, changes in how they interacted with the questionnaire, elements of progress not detected by the questionnaire (e.g., increased capacity for adversity), and hindsight bias.

Participants included 78 mother-preschooler and 51 father-preschooler dyads (53% female, 63.3% non-Hispanic White) oversampled for familial risk. At 2½ years, parents self-reported harsh parenting. At 3 years, parent-child RSA was collected during free play and clean-up tasks. Multilevel models of time-lagged RSA (i.e., parent RSA predicting child RSA in the next time unit and vice versa) were conducted. In response to a task with increased challenge and parenting demands, mothers and children showed expected individual RSA decreases (indicating active regulation) whereas fathers showed increases in RSA (indicating disengagement). During play, mother-driven negative time-lagged RSA coregulation and father-driven positive time-lagged RSA coregulation were observed, but this disappeared during challenge. Harsh parenting was associated with altered RSA responses to challenge: during clean-up, harsher mothers showed a lack of engagement in regulatory processes, harsher fathers showed more stability in RSA self-regulation during the task, and child-driven negative RSA coregulation with harsher fathers was observed. Findings suggest that during preschool: (1) parents are the typical drivers of RSA coregulation; (2) challenging contexts and parenting risk alter dynamic RSA self-regulation and time-lagged RSA coregulation; and (3) typical and atypical RSA self-regulation and time-lagged coregulation differ between mother-child and father-child dyads.",

Multi-option decisions are also important from a theoretical perspective. Experimental and computational studies have demonstrated that the composition of a set of choice options has predictable effects on choice outcomes. Specifically, with more options available to choose from, responses are slower and more stochastic. This effect is amplified when the values of the options (including the worst option in the set) are more similar to each other. In this study, we provide additional evidence of these effects. We also provide evidence that metacognitive factors such as feelings of confidence in the response or mental effort exertion during deliberation show similar effects as the cognitive factors (consistency between choices and value estimates, and response speed). Finally, we provide novel evidence that value estimates are refined during deliberation for all options in choice triplets, similar to what has previously been show for choice pairs.",

Following the skill-learning (task-specificity) hypothesis, we expected that language switching may be automatized and no longer rely on EFs in bilinguals with high language proficiency, but not for those with lower proficiency. Thus, we expected significant associations between the tasks in the lower proficiency participants only. Our results showed no CN switching-EF associations in the more experienced L2 speakers, but a significant association in lower-proficiency participants. This suggests that language switching engages EFs only in participants with lower proficiency in whom these processes are not yet automatized.",

          "abstract": "Protestors recently repurposed the abortion rights’ mantra, “my body, my choice,” to oppose COVID-19 mandates. But do those who oppose public health mandates fully support the right to choose? We answer this question by using exploratory analyses to identify the unique response patterns underlying support for abortion and COVID-19 mandates in random samples from the United States (Study 1; N = 2,331) and New Zealand (Study 2; N = 33,310). Latent profile analyses revealed a small subgroup in both countries (12.6% and 3.4% of the respective samples) who opposed mandates. Yet contrary to the “my body, my choice” rhetoric seen at anti-mandate protests, they also opposed abortion. Across both studies, those in the Anti-Mandate profile tended to be more religious, conservative, and distrustful of institutions. In Study 2, they were also low on cognitive consistency and high on conspiracy belief. Finally, the Anti-Mandate profile was opposed to free speech critical of both the United States and religion (Study 1), high on sexual prejudice (both studies), unsupportive of progressive protests (but supportive of reactionary protests; Study 2), and likely to vote for conservative parties (both studies). These results reveal the mobilization potential of the anti-mandate movement, uncover important contradictions within its members, and illustrate the nuanced ways in which opposition to gender policies (i.e., reproductive rights) coalesce with reactionary protests.",

          "abstract": "Music's rhythmic structure and emotional content can influence how attention is allocated. While much of the existing research has focused on music's ability to enhance attentional performance through behavioral tasks, our study aims to expand this knowledge by investigating how music affects the temporal dynamics of attention using eye-tracking. Fifty-seven middle-aged and older adults listened to music characterized as happy or sad music, or silence for 10 minutes before and after completing the Attention Network Test (ANT). Attention was indexed using blink probabilities. We hypothesized that happy and sad music would differentially influence blinking dynamics during music listening and during completion of the ANT. The probability of a blink fluctuated, non-linearly, during happy and sad music listening, but not during silence listening. Notably, participants in the happy music group inhibited blinking when the flanker task was preceded by temporally or spatially uninformative cues, whereas sad music and silence did not affect blinking before the flanker task onset. Blinking also predicted faster response times in the happy music group and slower response times in the sad music group. Overall, our results demonstrate that music listening modulates the temporal dynamics of attention, highlighting its potential to serve as a therapeutic tool for enhancing attentional performance, particularly in older adults where attentional decline is common.",

However, standard use of tasks that involve motor responses to index “speed” potentially confounds fine-motor coordination with central cognitive processing speed. One promising alternative is a vocal articulation task, which provides a measure of speeded performance that is independent of fine-motor coordination. The current study applies an ex-Gaussian decomposition to preparatory interval (the time to initiate a vocal response) and speech rate on a speeded articulation task among children with and without ADHD. Although differences in mean vocal response time were not found, there was substantial evidence that the tail of the distribution, as indexed by the tau parameter (which is linked to the rate of information accumulation), was larger in children with ADHD. Variance in tau was also greater among children with ADHD, and the greater variance was not fully explained by individual differences in working memory capacity.

          "abstract": "Background: Recent advances in digital mental health have paved the way for more personalized mobile health (mHealth) interventions by leveraging intensive longitudinal ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs) facilitate reach of individuals in a given moment and context, in their daily living environments, which can, in turn, lower barriers to public mental health services. The use of advanced Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, generative Recurrent Neural Networks in particular, may augment effects of EMIs on mental health outcomes by improving the process of tailoring EMI components to individual preferences, needs, and contexts. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and effects of a novel ML-based, adaptive EMI – the AI4U training - for personalized mental health promotion in youth. \n\nMethods: A within-subject micro-randomized trial (MRT) was conducted to investigate effects of EMI components on time-lagged proximal mental health outcomes in daily life. Participants were repeatedly randomized to one of two conditions up to seven times per day over a 30-day period with equal probability (i.e., up to 210 decision points for each individual): the experimental condition, receiving an EMI component based on a personalized ML-algorithm, or the active control condition, receiving an EMI component randomly. First, the feasibility and safety of delivering the AI4U training for mental health promotion in youth were evaluated. Second, the effects of ML-based vs. random assignment of EMI components on time-lagged proximal outcomes (i.e., positive affect, momentary resilience, negative affect) at tn+1 were examined. Third, uncontrolled effects of the AI4U training on distal outcomes (i.e., psychological distress, resilience, emotion regulation) at post-intervention were investigated. The AI4U training consists of eight EMI components on positive imagery, breathing techniques, and positive refocusing as well as a dedicated web-based dashboard for real-time self-monitoring of mental health outcomes and behaviours.\n\nResults: A total of 83 individuals aged 14–25 were identified from the general population and psychological counselling. Of these, 58 met eligibility criteria and provided informed consent, with 57 (98.2%) completing the AI4U training and post-intervention assessment. There was evidence on feasibility of the AI4U training overall, including high ratings of satisfaction, acceptability, and usability. No serious adverse events were observed. Beneficial effects of ML-based vs. randomized assignment of EMI components were evident for momentary resilience when the experimental and active control condition were compared (marginal excursion effect, B = 0.147, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.004 – 0.290, p-value: 0.044). However, there was no evidence of beneficial effects of ML-based intervention assignment on momentary positive affect (B = 0.012, 95% CI, -0.012-0.128, p-value: 0.839) and negative affect (B = 0.093, 95% CI, -0.020-0.206, p-value: 0.103), respectively. Uncontrolled effects of the AI4U training on distal outcomes indicated reduced psychological distress (Cohen’s d: -0.25) along with improved resilience (Cohen’s d = 0.32) and use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (Cohen’s d = 0.30).\n\nDiscussion: This study provides new evidence on feasibility, safety, and beneficial effects of a novel data-driven and ML-based, adaptive EMI for personalized mental health promotion in youth. A confirmatory trial is now warranted.",

          "abstract": "Friends and spouses tend to be similar in a broad range of characteristics, such as age, educational level, race, religion, attitudes, and general intelligence. Surprisingly, little evidence has been found for similarity in personality—one of the most fundamental psychological constructs. We argue that the lack of evidence for personality similarity stems from the tendency of individuals to make personality judgments relative to a salient comparison group, rather than in absolute terms (i.e., the reference-group effect), when responding to the self-report and peer-report questionnaires commonly used in personality research. We employed two behavior-based personality measures to circumvent the reference group effect. The results based on large samples provide evidence for personality similarity between romantic partners (n = 1,101; rs = .20–.47) and between friends (n = 46,483; rs = .12–.31). We discuss the practical and methodological implications of the findings.",

While approaches to returning individual-level research results to study participants in civilian contexts has received some attention, unique ethical considerations informing approaches to sharing military research results, and particularly in research studies involving active-duty Special Operations Forces (SOF) personnel, have been underexplored. As the number of research studies enrolling active-duty military personnel grows, an ethical framework to guide responsible handling and sharing of individual-level research results in these distinctive contexts is crucial to safeguard the rights and welfare of research participants and to elucidate appropriate practices for investigators. After exploring the landscape of ethical, clinical, legal and logistical considerations both motivating and complicating routine sharing of individual-level biomedical research results with active-duty SOF personnel, we propose a framework to guide responsible disclosure of results to capture potential benefits while mitigating possible risks.",

          "authors": "Emily Sebranek; Arianna N LaCroix",
          "abstract": "Purpose: People with aphasia (PWA) with cognitive deficits have poorer treatment outcomes than those without. Yet, aphasia therapy rarely targets cognition, which may contribute to the continued variability observed in aphasia treatment outcomes. Listening to music has been shown to positively impact cognition in neurotypical adults. The purpose of this study was to extend this large body of research into PWA by investigating whether listening to music improves attention in PWA.\nMethod: Forty-three PWA were assigned to listen to music characterized as happy (major mode, fast tempo) or sad (minor mode, slow tempo), or no music for 10 minutes. Attention was measured before and after music listening using the Attention Network Task, which measures three types of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Mixed ANOVAs were used to explore how each type of attention changed after music listening by group and aphasia severity.\nResults: Our results demonstrate that listening to happy music improved orienting attention, regardless of aphasia severity. Happy music listening also improved alerting attention for individuals with moderate-severe aphasia. Executive control attention was not modulated by music listening. \nConclusions: Our findings suggest that music listening has the potential to improve attention in PWA. While we recommend further research in this area to better understand the extent and underlying mechanisms of music-induced changes in attention, SLPs may want to consider incorporating music listening into their treatment of PWA.",

          "authors": "Justin Fleming; Matthew Winn",
          "abstract": "Objectives: Seeing a talker’s mouth improves speech intelligibility, particularly for listeners who use cochlear implants (CIs). However, the impacts of visual cues on listening effort for listeners with CIs remain poorly understood, as previous studies have focused on listeners with typical hearing (TH) and featured stimuli that do not invoke effortful cognitive speech perception challenges. This study directly compared the effort of perceiving audiovisual speech between listeners who use CIs and those with TH. Visual cues were hypothesized to yield more relief from listening effort in a cognitively challenging speech perception condition that required listeners to mentally repair a missing word in the auditory stimulus. Eye gaze was simultaneously measured to examine whether the tendency to look toward a talker’s mouth would increase during these moments of uncertainty about the speech stimulus. \n\nDesign: Participants included listeners with CIs and an age-matched group of participants with typical age-adjusted hearing (N = 20 in both groups). The magnitude and time course of listening effort was evaluated using pupillometry. In half of the blocks, phonetic visual cues were removed by selectively blurring the talker’s mouth, which preserved stimulus luminance so visual conditions could be compared using pupillometry. Each block included a mixture of trials in which the sentence audio was intact, and trials in which a target word in the auditory stimulus was replaced by noise; the latter required participants to mentally reconstruct the target word upon repeating the sentence. Pupil and gaze data were analyzed using generalized additive mixed effects models (GAMMs) to identify the stretches of time during which effort or gaze strategy differed between conditions.\n\nResults: Visual release from effort was greater and lasted longer for listeners with CIs compared to those with TH. Within the CI group, visual cues reduced effort to a greater extent when a missing word needed to be repaired than when the speech was intact. Seeing the talker’s mouth also improved speech intelligibility for listeners with CIs, including reducing the number of incoherent verbal responses when repair was required. The two hearing groups deployed different gaze strategies when perceiving audiovisual speech. CI listeners looked more at the mouth overall, even when it was blurred, while TH listeners tended to increase looks to the mouth in the moment following a missing word in the auditory stimulus. \n\nConclusions: Integrating visual cues from a talker’s mouth not only improves speech intelligibility, but also reduces listening effort, particularly for listeners with CIs. For listeners with CIs (but not those with TH), these visual benefits are magnified when a missed word needs to be mentally corrected — a common occurrence during everyday speech perception for individuals with hearing loss. These results underscore the importance of including participants with hearing loss in listening effort studies and suggest caution in assuming results from TH listeners will generalize to those with hearing loss. They also highlight the potential clinical relevance of visual speech information, for counseling patients and families and potentially for the development of audiovisual strategies to reduce listening effort.",

          "abstract": "The categorization of complex real-world stimuli, such as facial expressions, appears to vary greatly between people. This raises a crucial methodological challenge: how is it possible to elicit the mental representation of a complex category for a specific individual? Comprehensive category-elicitation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) work well across populations, but  converge too slowly to be usable with individual participants. Here, we address the problem of slow convergence with a new method: combining MCMCP with an adapted Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) acting as a “gatekeeper”. We tested this approach in a new experiment (N=90) on facial affect comparing MCMCP with the “gatekeeper” (MCMCPG) against baseline MCMCP and other variants. MCMCPG converged substantially faster than the other methods, in about 10 minutes for our task, with showing more representative recovered faces than its competitors. Further analyses captured participants’ substantial individual differences in a categorization task at an individual level. And, uniquely, the resulting model generalized these individual differences to real-world faces outside of our training set. Our study demonstrates the potential of MCMCPG for investigating generalizable human representations of complex stimuli at the individual level and illustrates the power of integrating Artificial Intelligence into psychological experiments.",

          "abstract": "Remembering the unfolding of past experiences usually takes less time than their actual duration. In this study, we examined the extent to which this temporal compression in memory depends on the number and duration of events that need to be maintained in a sequence. Participants were asked to watch and then mentally replay short videos depicting one, two, or three continuous events (i.e., people performing continuous actions in an uninterrupted way), each lasting 3, 6, 9, or 12 s. We computed remembering duration and a temporal compression index for each event. Results showed that event remembering duration was close to the actual event duration for short events, but smaller for longer ones (i.e., temporal compression was not systematic but occurred selectively depending on event duration). Furthermore, events were mentally replayed more quickly when they were part of a sequence of several events than when they were presented alone, and this decrease in the duration of event recall with the number of events was more pronounced for longer events. These results suggest that working memory capacity in representing naturalistic events is limited by both the number and duration of events to be retained, which may in part explain why the unfolding of events is temporally compressed in episodic memory.",

Yet, this approach comes at a big cost: it reduces research quality—reducing participation rates and leading to biased samples—and unduly restrains youth’s right to informed, autonomous decision-making. This goes against the best interest and rights of youth, their caregivers, and society at large. In this commentary, we propose a hybrid research ethics strategy, which may help to strike a better balance between meeting ethical responsibilities (protecting minors from involuntary or unconsented participation) and safeguarding research quality and youth’s right to autonomous decisionmaking. This strategy allows the use of active, informed consent from caregivers where needed, and ‘passive’ (opt-out) consent in cases where youth can make autonomous and well-informed decisions to participate in research.",

          "abstract": "Across many studies, verbal labels have been shown to significantly affect perceptual and cognitive processes. Here we ask whether verbal labels can also improve visual working memory performance by making objects more recognizable. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to remember visual details of unrecognizable shapes derived from real-world objects. Participants were either provided with category labels prior to stimulus presentation or not. We reasoned that the labels could aid object recognition, which would then help maintain them in working memory based on recent work showing that meaningful, recognizable objects are better remembered than arbitrary visual shapes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no reliable increase in visual working memory performance when participants were given verbal labels. This pattern of results persisted across various experimental manipulations, including different methods of distorting the objects, testing label memory, and using within or between-category stimulus sets. Overall, our results indicate that category labels did not readily enhance working memory performance for obfuscated shapes that are difficult to recognize, suggesting that improving visual working memory for meaningful stimuli may depend on how the visual system reorganizes incoming visual information perceptually rather than associating visual inputs with verbal knowledge. Thus, verbal labels do not seem to have as broad and general effects on cognitive functioning as previously assumed.",

          "abstract": "Financial exploitation of older adults has become an increasingly urgent public health issue, with annual losses exceeding $10 billion in the US annually. This exploitation often stems from age-related cognitive deficits, such as impairments in working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are linked to deterioration of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). A critical yet understudied component of age-related cognitive decline is confirmation bias—the tendency to interpret new information in a way that conforms to one’s pre-existing beliefs. As older adults focus more on present-oriented goals related to social and emotional satisfaction, their ability to recognize and respond to exploitative situations may decrease. This problem worsens with the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, increasing vulnerability to fraud. Despite these links, little is known about how confirmation bias is associated with future cognitive decline and risk for fraud. Two main challenges impede progress: the lack of knowledge about the latent processes that shape confirmation bias in this population, and the reliance on correlations between brain responses and behavior that do not clarify causal mechanisms. To address these issues, this chapter provides an overview of confirmation bias and its connection to aging. It then addresses adverse effects of confirmation bias before highlighting strengths of noninvasive brain stimulation as a method of investigating these relationships further.",

          "authors": "Jacinda Taggett; Charan Ranganath; James W Antony; Xiaonan Liu",
          "abstract": "Students are often taught that testing themselves will help them retain new material. Less well known, however, is that testing oneself before learning can also produce benefits (the “pretesting effect”). Prior studies have indicated that the semantic relatedness between the provided information (cue) and the answer (target) may be critical for this effect. Here, we investigated this by measuring the trifold relationship between cue, target, and guess using continuous relatedness measures. In Experiment 1, participants learned cue-target word pairs by studying or generating guesses based on the cue word before taking a test on both cue-target pairs and the original cue-guess combinations. We found a robust difference in accuracy favoring pretesting over studying, regardless of cue-target relatedness. In Experiment 2, we further examined if errorless generation contributed to the pretesting effect by adding a condition in which cue and target were present, but subjects still generated a related word. Cue-target memory was better in both the pretesting and generation conditions than the study condition. In both studies, while cue-target relatedness benefitted accuracy overall, these benefits did not interact with pretesting or generation pair conditions. Importantly, we observed an interaction between the cue-target semantic relatedness and guess-target semantic relatedness only in the pretesting condition, demonstrating a benefit for (incidentally) high relatedness between guesses and targets when cue-target relatedness was low and an impairment when cue-target relatedness was high, likely reflecting interference between target and guess. Our results illuminate the importance of considering guess quality in uncovering the mechanisms in pretesting.",

After analyzing passages where Freud conflates the real patient with the mythical figure of Oedipus and acknowledges the pivotal role of names in psychological processes, I employ an engineering technique to support the integration of the adjective “Oedipal” into psychoanalytic discourse. Additionally, I explain how the term “Oedipal complex” is more consistent with the philosophy of science. My contribution addresses intellectual resistance to Freud’s theories and the analysand’s “refusal to heal,” proposing that adopting the refined term could significantly impact the future of psychoanalytic theory and practice.

          "abstract": "Objectives: The benefits of mindfulness are well-documented, but limited research has explored sources of individual differences in outcomes of mindfulness interventions although understanding this can improve their efficacy and adherence. This study aimed to investigate the role of baseline participant characteristics in predicting the response to a low-dose mindfulness intervention in young adults. \nMethods: Participants were 161 students (M=22.1, SD=3.22) recruited from the University of Amsterdam who were enrolled in either a mindfulness-based intervention course or an unrelated psychology course that served as the control group. General linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of improvements in emotion regulation from pre- to post-intervention. Specifically, the study examined the influence of trait mindfulness, mental health, well-being, intervention expectations, perceived recent stress, and lifetime stress on changes in emotion regulation. \nResults: The results showed that baseline trait mindfulness was the only significant predictor of change in emotion regulation after the intervention (b = 0.25, SE = 0.13, p &lt;0.05). Participants with lower scores on trait mindfulness at baseline showed a greater improvement in emotion regulation. Other baseline participant characteristics, including mental health, well-being, intervention expectations, perceived recent stress, and lifetime stress, did not significantly predict changes in emotion regulation.\nConclusions: This study contributes to the understanding of individual differences in mindfulness interventions and highlights the importance of measuring trait mindfulness before implementing such interventions.

          "abstract": "Background. Electronic health (eHealth) programs are a promising avenue to enhance the accessibility of parenting interventions that aim to improve parent mental health. However, engagement in eHealth parenting programs can be variable and sociodemographic factors may help elucidate for whom there are barriers. Such work may inform specific components of future eHealth interventions and support the scalability and effectiveness of existing interventions for those experiencing barriers.\nObjective. The current study aims to investigate the extent to which sociodemographic factors predict various engagement metrics in a novel eHealth parenting program (The Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health [BEAM]).\n\nMethods. A secondary data analysis of engagement metrics was conducted in two separate randomized controlled trials (RCT) of the BEAM program. A total of n = 110 mothers (Mage = 31.85 years old, SDage = 4.67) of young children participated across both trials. We examined the magnitude of the relationships between sociodemographic predictors with distinct metrics of engagement.\n\nResults. Program engagement was highest in the earlier weeks of the program and declined across later weeks (β = -.16, p &lt; .001). Older mother age positively predicted several engagement metrics, including more time watching mental health videos (β = .34, p = .010) and parenting videos (β = .34, p = .010). Higher household income positively predicted more forum page views (β = .44, p &lt; .001), number of BEAM sessions attended (β = .30, p = .006), and more weeks of BEAM program engagement (β = .35, p &lt; .001). First time-parents engaged in fewer program weeks (β = -.25, p = .009). Number of children in the household, employment status, and living in an urban area did not significantly predict any program engagement metrics. \n\nConclusions. Parent engagement varied throughout the program, and it may be beneficial to specifically target mid and later program engagement for participants. First-time and low-income parents may face additional barriers in participating in eHealth programs and benefit from additional support from the intervention team to bolster engagement. Additional research will be helpful in replicating and extending these findings with larger samples to optimize program engagement.",

          "abstract": "The consequences of chronic stress present a major public health challenge, and we are beginning to understand ways to mitigate these damaging effects. Research on mindfulness has accumulated over the past decades and suggests that it can counteract the psychological, neural, and immune effects of chronic stress, but more research is required to provide precise clinical guidelines. This article describes mindfulness interventions in a language that can be understood by researchers from different backgrounds, reviews three central gaps, and provides future directions for research on the psychoneuroimmunology of mindfulness. \n\nThe first gap addresses the need to explore adaptations to existing mindfulness interventions that may further increase effectiveness or accessibility across diverse populations—such as varying intervention duration and doses of home practice or utilising technology. The second gap refers to a lack of consensus on the theoretical framework in mindfulness research that blocks progress. Researchers are invited to use the Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework (INSPIRER) that integrates disciplines and explains the psychological, neural, and immune mechanisms by which mindfulness produces broad benefits across different levels of observation. The final gap refers to individual differences in responses to mindfulness interventions, and discovering who benefits the most from mindfulness interventions. Baseline levels of psychopathology are some of the participant characteristics that influence responses to mindfulness interventions, but only further identification of participant characteristics and replication of existing ones will allow for more targeted approaches. \n\nBy addressing these three research gaps in the 21st century, we can advance the field of mindfulness and contribute to the development of cost-effective and personalised interventions that can be applied on a large scale to mitigate the effects of chronic stress and protect human health.",

          "authors": "Rosa E. Torres; Christine Salahub; Karen L. Campbell; Stephen M Emrich",
          "abstract": "Previous behavioral research has demonstrated that when given positive and negative cues (i.e., cues indicating the features of upcoming targets and distractors, respectively), young and older adults are able to use this information to a similar extent. However, it is possible that older adults achieve similar behavioral performance via different neural mechanisms. The current study aimed to test this question by examining the neural underpinnings associated with effective attentional filtering across age. Young and older adults were presented with either positive (target matching), negative (distractor matching), or neutral cues, which were immediately followed by a search array where participants had to report the orientation of a search target. We found that both age groups appropriately attended to target information when given information about it in the form of a target-matching pre-cue, as indicated by faster response times (RTs) and target-processing event-related potentials (ERPs). However, older adults were not able to suppress distracting information when given a negative cue, as no distractor-positivity (PD) ERP, indicative of suppression, was observed. Additionally, when given a neutral cue, older adults’ ability to suppress distracting information was correlated to measures of inhibitory control. Thus, although young and older adults seem to use negative cues similarly at first glance, neural evidence suggests there are differences between the two age groups in their ability to suppress task-irrelevant information.",

          "authors": "Sean Noah; Sreenivasan Meyyappan; Mingzhou Ding; George R. Mangun",
          "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that sustained visual attention operates rhythmically, as if the visual system periodically samples stimuli in the environment. In this study, we find evidence for rhythmic attentional sampling of internal representations of Targets and Distractors up to almost one second after the offset of visual stimulation. Twenty participants performed an anticipatory object-based visual attention task in which they were instructed to determine whether a short-lasting Target object image was blurry or not-blurry. This task was made more challenging by the overlaid presentation of a Distractor object image that might also be blurry, requiring focused attention to the cued object \ncategory to perform the task successfully. We recorded EEG during the task and performed a decoding analysis on the stimulus-evoked EEG to measure Target and Distractor information present in the scalp voltage topography over the stimulus epoch. We found that the magnitude of the represented Target and Distractor information oscillates in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz), consistent with previous characterizations of rhythmic attentional sampling. Moreover, we found a correlation between the Target-Distractor theta band phase difference and task performance. Our findings suggest that: 1. Attention separately samples Target and Distractor representations during the cognitive processes that occur between stimulus presentation and behavioral response; 2. These separately sampled streams of information interfere with one another; and 3. Target discrimination improves when Target and Distractor sampling rhythms are desynchronized.",

Prior research suggests that motor synchrony promotes closeness and prosocial behaviour, but few studies have examined its role in social learning. This study investigated whether motor synchrony, through a clapping game, enhances preschoolers' closeness with others, imitation, over-imitation, and prosociality. We hypothesized that children would feel closer, imitate more, and share more with a partner who moved in synchrony compared to one who moved asynchronously. In a group setting, motor synchrony and asynchrony were experimentally induced between the child and two experimenters. Bayesian analyses revealed no credible evidence for differences in affiliation, imitation, over-imitation, or prosocial behaviour between experimenters (BF10=0.045-0.216). A manipulation check indicated low motor synchrony scores, suggesting the intended synchrony may not have been fully achieved, potentially influencing the outcomes. These findings highlight the challenges of inducing motor synchrony in playful group contexts and raise questions about the conditions necessary for synchrony to impact social learning in young children.",

          "abstract": "A culture of honor refers to a social system where individuals' status, reputation, and esteem play a central role in governing interpersonal relations. Past works have associated this concept with the United States (US) South and related with it various traits such as higher sensitivity to insult, a higher value on reputation, and a tendency to react violently to insults. In this paper, we hypothesize and confirm that internet users from the US South, where a culture of honor is more prevalent, are more likely to display a trait predicted by their belonging to a culture of honor. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that US Southerners are more likely to retaliate to personal attacks by personally attacking back. We leverage OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to both geolocate internet users and to automatically detect whether users are insulting each other. We validate the use of GPT-3.5 by measuring its performance on manually-labeled subsets of the data. Our work demonstrates the potential of formulating a hypothesis based on a conceptual framework, operationalizing it in a way that is amenable to large-scale LLM-aided analysis, manually validating the use of the LLM, and drawing a conclusion.",

          "abstract": "Background:\n\nWith the rapid expansion of wearable technologies, there is increased interest in their utility for passive data collection applications in aging research. Wearables can be specifically beneficial to research featuring people with dementia and their families who have burdens that can make both study participation and reliable data collection more difficult, especially as dementia progresses. However, population-specific issues affecting the success of wearables for data collection can include remembering to wear a device, fluctuating acceptance of the device or study participation, and reliance on strained caregivers. Better understanding of how research with wearables can address these and other issues is necessary to enhance participant buy-in and sustained wearing for better quality dementia research.\n\nObjective:\n\nWe undertook a systematic evaluation of contemporary wearables research to describe this population's wearables experiences, desired qualities, and protocol needs.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe used the PRISMA 2020 guide to systematic reviews and searched three scholarly databases using medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for papers published since 2018 featuring the use or discussion of wearable devices for persons with dementia. We screened 1757 abstracts and retained 58 for full-text review.\n\nResults:\n\nWe present synthesized preferences, barriers, and facilitators to wearables buy-in and adherence in dementia research. A total of 29 factors were categorized into four overarching categories aligned with study development: device selection, protocol considerations, enhancing recruitment, and promoting adherence.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThese findings inform researcher guidelines for wearable device selection and protocol design to enhance the utility of wearables in future longitudinal research featuring persons with dementia and their caregivers.",

          "abstract": "Background:\n\nInexperienced adolescent drivers are particularly susceptible to engaging in distracted driving behaviors (DDB) such as texting while driving (TWD). Traditional driver education approaches have shown limited success in reducing motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.\n\nObjective:\n\nWe test an innovative approach to help address the critical issue of DDB among teenagers. We investigated the effectiveness of using a novel virtual reality (VR) game \"Distracted Navigator\" to educate novice teenage drivers about DDB.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe game consisted of maneuvering a spaceship around asteroids while engaging in simulated DDB (e.g., inputting numbers into a keypad). Facilitated discussion, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, linked gameplay to real-life driving. Teenagers were recruited and divided into intervention (VR gameplay/discussion) and control (discussion only) groups in a ratio of 2:1. Pre-post surveys measured the impact on TWD-related beliefs and intentions. Focus group interviews elicited feedback on the utility of the VR gameplay and discussion.\n\nResults:\n\nThe majority of participants were male (62.5%), ranging 14-17 years old (M(SD) =15.8(0.92)), with universal cell phone ownership. Approximately 60% reported never texting while driving and 29% said they rarely did. Compared to the control group (n=7), the intervention group (n=17) was more likely to report that the programming had changed how they felt about texting and driving overall (P=.015). However, specific TWD attitudes and intentions were not different by treatment status. Irrespective of the treatment, pre-and post-scores indicated reduced confidence in safely texting while driving (perceived behavioral control; P=.005). Thematic analysis revealed: 1) the VR gameplay adeptly portrayed real-world consequences of texting and driving; 2) participants highly valued the interactive nature of the VR game and discussion; 3) both the VR game and facilitated discussion were deemed as integral and complementary components, and 4) feedback for improving the VR game and discussion.\n\nConclusions:\n\nOur findings show the novel use of immersive VR experiences with interactive discussions can raise awareness of DDB consequences and is a promising method to enhance driving safety education. Widespread accessibility of VR technology allows for scalable integration into driver training programs, warranting a larger, prospective randomized study.",

Supportive school environments were associated with lower externalizing symptoms, particularly for youth in low threat contexts. Further, for racial/ethnic minority youth living in low-segregation neighborhoods, higher neighborhood access/quality of educational resources related to lower internalizing symptoms.\n\nConclusion\nWhile adverse neighborhood environments are associated with higher psychopathology symptoms and lower cognitive performance, some aspects of neighborhoods may buffer this association. Understanding these patterns is necessary for informing structural interventions that might reduce disparities in mental health and cognitive function.",

Using a retrospective cross-sectional design with data from the Asymmetries TalkBank database, this study aims to capture differences in disfluency production and lexical diversity between children with ADHD and Typically Developing (TD) children. These measures include the frequencies of different disfluency subtypes and two lexical diversity measures, and are correlated with performance on a working memory task and a response inhibition task. Results indicate that the ADHD group produced a higher mean frequency of each disfluency type, but no differences were found to be significant. Correlation analysis revealed that filled pauses and revisions were negatively correlated with working memory and response inhibition in the ADHD group, whereas they were positively correlated with working memory performance in the TD group. This suggests that the underlying causes of disfluency differ in each group and that further research is required of speech monitoring ability in children with ADHD.",

Twenty children (ages 8 to 9) were exposed to a complex artificial language comprising novel nouns, verbs, case markers, with variable word order by means of a CSL paradigm, adapted from Rebuschat et al.

They understand that people play particular roles within a larger social fabric that shapes their identities and expectations, and that their self image is affected by appraisals of how well (or not) they perform these roles. We designate here as relational concerns the considerations that arise from these roles and relationships, and study how they affect judgments of fairness. A series of vignette studies is used to explore how relational concerns compare with the impartial principles of equity and equality that fairness is commonly held to entail. We provide evidence that for participants based in the UK and in India, relational concerns are important for judging the fairness of distributions where people coordinate around shared goals. We also show that relational concerns may vary across cultural communities.",

A better understanding of how PTSD develops through treatment can increase treatment efficiency and reduce residual symptoms. Objective: The current study investigated which PTSD symptom clusters and symptoms within these clusters that change the most and least through trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) and identified common residual symptoms after treatment. Method: Latent growth curve modelling was used to identify differences in intercepts and slopes of symptoms, and residual symptoms were identified with McNemar tests in a sample of 517 youth (6 -19 years, 75.6% girls) receiving TF-CBT. Results: We found small but statistically significant differences in slopes across clusters. Avoidance both reduced the most and demonstrated most residual symptoms. Also, within clusters, many of the symptoms that reduced the most, such as psychological cue reactivity, persistent negative emotional state, and difficulties sleeping and concentrating, had the highest symptom levels at pretreatment and the most residuals posttreatment. Conclusions: Overall, symptoms of PTSD were reduced throughout TF-CBT. Symptoms that were rated highest at treatment start showed the most decrease but also tended to remain as common residuals. Symptoms such as psychological cue reactivity, persistent negative emotional state, and negative beliefs that were common residuals and are known to be central in development and maintenance of PTSD are of particular clinical relevance. Elaborate research on short-term symptom development and mechanisms of change is needed to advance the field.",

          "abstract": "Previous research suggests that participants can enumerate a set of objects more quickly and precisely when clusters can be formed according to Gestalt factors. This effect is known as \"groupitizing\". Although predominantly observed in the visual domain, the role of visual experience in its development is still unknown. Has groupitizing emerged from neural mechanisms underlying grouping-cues processing in the early visual cortex? What is the impact of visual deprivation on its development? A fundamental model to investigate these questions is to study congenitally blind (CB) individuals. Lacking experience of visual grouping cues, CB individuals should not develop groupitizing strategies if vision is essential. Conversely, if vision is not mandatory, CB individuals should reveal groupitizing abilities in other sensory modalities. Importantly, visual deprivation could prompt compensatory cognitive abilities, such as better auditory working memory, which may influence the enumeration of auditory stimuli. We compared congenitally blind and sighted individuals in an auditory groupitizing task, where participants estimated the number of pure tones (5 to 12) presented rapidly, which were randomly interspaced (ungrouped condition) or grouped by temporal proximity (grouped condition). We found that grouped sequences yielded lower error-rates and higher precision compared to ungrouped ones in both blind and sighted participants. Overall, the blind group presented lower error-rates and slightly better numerical precision, with a greater grouping-benefit toward larger set sizes, compared to sighted participants. These findings suggest that groupitizing may emerge even without vision, potentially relying on perceptual amodal mechanisms, and that visual deprivation may boost groupitizing in the auditory modality.",

          "abstract": "Since it was first noticed in the 1970s, studies have continued to observe that various types of portraits are often produced with the left side of the face protruding more than the right side of the face. This pose orientation is often preferred by the viewer and the displayed cheek appears to influence the viewer’s perceptions of the portrayed individual. This phenomenon has become known as the left-cheek bias. Based on the notion that the right hemisphere both innervates the left hemiface and is considered dominant in emotion processing, a popular explanation for the left-cheek bias is that such a posing orientation better displays emotional qualities. Given societal stereotypes associating women with emotional expressiveness, it has been suggested that this bias is more prevalent in portraits of women. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the literature on the left-cheek bias, both in terms of its occurrence, its effect on the viewers, and potential gender effects. A systematic literature search was conducted in seven electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO Discovery Service, PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Embase. Two independent raters assessed the resulting 268 articles, ultimately including 65 articles comprising 98 studies. These studies were first categorised by whether they assessed pose orientation in a set of stimuli (DV-group; k = 64) or how pose orientation affected an outcome measure (IV-group; k = 34). The present poster primarily focuses on the DV-group, analysing the outcomes of studies across various DV-categories with respect to pose orientation. Furthermore, the poster includes a review of studies examining gender differences in posing bias, along with their conclusions.",

          "abstract": "The importance of interactions between child temperament and parenting has been accepted ever since Thomas and Chess (1977) proposed their “goodness-of-fit” construct, but over the last three decades, pertinent research has grown exponentially. Researchers examining child characteristics that can moderate the effects of socialization have tested increasingly complex, nuanced, and sophisticated models, largely inspired by the highly influential frameworks of child plasticity or differential susceptibility (Belsky &amp; Pluess, 2009). Yet, multiple questions remain unsettled. We addressed four such questions as applied to predicting children’s observed disregard for rules at age 4.5 in a study of 200 community families from the US Midwest. (1) We examined children’s observed negative emotionality at 16 months, most commonly seen as plasticity “trait”, but separating anger and fear proneness, which may differently moderate effects of socialization.

          "authors": "Juyoung Kim; Grazyna Kochanska",
          "abstract": "As interest in early morality has grown, researchers have increasingly focused on young children’s moral self, but recent studies have targeted mostly its structure and associations with behavior rather than its developmental origins. Addressing this gap, we followed children, mothers, and fathers in US Midwest from late infancy (16 months old, N = 194, 93 girls, 101 boys), to toddlerhood (3 years old, N = 175, 86 girls, 89 boys), to preschool age (4.5 years old, N = 177, 86 girls, 91 boys). We proposed that moral self at preschool age originates in the second and third years, when the onset of parental control engenders in the child both receptive and adversarial stance toward the parent. In infancy and in toddlerhood, we collected behavioral indications of both stances – positive affect and responsiveness (in toddlerhood, also positive representation of the parent); and defiance and violations of parental prohibition. At preschool age, we measured child moral self in a puppet interview (Kochanska, 2002). For both mother- and father-child relationships, structural equation modeling supported direct paths from receptive and adversarial stance at age 3 years to higher and lower moral self, respectively, and the expected indirect effects of the child’s receptive stance in infancy on moral self, mediated by the receptive or adversarial stance in toddlerhood. The path from toddler-age adversarial stance to lower moral self was present only in father-son relationships. This study highlights the long-term pivotal significance of the child’s early stance toward the parent for the formation of moral self.",

          "abstract": "Speed–accuracy trade-offs are a fundamental aspect of decision-making, requiring individuals to balance collecting more information against making faster decisions. Although speed–accuracy trade-offs have been studied extensively at the individual level, their role in human group decision-making remains poorly understood—even though faster, and possibly more error-prone, decisions often influence group outcomes more than slower decisions. We examined how individual differences in speed–accuracy trade-off preferences shape decision-making in pairs, using an interactive online experiment and drift–diffusion modeling. Participants first performed a visual perception task alone, allowing us to estimate their individual drift rates and decision thresholds, the key cognitive determinants of speed–accuracy trade-off preferences. Participants then performed the task in pairs, sharing decisions in real time. Group accuracy depended on the faster (and thus more error-prone) member, and not on the slower (but more accurate) member. Social decisions were not worse than individual ones because faster members increased their thresholds in the social condition and became more accurate, while slower members incorporated less social information. These findings show that individuals adjusted their social information use to the speed–accuracy trade-off preferences of their group members, highlighting the importance of such individual differences for understanding collective behavior.",

          "abstract": "Causal selection is the process underlying our intuition that an outcome happened because of a given event, or that an event is the cause of an outcome. When a forest catches fire after a lightning strike, for example, people tend to say that the lightning bolt was the cause of the fire, not mentioning the presence of oxygen in the air, although they are well aware that the latter was no less indispensable for the fire to occur. We argue that the extant literature on causal selection has so far operated on the implicit premise that the only relevant variables for causal selection are individual variables, corresponding to distinct nodes in the relevant network of causes. Ours is the first systematic study of plural causes in the context of causal selection. First, we establish by means of two behavioral experiments the psychological reality and non- triviality of plural causes, ruling out potential deflationary explanations. Second, we show that state-of-the-art models of causal selection based on counterfactual dependence can be extended to make non-trivial predictions about plural causes consistent with our experimental findings. Third, we show that surprising logical properties of plurals in natural language interpretation can be found in causal reasoning with plural causes. We argue that the mental representations involved in causal-selection judgments show marks of the representations formal semanticists have proposed for plurals in natural language.",

          "abstract": "Teacher retention in England continues to be in a state of decline with early career teachers (ECTs) most at risk of leaving the profession. High attrition rates create an unstable and unsustainable workforce which negatively affects the educational development of young people. The purpose of this paper was to explore the career-related push and pull factors for ECTs in England. The paper also explores the way in which ECTs’ experiences shape career decision-making, and the extent to which their motivational needs are being met. Previous studies have considered workplace retention; however, little is known about the motivational needs and perspectives of ECTs. This paper explores the experiences of 20 ECTs in state-funded primary, secondary and special schools in England. All participants had less than five years teaching experience and were selected through purposive sampling. Participants took part in semi-structured online interviews with data analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were constructed from the data: Complexity, Belonging, Emotional Impact, Professional Identity and Relentlessness. Findings show that these themes are interrelated and combine to create a clear ‘tipping point’ where ECTs begin to find the job unmanageable. From a motivation perspective, we found that autonomous motivation reduces quitting intentions and that the need for relatedness and positive professional identities are particularly important for retaining teachers in the first five years of their careers.",

In Study 1, we found that seeing scientists as higher in intellectual humility was associated with greater perceived trustworthiness of scientists and support for science-based beliefs. We then demonstrated that describing a scientist as high (vs. low) in intellectual humility increased perceived trustworthiness of the scientist (Studies 2-4), belief in their research (Studies 2-4), intentions to follow their research-based recommendations (Study 3), and information-seeking behavior (Study 4). We further demonstrated that these effects were not moderated by the scientist’s gender (Study 3) or race/ethnicity (Study 4). In Study 5, we experimentally tested communication approaches scientists can use to convey intellectual humility. These studies reveal the benefits of seeing scientists as intellectually humble across medical, psychological, and climate science topics.",

          "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an existential threat to humanity, yet public awareness remains low. An underexplored tool for AMR risk communication is metaphor. By inviting a comparison between abstract and familiar concepts, metaphors can make complex health information more accessible. However, metaphor use in the context of AMR has been haphazard and remains poorly understood. We address this issue by providing an integrative content analysis of metaphor use in global, English-language, public AMR discourse. Four types of public sources were searched: (1) websites of 71 non-profit organisations, (2) national AMR action plans from 84 countries, (3) 819 international newspaper articles and (4) 2,616 social media posts. Across all sources, 2,149 metaphors excerpts were extracted. Qualitative content analysis identified 41 distinct metaphor themes, but 75% of metaphors fell into one of four themes: “War against resistance, infections and microbes”, “Heroes and villains of resistance”, “Post-antibiotic apocalypse and looming crisis of AMR”, and “Silent, creeping threat of AMR”. All key themes are inapt or theoretically problematic by painting a misleading picture of a finite struggle between good and evil, which does not match the ecological reality of a continuously evolving challenge. Furthermore, most existing metaphors are highly conventional and emotive. They aim to raise general awareness about AMR without conferring specific knowledge. Our findings call for an urgent re-framing. Media, policy makers and health officials should choose theoretically informed, apt and novel explanatory metaphors that are specific to the context of AMR and challenge public misunderstandings with the potential to prompt behaviour change.",

We model classes in a dataset of emotional responses to the pandemic using latent class trajectory analysis on a panel dataset of UK-based participants. Participants (n=868) rated eight emotions on a nine-point Likert scale in April of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, and provided demographic variables, data on perceived social support and the impact of life events. Using a latent class trajectory analysis, we found evidence for six distinct latent trajectory classes: 68.3% of individuals belonged to classes with a pattern of well-coping (decreasing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions) while the remainder showed patterns of poor adjustment. Social support and negative life events were predictive of class membership in a multinomial logistic regression: low social support and experiencing negative life events increased the probability of participants belonging to poorly adjusted classes. Our study suggests that most individuals – over the period of four years - were able to adjust well to the pandemic, while a about one third of individuals struggled considerably. Social support may be of interest as a protective factor and could aid policy makers during future crises.",

Empirical research to date shows no consensus on the causal effects of SMU on well-being.

After a 2-week baseline phase, participants (Mage = 21.42 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental (N = 35) or a passive control (N = 32) condition. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to limit their SMU to a maximum of 30 minutes (divided across their preferred apps) per day for 2 consecutive weeks, while participants in the control condition were instructed to continue their SMU as usual. After the intervention phase, participants in both conditions were followed up for 2 weeks during which all restrictions were removed. During the experiment, participants reported on their self-esteem, mindfulness, sleep, and emotional well-being. Results indicate a main effect of time for most outcomes, but induced SMU restriction did not moderate these effects.

          "abstract": "The speech-to-song illusion is a phenomenon in which the continuous repetition of a spoken\nutterance induces the listeners to perceive it as more song-like. Thus far, this perceptual\ntransformation has been observed in mostly European languages, such as English; however,\nit is unclear whether the illusion is experienced by speakers of Bangla (Bengali), an\nIndo-Aryan language. The current study, therefore, investigates the illusion in 28 Bangla-\nand 31 English-speaking participants. The experiment consisted of a listening task in\nwhich participants were asked to rate their perception of repeating short speech stimuli on\na scale from 1 − 5, where 1 = \"sounds like speech\" and 5 = \"sounds like song\". The stimuli\nwere composed of English and Bangla utterances produced by two bilingual speakers. To\naccount for possible group differences in music engagement, participants self-reported\nmusical experience and also performed a rhythm discrimination task as an objective\nmeasure of non-verbal auditory sequence processing. Stimulus ratings were analysed with\ncumulative link mixed modelling. Overall, English- and Bangla-speaking participants rated\nthe stimuli similarly and, in both groups, better performance in the rhythm discrimination\ntask significantly predicted more song-like ratings beyond self-reported musical experience.\nEnglish speakers rated Bangla stimuli as significantly more song-like than English stimuli.\nBangla speakers did not distinguish between English and Bangla stimuli–possibly reflecting\ntheir enhanced understanding of English, in comparison to the English participants’\ncomprehension of Bangla. An exploratory acoustic analysis revealed a role of harmonic\nratio in the illusion for both language groups. These results demonstrate that the\nspeech-to-song-illusion occurs for Bangla speakers to a similar extent as English speakers\nand that, across both groups, sensitivity to non-verbal auditory structure is positively\ncorrelated with susceptibility to this perceptual transformation.",

At the core of the model is a dynamic retrieval process incorporating two essential mechanisms: iterative retrieval, whereby information is sequentially sampled from memory to access the full history of experiences; and competitive retrieval, whereby the most prominent features in memory inhibit the recollection of other features. Together with context-based encoding, the model quantitatively explains well-known facts about response order and inter-response times in recall experiments. We show that our retrieval process maps closely to existing decision frameworks, such as drift-diffusion models, suggesting that the memory system plays a fundamental role in a wide-ranging set of decision-making settings.",

Much existing work has focused on testing the capabilities of the models. However, it is unknown how people themselves conceive of artificial intelligence technology's putative knowledge or attitudes, and of how they differ from the mental states of humans. By exploring how people interrogate systems to decide whether they are natural or artificial, we show that people fail to spot large language model output most of the time, except for answers to factual questions. We found people systematically overestimate the use of personal questions in a Turing test. However, people are sensitive to brusque, cynical tone, slang and perceived idiosyncrasy as cues to natural human output. Despite claims the Turing test is becoming obsolete, we argue it endures as a probe of evolving lay intuitions about artificial intelligence and a way to track theory of mind expanding to encompass different sorts of mind. Our results shed light on what people think separates humans from machines and may guide later models to detect authorship of text online.",

          "abstract": "Counterfactual learning, which refers to learning from what could have happened under different circumstances, is crucial for understanding decision-making in humans. Recent studies have well characterized the computational and neural processes underlying this aspect of learning. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of attentional allocation towards the different alternatives faced by individuals, and their consequences. The present study explores the role of gaze and pupil dilation as potential indicators of counterfactual thinking during reinforcement learning tasks. By examining how these physiological measures correlate with the cognitive processes involved in evaluating both experienced and forgone outcomes, the research provides insights into the complex dynamics of human counterfactual learning. We recorded the gaze and pupil size of 36 participants engaged in a computer-based 2-arm bandit task with full information. The participants faced scenarios where they made choices and were then shown both the actual outcomes and hypothetical outcomes of unchosen options. While the overall pattern of allocation typically involved a first fixation on the factual outcome followed by a subsequent one on the counterfactual outcome, this pattern was affected differently by both outcomes’ value. On the other hand, pupil size reflected the outcome valence of the chosen option as well as the similarity between outcomes. These findings suggest that gaze dynamics and pupil dilation serve as effective biomarkers of counterfactual processing, reflecting the cognitive load and confirmation bias associated with such processes.",

In total, 104 German twelve-month-olds (57 female) observed an established imitation task (FIT 12, Goertz et al., 2006).

          "abstract": "Purpose: While research and public debate have increasingly focused on the effects of pornography consumption, the experiences of those filmed for pornography have been largely overlooked. This study aims to address this gap by examining the vulnerabilities and health risks faced by this population. \n\nMaterials and methods: Individuals aged 18 and older filmed for pornography in Sweden were recruited to participate in face-to-face interviews. A total of 120 participants completed a combination of study-specific questions and standardized questionnaires on their background, experiences in pornography, and health status. Descriptive statistics were reported, and a regression analysis was performed to assess factors impacting PTSD severity. \n\nResults: Participants reported high levels of abuse both in childhood and during pornography production. Nearly all participants had experienced sexual abuse (88%), psychological abuse (90%), and physical abuse (79%) as children. This pattern of victimization continued into their involvement in pornography, where they were subjected to further abuse and exploitation, including verbal abuse (87%), rape (65%), physical assault (56%), third-party control (56%), and online harassment (57%). The consequences of this continuous polyvictimization were significant: 83% exhibited clinically significant PTSD, 69% had attempted suicide, and 80% had been diagnosed with at least one mental health problem. Our regression analysis found that childhood abuse, third-party control, and online violence were significant predictors of PTSD severity. \n\nConclusions: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive legal, social, and mental health interventions to protect this highly vulnerable population and address the unique harms stemming from being documented in pornography.",

Through the aggregation of shopping data from 20,550,952 customers of a UK-based pharmacy chain, we calculated behavioural entropy values within each local authority area in the country, subsequently correlating them with personality traits, socioeconomic indicators, and the 2016 European Union referendum outcomes. Our results validate the utility of ‘shopping entropy’ as an operationalisable proxy for the Big Five trait Openness, indicative of individuals’ propensity for embracing varied experiences. Moreover, we established the predictive capacity of entropy regarding the UK Brexit referendum’s results and voter turnout, highlighting the coherence between stable individual inclinations manifested in everyday shopping behaviours and tangible sociopolitical decisions.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive dissonance, a fundamental psychological process involving inconsistent cognitions causing discomfort, may vary across cultures. These variations could be attributed to differences in the way people define themselves, known as “self-construal”. Previous cross-cultural studies on the role of self-construal in cognitive dissonance have mainly employed the free-choice paradigm. However, many concerns have been raised about the validity of this procedure and these studies, more generally. To address this issue, we will conduct secondary analyses to explore unexamined associations in a large existing dataset (Vaidis et al., 2024). Specifically, the current study will investigate the moderating role of individual (self-construal) and cultural (individualism) variables on dissonance effects following an induced-compliance paradigm across 18 countries (N = 3822). Based on the literature, we hypothesised that induced-compliance effects (i.e., adjusting attitude to match behaviour, particularly when it has been adopted freely) will be stronger for participants with higher individual self-construal scores (H1), in more individualistic countries (H2), and in countries with higher aggregated levels of independent self-construal (H3). The analyses [supported / did not support] H1,  [supported / did not support] H2 and [supported / did not support] H3.\n\nKeywords: Self-Construal, Culture, Cognitive Dissonance, Induced Compliance, Cross-cultural study",

          "abstract": "Memory precision varies along the hippocampal long axis in the mature brain. Yet, little is known about how developmental change in long-axis functionality influences this precision. We characterized how children and adults engage the hippocampal long axis to form precise memories. Children (7-9 years) and adults performed two tasks that encouraged an orientation to the specific details versus broader category of scenes during encoding. They then performed a recognition test with studied scenes and similar lures. Adults had more precise memories than children, in that they were better able to discriminate studied scenes from lures; yet, both age groups benefited from orienting to specifics. Examining hippocampal engagement during both tasks showed a developmental shift from posterior to anterior hippocampus during specific encoding. Subregion engagement was also differently related to memory quality in children versus adults: While posterior hippocampus supported subsequent memory across age groups, both anterior and posterior hippocampus showed developmental differences in their link to false memories. Individual differences in the source of specific encoding along the long axis revealed that premature shifts towards an adult-like profile were disadvantageous to children’s memory. Our results suggest as development unfolds, refinements to both anterior and posterior subregion functionality supports memory imprecision.",

          "authors": "Björn Jörges; Laurence Harris",
          "abstract": "For many years the accepted wisdom in vision science has been that humans tend to underestimate the speed of an object when they pursue it with their gaze in comparison to when they fixate a spot in the visual scene and the object moves across the retina, an effect that is referred to as the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. However, experiments on the Aubert-Fleischl effect have generally employed a target moving in front of a blank background. For objects moving in the real world, relative motion between the object and the background provides additional cues, potentially allowing the visual system to compensate for the Aubert-Fleischl phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we asked 50 participants to compare the speed of a single sphere to the speed of a sphere-cloud in a two-interval forced-choice task while they either followed the single sphere with their gaze or kept their eyes on a fixation cross. Stimuli were presented in virtual reality and the sphere’s movement could occur either in a completely black environment with no relative motion cues present, or against a visible, textured background behind the moving sphere. The probe sphere-cloud always moved in darkness. In a large data set (n = 50), we found no evidence for an Aubert-Fleischl effect, i.e., no evidence for an underestimation of speed during pursuit, in either of the environments. We report some evidence for an inversion of the Aubert-Fleischl effect, in which the tracked sphere appeared to move faster when pursued, particularly when relative motion was present. Our results challenge the prevailing notion that object speed is underestimated when the object is pursued versus when fixation is maintained and highlights the necessity to take into account characteristics of the visual scene.",

          "authors": "Florian Ismael Seitz; Rebecca Albrecht; Bettina von Helversen; Jörg Rieskamp; Agnes Rosner",
          "abstract": "Quantitative judgments have been suggested to result from a mixture of similarity- and rule-based processing. People can judge an object’s criterion value based on the object’s similarity to previously experienced exemplars and based on a rule that integrates the object’s cues like a linear regression. In order to better understand these processes, the present work combines cognitive modeling and eye tracking and tests whether people who rely more on the similarity to exemplars also look more at the exemplar locations on the screen. In two eye tracking studies, participants learned to assign each of four exemplars to a different screen corner and criterion value and then judged the criterion value of briefly presented test stimuli. Eye tracking measured participants’ gazes to the now empty exemplar locations (a phenomenon called looking-at-nothing); cognitive modeling of the test phase judgments quantified participants’ reliance on a similarity- over a rule-based process. Participants showed more similarity usage and more looking-at-nothing in the study in which the cues were linked to the criterion by a multiplicative function than in the study with an additive cue-criterion link. Focusing on the study with a multiplicative environment, participants relying more on the similarity to exemplars also showed more looking-at-nothing (τ = 0.25, p = .01). Within trials, looking-at-nothing was usually directed at the one exemplar that was most similar to the test stimulus. These results show that a multi-method approach combining process tracing and cognitive modeling can provide mutually supportive insights into the processes underlying higher-order cognition.",

However, some critical lingering questions and methodological inconsistencies leave it unclear what aspects of brain health are affected by exercise and video gaming, if any at all. In a global online study of over 1000 people, we collected data about participants' physical activity levels, time spent playing video games, mental health, and cognitive performance using tests of short-term memory, verbal abilities, and reasoning skills from the Creyos battery. The amount of regular physical activity was not significantly related to any measure of cognitive performance; however, more physical activity was associated with better mental health as indexed using the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 screeners for depression and anxiety. Conversely, we found that more time spent playing video games was associated with better cognitive performance but was unrelated to mental health. We conclude that exercise and video gaming have differential effects on the brain, which may help individuals tailor their lifestyle choices to promote mental and cognitive health, respectively, across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "Memories are always encoded within an environmental context. Autobiographical memories, also known as memories of everyday life events, may be particularly connected to the environment in which they took place due to the incorporation of context into other memory features (e.g., people, activity, emotion). However, little is known about how the relationship between an autobiographical memory and its context changes throughout the course of memory consolidation. One theory proposes that during consolidation, autobiographical memories are decontextualized and integrated into existing memory networks. In line with this theory, we predicted that remote memories would be less context-dependent than recent memories. In the current study, 353 participants recalled two recent episodic (within last two weeks) and two remote episodic (1.5 – 2.5 years old) autobiographical memories. They were then tested on novel measures of context-dependency and memory integration. Contrary to our predictions, we found that remote memories were more context-dependent, such that they were more difficult to imagine in a new location and would be more changed if imagined in a new location. Additionally, the locations listed for remote memories had a wider spatial scale compared to recent memories. One explanation for these results might be that remote memories are more difficult to imagine in a new location due to their wider spatial scale. However, spatial scale did not mediate the relationship between age and context-dependency. We conclude that rather than a linear decrease in context-dependency, autobiographical memories that remain episodic both have wider spatial scales and are more context-dependent.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive bias and lateralization/motor bias tests have been used to indicate animal affective state and welfare, particularly in dogs. This study examined the relationship between cognitive and motor bias in dogs tested in their homes, where any negative impacts of testing stress might be minimized. Motor bias was tested using the typical Kong Classic™ toy, as well as a novel toy for which paw touches generated movement- the Kong Wobbler™.  Beagles and huskies were trained to associate two bowl positions with reward or no reward. Cognitive bias was assessed by relative latency to approach a third bowl (ambiguous) position. Beagles had a significantly higher positive expectancy score (PES) than huskies, indicating they treated the ambiguous position similar to the rewarded position (i.e., positive affect). However, the latency of the huskies, but not the beagles, to the ambiguous bowl position increased over test trials, possibly indicating that the breeds treated the non-rewarded test trials differently. In the motor bias test,  the Kong Wobbler™ generated a higher rate of paw touches, with no significant differences in the direction or strength of motor bias compared to the KONG Classic™. However, our timed approach to the paw touch tests (vs. a required number of paw touches) did not reveal statistically significant lateralization in the dogs. Despite this, there was a significant correlation between affect and direction of lateralization; dogs who preferentially used their left paw during the Kong Wobbler™ test had lower PES. These results suggest that small methodological changes (home testing, Kong Wobbler™) hold promise for future research and that more consideration of breed effects in the interpretation of cognitive bias test results are warranted.",

          "abstract": "Intergroup bias can take many forms and one conceptualization examines intergroup bias on a regional level, aggregating individual data to quantify county-, state-, or country-level bias. Regional intergroup bias manifests in a systemic manner, and as such, regional bias predicts detrimental regional outcomes and structural disparities that may be difficult to study on the individual level. In the present research, we conducted a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between regional intergroup bias and various discriminatory outcomes, from racially biased traffic stops to disparities in employment for disabled people to health disparities for marginalized groups. In examining multiple types of bias against lower status groups, we found evidence for the relationship between regional intergroup bias and discrimination in various forms. This work furthers understanding of regional intergroup bias as a form of structural bias that predicts structural disparities. By studying regional intergroup bias, we gain a stronger understanding of how people may influence the bias of a region, and how regional biases may have devastating outcomes for marginalized groups in those regions.",

However, there is a major lack of evidence on chronic offending in low and middle-income countries; understanding these patterns is especially important in settings with very high levels of violence, like Brazil.\nAims: To identify the extent that crime is concentrated in chronic offenders and linked to violence and homicide in a Brazilian cohort. \nMethods: The 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort includes 5,623 participants followed from birth in 1982 with complete crime records up to age 30. Chronic offenders were defined as individuals who committed five or more offences and over 50% of all crimes. Key offending characteristics including age of onset, violent and homicide offending, and incarceration rates were compared across three offender groups (one-timers, below-chronic, and chronic offenders).\nResults: Approximately 27% of participants committed at least one crime by age 30, and 5% were chronic offenders who were responsible for 57% of all crimes, 54% of violent crimes, and 68% of homicides. Chronic offenders exhibited more severe patterns of offending on all characteristics examined, compared to non-chronic offenders. Homicides committed by chronic offenders were more likely to involve firearms than those by non-chronic offenders.\nDiscussion: This is the first study to analyze chronic offending within a large, prospective cohort in a low and middle-income country. Chronic offending patterns in this Brazilian setting resemble those in high-income country studies, and are highly related to homicides.",

          "abstract": "We attempted to replicate previous findings of rising heritability and declining shared environmental influence on intelligence across development using the Twins Early Development Study—a large, longitudinal sample of British twins. Two longitudinal twin models (a Cholesky and Simplex model) were fitted to 9 waves of cognitive test data for 10,535 twin pairs. Heritability rose significantly from 24% at age 2 to 48-52% at age 16. Concurrently, shared environmental influence declined significantly from 65% to 9-13%. Moreover, nonshared environmental influences also increased significantly, rising from 11% to 39-40%. \n\nIn early childhood, developmental gains in heritability were explained by the emergence of new genetic influences. In later childhood and adolescence, gains in heritability were explained by the continued emergence of new genetic influences but also the amplification of pre-existing genetic influences. This evidence for genetic amplification suggests that active gene-environment correlation is partly responsible for gains in heritability later in development. Shared environmental influence declined across development because pre-existing environmental influences decayed between waves faster than new environmental influences accumulated. Lastly, the rise in nonshared environmental influence was principally explained by age-specific environmental effects that increased in magnitude across development.",

          "authors": "Orestis Zavlis",
          "abstract": "Despite almost a century of empirical research, the concept of personality disorder remains poorly understood and incredibly stigmatized. In this paper, I argue that most of the controversies and unresolved mysteries surrounding personality pathology can be traced back to a cognitive bias that I term the illusion of personality (pathology): our natural tendency to view most individual differences as personality differences (and their deviations from the norm as personality problems). I begin by illustrating how this illusion leads to the paradoxical, yet logical, conclusion that all mental disorders are personality disorders (an outcome that was a reality back in the 1900s). I then demonstrate how we can move beyond this illusion by defining each individual difference according to its predominant psychological theme (e.g., neuroticism as an ‘emotional’ trait) rather than by washing away that theme with the term ‘personality’ (i.e., neuroticism as a ‘personality’ trait). Subsequently, I apply this way of thinking to various personality constructs, including the five-factor traits, the self-other impairments of ‘personality disorder,’ and related social-cognitive disturbances, showing that all personality constructs that account for the development, maintenance, and treatment of personality disorder are all relational. On that basis, I argue that disorders of ‘personality’ can be respecified as disorders of ‘relationships,’ before concluding the paper with a set of suggestions on how we can move away from the illusory concept of ‘personality disorder’ and toward the more specific (and perhaps also humane) idea of ‘relational disorder.’",

While DCD and ADHD are considered separate conditions, their commonalities create challenges for differential diagnosis and support. Therefore, this preregistered broad-spanning scoping review includes systematic literature searches to summarize all available studies on DCD and/or ADHD. N = 68 articles were classified into the following categories: (i) neuroimaging, (ii) genetic and twin studies, (iii) methylphenidate, (iv) cognition, (v) motor skills, (vi) physical activity and physical therapy, (vii) perception, sensory processing, and visuomotor integration, (viii) psychosocial factors and wellbeing, and (ix) symptom presence and management. Most studies included samples under 18 years old and almost no studies were replicated. Common themes supported that individuals with co-occurring DCD and ADHD have more difficulties than those with one condition. While we found numerous neural and functional overlaps between DCD and ADHD, several features consistently differentiated the conditions, e.g., sensorimotor difficulties in DCD. Thus, we conclude that DCD and ADHD are similar conditions with a few differential features, however, co-occurring DCD+ADHD has unique burdens not observed in either condition alone. Extensive replication is needed to determine the precursors, stability, and changeability of DCD and/or ADHD.",

          "authors": "Mike W.-L. Cheung",
          "abstract": "There are various statistical models with different features and assumptions in meta-analysis. Popular models are, for example, the fixed-effect (or common effect), random-effects, and mixed-effects models. Apart from these models, several alternative models, such as the multiplicative error model (unrestricted weighted least squares model), the hybrid of additive and multiplicative error models, and the location-scale model, have been proposed in the literature. Understanding these models can be challenging for researchers without a solid mathematical background. Implementing or modifying these models is even more challenging for researchers unless they have advanced statistical and programming knowledge. This tutorial elucidates a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework to understand these models. Several R packages are introduced to facilitate the\nspecifications and generation of graphical models for these meta-analytic models. More importantly, researchers may use the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation method to fit these models. This holds significant potential across two domains. First, it can be used as an educational tool in teaching and learning meta-analytic models. Second, the framework supports developing and evaluating novel meta-analytical models,\nwhich have not yet been implemented in current meta-analysis software, fostering advancements in meta-analytic methods. This tutorial also demonstrates with three real datasets how to extend it to address research questions involving complicated meta-analytic models, including nonlinear models, multivariate meta-analysis, and meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM). Limitations and future directions to extend the SEM-based meta-analysis are discussed.",

Por otro lado, se halló una correlación positiva entre la escala total y el ingreso de los participantes (Rho = 0.148, p = 0.034).\nPalabras claves: psicometría, hipocresía, escala, psicología social, disonancia\n\nHypocrisy is defined as the feigning of qualities or feelings contrary to those experienced. The components, according to the literature, for assessing behavior are: intent to deceive, weakness of will, degree of discrepancy between attitude and behavior, whether the attitude is publicly declared, and the nature and severity of the consequences of behavior. The purpose is to develop the Cruz-López Hypocrisy Scale (EHCL) as an instrument to measure how hypocritical a person can be. The sample consisted of 207 Puerto Rican adults. The instrument demonstrated adequate internal consistency. Inverse relationships were found between the totality of the scale and sexual orientation (Rho = -0.219, p = 0.002) and religious belief (Rho = -0.228, p &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, a positive correlation was found between the total scale and the income of the participants (Rho = 0.148, p = 0.034).\nKeywords: psychometrics, hypocrisy, scale, social psychology, dissonance",

There are a lack of longitudinal studies measuring the naturalistic development of PTSD and alcohol use problems in individuals with recent trauma exposure. This study aimed to compare the temporal relationships between posttraumatic stress symptoms and alcohol use over six months following trauma exposure in males and females. \n\nDesign: Large-scale longitudinal observational emergency department (ED)-based study of individuals with recent trauma exposure. \n\nSetting: Twenty-nine EDs across the United States. \n\nParticipants: Individuals with recent trauma exposure (n=2942, 62% female) were recruited from EDs within 72 hours of trauma exposure between 2017 to 2021. \nMeasurements: PTSD symptoms, measured via the PTSD Checklist for the DSM-5, and alcohol use was measured via the PhenX toolkit, were assessed at five time points: ED visit, 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months following trauma.\n\nFindings: PTSD symptoms predicted lower future alcohol use between the pre-trauma to 2-week timepoints (b=-0.08, p=0.01) and higher use between the 3 to 6-month timepoints (b=0.06, p=0.01). There were no timepoints in which alcohol use predicted future PTSD symptoms. When stratifying by sex, male participants showed reciprocal associations, with alcohol use early after trauma predicting PTSD symptoms between 2 to 8 weeks (b=0.08, p=0.01), while PTSD symptoms predicted alcohol use between the 3 to 6-month timepoints (b=0.10, p=0.01). Female participants showed a different reciprocal pattern, with pre-trauma PTSD symptoms predicting lower alcohol use 2 weeks post-trauma (b=-0.08, p=0.04), while alcohol use subsequently predicted greater PTSD symptoms from 8 weeks to 3 months (b=0.04, p=0.04).\n\nConclusions: Males and females exhibit complex temporal development patterns of PTSD symptoms and alcohol use that align with the mutual maintenance hypothesis in men but the susceptibility hypothesis in females. These patterns are masked in analyses that do not stratify by sex.",

          "abstract": "Reliable measures are necessary for successful research studies, with unreliable measures significantly reducing the internal validity of studies when they are used. To combat this, measures are often developed using complex techniques, and ensuring they are reliable is of paramount importance. Despite this, reliability, is always estimated at the mean and assumed to be consistent across the distribution, but heterogeneity in this reliability may exist based on the portion of the distribution analyzed, with reliability differing when the measure is given to low, average, or high achievers. To address this, the present study focuses on the development of a novel method for estimating quantile-sensitive heterogeneity in reliability. This method was then applied to a set of measures from a publicly available dataset and was applied to both item-level and sum-score data, highlighting the flexibility of the approach. Results of the study found that the newly developed approach was effective in detecting the presence of heterogeneous reliability, finding statistically significant differences between the reliability at the lowest versus the highest quantiles within one of the measures tested.",

However, less is known about whether scene consistency can also affect the processing of finer object features, such as the state of an object (e.g., the angle of a swiss army knife or the fill level of a bottle). Therefore across three experiments, we presented a subset of the JURICS stimulus set, where each object exists in 20 continuously varying states (e.g., from fully closed to fully open) in scenes that were either contextually consistent or inconsistent. Participants were asked to report the specific state of the object using a continuous report task. Our results showed that scene consistency enhanced the precision of state judgments, i.e. participants made significantly larger errors in reporting object states when objects were presented in inconsistent compared to consistent scenes. These findings suggest that scene context exhibits its effect already on the fine-grained perceptual processing of objects, affecting not only object categorization but the accuracy of its perceived features.",

          "abstract": "Positive emotions have important functions related to intra- and interindividual flourishing and well-being. At the turn of the century the interest in distinct positive emotions and their importance has skyrocketed due to the positive psychology movement. Since then, researchers have explored positive emotions beyond the category of happiness and research programs revolving around concepts such as awe or gratitude have been established. Navigating the field of positive emotions has become complicated though as many different taxonomies or conceptualizations of distinct positive emotions have been suggested. In the current project we review the theoretical and empirical literature on distinct positive emotions, investigating how many positive emotions can be distinguished, to what degree they overlap, and what higher order dimensions or categories can account for them. Focusing on 1,463 journal articles published across the last two decades, we identified 13,827 instances theorizing, mentioning, or measuring positive emotions and 170 different concepts employed. Narrowing down this list, 63 experts in emotion research rated the 48 most frequently investigated concepts regarding their conceptual similarity. Based on these results, we propose an integrative taxonomy of 28 positive emotions, forming six different superordinate categories or families that are based on the two dimensions of arousal and sociality. We identify challenges associated with research on positive emotions and provide suggestions on how to move the field forward from a theoretical and methodological perspective.",

          "abstract": "Sports are in many ways ideal for an expert performance approach. The skills needed are rich and complex, yet displayed in tightly constrained tasks that can be isolated and simplified for experimental control and analysis. Well-defined goals enable objective and precise performance evaluation, and participants are already highly practiced on representative tasks from their domain, and motivated to perform well. \n\nModern technology allows collection of large quantities of rich physiological and behavioral data, even in naturalistic settings. Indeed, the challenge often lies more in interpretation of the results and avoiding information overload, than the technical challenge of obtaining accurate measurements. Performance metrics that can summarize large quantities of data are therefore of both theoretical and applied interest; to the basic researcher they parametrize complex behavior into more elementary and interpretable components, to the practitioner they pinpoint aspects of technique to evaluate and improve. This paper discusses some foundational issues in the development of such metrics for high-speed sports, where human performance can be observed at the limit of physiological and information processing capacity. \n\nWe first define high-speed sports, make a logical distinction between criterion differentiator and proxy metrics, and discuss identifying expert performance directly in terms of performance parameters. We then illustrate three general problems - and how to deal with them - using concrete examples from the openly available IMSRace data set:\n\n(1) Extreme events. How to deal with fat tailed performance distributions, a characteristic of high-speed sport even at the expert level? \n\n(2) Expert superiority. How good does one need to be, to be an \"expert\"? We suggest that a Magnitude Based (physical) rather than Deviation based (statistical) approach is to be preferred in high-speed sport.\n\n(3) Dissecting performance. How to find predictors for performance for individuals with vastly different levels of skill? We discuss distribution asymmetries and ceiling effects.\n\nThe topic is of interest to experimental researchers on high-speed sports expertise, and expertise in related fields. Coaches, performance engineers and other practitioners may also gain insights from a more fundamental approach to performance data and its analysis.",

          "abstract": "Research on the diagnostic performance of radiologists using AI decision support system often relies on basic AUC comparison of AI use and non-AI use to draw conclusions about clinical decision-making, with known limitations. We re-evaluated a real-world dataset of radiologist use of AI across 127 pathologies and 1,163 cases to compare diagnoses in the face of four types of AI response: true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative. To corroborate our results with insights from cognitive psychology we use Signal Detection Theory, a model of decision-making, to better understand the impact of AI on clinical decisions. Finally, we simulate our results in the context of a wider healthcare clinic to envision these changes on a grander scale. Our results revealed important insights; with increased disease detection (higher sensitivity) at the cost of more false positives (lower specificity) and increased homogeneity of decision making amongst clinicians whose diagnoses are typically highly varied. Although usually considered a positive property, we warn that homogenisation may have negative implications at a system level by homogenising incorrect diagnoses. Further, we find highly confident radiologist decisions benefit the least from AI assistance. We conclude that the effects of introducing AI in clinical practice are outside of the scale of more common changes to practice, i.e. staffing, and that introducing AI to clinics may introduce higher disease detection but also unexpected consequences.",

          "abstract": "Parents are reporting a rise in mental health concerns, particularly in parents of young children. Unfortunately, only half of those with a mental health diagnosis report accessing services, and many report that current supports do not adequately address the extent of their needs. Social determinants of health, such as economic stability and education, are related to mental health outcomes in parents and children. The World Health Organization has highlighted the need for innovative parenting interventions that support overall parental and child wellbeing. One proposed strategy is the implementation a systems navigator role which connects families to services that address social determinants related to mental health. In this study, we hosted a knowledge exchange event where frontline service workers came together to discuss the barriers and facilitators to accessing and providing quality care, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of a proposed systems navigator role embedded within an evidence-based online mental health program called Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM). Focus group discussions were analyzed using thematic analysis. Five themes emerged which inform the relevance and implementation facilitators of a successful systems navigator role: (1) Hopes for Families; (2) Barriers to Service Access and Provision; (3) Facilitators to Service Access; (4) Fit of a Systems Navigator Role; and (5) Identified Support Need. These discussions highlighted that a supportive systems navigator role should connect families to services beyond mental health care to address social determinants contributing to their overall wellbeing. Navigators should foster long-term relationships with diverse community agencies to effectively support families. Finally, providers expressed a preference towards a hybrid online and in-person systems navigator, which could function depending on the family's needs. This research is a first step to implementing a navigation role who supports families and collaborates with providers across settings.",

          "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are characterised by extreme concerns about food and weight. These concerns are linked to changes in decision-making, such as persisting with actions that are no longer rewarding. This study tested whether people with eating disorder symptoms show increased persistence due to altered decision thresholds. A group with heightened concerns about eating (ED; N=48) and a healthy control group (HC; N=56) completed a foraging task, in which an option on screen was exploited for reward. With each decision to exploit, reward feedback decreased and participants had to decide when to move on to a new option. Each block lasted 7.5 minutes. Behavioural persistence was measured as the number of seconds spent exploiting each option. Decision thresholds were measured when deciding to move on, as the counterfactual reward that would have been received for an exploit action. We predicted that the ED group would show increased persistence and decreased decision thresholds (i.e. lower counterfactual reward when deciding to move on). We found no evidence for these predictions. Instead, exploratory analyses showed that the ED group exhibited progressively faster response times (RTs) when approaching the time limit for each block. This increase in motor vigour correlated with the severity of eating disorder symptoms and total rewards earned. We discuss the potential utility of changing motor vigour as a transdiagnostic marker of ED tendencies.",

The content change of the subject angle corresponds to the structural change of the entity one by one. The change of internal structure of some complex entities can partially respond to external interaction. The change of entity structure， the corresponding change form in its subject angle is its subjective content. Even if a third-party entity can observe its change through induction， the angle change of the third-party entity and the main angle change of the entity structure cannot be exactly the same.\n2. 主体角度的唯一真实性\n主体角度的变化是对这个主体来说唯一真实的存在。两个实体在相互作用中，一个实体的主观角度来看，外界从空无产生了存在内容。这个过程中主体只能改变自身结构，主体角度的内容也是和自身结构变化一一对应。如果这个实体具有的内部结构可以对外界变化进行特征识别实现部分对应，那么其主观角度的存在内容就可以模拟相互作用中外界对其产生作用的事物。在具有显意识的动物中，这个主体角度的变化就是显意识。\n主体角度内容和所谓的第三方客观角度内容不同，因为第三方客观角度是抽象出来的一种对真实实体的抽象模拟形象，并不是真实实体的绝对客观形象，每个真实实体都具有无限多的角度形象，所以相当于是无形的。\n主体角度内容是实体能感应到的唯一真实存在，只是其客观对应的是自身的结构，如果模拟外界事物那就不是客观的了。\n3. 主体角度的非空间性\n所谓的客观空间只是一种对外部世界的抽象模型中的基础理解框架。这种世界抽象模型具有日常实践有效性，因此被认为是真实的。但是，主体角度对外界的一切内容都是模拟的，主体角度只代表自身的感觉。\n一些复杂的实体，通过视觉和触觉这种相互作用方式，根据长期互动积累的经验将自身感受状态映射为外界事物形象，以此形成所谓的客观世界。这个客观世界所具有的空间性，来自于思维对变化视觉景象和触觉变化存在一致性的抽象，这种抽象模型通过三个空间维度来解释外界变化，在一般的互动中非常有效，所以就被当做是真相。\n一切所谓的世界模型都是基于主体角度，对真实的无限维度本体进行模拟，所得到内容都是不真实的。主体角度只能对应自身变化，外界世界都是对变化建立的世界模型。",

Most research on this topic has focused on the first three to four years of life because this is a critical period for developing connections between the gut microbiome and the brain. Prior research has identified associations between variability in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in infancy and markers of temperamental risk for psychopathology, including negative affect. However, the specific microbes affected, and the directionality of these associations have differed between studies, likely due to differences in the developmental period of focus and assessment approaches. In the current preregistered study, we examined connections between the gut microbiome, assessed at two time points in infancy (2 weeks and 18 months of age), and negative affect measured at 30 months of age in a longitudinal study of infants and their caregivers. We found that infants with higher gut microbiome diversity and Veillonella abundance at 2 weeks of age, and higher Ruthenibacterium abundance at 18 months, showed more observed negative affect during a study visit at 30 months. These results suggest timing-specific associations between the gut microbiome and negative affect even within this early critical period.",

          "abstract": "Technological cognition—the capacity of humans to generate and interact with technology—emerges from the interplay of multiple neurocognitive systems. This perspective article proposes an integrated model grounded in physical understanding, synthesizing recent advances in cognitive neuroscience. We argue that technological cognition arises from the coordination of semantic knowledge, technical reasoning, visuospatial and motor skills, and social cognition. Key brain regions implicated include the parietal lobes—particularly the superior and inferior parietal cortices—the inferior frontal gyrus, and the temporal lobes. These areas support functions ranging from tool use and mechanical problem-solving to conceptual understanding and social learning. We suggest that technological artefacts not only reflect but also extend human cognitive capacities, forming a dynamic exchange between individual cognition and the environment. This integrated approach may have significant implications for clinical practice, education, and policy, offering potential pathways for novel diagnostic technologies and inclusive innovation. We advocate for interdisciplinary research to further elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underpinning technological cognition and to explore how different technologies may engage distinct cognitive processes and neural pathways. Understanding these mechanisms may foster a society better equipped to handle future challenges, ensuring that technological progress remains a shared human endeavor.",

          "abstract": "Background and Hypothesis\nEmployment discrimination against people living with psychosis is well established, with implications for their quality of life. However, a meta-analysis of studies exploring this link has not yet been conducted. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify employer attitudes and potential discrimination towards people living with psychosis.\n\nStudy Design\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining employer attitudes and hiring practices towards individuals with psychosis was conducted. Electronic databases were searched from inception to July 15, 2024. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on six studies meeting our inclusion criteria.\n\n\nStudy Results\nStudies included in the systematic review consistently found that employers view individuals with psychosis as less employable compared to those with other health conditions or no disabilities. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant medium to large pooled effect size (Hedges g) of 0.57 (95% CI [0.21 to 0.94], p = 0.010), indicating statistically significant discrimination. Subgroup analysis estimated that 76.00% (95% CI [62.90% to 89.09%], p &lt;0.001) of employers expressed negative attitudes towards hiring individuals with psychosis.\n\nConclusions\nThis first meta-analysis on the topic reveals statistically significant (p = 0.010) employer discrimination towards individuals with psychosis, contributing to poor employment outcomes. Findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address misconceptions and promote inclusive hiring practices. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating strategies to reduce workplace stigma and improve employment outcomes for people living with psychosis, potentially through adaptations of evidence-based supported employment models such as Individual Placement and Support (IPS).",

Although frequently seen as a dichotomy, entrepreneurs and managers share responsibilities for building and sustaining a business, and hence, this could also be studied as a spectrum. Previous research has individually examined specific aspects of entrepreneurial (vs managerial) work, but limited studies have examined their effects holistically. Using a wide range of survey instruments, we took an exploratory data-driven approach to explore the entrepreneurial-managerial spectrum. Exploratory factor analysis revealed five latent factors driving variance in our data: Negative Emotions, Fulfillment &amp; Support, Creative Capacity, Collaborative Personality, and Decision-Making Avoidance &amp; Hypervigilance. When explored as a traditional dichotomy, our results found that entrepreneurs scored lower than managers in Decision-Making Avoidance &amp; Hypervigilance and Collaborative Personality. On the other hand, as a spectrum, data suggested an increase in Creative Capacity and a decrease in Decision-Making Avoidance &amp; Hypervigilance with increasing entrepreneurial experience. Emotional health and career success remained similar across groups. Overall, we explored the complex profile of entrepreneurs and managers as a step towards understanding the dynamic and unique combination of personality, cognition, emotional health, and demographics across the entrepreneurial-managerial spectrum.",

This study examined the relationship between these individual differences and long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Externally learned values are acquired through externally guided decision making (EDM), in which feedback confirms decision accuracy, whereas intrinsically learned values are acquired through internally guided decision making (IDM), based solely on personal preferences without feedback. The participants learned the value of the four stimuli in an EDM task, and subsequently performed an IDM task with these learned stimuli and 11 new stimuli. Resting-state EEG signals were recorded before and after both the tasks. The results indicated that individuals with a higher alpha-range LRTC prioritize intrinsically learned values over externally learned values in the IDM. These findings were discussed in relation to individual differences in alpha wave-gating function and self-specificity of intrinsic brain activity contribute to the prioritization of self-related preferences in free choice.",

          "authors": "Ria H. A. Hoekstra; Jill de Ron; Sacha Epskamp; Donald Robinaugh; Denny Borsboom",
          "abstract": "The network theory of psychopathology posits that mental disorders are stable states of symptom activation that arise from networks of causally interrelated symptoms. Based on this theory, it can be inferred that, ceteris paribus, a person with a more strongly connected symptom network (i.e., a network characterized by more and stronger causal relationships), may have an increased risk of developing a mental disorder. Researchers have started to take an interest in idiographic networks to evaluate this theoretical position. However, there are good reasons to question whether the dynamics implied by these models make them suitable for evaluating the network theory. In this paper, we map the parameters of different types of idiographic network models to the network theory of psychopathology. In particular, we use stability landscapes to map the dynamics implied by the Ising model with a $\\{0, 1\\}$ and $\\{-1, 1\\}$ encoding, and the graphical vector autoregressive (GVAR) model onto symptom severity and the variability in symptom activation. Only the Ising model with the $\\{0, 1\\}$ encoding shows behavior consistent with the network theory. The Ising model with the $\\{-1, 1\\}$ encoding only partially aligns with the network theory, as increased network connectivity leads both the healthy and unhealthy state to become more stable. Contrary to popular belief, we illustrate that, in the GVAR model, temporal network connectivity is independent of symptom severity. Instead, in temporal network connectivity strongly relates to variability in symptom activation: more strongly connected networks are associated with more variance around the stable state. Our results suggest that more systematic investigations should precede linking psychological theory to statistical network models for empirical data. To this end, we present stability landscapes as a tool to gain insight into the dynamics of idiographic network models and as a means to link model-implied to theory-implied behaviour.",

          "abstract": "Do people have the intuition that free will and moral responsibility are compatible with determinism? To find out, experimental philosophers have presented participants with vignettes describing agents in deterministic universes and probed their intuitions about the free will and moral responsibility of these agents. However, these debates soon got embroiled around the difficulty of assessing whether participants correctly understood the vignettes and the concepts of determinism and free will, and the extent to which different comprehension errors plagued participants’ answers. In this chapter, we clarify those debates by using the results of a brand new study (N = 772) on participants’ intuitions about free will. We introduce readers to correlations, regressions, multiple regressions, mediation analyses, and multiple mediation analyses through the use of structural equation modeling to show how different techniques may give different interpretations of folk intuitions on free will. We explain how to run these different analyses in R and provide detailed R code.",

Adopting a more distal lens by assessing dimensions of neighborhood environments could help identify broader contextual features that influence psychopathology across the lifespan and mechanisms underlying these associations. The current study examines associations of dimensions of neighborhood environments with psychopathology symptoms along with potential emotion, cognitive, and neural mechanisms central to dimensional models of adversity.\n\nMethod\nThe ABCD sample included 11,868 participants aged 9-10 across 21 sites in the U.S. Associations were examined for neighborhood indicators of threat and deprivation with emotion processing (adaptation to emotional conflict, task-active ROIs for emotional n-back), cognition (EF and task-active ROIs for the stop-signal task), and neural function (rs-fc of amygdala to resting state network connectivity and within-network rs connectivity). Mixed effect models nesting within family and site assessed indirect effects for neighborhood and symptoms.\n\nResults\nIndirect effects of neighborhood deprivation across symptom domains through EF were observed. Neighborhood deprivation, but not threat, had an indirect effect on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) through within-retrosplenial temporal and within-dorsal attention network connectivity. Indirect effects for only neighborhood threat were observed with attention difficulties/internalizing problems/PLEs, through default mode within-network connectivity, with PLEs through visual network within-network connectivity, and with PLEs/externalizing symptoms through amygdala to sensorimotor network connectivity. \n\nConclusion\nResults provide insights into neural and cognitive processes underlying observed links between different neighborhood components and psychopathology, with implications for prevention and intervention efforts at the individual and contextual level.",

In this paper, we present a computational neurophenomenological account of minimal phenomenal experience within the active inference framework. We propose a generative mechanism that allows active inference agents to leverage capacities akin to those in generative adversarial networks, which use a dual framework of data generation and discrimination to improve perceptual accuracy. Our hypothesis posits that the brain continuously generates synthetic data to fill perceptual and cognitive gaps, and we provide a computational mechanism within the active inference framework to support this. We explore how synthetic data generation, when amplified by meditation, psychedelics, or other altered states, can the brain to ‘defabricate’ entrenched conceptual structures and approach pure consciousness at the limit. We provide simulations of an active inference agent embedded in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that recursive loops of synthetic data generation can lead to a breakdown in conceptualization — 'seeing as' — while enhancing the system’s ability to predict its own observation stream. We argue that this model can characterize the essential features of MPE, including contentlessness, epistemic openness, and the unique valence profile associated with minimal phenomenal experiences.",

We utilized Classical Test Theory to assess TILS internal consistency, temporal stability, factor structure, and measurement invariance.

Convergent validity was explored through the Spearman correlation coefficient using personality traits, depression, and anxiety.\n\nResults\nThe results showed satisfactory reliability and validity of the TILS in the Czech Republic. The scale's internal consistency and temporal stability were found to be satisfactory (Cronbach’s α = 0.81, McDonald’s ω = 0.82, r = 0.71). The parallel analysis supported the unidimensionality of the TILS with a high factor loading of items (λ = 0.61 - λ = 0.85). Moreover, measurement invariance indicated that the TILS measures loneliness equivalently between genders. The IRT results indicated that the highest measurement precision was reached in individuals with lower and above-average levels of loneliness. Significant correlations between the TILS scores, anxiety, depression, and personality traits supported the convergent validity of the scale.",

          "abstract": "Background: Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms are fairly common in the general population but are linked to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. However, the genetic and environmental origins of these associations are unclear. This twin study examined the phenotypic and aetiological associations between subsyndromal hypomania with psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions and related symptoms (e.g., self-harm).\n\nMethods: Participants were 4,932 twin pairs from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. Hypomanic symptoms were assessed using the parent-rated Mood Disorders Questionnaire when the twins were aged 18. Specialist diagnoses of 14 conditions and symptoms were ascertained from Swedish population registries. Phenotypic associations between hypomania and these conditions/symptoms were investigated and their aetiological overlap examined using the twin method.\n\nOutcomes/findings: Subsyndromal hypomanic symptoms were significantly associated with the diagnosis of all 14 conditions/symptoms. The highest odds was for psychotic disorders (odds ratio [OR]=1·48, 95% confidence intervals [CI]=1·33-1·64, p&lt;0·001) and the lowest was for eating disorders (other than anorexia) (OR=1·15, 95% CI 1·08-1·22, p&lt;0·001). The genetic correlations between subsyndromal hypomania and these diagnoses ranged from 0·12 (95% CI 0·04-0·33) for eating disorders (other than anorexia) to 0·58 (95% CI 0·28-1·00) for drug misuse. The highest non-shared environmental correlation was for psychotic disorders (0·52, 95% CI -0·02-0·92) and lowest was for body dissatisfaction (0·04, 95% CI -0·01-0·08). For bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity/Disorder, genetic and non-shared environmental correlations with subsyndromal hypomania were of a similar magnitude.\n\nInterpretation: The association between subsyndromal hypomania and the diagnosis of multiple psychiatric phenotypes highlights its important role in the developmental pathway to clinical disorders, its complex origins and that it may represent a quantitative trait for bipolar disorder, and various psychiatric phenotypes.",

Through meta-analytic p-curves, we compared the evidentiary value of studies that reported the use of ‘suspicion’ probes versus those that did not, as well as studies that either retained or excluded ‘suspicious’ participants. We sampled 200 independent effects from psychology experiments that employed deception and were recently published in five eminent journals of experimental psychology: Cognition, Emotion, JEP: General, JPSP (all sections), and Psychological Science. Studies that reported the use of ‘suspicion’ probes (k = 100) had less evidentiary value and statistical power than those that did not report the use of ‘suspicion’ probes (k = 100). Furthermore, studies that excluded ‘suspicious’ participants (k = 50) had less evidentiary value and similar statistical power to those that retained ‘suspicious’ participants (k = 50). Though we cannot claim that these differences are causally-induced by ‘suspicion’ probes, our findings call into question the value of performing such probes and using them to exclude ‘suspicious’ participants in the context of hypothesis testing in experimental psychology.",

Since drinking motives are proximal predictors of initiation and escalation of alcohol use, accurate measurement of these motives is crucial. This study compared the psychometric properties – factor structure, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability- of the 12-item, 18-item, and the original 20-item versions of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire (DMQ). We also examined the associations between drinking motives and alcohol use outcomes using network analysis. A total of 434 adults (77.4% female) completed the baseline session and 130 (85.3% female) participated in a follow-up approximately two weeks later. Results showed that the subscales of the DMQ have good internal consistency ( .80) regardless of version. Test-retest reliability was acceptable to good (rs= .71-83) but was higher for social and enhancement than for conformity and coping motives. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 12-item short form outperforms the original 20-item version and the more recently proposed 18-item version. Partial correlation networks including DMQ subscales and alcohol outcomes revealed consistent positive association between social motives and binge drinking, alcohol use quantity per drink occasion and enhancement motives, while frequency of use was primarily associated with coping motives. However, while associations amongst drinking motives were identical in the 12- and 18-item version, these differed from the 20-item version. This study demonstrates how network models can be valuable tools in the validation and comparison of questionnaires and shows that the 12-item DMQ could be a good alternative for the often used longer forms.",

The PBACE is a self-report measure comprising seven subscales: Value of Anger, Cost of Positivity, Control, Parental Knowledge, Manipulation, Stability, and Autonomy. The psychometric properties of the PBACE, including reliability, content, convergent, and construct validity, and dimensionality, were assessed in a sample of 397 parents of children aged 5-11 years. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of seven models and a general seven-correlated model, which showed good model fit for the PBACE and its subscales, except for the Parental Knowledge subscale. The poor fit of the Parental Knowledge subscale led to testing a six-correlated model without it, which demonstrated superior model fit compared to the seven-correlated model. Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) indicated good content validity for the scale. Additionally, significant associations with children's emotion regulation established satisfactory convergent validity. Internal consistency, measured by the Omega coefficient, was acceptable for all subscales except Parental Knowledge, while the PBACE overall demonstrated excellent internal consistency.

          "abstract": "Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) is a widely recognized tool for assessing intelligence. However, it often faces challenges related to lengthy administration times, which can diminish its practicality and increase resource costs. Although several short-form APMs have been developed, they typically overlook the differences in cognitive components assessed by various items, potentially compromising the instrument's content validity. To enhance the consistency of the proportion of cognitive components measured in the short-form instruments compared to the complete APM, this study employed an automated item selection algorithm with cognitive component constraints within the item response theory framework—the revised maximum priority index—to develop a series of short-form APMs with varying item counts. By comparing them with existing short-form APMs, the newly developed instruments demonstrated good reliability while maintaining a nearly consistent proportion of cognitive components measured as in the complete APM. Finally, we recommend two short-form APMs containing 12 and 18 items, respectively, for subsequent use, based on the customary lengths of existing short-form APMs.",

          "authors": "Tamlin Conner; Jack Cooper; Robin Turner",
          "abstract": "Healthy lifestyles are a cornerstone of optimal physical health, yet their contribution to optimal mental health is still an open question. This article investigated the relationships between three key health behaviors—sleep quality, physical activity, and dietary choices—and psychological well-being among young adults ages 18 to 25, a demographic known for disproportionately low levels of well-being. The research used three datasets: a cross-sectional survey (Study 1, N=1,032) and two daily diary datasets (Study 2, N=818; Study 3, N=236) of young adults living in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Multilevel regression analyses examined how these health behaviors simultaneously and synergistically predicted well-being at the between-person and within-person levels, while controlling for covariates such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and depressive symptoms. Additionally, Study 3 incorporated wearable device-measured physical activity to supplement self-report measures. The findings highlighted better sleep quality as the strongest predictor of well-being across all three datasets, followed by fruit and vegetable consumption, with significant associations between these health behaviors and well-being observed at the between-person and within-person levels. Physical activity also emerged as a reliable predictor of well-being, mostly at the within-person level. The use of device-measured physical activity confirmed similar patterns, reinforcing the validity of findings. Pathways linking health behaviors to well-being were mostly additive, except for a buffering pattern observed at the within-person level indicating that higher fruit and vegetable intake could potentially mitigate the negative impact of poor sleep on daily well-being. This article underscores the importance of the “big three” health behaviors in well-being among young adults, offering insights for future health interventions to improve positive psychological functioning in this population.",

          "abstract": "Causal inference and questions about timing are central to developmental science. Yet scientists are often limited to observational data, and conceptual, methodological, and computational barriers have prevented uptake of relevant methodological tools from other disciplines that are designed to improve causal inference. This paper provides a practical guide to implementing one powerful causal inference tool, marginal structural models (MSMs), to strengthen our ability to test causal questions about exposures/treatments that unfold over time. We draw on an illustrative example testing the potentially causal roles of dose and timing of exposure to economic strain from infancy through early childhood on children’s behavior problems in early childhood. We first introduce the advantages of MSMs for investigating causal questions over time. Specifically, we review the logic of ‘exposure histories’ and the potential outcomes framework, using sequential randomization as a conceptual tool. We then discuss inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) for addressing the threat of confounding over time. We then outline how to implement MSMs with observational data, before providing step-by-step guidance for using our novel, open-source R package, devMSMs. In our example, we create longitudinal IPTW balancing weights to attenuate a number of confounder-exposure relations. We then apply these weights to test an outcome model relating economic strain across infancy, toddlerhood, and early childhood to future behavior problems. Finally, we estimate and compare the predicted causal effects of different developmental histories of high economic strain that vary in dose and timing and discuss substantive implications. We close with ongoing considerations.",

          "abstract": "Philosophers and psychologists alike have long debated the etiology of beliefs about human agency. Recently, empirical investigations have shown that lay beliefs about free will and determinism represent stable and important individual differences. Despite a perennial interest in the sources of agentic belief, genetic and environmental influences on such beliefs have never been studied. We administered a battery of items assessing these beliefs to a unique sample of 394 adoptive and biological families with adult offspring to investigate the origins of agentic beliefs and their relationships. We found significant differences between adopted and biological offspring and between the parents of such children, particularly in beliefs about determinism. Biometric modeling revealed especially surprising results: unlike the vast majority of traits studied in family designs, agentic beliefs appear to be weakly or not at all heritable. Since genetic factors might be regarded as typical of the \"initial conditions\" in philosophical thought experiments about free will and determinism, it is especially ironic that beliefs about free will and determinism may be among the traits least influenced by genetic differences.",

          "authors": "Duncan Jordan",
          "abstract": "Avoidant processing of positive emotional information and facilitatory processing of negative emotional information are related to the experience of anhedonia and anxiety. However, how these cognitive processes inter-relate with self-report symptoms of psychopathology over time is unclear. The current study thus examined behavioral indices of perception, attention, and affective updating in relation to self-report measures of anhedonia and anxiety in dynamic network models at six separate time-points among participants preselected for a wide-range of depression symptoms (N = 101). Findings suggest that two different pathways are associated with emotional information processing over time: one represents an anhedonic circuit, and the second represents a two-node reward devaluation circuit. The first pathway reveals how anhedonia and cognitive functioning are related over time (and, potentially, across levels of analysis) and could inform future longitudinal studies of anhedonic individuals. The second pathway represents a theoretical advance in the conceptualization of reward devaluation by further demonstrating that attentional avoidance and perceptual avoidance of positivity are inter-related. Future studies and network analyses that evaluate anhedonia and devaluative processing of positivity, and that replicate these innovative methods, are needed to elucidate how avoidance of positivity and anhedonia are related as part of a causal system of self-reported symptoms and behavioral tasks.",

          "abstract": "Within-disorder heterogeneity complicates mapping neurobiological features of psychopathology to DSM conceptualizations. The present study explored patterns of diagnostic classification errors among disorders with commonly co-occurring features to examine this heterogeneity. We conducted classification analyses with the UCLA Phenomics Study database using a support vector classifier to differentiate disorders via whole-brain task-based functional connectivity, predicting that model misclassifications would provide insight about brain connectivity characteristics shared across disorders. We also explored whether symptoms and specific brain networks could account for misclassification rates. The classification model performed better than chance (44% accuracy, p = .01) and revealed that misclassification of schizophrenia (SCZ) as bipolar disorder (BD; 38%) and BD as SCZ (36%) was symmetrical. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was misclassified as BD at the highest rate (46%) and higher than the converse (17%). SCZ and ADHD were misclassified least (SCZ as ADHD 15%; ADHD as SCZ 22%). Considerable variance in misclassification of SCZ as BD (R2 = .83) and BD as SCZ (R2 = .71) could be accounted for by symptoms of both SCZ and BD. Permutation testing revealed disorder- and network-specific effects, with certain networks improving classification accuracy and others hindering it for specific disorders. An approach focused on classification errors replicated known disorder overlap, producing errors in the expected configuration. Further, it identified clinical and neural features within and across diagnostic categories that contribute to disorder misclassification and within-disorder heterogeneity. This approach may facilitate neurobiologically informed phenotypic differentiation within diagnostic groups.",

However, we do not know how social (dis-) connection unfolds at the physiological level in real time among CHR youth and caregivers. The present laboratory-based dyadic interaction study examined physiological coregulation in 70 dyads across 137 participants. Whereas 32 of these dyads were composed of CHR youth and their caregivers, the remaining 38 dyads encompassed psychiatrically healthy youth and their caregivers. Dyads engaged in 10-minute neutral, conflict, and pleasant conversations while their autonomic physiology was continuously monitored. In conflict and neutral interactions, CHR youth exhibited contrarian coregulation. Contrarian coregulation was associated with elevated risk for psychosis, was linked to greater baseline psychosis symptomatology, and prospectively predicted increases in symptoms one year later. These findings document alterations in physiological coregulation between CHR youth and their caregivers, highlight their relevance for clinical symptomatology, suggest novel avenues for relationship-focused treatments, and contribute to a biologically-informed science of social connection.",

Building on our previous work with respect to analogizing between ANNs and cognition, brains, or behaviour (Guest &amp; Martin, 2023), we use metatheoretical analysis techniques (Guest, 2024), including formal logic, to characterise two distinct tendencies within connectionism that we dub classical and modern, with divergent properties, e.g. goals, mechanisms, scientific questions. We also demonstrate how we, as a field, often fail to follow important lines of argument to their end --- this results in a paradoxical praxis.

          "abstract": "Background:\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with inadequate screening rates even in urban areas with high concentrations of medical professionals. While medical guidelines recommend annual diabetic retinopathy screening for patients with diabetes mellitus, adherence to these recommendations remains suboptimal. This study evaluates the impact of a novel teleretinal DR screening program on screening compliance across urban community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Methods:\nWe conducted a quasi-experimental study comparing DR screening compliance between intervention and comparison community health centers before and after implementing a teleretinal screening program. Participants included patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with primary care providers at the studied sites. We defined compliance as completion of either teleretinal screening or a documented eye care professional examination within the previous 365 days. Monthly compliance rates were analyzed using two-way fixed effects regression and event study techniques.\nResults:\nThe study included 10,247 patients with diabetes mellitus who received care at six participating sites, generating 222 monthly compliance rate estimates. Baseline compliance rates before implementation ranged from 25% to 40% across sites. The two-way fixed effects regression analysis revealed that the screening program significantly increased DR compliance rates by an average of 7.2 percentage points (p &lt; 0.001). Event study analysis showed positive effects across all sites, though the initial improvement tended to diminish over time.\nConclusions:\nImplementation of a community-based teleretinal DR screening program significantly improved compliance with annual screening guidelines in urban communities. These findings support the broader adoption of teleretinal screening as an effective strategy for preventing DR-related vision loss in vulnerable populations. Further research is needed to assess long-term clinical outcomes and optimize program sustainability.",

          "abstract": "While most research on the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) has focused on exploring the candidate event related potentials (ERP) components associated to visual awareness, much less is known about the temporal dynamics associated to those correlates. In the present study, we will measure the temporal dynamics of visual awareness as a function of the level of processing (LoP) of the stimulus and report condition (report vs. no-report). In the report condition, participants will perform a low-level (color identification: blue vs. red) or high-level (category identification: animal vs. object) task on colored stimuli that will be presented at threshold while reporting their awareness of the target (e.g., ‘seen’ or ‘unseen’). In the no-report block, participants will count the number of times that a task-irrelevant, but LoP congruent, stimulus appears within each block. The VAN (visual awareness negativity) and LP (late positivity) components of the ERP will be computed for each condition by pooling together aware and unaware trials. If awareness to different stimulus representations is temporally dynamic, we will expect an earlier low-level VAN compared to high-level VAN together with an earlier high-level LP compared to low-level LP, suggesting that the temporal course of the NCC is dependent on the level of processing of the stimulus and task demands. An absence of differences between low-level and high-level VANs, on the other hand, will suggest that awareness emerges “at once”, independently of the level at which the stimulus is processed. Regarding the LP, we expect two alternative scenarios. In the first one, we will observe reliable LPs only in the report condition and no LPs in the no-report condition. This will be in line with the proposal that the LP/P3 is not a correlate of awareness but reflects post-perceptual or task related processes. In the second scenario, reliable LPs might be observed in both the report and no-report tasks, but only for the high-level tasks. This will suggest that the LP is indeed a correlate of visual awareness which is exclusively modulated by high-level stimulus representations. In sum, here we will explore whether the NCC within the no-report paradigm are depend on the LoP of the stimulus and whether they are temporally dynamic, or alternatively, they are temporally invariant and independent of the LoP conceptualization.",

          "abstract": "Humans often need to make decisions that take future situations into account. This kind of sequential choice entails a trade-off between the present and the future, where decision-makers have to decide to accept or reject the currently available option. The approach-avoidance conflict, on the other hand, is a frequently used framework in psychology to study the behavioral trade-off regarding appetitive and aversive stimuli. This study investigates the influence of approach and avoidance conditions on sequential choice. Therefore, we developed experimental conditions in which participants should either approach or avoid environmental dangers in order to optimize their behavior. The main objective is to evaluate meta-decision making strategies under ecologically valid conditions. To accomplish this, we developed a game-like foraging paradigm with probabilistic outcomes where people could use different types of decision rules (or policies). While some policies would only account for one variable of our game environment, others would account for different variables depending on the time-point and the situation. Model comparisons allowed us to test whether participants would rely on a rather myopic/heuristic or a forward-looking policy. We then tested whether policies differed depending on our task’s approach and avoidance condition. Our findings suggest that people generally use a myopic strategy in sequential decision-making. However, we observe increased optimal behavior in situations where the environment bears higher dangers that should be avoided. We suspect the underlying mechanisms to be linked to an internal energetic trade-off between efficient and accurate meta-decision making depending on the risks imposed by the environment.",

Yet while there is an extensive literature on descriptive gender representation in bureaucracies and courts, we largely lack studies that examine patterns of women’s presence on expert advisory bodies. Drawing on large-n data on the composition of Norwegian expert advisory commissions, the paper investigates and evaluates how the share of women on these commissions has developed over the last half-century. It finds that while overall gender parity was achieved in recent decades, women remain strongly under-represented among commission chairs, particularly academic chairs, and among commission members from economics, an especially important policy discipline. Normatively speaking, the developments towards parity are promising, and we find no empirical confirmation of the worry that proportional representation and competence requirements are in tension. On the contrary, persistent gender gaps among economists on commissions and academic chairs may endanger adequate provision of expertise into policy-making.",

We use interviews with wealthy German family business owners in media outlets between 2014 and 2019. Applying thematic analysis, we demonstrate that these wealthy business owners discursively link the past, present, and future of their family and business. By doing so, they emphasize hard work to explain family wealth transitions and how such wealth is accumulated across generations. This temporal self-narration about business success tied to family structure creates a powerful discursive strategy to legitimize their wealth.

Most US adults are not likely to experience severe cases of RSV infection, but adults aged 60 or older are at elevated risk of experiencing hospitalization or death due to RSV. While RSV vaccines are available for adults aged 60 or older, and have been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood that older adults experience severe cases of RSV, less than one quarter of those eligible have opted to receive the vaccine. In the context of RSV vaccination, Reversal Narrative (RN) messages share stories about individuals who previously refused to receive the vaccine, but – in response to personal negative health outcomes (“regret” RN messaging) and/or new scientific information (“rationalizing” RN messaging) – ultimately changed their mind. In a large and nationally representative survey (N = 1,300) of US adults, as well as a state-representative survey (N = 850) of a highly vaccinated US state, we demonstrate that unvaccinated adults over the age of 60 are significantly more likely to intend to receive an RSV vaccine when exposed to regret-focused (but not rationalizing) RN messaging. We conclude by discussing the viability of RN messaging as a vaccine promotion tactic, and consider how researchers might partner with health communicators to explore their viability in a wide range of health contexts.",

Trials 1 and 2 were conducted in June 2023, and randomly exposed a representative cross-section of adults in a highly vaccinated state (Rhode Island; Trial 1, N = 800) and a nationally representative cross-section US adults (Trial 2, N = 1,000) with messages that normalize the risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group). Trials 3 and 4 were conducted in October 2023, and randomly exposed analogous state (Trial 3, N = 800) and nationally representative survey respondents (Trial 4, N = 1,200) to messages that “de-normalize” constantly-mutating viral threats posed by endemic COVID-19 (vs. a control group).   \n\nSetting: Survey respondents were administered the trials online.\n\nParticipants: All adults aged 18 or over, residing in either the US (Trials 1, 3) or Rhode Island (specifically; Trials 2, 4), and who were members of a large, online, opt-in survey panel recruitment pool maintained by YouGov, were eligible for inclusion in this study.  \n\nInterventions: Respondents were randomly assigned to read a short message promoting annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake (vs. a control group, shown an unrelated message). In Trials 1 and 2, messages either made an effort to (a) normalize COVID-19 as endemic (“normalization” [NORM]), (b) both normalize and highlight the Long COVID health risks posed by endemic COVID-19 (“normalization + risk” [NR]), or (c) a control message unrelated to vaccination. In Trials 3 and 4, respondents were randomly assigned to either read (a) the aforementioned “NORM” message, (b) a message “de-normalizing” (DENORM) COVID-19 as a constantly mutating viral risk, or (c) a study-wide control message.\n\nOutcomes &amp; Measures: The primary outcome variable in this study measures respondents’ self-reported intentions to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine. The primary explanatory variable in our analyses is an indicator of experimental condition assignment, stratified by whether respondents (a) received a full COVID-19 vaccine sequence &amp; at least one booster shot, (b) received some form of COVID-19 vaccination, but no boosters, or (c) are unvaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nResults: In Trials 1 and 2, we find that unvaccinated Rhode Islanders exposed to the NR messaging, but not NORM messaging, were significantly more likely to intend to receive an annual COVID-19 vaccine (NORM: B = 0.13, CI = -0.03, 0.30, p = 0.11; NR: B = 0.22, CI = 0.00, 0.44, p = 0.05). In Trials 3 and 4, we find that exposure to DENORM messaging, but not NORM messaging, is also associated with annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake among unvaccinated Rhode Islanders (NORM: B = 0.19, CI = -0.03, 0.41, p = 0.10; DENORM: B = 0.23, CI = 0.01, 0.44, p = 0.04). We detect no significant effects in either of our national samples, which post hoc analyses suggest might result from observed and unobserved differences in unvaccinated populations across Rhode Island and national samples.\n\nConclusions: Our work suggests that messaging emphasizing both the endemic health risks (“NR”) and challenges of combating new COVID-19 variants (“DENORM”) may be effective at increasing annual COVID-19 vaccine uptake in unvaccinated populations, and suggest opportunities for future research regarding how differences in state public health contexts might moderate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine communication.",

          "abstract": "Countries with stronger support to gender equality tend to invest in policies supporting\nthe dual-earner family model or the earner/carer family model, while countries\nwith stronger support to conservative gender norms tend to have policies supporting\nthe male breadwinner family model. However, gender equality norms can be\nendorsed by the majority of the population at the national level, whilst conservative\nnorms could still be largely supported at the sub-national level, potentially leading\nto lower uptake of parental leave among fathers in more conservative areas.\nThis study seeks to examine shifting norms in fathers’ parental leave uptake\nin Finnish municipalities in the 2010s, around the first reform that gave fathers\nan independent right to a 6-week quota of “solo” parental leave. We applied a\nBayesian spatio-temporal model on administrative data from Finnish municipalities\nand estimated local norms based on voting data and content analysis of political\nmanifestos. Furthermore, we used the proportion of Swedish residents as a proxy\nfor cross-border policy influences from the neighbouring country Sweden, where\npaternal leave-taking has been a longer phenomenon.\nLocal support to de-familialising policies was found to predict higher leavetaking,\nbut only before the 2013 reform when fathers’ quota use shortened mothers’\nleave. The proportion of Swedish-speaking residents was found to be increasingly\nimportant for predicting paternal leave-taking. We interpret this result as a sign of\ncross-border influences from Sweden. Interestingly, uptake increased the fastest in\nthe most conservative region, probably due to its strong linguistic and cultural links\nto Sweden. Furthermore, we observed spatial dependencies between neighbouring\nmunicipalities, which supports our spillover hypothesis; that the interactions among\nfamilies nearby lead them to adopt new practices.\nThese results trigger new theoretical considerations concerning the role of gender\nnorms in affecting citizens’ behaviour in the family policy field and how these norms\ninteract with policy reforms, the role of national institutions in affecting welfare state\npreferences at the local level, and the importance of community socialisation.",

          "authors": "Jon Abbink",
          "abstract": "The severe armed conflict in Ethiopia since November 2020 – the start of an armed insurrection by a party (TPLF) in northern Ethiopia - has been framed and impacted upon by digital offensives and global media reporting in peculiar ways. Representations of the conflict events, actors and victims have had a divisive effect on political debate and cooperation in Ethiopia, thus fuelling communal divisions and preventing compromise. The arena of shared politics in federal Ethiopia was further fragmented, with a notable role played by influential global news media and the ‘social’ media. Their politic rhetoric went beyond strategies of persuasion into forms of partisan intimidation, misinformation, bias and even fiction. \nAs with all early 21th-century armed conflicts (cf. the Middle East, Myanmar, or Ukraine), the digital sphere and media manipulation on Ethiopia are shown to be essential domains of discursive battle, extending real life battles, and impacting on international diplomatic responses. The paper analyses some key aspects of the evolving conflict from the perspective of repeated digital ‘memes’ – ‘famine’, ‘genocide’, ‘blockade’, ethnic cleansing’ - and narrative frames – ‘underdog’, ‘self-defense’, ‘peaceful resolution’, ‘truce’ - produced by adherents of one or the other party in the conflict. \nThis contemporary (digital) political rhetoric subverts itself and creates a world of semi-fictitious appearances that perpetuate conflict. The problem of addressing ‘Sophist’ arguments is the same as in Plato’s time (cf. Gorgias), but current digital media allow political rhetoric to massively go beyond the conventions of shared discourse. \nUsing examples, I argue that, beyond the analysis of the digital and news media products themselves, new ways have to be found to ‘reality-check’ or reduce these products/representations to themes amenable for public discussion and eventual shared compromise (cf. Norris 2017: 630). This might help (re)building political rhetoric in a constructive, and not exclusively polemic, manner.",

          "abstract": "Parental leave uptake by fathers represents one pathway to redress the typically unequal division of early childcare. Following the Nordic schema, the Finnish leave system is designed around this concept to encourage leave uptake, but a substantial share of fathers refrain from it. Though there is a substantial body of literature on policy and individual-level motivators of leave uptake, the decision to take leave often occurs in the context of the workplace. Workplace factors are often cited as typical barriers to uptake. We systematically investigated how the most important workplace characteristics are associated with fathers’ parental leave decisions. We used administrative, linked employee-employer Finnish register data and a multilevel Bayesian approach to examine employed first-time fathers’ use of the father’s quota in 2013–2017. Contrary to our expectations, the probability of taking father’s quota did not vary by the gender composition of or gender wage gap within the workplace. Workplace educational level was important, but only for tertiary educated fathers. Increased competitiveness of the workplace lowered the probability of taking the quota. Our findings call for further study on the interplay of individual and contextual factors in fathers’ parental leave uptake.",

This oversight is regrettable as these factors often intertwine, particularly given the prevalence of socioeconomic deprivation among ethnic minorities compared to the White majority. In this study, we investigate the mediating and moderating effects between offenders' residential area deprivation and their ethnic background using an administrative dataset encompassing all offences processed through the England and Wales Crown Court. Our findings reveal the following: i) substantial ethnic disparities among drug offenders, but mostly non-existent across other offence categories; ii) area deprivation does not explain away ethnic disparities, but pronounced area disparities are found for breach and assault offences, wherein offenders living in deprived areas are penalised compared to their more affluent counterparts; and iii) ethnicity and area deprivation interact, but only for breach offences, with ethnic minority offenders being treated more harshly than white offenders when residing in deprived areas but favoured when they live in affluent areas.",

          "abstract": "To cope with large information content in today’s multilingual Saudi Arabia, translation services are essential. Like any other industry, translation practice was heavily affected by technological advances. Professionals in the translation field use technology like Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) tools to complete their translation tasks. Freelance translators are not exempt from this. This study examines the utilization of CAT tools in the freelance industry in Saudi Arabia. Fulford and Granell-Zafra (2005) have proposed a model that incorporates both information and Communication Technology (ICTs)and CAT tools, facilitating a diverse array of activities such as document creation, information search and retrieval, communication, business management, marketing, procurement, and translation. While CAT tools support document creation, business management, and translation, ICT tools are responsible for the remaining activates . This research aims to thoroughly analyze the characteristics of Saudi freelance translators who use CAT tools, evaluate their usage of CAT tools, and acquire valuable insights into their overall attitudes towards CAT tool. The data was gathered using the survey method and distributed among 98 Saudi freelance translators. The data was analyzed using SPSS descriptive analysis and frequency tables showing percentages of each respondent. The results show that Saudi freelance translators employed general-purpose software like MS Word and MS PowerPoint, whereas less interest was given to special-purpose software which represent CAT tools . The vast majority of the participants agreed on the positive effect of CAT tools. Finally,it may be beneficial to conduct further research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.",

It investigates the roles and challenges women face in the novel. While there is growing interest in the portrayal of women in literature, Iraqi literature—especially from the perspective of Iraqi women writers remains underexplored. Hadi’s *The Black Eyes* provides a unique case to examine this intersection. Despite the novel’s rich narrative, which offers insight into Iraqi women’s lives, there is a lack of comprehensive CDA to understand how its language constructs and communicates the multifaceted roles, challenges, and images of women. The research fills this gap by analyzing specific passages from the novel using Fairclough’s model. The findings reveal a nuanced portrayal of women and underscore the value of CDA in analyzing such works. Further research is recommended to apply CDA to other Iraqi literary texts for broader insight",

          "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between reading strategies and Bandura’s (1986) theory of Reciprocal Determinism. Previous research acknowledged the concept of Reciprocal Determinism as an effective teaching approach, however, limited research has been done to consider how reading is influenced by learners’ personal factors, behavior and environment.  Based on four Research Questions,  the study explores the perceived use of reading strategies by 225 undergraduates who completed a critical reading course at a local university.  These learners of English as a Second Language responded to an online questionnaire adapted from Mokhtari and Sheorey’s (2002) Survey of Reading Strategies.  Based on the learners’ ratings of the reading strategies, namely Global Reading Strategies, Problem-Solving Strategies and Support Strategies, the findings revealed that there is a significant relationship between the learners’ perceived use of reading strategies and the three factors of Reciprocal Determinism, namely Personal Factors, Behaviour and Environment indicating a cyclical effect that infuences learners’ reading comprehension.  This exploration of reading strategies through this theory has pedagogical implications on how reading is taught to scaffold and help learners increase metacognitive awareness and self-efficacy. Overall, this study contributes to a further understanding of the importance of taking into account the three factors in a reading environment and the relationship between reading strategies and RD.  Future studies could be an extension of how the cyclical effects of Reciprocal Determinism and reading strategies could be strategically integrated into the teaching of skilled and unskilled readers and in other learning domains",

          "abstract": "Project-Based Learning (PBL) can potentially enhance learners’ oral proficiency. However, little evidence supports how PBL improves learners’ complexity, accuracy, and fluency, particularly for learners with different proficiency levels. This study examined the changes and linguistic features of varying proficiency learners’ complexity, accuracy, and fluency within a PBL context. It involved a homogeneous group of 45 Chinese college learners, categorized into high (N=15), medium (N=15), and low proficiency learners (N=15). Their oral complexity, accuracy, and fluency were assessed using speaking tests before and after PBL. The changes in their oral performance were evaluated using objective measures of complexity, accuracy, and fluency. The transcripts were also used to analyze the linguistic features of different proficiency learners. The results indicate that PBL significantly enhances syntactic complexity as learners’ proficiency levels increase. Significant differences were observed in lexical complexity, pronunciation accuracy, and self-repairs between high and low-proficiency learners. However, no significant differences were found in syntactic accuracy and speech rate across high, medium, and low proficiency learners. The findings also indicate that different proficiency learners reveal various linguistic features of syntactic complexity, syntactic accuracy, and self-repairs in their oral performance. This study provides implications for educators to design project-based activities for different proficiency learners to improve their complexity, accuracy, and fluency.",

The study adopted a quantitative method to analyse the ICNALE written essays v2.4 using CPIDR v5.1 software. The study aimed to identify the level of propositional idea density in the writing of English native speakers and Asian learners of English and to examine the effect of the type of English, the theme type, the proficiency level and nationality on propositional idea density. The study is one of the very few studies about propositional idea density in ESL and EFL contexts. Many statistical analyses were performed on CPIDR results using jamovi v2.3 software, and the results of the tests revealed that the propositional idea density in native speakers’ essays was higher than that in Asian learners’ essays. Moreover, the results showed that there was a statistically significant difference among all the participants based on the theme types of part-time jobs and smoking, among native speakers based on occupation type (students, teachers, others) and among Asian learners of English based on the type of English proficiency level and nationality. The findings of the study showed that propositional idea density is a psycholinguistic index of the amount of presupposed knowledge language users have on a specific topic. In other words, propositional idea density is a window to language users’ schemata. Additionally, the findings of the study can be considered an insightful contribution to contrastive interlanguage analysis.",

          "abstract": "The main aim of the study is to examine the impact of video games on vocabulary acquisition among Saudi university students, as well as what types of games are most effective and students’ perceptions of their use. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving 100 students divided into control and experimental groups. Over twelve weeks, the experimental group used video game-based learning activities, while the control group followed traditional methods. Vocabulary gains were measured using pre-tests and post-tests. Qualitative data from questionnaires and interviews with the participants have supplemented the results. The findings show that the students who used video games reported greater engagement, motivation, and reduced language anxiety, appreciating the contextual learning and immediate feedback provided by video games. These findings support the use of video games as effective tools for vocabulary acquisition, offering an interactive and immersive learning experience. Students’ positive perceptions further highlight the benefits of integrating video games into language learning. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of video game-based learning and its influence on other language skills, as well as explore different game types in various educational settings.

Second, it addresses a gap in research by focusing on an underexplored context: online legal English classes for Arabic-speaking learners, a topic which has not been widely researched. Applying Conversation Analysis to fragments from the online class, the findings reveal that code-switching serves as a vital resource for learners in comprehending complex legal concepts by drawing on their first language (L1) knowledge (in this case, Arabic). It also facilitates word searching, collaborative learning, and effective negotiation of meaning, aiding in the overall second language (L2) acquisition process.",

          "abstract": "The present research deals with the phenomenon of hedging language, mainly focusing on the context of spontaneous verbal interactions. The main aim of the study is to analyze the occurrence of hedges in English spoken discourse as captured in the Spoken British National Corpus 2014. The research process deals with the differences in the usage of approximators and shields existing among men and women across different age groups and levels of education. The research methodology involves creating six sub-corpora, measuring hedge dispersion, examining selected hedges to ascertain their hedging function within the context and calculating frequencies within each sub-corpus. The research outcomes point to the prevalence of shields in spoken discourse. Plausibility shields are commonly used while attribution shields show lower usage. Adaptors contribute to mitigating certainty in utterances, whereas rounders play a less prominent role. These findings emphasize the nuanced interplay between linguistic strategies and speaker characteristics in spoken communication and highlight the importance of cooperative principles in discourse.",

Understanding these matters is critical for improving research production and personal performance. The Study utilized a Quantitative descriptive approach by analyzing evidence of overall productivity scores in the Sinta Database. In addition, an online survey was issued to point out academics’ involvement in research and the drives beneath their participation. The findings indicated that the research productivity among 30 English education departments was mainly low. Academics intensively engaged in writing, citing, conducting, and reading research. However, publishing research in recognized international journals indexed by Scopus or Web of Science, publishing in accredited national (Sinta Tiers one and two), and proposing intellectual property rights received less scrutiny. Their research drive was primarily for professional development, knowledge contribution, and self-awareness; research is a component of their job, alongside teaching and community services. However, promotions, governmental positions, and professional allowances were less motivating. The findings emphasize the significance of targeted funding and mentorship to facilitate publications, promote technical advancement, and stimulate the pursuit of intellectual property rights to enhance research productivity.",

This study aims to explore the concept of inclusive AI learning design and its intersection with the integration of the 6Cs framework in higher education. In other words, it delves into the multifaceted role of Artificial Intelligence in the classroom, focusing primarily on the integration of the 6Cs (communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, character education/ connectivity, and culture/ citizenship) in Moroccan higher education institutions, Artificial Intelligence literacy, and the cultivation of digital humanities techniques. The main research question guiding the study was “How to integrate the 6Cs at the tertiary level using inclusive Artificial Intelligence learning design? ». The study held significance in contributing to the existing literature by providing new insights and filling gaps in knowledge. To achieve the objectives of the study, the researcher relied on an exploratory descriptive approach through an interview and a self-developed questionnaire involving 15 ESP teachers. The results indicated that teachers face several challenges when integrating the 6C of 21st-century education into ESP classes, including engineering students’ low motivation, difficulties in combining multiple competencies, limitations in teaching materials, and time management issues. Hence, establishing a framework for inclusive Artificial Intelligence learning design that encompasses the 6 Cs is compulsory.",

          "abstract": "This research study aimed to investigate how and what are the affective factors, main challenges, and recommendations among Saudi female EFL students in developing emotional intelligence for learning English. The study used a survey questionnaire to collect data from 80 participants, which were then analyzed using statistical methods. The results showed that higher levels of EI were positively correlated with better English language proficiency. The study also found that certain affective factors, such as empathy, self-awareness, and emotional regulation, were particularly important in predicting ELL outcomes. The different affective factors are assessed on different grading scales. Considering the statistical analysis, it could be determined that factors related to the English language, such as social skills, motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic), emotional regulation, effective communication, empathy, self-confidence, self- and cultural awareness, and resilience, have a positive and affirmative influence on the beliefs of English language learners. On the other hand, when analyzing the main challenges faced by Saudi female EFL students in developing emotional intelligence for learning English a majority of students favored that it is challenging to use EI to manage stress and emotions while learning a second language. Therefore, cultivating EL could maintain motivation and enthusiasm for learning English. The study pointed out that learning a second language is a challenging task, and it becomes even more difficult when one has to navigate and adapt to cultural differences. The study strongly favored the integration of the affective factors in teaching as well. Research suggested that a supportive and encouraging environment, positive feedback and constructive criticism could enhance the EI of Saudi female EFL students learning English. With the use of EI, students felt supported and encouraged, and they were more likely to feel confident in their abilities and take risks in their language learning.",

Thus, this mixed-methods study aimed to fill this gap by investigating the impact of the POA on Chinese university students’ motivation for English learning. The quantitative results demonstrated significant improvements in both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation among the students instructed by the POA. The qualitative data supported these findings, revealing that the structured stages of the POA, along with its core principles, created a supportive and engaging learning environment. However, the study also highlighted challenges, such as the potential for students to feel overwhelmed by the demands of the approach. The importance of this study lies in its demonstration that the POA is a practical and effective method for enhancing motivation in English language learning, with significant implications for broader educational reforms aimed at creating more supportive learning environments.",

Yet, teachers’ perceptions of pragmatics and teaching pragmatics has yet to be closely investigated in the context of Moroccan higher education and therefore remains uncharted in literature. To address these gaps, the present study explored how Moroccan university professors view pragmatics and pragmatic teaching. It also explored how they use their pragmatic knowledge in the classroom. A total of 10 university professors (6 males and 4 females)  from two public universities (Moulay Ismail and Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah) in Morocco participated in the current study. Quantitative data were collected by completing an anonymous questionnaire, while qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Participants expressed their perceptions and described experiences of the importance of teaching pragmatics, issues related to culture and identity in teaching English as a Foreign Language, and materials and tasks in teaching pragmatics. The findings yielded that linguistic knowledge is as essential as pragmatic knowledge. Thus, striking a balance between pragmatic and grammatical competence and teaching them simultaneously is crucial. Learners with advanced grammatical knowledge may fail to use the target language appropriately. As such, the results indicated that some teachers are unaware of the importance of introducing pragmatics to students in the early stages of learning English. Their skills are enough to be good at transmitting cultural knowledge and suitable language competence to students. Practical implications for future research and practice are also discussed.",

          "abstract": "This study explores the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the dissemination of cultural content, focusing on the transmission of Norse mythology and Orthodox Christian religious values within Romania, a culture with no historical connection to Norse mythology. By statistically analysing data collected from digital platforms such as TikTok and X (formerly Twitter), the research examines the differences in the presence and language of posts related to culturally specific content (Orthodox Christianity) and non-specific content (Norse mythology). The findings reveal that cultural content with strong institutional and historical support, like Orthodox Christianity, shows a higher prevalence and consistency in its digital dissemination, often transcending language barriers. Conversely, Norse mythology, lacking such support in Romania, demonstrates a more fragmented and inconsistent digital presence. The study also uncovers the influence of social media algorithms on the retrieval and representation of cultural content, highlighting significant quantitative and qualitative differences in search results between different users. These findings suggest that while the IoT facilitates global cultural exchange, it also introduces challenges in preserving the authenticity of cultural content in digital environments. The implications of this research extend to understanding the mechanisms of cultural hybridisation and the potential for digital platforms to both preserve and transform cultural heritage.",

The research aims to understand how these technologies influence language learning and identify how these tools are used across varying proficiency levels. The significance of the study lies in its potential to inform educators and highlight the role of using technologies in language learning. Based on data collected from a survey of 151 students (ranging from A2 to C2 proficiency levels), the findings indicate that students across all proficiency levels actively engage with NMT and ChatGPT. Across all proficiency levels, NMT and ChatGPT are used primarily for word translation. However, higher proficiency students use ChatGPT for complex tasks (such as mistake correction or summary writing). Moreover, the study emphasizes the positive attitudes of Gen Z learners toward technology as a flexible and valuable educational resource. The motivation to use technology stems from the desire to learn new vocabulary, comprehend English content, and enjoy flexible learning. Therefore, the study recommends that educators adapt teaching strategies to include these technologies, considering the different proficiency levels of students. Future research should focus on the long-term impacts of technology use on language acquisition.",

I examine discourse on AI in relation to notions of futurity and expertise.

As utilized by cultural sociologists, computational text analysis offers new possibilities in the study of meanings and framings. However, short texts remain understudied due to limitations in existing methods and approaches. I contend that short text limitations can be overcome by focusing on the meaning of sentences as opposed to the meaning of words and I demonstrate the utility of such an approach through two-stage topic modeling in my study of AI, particularly around how notions of futurity and domain-specific expertise are operationalized. This project demonstrates how AI has reshaped notions of expertise with a focus on medicine and ethics amidst new and contested understandings of what a future with AI looks like.",

          "abstract": "This article orbits the promise of Sociology and presents the sociology of promises—or, more precisely, the science of promises, aimed at addressing all sociological curiosities and encompassing all that is sociological. In introducing the General Social Theory of Compromises (G-STOC), a framework designed to overcome the fragmentation of traditional social theories and address their limitations in explaining social behavior, a breakthrough is presented in eight main takeaways that are simultaneously ontological, epistemological and theoretical: (1) social coercive powers derive from actual or virtual agency; (2) virtual agency derives from promises; (3) all anger and disappointment derive from broken promises; (4) promises are always in dynamic reciprocal sets called compromises; (5) compromises are heuristic devices underlying all social relationships; (6) all social phenomena involve compromises; (7) to explain is to describe relationships and (8) sociological explanation, therefore, derives from the description of compromises and their history. The above tenets begin to outline a powerful and coherent framework and their proper appreciation is bound to have a profound impact in Social Science. Emphasizing theoretical novelty and superior heuristic power while avoiding convoluted syntheses of competing theories, the author advocates for clear conceptual and theoretical grounds to enable a complete and integrated explanation of social phenomena. Through this innovative approach, the paper invites scholars to engage critically with G-STOC and explore its potential to offer new insights into the social world and its complexities.",

However, the underlying causes remain unclear, possibly due to self-selection or continued instability in the family environment.\nMethod: This study employs structural causal modeling and Bayesian logistic regression to investigate the causal effect of childhood family structural changes on adult educational attainment using Finnish full-population register data (n = 272,962), focusing on cohorts born in 1987–1991 and their family members.\nResults: A substantial portion of the 17-percentage-point disadvantage of children from separated families was due to the selection of families into separation and further structural changes. Separation effects followed a U-shaped pattern, with the largest negative effects among families in the middle of the educational gradient. Stepparents did not exert positive or negative effects, except for highly educated parents’ children benefiting from stable stepfathers. Recurring family instability had the largest negative impact.\nConclusion: The curvilinear relationship between parental and child education may partly explain the mixed results of previous studies.\nImplications: Given that recurring family instability was shown to be the most detrimental to children’s educational attainment, low-threshold guidance and support to aspiring and existing blended families might have the largest impacts on children of separated parents.",

          "abstract": "The average lifespan has increased strongly in the past decades, but not everyone has benefited equally. Establishing the degree of intergenerational persistence of survival generates insights into broad inequalities between individuals and families in their likelihood to live to high ages. Using established register-type data for a region in Southern Sweden 1880-2015, we show that even before the rise of the modern social gradient in health in the 1960ies, mortality is lower among descendants from long-lived parents (top survivors of their birth cohort). This shared survival advantage between parents and children persists over time even after considering SES. Mortality among the descendants of top survivors is lower in lifestyle-related causes of death, suggesting that behavioral factors could be a significant factor in explaining the survival advantage, but also. Overall, we find that mortality concentrates in families in patterns that go beyond the influence of SES alone.

          "abstract": "Two approaches to prehistoric numeracy are analyzed and compared. The first uses traditional archaeological methods and criteria to examine and characterize marks on prehistoric artifacts for the purpose of assessing whether they were notations. The second uses a theoretical framework in which cognition is extended—meaning that material forms are a component of the mind—in order to understand the role of counting devices in numerical cognition. Each answers a different question: The traditional approach is concerned with understanding the intent and meaning of artifactual marks, while the extended approach focuses on how material forms contribute to numerical realization, explication, and elaboration. Both highlight ongoing issues in investigating prehistoric numeracy, which might benefit from a combined and expanded methodology.",

          "abstract": "Social stratification is interested in unequal life chances and assumes the existence of a hierarchy of more or less advantageous occupations. Yet occupations are not easily translated into a linear hierarchical measure. Influential scales combine multiple indicators and lack intuitive interpretation. We present a new scale based on occupations’ earnings potential (OEP). The OEP scale measures the median earnings of occupations and expresses them as percentiles of the overall earnings structure: If machine mechanics earn the national median wage, their OEP is 50. We construct national OEP scales using annual microdata pooled over several decades for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and US. Consistent with the Treiman constant, these national scales are highly correlated over time (r=0.90) and across countries (r=0.80), justifying the use of one common OEP scale. When applied to another European database, the common OEP scale explains a quarter of the variance in earnings – and performs as well for countries used to construct the scale as for countries not used. Moreover, it is associated with the causes (education) and consequences (social mobility) that theory expects it to be. OEP provides a simple, clear and parsimonious indicator of economic advantage that can be meaningfully interpreted.",

          "abstract": "We propose a theoretical framework to explain fertility declines over the past two centuries around the world. The framework suggests that low-fertility countries already entered and will persist in a fertility equilibrium in the foreseeable future. What distinguishes our theoretical framework from the previous ones is the centrality of women in our model. The woman has a different interest in fertility decisions from others including her male partner. In most human history, her input in fertility decisions was minimal. As the premodern regime begins to crumble, women gradually become aware of other life choices and obtain reproductive autonomy. These changes inevitably lead to falls in fertility. The falls are ultimately driven by the push for broad gender equality and would continue and not be permanently reversed until they meet pronatalistic forces in a below-replacement environment where the antinatalistic and pronatalistic forces balance out into a fertility equilibrium.",

          "abstract": "This paper compares processes of labour market entry and early career stages in Britain and West Germany. It starts by looking at the characteristics of the respective institutional structures in which human capital is formed and allocated. The two national systems of formal institutions can be regarded as generating particular modes of co-ordination between education and the labour market, that is that the labour market integration of young people follows different rules in the two countries. A frame of reference is provided by a general model that distinguishes between a horizontal, a vertical and a temporal dimension of the process of integration into the labour market. These dimensions are further pursued in empirical terms: here, major aims of the paper are to assess the effects of formal qualifications on the quality of first jobs and to analyse the multi-dimensional stability of entry positions in early careers. In Britain, co-ordination is, to a larger extent, achieved by criteria of timing, in addition to the hierarchical grading of qualifications; in Germany the latter, as well as substantive occupational skills, play a major role. There have also been important historical changes in these dimensions, especially in the UK.",

          "abstract": "As populations age and informal caregiving becomes more widespread, the health consequences of providing care are becoming a key concern for societies. Sociological theories of stress appraisal and role strain posit detrimental consequences to the health and wellbeing of caregivers. Conversely, role enhancement theory holds that caregiving can have positive health consequences. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) collected among adults aged 50 years or older with a follow-up period of up to 20 years (2002-23, N ca. 20,000 persons), we examine associations between transitions into and out of caregiving, and two key health outcomes which have been understudied as consequences of caregiving, namely: allostatic load and cognitive functioning. We estimate asymmetric fixed-effects models which model changes in health outcomes as a function of transitions into and out of caregiving while accounting for unobserved between-person heterogeneity. Our results show that caregiving is associated with better cognitive health for both men and women, but not with improved biomarker-based allostatic load. Results do not differ by caregiving intensity, irrespective of which amount of time is defined as intense caregiving. Our findings provide support for role enhancement theory, suggesting that caregivers benefit in terms of cognitive functioning, even if a biomarker-based approach to measuring stress-related health outcome does not corroborate an overall health benefit. We formulate implications for policy-making and directions for future research.",

Our results show variations in the importance of international and internal migration research over time, but with a marked dominance of international migration studies in more recent years. We further uncover the geographical bias in migration research, noting a stronger emphasis on high-income countries as the main destinations studied. Overall, we also note considerable shifts in topics over time for both types of migration.

          "abstract": "The Court of Justice frequently redrafts the questions submitted to it by the national courts in the \ncontext of the preliminary reference procedure. The practice is known as reformulation, and \noftentimes determines a change to the substance of the question, which is referred to in this article as  substantial reformulation. The Court justifies its use in the need to provide a useful answer to the \nnational court. This article empirically investigates how the Court uses the submissions of the parties \nand other materials in the case to substantially reformulate. To do so, it builds a framework of analysis  to observe the possible influence of the parties in the changes to the dispute and the justifications used  by the Court. The analysis relies on a unique dataset of 380 hand-coded preliminary rulings on interpretation.\nThe findings confirm that substantive reformulation at the Court is frequent and significant. In \nreformulating the dispute, the Court draws on the materials submitted by the parties, and their \ninfluence can be traced to the questions actually replied to by the Court. Yet, the influence of the \nparties in setting the boundaries of the dispute must not be overstated, as it remains fully within the \nCourt’s control when to reformulate and which materials to use to do so. Furthermore, it is difficult \nto identify patterns in the Court’s use of substantial reformulation. Providing a sufficient answer is a \nconvenient excuse, but it does not seem to fully explain the findings of the article. The article explores other possible explanations for the increasingly frequent revert to reformulation.",

Homelessness has increased especially in areas with greater shortages of affordable private rental housing (relative to demand from low income households). \n\nThe research, ‘The changing geography of homelessness in Australia (2001–21) and its structural drivers’, undertaken for AHURI by researchers from Swinburne University of Technology, Launch Housing and RMIT University, investigates the changing geography of homelessness in Australia from 2001 to 2021 and the role of structural factors, such as poverty and supplies of affordable rental housing, in shaping this geography. \n\nHomelessness was also higher in areas with smaller supplies of social housing relative to demand. The research suggests that an increase in social housing will further significantly reduce homelessness.\n\nIn areas with a greater shortage of affordable rental dwellings, a higher percentage of Specialist Homelessness Service clients are returning for support after having been assisted. As the majority of people experiencing homelessness tend to remain in the same area, localised responses to homelessness are really important. Homelessness services and affordable housing options need to be expanded in areas where they are needed, and not just where existing services are located.\n\nIn order to provide housing to clients who accessed a Specialist Homelessness Service in 2021–22, the research estimated that around 158,000 one- to two-bedroom dwellings and 25,000 three-or-more-bedroom dwellings are needed nationally.

          "abstract": "Neuroscience is traditionally considered a branch of biology, with interdisciplinary influences from a wide range of fields including psychology, computer science, engineering and mathematics. As a result, a computational approach to neuroscience has emerged that analyzes human brain activity as the superposition of signals that yield complex rhythms and nonlinear dynamics. The computational approach assumes that normative properties, such as value, meaning and purpose, that are highly relevant to humanity are somehow emergent from these otherwise mechanical interactions. Here, I propose that brain dynamics reflect an organic whole that, in the words of Iain McGilchrist, is “inextricably linked with values, meaning and purpose.” This proposal suggests that brain activity can be investigated as a “kind of music:” a global, emotive form, the shape of which contains nested information regarding vital physiology and embodied emotionality. Using electroencephalography (EEG) as an example, and drawing on the field of musicology, I review historical and recent evidence that reveals how neurodynamics can be seen more like music or an artistic creation: multi-scale, context sensitive, dynamically evolving, and intrinsically meaningful. This “neurodynamics of music” hypothesis is investigated using a geometric framework that includes rhythms and nonlinear dynamics, but where those properties must be understood in the context of the vital metabolism of living organisms. Vital, homeostatic and emotional signals underpin the recurrent play of anticipation and fulfillment in life, brain activity and from which, differentiated meaning is sculpted from the global whole. Neuroscience can benefit from the tools of the humanities informing its analytic methods, theoretical assumptions and interpretive frameworks. Through reengagement with the musical heart of neurodynamics, we may be more inclined to see our brains, our minds, and ourselves, as creatively meaningful, purposeful and alive.",

In this study, we introduce a new approach to estimate trends in children’s exposure to co-resident parental death in the U.S over the past 25 years (1999-2023). Our methodological approach relies on a fusion model and data simulation that joins recent population and mortality data to estimate children’s exposure to co-resident parental death. The results reveal a subtle rise in parental death each year since the early 2010s: in 2023 alone, more than 300,000 children experienced a co-resident parent’s death. The results further demonstrate that the long-running, steady increase in the annual number of parentally bereaved children accumulates to more than 2.4 million children under 18 in 2023 having ever experienced a parent’s death—representing approximately 3.2% of the child population. The results further demonstrate race and ethnic disparities, with non-Hispanic Indigenous children especially at risk of parental death. Together, the results attest to the need for a comprehensive policy response to support parentally bereaved children, and the need for further scholarly recognition of this uniquely consequential childhood adversity.",
