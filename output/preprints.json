          "title": "Development and Validation of the Media Motivations (MEMO) Scales for Children and Parents",
          "authors": "Bolim Suh; Rachel Barr; Margaret Lee Kerr; Jenny Radesky; Heather Kirkorian",
          "abstract": "The complex associations between child media use and development cannot be fully understood through screen time estimates alone. Parental motivations for media use are one of the factors that may shape the quality of media experiences and ultimately child development and family well-being. However, validated scales to capture parents’ motivations for their own and their children’s media use are lacking. Filling this gap, the current paper describes the development and validation of the Media Motivations for Children (MEMO-C) and Parents (MEMO-P) scales in a sample of 521 parents with young children (2-5 years old). The scales were designed to capture regulatory and relational aspects of child and parent media use. Factor analyses revealed a three-factor structure for each scale (MEMO-C: Regulate, Occupy, and Connect; MEMO-P: Regulate, Relax Alone, and Connect). These factors demonstrated strong psychometric properties including high reliability as well as convergent and incremental validity in predicting child- and parent-related constructs above and beyond screen time estimates and related demographic information. By measuring parental media motivations through a relational lens, these scales enable researchers to more closely examine how family media use is associated with child development and family members’ well-being.",

          "title": "A new perspective on the development of Quebec French rhotic vowels",
          "authors": "Massimo Lipari; Morgan Sonderegger",
          "abstract": "Quebec French is reportedly developing rhoticity, with low F3 resulting from a bunched or retroflexed tongue (like English /ɚ/), in some or all of its front mid rounded vowels /ø, œ, œ̃/. The source of this rare, understudied sound change is unclear from previous work: contact with English and contrast enhancement have been suggested, and phonologization of coarticulation is typologically plausible. We examine this issue, investigating the apparent time change in the F3 trajectories of the three vowels using generalized additive mixed models on a corpus of parliamentary speech (106 speakers from across Quebec). We observe rhoticity in /ø/ and /œ̃ /: men begin with low F3 in these vowels, and women show change in progress. Conversely, there is less clear evidence of change in /œ/. We suggest these findings are best explained by rhoticity being a two-phased change, originally due to borrowing and subsequently spreading through contrast enhancement. Rhotacization, we argue, is the combined product of intensive exposure to English (which led to frequent non-integration of bunched/retroflex segments in loanwords) and an exceptionally large vowel inventory. It thus results from the unique interplay of social and phonological factors in Quebec French, which is consistent with such changes being cross-linguistically rare.",

          "authors": "Suresh Muthukumaraswamy; Matthew Baggott; Eduardo Ekman Schenberg; Dimitris Repantis; Max Wolff; Anna Forsyth; Tehseen Noorani",
          "abstract": "The rapid growth of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) research and considerable debate around PAT’s promise and limitations as a healthcare intervention demand addressing theoretical gaps in PAT development. Traditional clinical trials evaluate PAT as a simple pharmaceutical treatment, overlooking its inherent complexity as a multi-component intervention. This position piece advocates for applying the UK Medical Research Council’s complex intervention framework to PAT, emphasising: theory of therapeutic change, structured development phases, contextual interactions, and stakeholder inclusion. The limitations of standard explanatory clinical trials, particularly their challenges with real-world validity, are contrasted with pragmatic clinical trial designs. Pragmatic randomised controlled trials (RCTs), informed by the PRECIS-2 tool, provide a pathway to align PAT clinical trial designs with real-world applications. This approach enables the exploration of how PAT interacts with existing healthcare systems potentially optimising its therapeutic utility in the intended patient population.  Furthermore, we discuss the philosophical divergence between perspectives on PAT’s efficacy, contrasting drug-centric views with psychotherapy-augmented theories and how this should influence PAT trial design. We propose the integration of qualitative data, adaptive designs, and comparative effectiveness research to refine PAT interventions and address the shortcomings of conventional double-blind RCTs. By leveraging academic and community-led research, this work proposes a pluralistic evidentiary model, enabling more inclusive, practical trial designs that might be considered in expanded evidence assessments. This approach holds the promise of advancing psychedelic medicine while avoiding the historical pitfalls that limited its development in prior decades.",

          "abstract": "Terror Management Theory (TMT) proposes that when people are made aware of their own death, they are more likely to endorse cultural values. TMT is a staple of social psychology, being featured prominently in textbooks and the subject of much research. The implications associated with TMT are significant, as its advocates claim it can partially explain cultural conflicts, intergroup antagonisms, and even war. However, considerable ambiguity regarding effect size exists, and no preregistered replication of death-thought accessibility findings exists. Moreover, there is debate regarding the role of time delay between the manipulation of mortality salience and assessment of key measures. We present results from 22 labs in 11 countries (total N = 3,447) attempting to replicate and extend an existing study of terror management theory, study three from Trafimow and Hughes (2012), and the role of time delay effects. We successfully  replicate Trafimow and Hughes (2012), and demonstrate that it is possible to prime death-related thoughts, and that priming is more effective when there is no delay between the priming and outcome measure. Implications for future research and terror management theory are discussed.",

          "authors": "Mingshan Xu; Antonio Benítez-Burraco",
          "abstract": "Color terms and emotions frequently intertwine in language. Humans systematically associate colors with emotions mostly through metaphor and metonymy. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a fundamental technology in the field of natural language processing (NLP). LLMs like ChatGPT can extract detailed linguistic information from vast amounts of data (generally, corpora of written texts). In this paper, we compare the performance by humans and ChatGPT-4o in an association task involving 13 colors and 20 emotions (and 5 intensities of emotion) in two languages, Spanish and Mandarin. We found that ChatGPT-4o associates colors with emotions similarly to humans, also apprehending cross-linguistic and cross-cultural differences. Nonetheless, some differences also exist. Overall, ChatGPT-4o associates colors with more positive emotions. Furthermore, whereas there are notable differences in the intensities of emotion associated to colors by speakers of Spanish vs Mandarin, the responses by ChatGPT-4o are more homogeneous. In conclusion, ChatGPT-4o is a reliable model of human emotional language, although some qualitative differences with humans persist.",

However, the perception of emotions is also related arousal levels and valence, and more research is needed to determine how depression impacts these dimensions.\n\nAims:  To compare performance on both an objective forced choice emotional recognition task and subjective emotional face valence rating task in participants with self-reported high depression.\n\nMethods: Based on screening using the depression sub-scale of the DASS-42,  46 participants (23 males, 23 female) were in the high depression group (mean DASS-42 34±5) and 50 participants in the control groups (25 males, 25 females) with DASS-42 scores of either 0 or 1. All participants completed both a performance-based task (objective) as well as a rating task (subjective) of emotional facial expressions. \n\nResults: The data indicate that difference in performance exist in classification accuracy between the groups, with depressed participants demonstrating reduced accuracy for anger, sadness and neutral facial expressions. Additionally differences in subjective ratings exist in the depressed group, but with the important caveat that these only relate to faces display positive emotional expressions.\n\nDiscussion: The limitations of relying solely on objective tasks where recognition accuracy is the main outcome measure are discussed as well as the data quantitatively demonstrating a reduced response in the depression group to positive stimuli.  This study justifies the need for future studies using both objective and subjective measures to assess emotion classification deficits in depression.",

Given that individuals experiencing depression symptoms have low motivation to engage in pleasurable activities, this study aimed to explore the effect of mental imagery on activity engagement for pleasurable activities in non-depressed, dysphoric, and depressed individuals (N = 163). Participants selected four activities they wished to engage in and rated expected outcomes and anticipated emotions relating to activity completion before and after mental elaboration of each activity using either mental imagery or verbal reasoning. Over the following week, utilising ecological momentary assessment (EMA), participants recorded the frequency with which they engaged in their chosen activities. Results showed both conditions led to similar levels of behavioural engagement, across all participants, suggesting that both tasks may influence behavioural engagement. Research is now needed to investigate the underlying mechanism/s by which behavioural engagement is occurring.",

          "authors": "Matthew J. Bolton",
          "abstract": "Although research on the topic has taken off in recent years, little remains known about the psychotherapy and counseling service utilization and preferences of autistic persons. Adult autistic laypeople (N = 229) were thus recruited for an exploratory, mixed-methods study. Results indicate that most autistic people have some experience and/or familiarity with psychotherapy and counseling and that from those experiences they have small to moderate preferences, as evidenced by scores on the Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP), for therapist directivity; encouragement of emotional expression and therapist-guided exploration of the therapeutic relationship; focus on the client’s present and future; and warm support and unconditional positive regard rather than strong challenge and confrontation. Respondents valued their therapists holding systemic and social justice-oriented perspectives and preferred their therapists use identity-first language in reference to autism; and held favorable attitudes towards psychotherapy-adjacent supports like medication and self-help books. Most respondents with therapy experience believed they had experienced at some point a “seemingly or overtly harmful” event in meeting with their therapist. These and other findings are discussed. The study also examines considerations relevant to the future use and development of the C-NIP measure.",

          "authors": "Abhishek Baba; Swarag. Thaikkandi; Ark Verma",
          "abstract": "Research suggests that individuals consistently demonstrate favorable attitudes towards members of their ingroups compared to those belonging to other social groups. Such ingroup biases are observed not only in well-established historical groups but also in minimal group settings. The current study investigates the robustness of the said ingroup bias across different contexts through four experiments. In Experiment 1, participants were merely assigned to one of the two minimal groups, and their ingroup bias was assessed. In the next three experiments (Exps 2a- 2c), the relationship between the minimal ingroups and outgroups was manipulated. In Experiment 2a, both groups were described as good and in a mutually harmonious relationship; in Experiment 2b, the two groups were in a conflicted relationship, with the ingroup described as good and the outgroup as bad; and finally, in Experiment 2c, both groups were again in a conflicted relationship with the ingroup being described as bad and the outgroup as good. The degree of ingroup bias was indexed in terms of faster response times, higher accuracy, and greater sensitivity on a perceptual-matching task. Interestingly, while the preliminary analysis showed a significant moderation of bias measures across the four experiments, a more detailed examination using Bayesian regression analysis and Drift-Diffusion Modeling established a strong persistence of ingroup favoritism despite changing group characteristics and relations. The changing relations didn’t affect the robust ingroup bias much as the general trend for favoring one’s own group persisted across all experiments. The minimal yet robust nature of ingroup favoritism is explicated.",

          "abstract": "Growing evidence linking media use to worse child outcomes highlights a need to understand mechanisms driving media use. Past research links media use to infant negative affect, and parents report using media to cope. However, trait-level measures can mask within-person effects that reflect mechanisms more directly. In the current study, 401 predominantly White (70.32%), college-educated (88.03%) parents (75.56% mothers) of an infant 12-24 months old (M=16.43 months, 51.37% boys) completed daily diaries reporting the frequency of parent and child activities, behaviors, and affective states each day for 21 consecutive days. Temporal network modeling was used to examine associations among parents’ daily reports of infant affect, media motivations, and parenting behavior. On days when infants were fussier, parents reported more frequent yelling and more frequent media use to occupy children, regulate children, and regulate parents’ own emotions the same day, and more media to occupy children the next day. The reverse was not true: Media use did not predict negative affect the next day. Using media to relax alone and to regulate children predicted more parent comforting the next day, while using media to connect with children predicted more infant positive affect the next day. Again, the reverse was not true. Thus, temporal effects suggest media use may be an adaptive strategy, at least in the short term. Critically, short-term (i.e., same-day and next-day) within-person effects were not found at the between-person level, underscoring the importance of examining fluctuations within individuals to identify mechanisms and potential intervention targets.",

          "authors": "Jeremy Strueder; Inkyung Park; Paul D. Windschitl",
          "abstract": "Background: Icon arrays, which visually depict frequencies, are commonly recommended for communicating risk information like survival rates. However, they have been found to be ineffective at buffering against motivated reasoning that can lead to undue optimism. To determine whether the impersonal frequency format of icon arrays (reporting a number affected out of a reference class) makes them vulnerable to motivated reasoning, a novel intervention is tested as a means for reducing undue optimism. Methods: Female U.S. participants from Amazon’s MTurk (N=399) imagined a scenario in which their infant would be born extremely preterm. They were presented with icon array information about the survival chances (15-in-100 or 45-in-100) of prematurely born infants with intensive care. For the key intervention, some participants were asked a reflection question immediately after seeing the icon array, which prompted them to indicate what the information meant for their own infant’s percent-chance of survival (i.e., they converted a frequency about a reference class to a probability value about the personal outcome of interest). For other participants, the reflection question merely asked about frequency. The main dependent measure came next and assessed gut-level optimism. Results: People’s gut-level beliefs about their infant’s chances of survival were optimistically biased; the intervention did not reduce this. These gut-level beliefs, rather than the objective survival rate information conveyed through icon arrays, were predictive of subsequent treatment choices. Conclusions: The results suggest that the inability of icon arrays to buffer against motivated reasoning is not due to their frequency format. Moreover, the findings highlight the usefulness of measuring gut-level interpretations of likelihood, which can reveal significant insights into the psychological mechanisms driving patient-treatment choices.",

          "authors": "Eric C Fields",
          "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly common in the psychology and neuroscience literature to use Bayes factors to provide evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. The most common approach reports a Bayes factor that compares the null hypothesis to a “default” alternative. This approach can show that the data is more likely to have been generated under the null hypothesis than under the specific alternative tested, but it cannot provide evidence for the absence of an effect. In fact, analyses using default alternatives can return evidence in favor of the null hypothesis when the data is consistent with medium to large effects. I show that common interpretations of these Bayes factor analyses are misleading, and I provide examples and simulations that help to understand what a Bayes factor in favor of the null does and does not tell us. I argue that Bayes factors have no special ability to help us understand null effects when compared to frequentist methods such as equivalence testing and confidence intervals.",

          "abstract": "Recognition of a word and its meaning benefits from the sensorimotor information about concepts. However, this phenomenon has been underexplored in second language (L2) speakers who may rely on more “shallow” representations. Using a megastudy dataset, we investigate how sensorimotor strength affects L1 and L2 word recognition performance. Bayesian hierarchical regressions revealed that variables associated with physical sensations (interoceptive strength, motor action) and communication experience (head or mouth movement, auditory strength) produced strong effects in both groups. On the other hand, variables associated with concrete objects (visual, haptic experience) and with taste/smell (olfactory, gustatory experience) influenced L1 word recognition performance to a larger extent than in L2. In L2, reliance on semantic information during word recognition is reduced, with stronger effects of lexical variables compared to L1. The findings provide implications for understanding second language processing mechanisms and demonstrate the usefulness of megastudy datasets in investigating L2 conceptual representations.",

          "abstract": "Does a bilingual’s language environment, whether L1- or L2-dominant, modulate their use of language control mechanisms in speech production? The language-switching task (LST) typically assesses two indices of language control: asymmetric switch costs, where switching into L1 incurs greater costs than switching into L2, and reversed language dominance, where L1 becomes slower than L2. We ask if these measures are affected by the language context a bilingual is in and whether the relative balance between languages is sustained after mixed language use. Polish-English unbalanced bilinguals performed the LST in L1- and L2-dominant contexts. We found that language context modulated the magnitude of language control indices. In the L1-dominant context, we replicated effects typical for unbalanced bilinguals: asymmetric switch costs and reversed language dominance. However, in the L2-dominant context, the asymmetry of switch costs was reversed, and the reversed dominance effect decreased. Furthermore, to measure if language dominance reversed from their usual dominance and whether the language context modulations were sustained after leaving, participants named pictures in pure language blocks before (pre-LST) and after (post-LST) LST. Initially, unbalanced bilinguals exhibited a typical L1 dominance (i.e., faster L1 than L2 naming) which reversed during LST and remained reversed post-LST. The modulations of bilingual language control suggest that immediate language context flexibly shapes control mechanisms for effective production, with adjustments persisting beyond the L1- or L2-dominant context. Thus, mechanisms of control are highly adaptive to contextual demands rather than being solely determined by the language proficiency or other fixed speaker traits.",

          "abstract": "Long-standing research suggests that social inferences are captured by a few latent dimensions (e.g., warmth and competence). Others argue that social inferences are more complex but lack empirical support. Here, we conducted two pre-registered studies to test the high-dimensional properties of social inferences. To maximize generalizability, we computationally sampled diverse naturalistic videos and recruited U.S. representative participants (N = 1,598). Participants freely described people in videos using their own words. Cross-validation identified 25 latent dimensions which explained only 15% of the variance in the data. Alternatively, a sparse network model representing the unique correlations between inferences better represented the data. The network models informed the dynamics of naturalistic inferences, revealing how different inferences co-occurred and how they unfolded over time from concrete to abstract (Study 1). The network models also indicated cultural differences in how one inference was related to another between samples (Study 2, Asian N = 651, European N = 792). Together, these findings show that the high-dimensional network approach provides an alternative model for understanding the mental representation of social inferences in naturalistic contexts, which provides new insights into the dynamics and diversities of social inferences beyond the static, universal structure found with traditional low-dimensional latent-construct approaches.",

          "abstract": "Large language models segment many words into multiple tokens, and there is mixed evidence as to whether tokenization affects how state-of-the-art models represent meanings. Chinese characters present an opportunity to investigate this issue: They contain semantic radicals, which often convey useful information; characters with the same semantic radical tend to begin with the same one or two bytes (when using UTF-8 encodings); and tokens are common strings of bytes, so characters with the same radical often begin with the same token. This study asked GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Llama 3 whether characters contain the same semantic radical, elicited semantic similarity ratings, and conducted odd-one-out tasks (i.e., which character is not like the others). In all cases, misalignment between tokens and radicals systematically corrupted representations of Chinese characters. In experiments comparing characters represented by single tokens to multi-token characters, the models were less accurate for single-token characters, which suggests that segmenting words into fewer, longer tokens obscures valuable information in word form and will not resolve the problems introduced by tokenization. In experiments with twelve European languages, misalignment between tokens and suffixes systematically corrupted categorization of words by all three models, which suggests that the tendency to treat malformed tokens like linguistic units is pervasive.",

          "abstract": "The current pre-registered study compared subjective, autonomic and neurophysiological correlates of nocebo hyperalgesia across three groups: Direct Experience (N=20), Social Learning (N=20), and Control (N=20). Participants first underwent a Learning-Phase, where an association between treatment cues and painful thermal stimulation was established. Conditioned responses, induced via social or direct experience, were assessed during the Test-Phase, relative to the control comparator. Pain perception, autonomic arousal, and brain activity were measured via VAS, electrodermal activity, facial action units, and electroencephalography. Both direct and social learning produced significant nocebo hyperalgesia, as indicated by increased pain ratings, autonomic arousal, and modulation of event-related potentials. Increased N2 amplitude, associated with nociceptive processing, was comparable across the two conditioned groups, demonstrating expectancy-driven changes in brain activity irrespective of learning type. While social learning elicited stronger nocebo hyperalgesia in subjective ratings, direct experience was associated with heightened autonomic response and greater activation of facial action units associated with pain during the Learning-Phase. Differences in the trajectory of the autonomic response during the Test-Phase was also observed, with phasic responses diminishing for direct experience but persisting social learning. These findings highlight the role of social information in shaping maladaptive pain responses and highlights the need to mitigate nocebo effects in clinical settings where maladaptive health outcomes can be both directly experienced and socially expressed. By demonstrating distinct behavioural and physiological patterns associated with direct and social learning, this research contributes to understanding the mechanisms underlying expectancy-driven pain modulation.",

          "abstract": "AI writing assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to make autocomplete suggestions to people as they write. Can these AI writing assistants impact people’s attitudes in this process? In two large-scale preregistered experiments (N=2,582), we exposed participants writing about important societal issues to an AI writing assistant that provided biased autocomplete suggestions. When using the AI assistant, the attitudes participants expressed in a post-task survey converged towards the AI’s position. Yet, a majority of participants were unaware of the AI suggestions’ bias and their influence. Further, the influence of the AI writing assistant was stronger than the influence of its suggestions when presented as static text, showing that the influence is partially due to AI writing assistants leading people to incorporate biased viewpoints into their own writing. Lastly, warning participants about assistants’ bias before or after exposure does not mitigate the influence effect.",

          "abstract": "One of the most extensively studied constructs in multisensory research is the temporal window of integration. It has been varyingly estimated by measuring the temporal boundaries within which stimuli in different sensory modalities are perceived as simultaneous or elicit multisensory integration effects. However, there is ample evidence that these approaches produce distinct psychometric outcomes, as the widths of the windows they yield differ even when estimated with equivalent designs and stimuli. In fact, these two estimates can sometimes even be negatively correlated. What is more, the perception of synchrony has been found to be neither necessary nor sufficient for the occurrence of multisensory illusions. This indicates that subjective simultaneity and integration phenomena are dissociable, undermining the conclusions of studies that use them interchangeably. Failing to disentangle the temporal windows in which they occur has led to contradictory findings and considerable confusion in fundamental research that has started extending to other domains. In clinical studies, this confusion has affected work ranging from neuropsychological conditions (such as schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment, dyslexia, and autism) to more general health factors (such as obesity and inflammation); in industrial applications, it is seen in studies using virtual reality, human-computer interfaces, and warning systems in vehicles. In this brief review, we discuss the importance of distinguishing these two constructs. We propose that, while the temporal boundaries of integration phenomena are aptly described as the temporal window of integration (TWI), the temporal boundaries of simultaneity judgments should be referred to as the temporal window of synchrony (TWS).",

We test the hypothesis that perceived realism underpins case strength decisions, where realism reflects a good match between the case and retrieved information. To assess how realism affects juror decisions, jury-eligible subjects (N = 83) read mock criminal cases, rating the strength of each case. Participants also reported their ability to recall a similar case (autobiographical recall), their knowledge of similar cases (factual recall), and the perceived realism of the case. Perceived realism was the most influential component of mock-juror decisions. Additional analyses identified two contributions of perceived realism: a common factor combining realism with memory recall; and an independent factor, as might arise from a mismatch between memory and case evidence. These findings support the hypothesis that complex decisions rely on perceived realism in light of memory retrieval.",

This review presents a systems framework for understanding diverse trajectories in bilingual language acquisition. Drawing on systems theories, we examine how multiple levels of influence interact, from individual factors such as maturational processes that lay the foundation, to immediate language experiences with family and educational contexts that provide learning opportunities. These experiences unfold both dynamically over time, and within broader societal contexts that determine language status and community support. The framework reveals how successful bilingual development depends on alignment across system levels: children, equipped with powerful learning abilities, must meet rich and sustained language experiences, as well as supportive social conditions. This approach illuminates systematic patterns in bilingual development, and emphasizes coordinated, multi-level approaches for supporting bilingual development.",

          "authors": "João Tenório",
          "abstract": "This paper aims to analyze the meanings and feelings represented by semiotic elements available in the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho. The theoretical approach adopted is the Semiotic Cultural Psychology (SCP) in which considers human beings as meaning makers in the world through the mediation of signs. In this paper we consider signs from the Peirce perspective as the representation of objects in the real world and divided into symbols, indexes and icons. From SCP we considered how these signs can represent mediation by pleromatization and schematization in order to understand meanings and feelings represented by field-like signs and point-like signs. In the excerpt from this article, we selected the first episode of the anime Yu Yu Hakusho to understand how meanings and feelings are regulated through existing complexes of signs during the narrative. To achieve this, we cataloged the main semiotic elements of the episode, classifying them as point-like signs or field-like signs. Subsequently, we analyzed which of these signs were part of a semiotic hybrid complex (pleromatization/field-like signs/hyper-generalization) regulating feelings related to the narrative and which expressed constructed and shared meanings (schematization/point-like signs/generalization). In the results, we found that semiotic elements can be considered as narrative devices to involve the viewer in the story based on the intentionality of the author. In the Yu Yu Hakusho first episode, the intentionality is based in the presentation of the character Yusuke and the creation of feelings related to him. In this sense, in order to present who Yusuke is, point-like signs were identified representing some characteristic about him. In the second part of the episode, there was a predominance of field-like signs in order to create some feelings about Yusuke based on the empathy constructed in the first part of the narrative. Then, as related in the literature, mediations by schematization and pleromatization acted all the time in order to relate cognitive elements (meanings constructed about Yusuke) and effective elements (feelings to be felt for Yusuke).",

          "abstract": "Hunger and satiety are key physiological states that regulate food intake and contribute to the maintence of body weight. Identifying appetite phenotypes, such as reduced satiety sensitivity, holds significant potential for developing personalized prevention and treatment strategies for obesity. However, a key challenge in obesity research is the lack of objective, quantitative tools to measure the physiological states of hunger and satiety.  We developed the Food Attentional Bias (FAB) task, a novel, free-viewing eye-tracking paradigm designed to capture shifts in attentional bias toward food (should we add compared with other stimuli?). In this study, we investigated within-subject changes in attentional bias toward food before and after eating in a cohort of healthy-weight individuals  (n=??) using the FAB Task. Our results indicate a marked decrease in dwell time to food stimuli after eating, regardless of counterbalanced condition, BMI, sex, or age. A linear mixed model for relative dwell time revealed a significant effect of the AOI (area of interest) category on dwell time (F(4, 5538) = 43.520, p &lt; .001). Post hoc comparisons for the AOI * Meal interaction revealed that the dwell times for food AOIs were significantly greater premeal than postmeal (mean difference = 0.070, p &lt; .001). These findings suggest that as the body’s satiety signals increase postmeal, the motivational value of food decreases, leading to a reduction in attentional bias toward food stimuli. This dynamic recalibration of attention may act as an objective physiological marker of satiety, illustrating how internal physiological states influence attention allocation following food consumption.",

          "abstract": "It has been more than twenty years since we lamented the lack of large, pragmatic, randomised controlled trials to evaluate novel educational policies.  Whilst there was an evaluation landscape in education this was dominated by quasi-experimental designs that could not, by their very nature, enable the minimisation of selection bias.  Consequently, even well conducted quasi-experiments have the potential to be misleading as their results may be influenced by selection effects.  However, over the last 20 years there has been a sea change, with large pragmatic randomised controlled trials dominating the evaluation landscape especially in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US).  Key funding agencies for educational evaluations in both countries encourage the adoption and prioritisation of ‘true’ experimental designs.  Furthermore, the methodological quality of recent experiments is high with trial registration, large sample sizes, independent randomisation and blinded pre and post testing featuring in many if not most of the published examples. In this paper we summarise the massive progress in the quality and quantity of educational trial design over the last 20 years.  We also describe innovative trial designs that have and are being used to control for various confounders that can still be present in a trial design despite adequate randomisation.",

Reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. \n\nResults: Five themes were generated. The first two focused on factors contributing to the rise in self-diagnosis: (1) Self-diagnosis stems from an inherent need to be understood and (2) Access to diagnostic language has proliferated. The latter three focused on the impact of self-diagnosis on therapy: (3) Self-diagnosis is meaningful therapeutic material; (4) When adolescents feel validated, self-diagnosis often fades over time; and (5) Self-diagnosis becomes a barrier to change when it is inflexible.\n\nDiscussion: The study indicates that, in most cases, clinicians do not consider self-diagnosis as problematic and report it can sometimes help understand the adolescent’s concerns. However, our study also supports concerns about harm to the individual when self-diagnosis is inflexible, and how self-diagnosis could be harmful on a population level if it trivialises psychiatric language and suffering. These findings suggest the need for careful management of self-diagnosis in clinical settings and addressing public discourse that promotes self-diagnosis.",

          "abstract": "Emerging single-process propositional perspectives in psychology and philosophy have introduced the key idea that, much like their explicit (controlled) counterparts, implicit (automatic) attitudes should reflect logical operations such as negation. In the present project, we subject this idea to a particularly stringent test by probing not only whether implicit attitude formation is sensitive to negation but also whether such sensitivity additionally reflects the distinction between easy-to-negate bipolar adjectives (those with clear antonyms, e.g., “strong”) and difficult-to-negate unipolar adjectives (those without clear antonyms, e.g., “unique”). Across four experiments (three preregistered; total N = 6,707), we found (a) no significant difference in implicit attitude formation in response to affirmed bipolar vs. affirmed unipolar adjectives (β = 0.07); (b) modulation of implicit attitude formation by whether adjectives were affirmed or negated (β = 0.67); and, critically, (c) stronger modulation of implicit attitude formation by the negation of bipolar relative to unipolar adjectives (β = 0.23). These results generalized across three sets of adjectives, two implicit attitude measures (the Implicit Association Test and the Affect Misattribution Procedure), and two novel targets (social and nonsocial). Together, these data provide remarkably strong evidence to suggest that implicit attitude formation reflects logical operations, including not only whether an adjective is affirmed or negated but even whether adjectives are relatively easy or difficult to negate. We discuss theoretical implications for single-process and dual-process accounts of attitude formation and higher-order human cognition, as well as translational implications for theoretically informed attempts at modifying preexisting implicit social attitudes.",

Learning was either incidental (Experiments 1-2) or intentional (Experiments 2-4) and occurred under full (Experiments 1-4) or divided (Experiments 3-4) attention. In a test phase, participants were re-presented the effect images and asked to either reproduce or alternate the action that had produced them. Results obtained through cognitive modeling revealed that action-effect relations are primarily represented in explicit memory, with minimal contributions of implicit memory. Intentional learning enhanced memory compared to incidental learning, while divided attention during encoding reduced it, with these factors mainly affecting explicit memory. These findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying skill acquisition and provide insights into the representational nature of action-effect relations.",

          "abstract": "During the last two decades, interest in aversive personality traits increased. Among non-forensic personality features, everyday sadism is said to reflect the most aversive one. A plethora of studies found males to score higher on average in everyday sadism. However, valid comparisons of test scores require that measurement invariance of the test holds between the groups under scrutiny. Using four samples (ntotal = 2,909 [70% female]), we tested for gender-related measurement invariance of all currently available everyday sadism self-report measures. We found partial scalar invariance for the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies (regardless of the inclusion of a method factor), scalar invariance for the Assessment of Sadistic Personality (irrespective of the inclusion of a method factor) and the Comprehensive Assessment of Sadistic Tendencies, and partial metric invariance for the Short Sadistic Impulse Scale. The everyday sadism subscale from the Short Dark Tetrad did not even exhibit configural invariance; the respective subscale from the Mixed Short Dark Tetrad yielded partial scalar invariance only when a method factor was included. These findings have important implications for gender-specific expressions of everyday sadism that need to be considered in scale development and the interpretations of test scores.",

          "abstract": "Acoustic amplitude modulation (AM) patterns carry important information, particularly in speech. AM masking, influenced by frequency selectivity in the modulation domain, is considered a crucial factor for speech intelligibility in noisy environments. Based on recent evidence suggesting an age-related decline in AM frequency selectivity, this study investigated whether increased AM masking in older listeners is associated with reduced speech intelligibility. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured using tone-vocoded speech and maskers with no modulation, broadband AM, or narrowband AM at varying modulation frequencies. AM masked thresholds were assessed for a 4-Hz target modulation frequency. The study included young (N=14, 19-25 years) and older (N=14, 57-79 years) listeners with normal hearing. It was hypothesized that SRTs would be higher for the older group with modulated maskers and that the age-related increase in SRT would depend on the masker’s modulation frequency content.  The speech intelligibility results showed that maskers with broadband AM produced higher SRTs than unmodulated maskers. However, SRTs varied little with masker-modulation center frequency across the range tested (2-32 Hz). While older listeners exhibited lower AM frequency selectivity than young listeners, they did not consistently exhibit higher SRTs than their young counterparts across maskers. However, there was a trend for the effect of age to be greater for maskers with broadband AM than for unmodulated maskers. Overall, despite supportive trends, the results do not conclusively demonstrate that older listeners are more susceptible than young listeners to AM masking of speech.",

          "abstract": "Visual cross-modal conflicts occur when visual distractors interfere with auditory task performance. However, the specific effects of semantic and non-semantic visual distractors, particularly their neural dynamics, remain poorly understood. This study investigated the impact of semantic and non-semantic visual cross-modal conflicts on auditory working memory performance and its neural mechanisms, as revealed by an electroencephalogram (EEG). Thirty-nine healthy, right-handed young adults participated, completing the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) under three conditions: no visual distractor, semantic visual distractors (digits), and non-semantic visual distractors (symbols). Both semantic and non-semantic distractors significantly reduced task accuracy compared to the no-distractor condition, with semantic distractors producing stronger interference, as reflected in longer reaction times (RT) and higher omission rates (MR). Event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed that both conflicts elicited larger P200 amplitudes, more negative N200 amplitudes, and delayed P300 latencies. The semantic conflict elicited more negative N200 amplitudes at the frontal region, while the non-semantic conflict evoked smaller P300 amplitudes and longer P300 latencies at the central region. Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between changes in behavioral performance and ERP components. Specifically, ∆P300 amplitude negatively correlated with ∆RT and ∆Error rate in the semantic conflict condition. ∆N200 amplitude negatively correlated with ∆Accuracy and ∆RT, and ∆P300 latency positively correlated with ∆MR in the non-semantic conflict condition. These findings demonstrate that visual cross-modal conflicts disrupt auditory working memory task performance, involving both specific and general mechanisms for resolving semantic and non-semantic conflicts.",

          "authors": "Valerio Placidi; Matteo P. Lisi; Salvatore Maria Aglioti",
          "abstract": "Understanding the psychological, cultural, and social factors that shape attitudes toward mafia-type organized crime (MCOs) and influence collective anti-mafia action is crucial, yet research on this topic remains limited. Existing studies have largely focused on cognitive and affective variables, such as beliefs about social change, romanticization of MCOs, and vicarious shame, while the effects of demographic, personality and contextual factors have been overlooked. Additionally, the interplay between implicit and explicit processes in shaping behavior toward MCOs, and the role of individual differences in determining knowledge about the mafia phenomenon remain unclear.\n\nTo address these gaps, we conducted two online studies with Italian participants. In Study 1 (N = 220), participants recalled names of well-known figures associated with either mafia-type crime or the anti-mafia movement. Their intentions to engage in collective anti-mafia action were measured via self-report. In Study 2 (N = 150), participants completed a face recognition task involving mafia and anti-mafia figures, alongside an innovative mouse-tracking assessment to capture implicit anti-mafia collective action intentions.\n\nOur findings suggest that demographic factors (i.e., news reading frequency, media exposure, education, birth and residence region), personality traits (i.e., extroversion, openness, conscientiousness), social orientations (i.e., attitudes toward MCOs, civic engagement, system justification) and contextual factors (i.e., perceived risk and efficacy) influence implicit and/or explicit anti-mafia intentions. Notably, participants’ age, attitudes toward mafia-type crime, news reading frequency, and occupation predicted the recognition frequency of mafia and/or anti-mafia figures. Finally, recall and recognition were higher for anti-mafia personalities than for mafia members.\n\nThese results contribute to an underexplored research area and have practical implications for designing evidence-based interventions to counter mafia culture and promote civic engagement against organized crime.",

          "abstract": "The experience sampling method (ESM) has become a popular tool across various fields of\npsychology. However, the intensive nature of ESM raises concerns about careless\nresponding, where participants respond to questionnaires without paying sufficient\nattention to them. To better understand careless responding in the context of ESM, this\nstudy investigated its temporal dynamics across three commonly used sample types\n(community, student, clinical). We leveraged four careless responding indicators from\nprevious research — response time, within-beep standard deviation, an inconsistency\nindex, and occasion-person correlation — and used univariate and multivariate multilevel\nmodels to examine their trajectories over time, both over the course of the study and over\nthe course of a day. Our results demonstrate that careless responding is not a stable\nphenomenon but changes over time, with evidence for increases in carelessness across days\nand non-stationarity within days across the different samples. Furthermore, our findings\nimply that the indicators differ in their ability to capture carelessness: while response time,\nwithin-beep standard deviation, and the inconsistency index show potential for capturing\ncarelessness, occasion-person correlation appears unsuited for an ESM context. The\npresence of few and small associations among the indicators indicates that they flag\ndistinct and independent kinds of carelessness and thus complement one another, making it\nadvisable to use multiple indicators where possible. Overall, our findings underscore the\nimportance of considering the temporal dynamics of carelessness in ESM studies and\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the indicators in assessing it.",

          "abstract": "Do ideological differences in moral concern reflect a true reversal of ethical priorities, or do liberals simply extend moral concern more broadly without compromising their commitment to close relationships? Across two large-scale reanalyses, we test the claim that liberal moral universalism comes at the expense of concern for close others. First, we analyze a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 1,000) weighted to match census benchmarks. Second, we conduct an integrative reanalysis of four large online convenience samples (N = 3,201; Prolific). Using the Moral Expansiveness Scale (MES), a widely used measure of moral concern, we examine how ideology shapes moral circles and whether concern for distant others competes with––or coexists alongside––care for those closer to home. Results show that greater concern for distant entities, including outgroups and non-human entities, positively correlates with concern for close others rather than displacing it. Moreover, across the ideological spectrum, ingroup favoritism remains a strong and consistent pattern. However, very conservative individuals in the representative sample showed no meaningful difference between their moral concern for ingroups and outgroups, driven not by heightened outgroup concern but by lower concern for close others. These findings challenge the notion that liberals neglect their immediate social circles and instead suggest that ideological differences in moral expansiveness stem from the degree to which concern extends outward. Our results have important implications for understanding how ideological worldviews shape moral priorities, particularly in a political climate where moral concern is often framed in zero-sum terms.",

Regression analyses\nrevealed that the Big Five personality traits (R2 = 31%) explained the greatest share of variance\nin class membership, followed by perceived event characteristics (R2 = 8%).

          "abstract": "Background: The development of generative AI systems like ChatGPT has provoked debates about their effective use in educational settings.\n\nAims: The present study explores how university students prompt ChatGPT to solve complex non-routine problems, specifically examining which prompts are associated with higher or lower problem-solving performance.\n\nSample: Seventy-seven university students (53 women; Mage = 22.4 years) participated in the study.\n\nMethods: To identify various prompt types employed by students, the study utilized qualitative analysis of interactions with ChatGPT 3.5 during the resolution of the creative problem-solving task. Participants’ performance was measured by the quality, elaboration, and originality of their ideas. Subsequently, two-step clustering was employed to identify groups of low- and high-performing students. Finally, process mining techniques (heuristics miner) were used to analyze the interactions of low- and high-performing students.\n\nResults: The findings suggest that including clear evaluation criteria when prompting ChatGPT to generate ideas (rs = .38), providing ChatGPT with an elaborated context for idea generation (rs = .47), and offering specific feedback (rs = .45), enhances the quality, elaboration, and originality of the solutions. Successful problem-solving involves iterative human-AI regulation, with high performers using an overall larger number of prompts (d = 0.82). High performers interacted with ChatGPT through dialogue, where they monitored and regulated the generation of ideas, while low performers used ChatGPT as an information resource.\n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the importance of active and iterative engagement for creative problem-solving and suggest that educational practices should foster metacognitive monitoring and regulation to maximize the benefits of human-AI collaboration.",

Half of the applicants were unaware that their sexual orientation was relevant to the asylum decision. Approximately one third of applicants cited either concerns about the confidentiality of the interview or discomfort with disclosure. One in five applicants referred to a professional involved in the registration or asylum interview as a barrier to disclosure. Against established asylum guidelines, in two case decisions, the credibility of the applicant’s explanation for delaying disclosure was not evaluated. To encourage disclosure, information regarding the eligibility criteria for asylum should be more readily available to asylum applicants; moreover, applicants’ explanations for the delayed disclosure should be carefully evaluated in all cases, with regard for the psychological barriers to sharing sensitive personal information. Finally, psychological research should test and validate interviewing techniques that enhance trust and rapport in the asylum context.",

          "authors": "Shawn Prest",
          "abstract": "Meditative experience has long been associated with conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity to phenomena, increased present moment perception and more pleasant experience. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such meditative “deconstruction” are not well understood, with no formal computational models available to explicate how deconstruction alters perception and action during meditation. Using the active inference framework, I demonstrate that the phenomenology of deconstruction–in terms of conceptual attenuation, reduced reactivity and shorter temporal scale perception–naturally emerges from the dynamics of hierarchical inference when the deconstructive notion of letting go is cast as a reduction in belief precision over hidden states at a specific level of the generative model. I present a formal hierarchical three-level generative model and simulate deconstruction as an intervention in a facial recognition task, where the agent selects a letting go policy when perceived affective valence becomes excessively negative. The results demonstrate that the capacity to deconstruct permits agents to self-regulate experienced affect via letting go. The model offers a novel perspective within the paradigm of computational phenomenology on conceptual attenuation, equanimity, stillness and affect during meditative deconstruction.",

There has been consensus around the principles governing this process: lexical items are activated immediately and incrementally as speech arrives, perceptual and lexical representations rapidly decay to make room for new information, and lexical entries are temporally structured. In this framework, speech processing is tightly coupled to the temporally unfolding input. However, recent work challenges this: low-level auditory and higher-level lexical representations do not decay but are retained over long durations; speech perception may require encapsulated memory buffers; lexical representations are not strictly temporally structured; and listeners can delay lexical access substantially in some circumstances.

Optimal performance requires switching clusters in a manner that maximizes the rate of retrieving words, known as the marginal value theorem. Previous work has found evidence for this in semantic fluency. The current study tests whether people adhere to the marginal value theorem in letter fluency and whether executive functioning is associated with optimal performance. Three letter cues (T, N, and J) and one semantic cue (animals) were administered. Results are consistent with optimal search in N and J, but not T or animals. These findings provide mixed support that people search optimally during letter fluency.",

We applied this methodology to the semantic fluency task (listing items from a category) and find that category- specific weights can be used to identify the semantic category of a fluency list.

          "abstract": "Although horror media is designed to elicit fear and anxiety, many individuals with elevated anxiety symptoms report being drawn to horror and even using it as a coping mechanism. This paper provides a theoretical framework explaining why anxious individuals might engage with horror media and how such engagement could be harnessed to alleviate anxiety and build psychological resilience. First, I outline how specific features of horror media may provide immediate anxiety relief through mechanisms like distraction, perceived control, and physiological regulation. I then propose that repeated exposure to fear-inducing content in horror can foster long-term psychological benefits by enhancing emotional clarity, challenging emotional reasoning, increasing tolerance of somatic experiences, and promoting cognitive reappraisal. These processes are discussed in relation to principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy, highlighting how horror media may serve as a novel, accessible tool for anxiety management. Finally, I outline critical avenues for future research. By integrating insights from clinical psychology, media studies, and neuroscience, this paper lays the groundwork for understanding horror media’s potential role in therapeutic contexts.",

In our modeling framework, numerical values of model parameters map onto specific cognitive processes (e.g., attention or working memory) involved in gaze control. Because of the general architecture of the mathematical model and our robust procedures in model inference via Bayesian data assimilation, our framework may find applications in other fields of developmental and cognitive sciences.",

We show how to combine large language models, retrieval-augmented personification (a novel variant of retrieval-augmented generation), and custom code-based logic to create a psychology engine that simulates realistic patient responses by emulating several key psychological mechanisms: short- and long-term memory, varying levels of conscious awareness about topics (as well as modulation of such awareness), and dynamic mood states where attitudes toward topics of conversation evolve over the course of the dialogue. We also describe algorithms for creating realistic patients with coherent symptom profiles and backstories. Taken together, these tools produce a realistic training partner for an MHP, enabling both training-at-scale as well as automated evaluation of specific skill sets. We discuss how our psychology engine framework makes training qualified MHPs more efficient and scalable, facilitates the continuing education needed as potential new treatments such as psychedelics emerge from clinical trials.",

This review presents a systems framework for understanding diverse trajectories in bilingual language acquisition.

These experiences unfold both dynamically over time, and within broader societal contexts that determine language status and community support. The framework reveals how successful bilingual development depends on alignment across system levels: children, equipped with powerful learning abilities, must meet rich and sustained language experiences, as well as supportive social conditions. This approach illuminates systematic patterns in bilingual development, and emphasizes coordinated, multi-level approaches for supporting bilingual development.",

In one domain of collective action, labor unionization, membership in the US has continuously declined since the 1980s. Despite this decline, recent surveys suggest that pro-union sentiment is rising. Amid workplace inequity and rising public interest in unionization, we draw from research on collective action and organizational identification to examine whether exposure to worker-organization conflict and information about unions changes how workers evaluate existing and novel organizational grievance procedures, and consequently, increases pro-union sentiment. Across four studies (N = 3,143), we find that exposure to workplace conflicts and information about unions reduces workers’ perceived alignment with organizational grievance procedures and increases pro-union attitudes, relative to control conditions where participants are not exposed to information about unions.

          "abstract": "Human learners often seek information rationally: they prefer more informative over less informative data, and ask questions that optimally discriminate between competing hypotheses. But this picture holds only in simple, controlled settings: in more complex tasks, the computations needed for optimal information seeking become intractable and human inquiry empirically is often far from optimal.  How do people effectively navigate the information landscapes the real world presents? We propose a model of information-seeking under representational constraints, which simplifies complex data used to make inferences and seeks information rationally with respect to its costs.  Six behavioral experiments using two popular search games support this account: we find that people reason imprecisely and make queries in ways that are objectively uninformative under standard models, but are actually efficient given their limited representational capacity. Participants also increasingly prefer simpler, less informative queries as they gain experience in a task, suggesting rapid adaptation to their cognitive limits. Our findings challenge theories of human information-seeking based on an idealized notion of rationality and instead support a more nuanced and realistic view: people are limited in what information they can represent but have information-seeking strategies that are efficient given those limits.",

          "abstract": "Objective\n\nResearch indicates higher prevalence of dissociative experiences in adolescents than in adults. However, the exact phenomenology and underlying mechanisms of dissociation in adolescence have yet to be clarified. The current study explores the presentation of, and possible psychological factors underlying, dissociation in this population.\n\nMethod\n\nTwo online self-report surveys captured data from 3076 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. Participants completed the Černis Felt Sense of Anomaly (ČEFSA) scale of felt sense of anomaly-type dissociation, alongside measures of mechanisms implicated in a cognitive-behavioural model of dissociation in adults (cognitive appraisals, alexithymia, and affect intolerance). N=409 completed the ČEFSA scale at a second timepoint, one month later.\n\nResults\n\nMost (91.87%) adolescents endorsed at least one ČEFSA item. The mean number of endorsed items was 13.00 (SD = 9.67). The most endorsed factors of the ČEFSA were Altered Sense of Agency (82.96%), Anomalous experience of the Self (76.76%), and Altered Sense of Connection (73.76%).\n\nMediation analysis indicated that emotion regulation (expressive suppression) mediated the relationship between Time One and Time Two dissociation scores: greater suppression was associated with greater dissociation one month later. No other tested variables showed statistically significant mediation.\n\nConclusions\n\nAdolescents are likely to experience dissociation as detachment and disconnection, particularly relating to their selfhood and external world (i.e., depersonalisation and derealisation). \nThis study suggests that the key element of a recent cognitive-behavioural model of dissociative experiences in adults – that affect intolerance perpetuates dissociation – may also be applicable in adolescence.",

Network modelling can reveal these relationships, but it has rarely been conducted with prospective, naturalistic data. We explored networks looking at prospective relationships between negative and positive emotions on one hand and transdiagnostic eating-related behaviors (hunger, food craving, and calorie intake) on the other. These variables were assessed six times a day across eight days in female participants with Binge-Eating Disorder (BED, N=37), Bulimia Nervosa (BN, N=42), and Anorexia Nervosa of the binge-purge (AN-BP, N=26) and restrictive (AN-R, N=29) subtypes. Most prominent were associations of calorie intake with subsequent negative affect, seen in every group, particularly in BN. We also observed several possible affect-mediated pathways for restriction: in BN and AN-BP, hunger predicted reduced negative affect, and there were clear restriction- and hunger-promoting feedback loops mediated by emotional responses; in AN-R, depression predicted less hunger and desire-to-eat. We also observed differing patterns of emotional eating. AN-R showed positive emotional eating, with happiness predicting desire-to-eat and thereby eating. BED showed negative emotional eating, with worry predicting subsequent hunger and desire-to-eat, and irritation predicting calorie intake. AN-R and BN showed bored eating, while AN-BP showed no negative emotional eating whatsoever. Lastly, when it comes to emotional experience, patients with AN-BP experienced the most intense and persistent negative affect across the sample, and their network was most dissimilar to that of AN-R, supporting their study as a separate group with elevated emotional distress.",

Specifically, the authors propose a framework that combines citation impact and sample size of the original articles as a metric for assessing replication value. This implies that original studies with higher scores on this metric can be prioritized for replication efforts.\n \nWe thoroughly agree with the authors' assumption, and indeed support the view of working towards an optimal framework that helps the community achieve maximum research impact from the replication efforts.

We received 190 eligible responses of which 91 were randomized into the ‘without spin’-condition and 99 into the ‘with spin’-condition. \nInterventions   We selected 10 abstracts from published RCTs that investigated behavioural treatments for depression. The RCTs had at least one nonsignificant primary outcome and an abstract conclusion that claimed a beneficial effect despite that nonsignificant primary outcome. We rewrote the abstracts to create a spinless version of each of the 10 abstracts. Participants were randomly assigned to read one version of one of the 10 abstracts and answer questions about the study described in the abstract. \nOutcome measures   The primary outcome was the participants’ perception of the effectiveness of the treatment proposed in the abstract, rated on a scale from 0 to 10. \nResults   The Bayesian analysis showed no convincing support for an effect of spin on the participants’ perception of the treatment effectiveness (posterior mean = 0.53, SE = 0.27, 95% CI [-0.01, 1.07]; posterior mode = 0.54, 95% HDI [-0.02, 1.06]).

          "abstract": "Selectively focusing attention allows us to prioritize specific information within working memory. The current study investigates the consequences of focused attention for prioritized information in visual working memory. Specifically, in three behavioral experiments, we study how focused attention modulates the distractor susceptibility of mental representations that are the object of focused attention, using different prioritization modes (spontaneous, cued-based, and reward-based prioritization). When we relied on spontaneous prioritization in Experiments 1a and 1b, our findings indicated that information in the focus of attention is as vulnerable to perceptual interference as information represented elsewhere in working memory, and this did not change over time. When prioritization was externally-guided in Experiment 2, we found information in the focus of attention to be either protected from perceptual interference (when using cue-based prioritization) or as vulnerable as information represented elsewhere in working memory (when using reward-based prioritization), regardless of when the priority signal was presented (before, during, or after encoding). Thus, overall, distractor susceptibility of information in working memory was revealed to be either reduced (when cue-based) or unaffected (when spontaneous or reward-based) by prioritization, but never increased in the current study. Theoretical implications for the focus of attention are discussed.",

Growing evidence suggests that people often rely on mental simulations to evaluate probability and risky events. However, prior experimental findings offer conflicting predictions about how utility biases this mental sampling process. Across four experiments (total N=206, with Experiment 4 pre-registered), we investigated the influence of utility using a random generation paradigm. These responses were then compared to probability judgments and predictions. While we identified individual differences, the majority of participants exhibited neutrality, with no systematic impact of utility on their sampling distributions. Nevertheless, biases emerged under specific conditions, including a preference for smaller or more probable outcomes as the starting point of simulations and optimism in single-response predictions. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting that probability judgments, predictions, and random generation tasks may rely on a shared underlying mental process. Our findings suggest that models of judgment and decision-making should account for individual differences in utility influences, particularly distinguishing between unbiased sampling and optimistic sampling—the selective over-representation of high-utility outcomes.",

          "abstract": "A Ganzfeld is a homogeneous visual field, devoid of any focal points. Such a stimulus has been used by researchers to study perceptual phenomena in the absence of changes in sensory structure. Others have used it to study altered states of consciousness (ASCs). Until now, these different facets have been studied separately with little attention for the emotional subjective experience. This study aimed to elucidate the perceptual, phenomenal, and emotional experience of the multifaceted Ganzfeld using a multi-method approach combining behavioral (eye-tracking) and neural (EEG) measures, with qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires) assessments. We show that Ganzfeld spaces induce ASCs and offer immersive, full-body experiences, including bodily effects. Our results pertaining to bodily sensations further prompted us to identify a perceptually grounded processing type with either an inward-directed or externally-directed focus. We also identified the presence of an abstract cognitive processing type characterized by an introspective focus and meditative experiences. At the behavioral level, decays were characterized by decreased eye movements. The lag in reporting decays and the subjective experience of decays point to the notion of mind blanking. At the neural level, we found increased theta activity preceding decays, further hinting at a potential interrelation between perceptual decays and mind blanking. Finally, decays were characterized by more alpha activity, indicating attenuated sensory processing and a relaxed state. Our findings contribute to a more in-depth understanding of all the components contributing to the rich Ganzfeld experiences.",

Shorter rhythmic cycles were learned and recalled by Culturally Familiar Non-Musicians and Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians, while longer ones posed challenges. Culturally Unfamiliar Non-musician participants showed no learning or recall for the four rhythmic cycles. The effect of length did not stand in isolation and was impacted by the chunking process, observed when Culturally Unfamiliar Musicians differentiated the 10-beat rhythmic cycle even before learning.",

          "abstract": "Understanding consumer search behavior is crucial for businesses and policymakers aiming to effectively engage with consumers through product offerings and interventions. Consumer search in service for choice remains a significant topic in marketing, economics, and psychology although existing theories differ in fundamental assumptions and methodological approaches. Theoretical assumptions range from the order in which items are searched being independent of their value, to search being influenced by cognitive and visual factors. Methodological approaches vary from directly observing search (with eye tracking or click stream data), to inferring search from choice data alone. This article proposes a framework for integrating theoretical and methodological approaches to consumer search. This integration will help marketers and policymakers compare and apply theories to different contexts. Ultimately, it paves the way to a unified framework for understanding and guiding consumer behavior as well as strategic decisions in marketing and policy. We review five prominent theoretical models, each with distinct terminologies. For each model, we review its background, aims, core assumptions, and provide illustrative examples. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we initiate a synthesis to resolve terminological differences and outline a path toward theory integration, and (2) we discuss how our framework can guide future research and foster a more comprehensive understanding of consumer search and choice.",

We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1) Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2) Trust in the labels and 3) Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s\nbelief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by defining a design space for label  implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of \nlabels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.",

          "abstract": "Behaving randomly can be advantageous: it prevents others from capitalizing on patterns in our behavior. Unfortunately, the consensus from sixty years of psychological research is that people cannot do so: when attempting to be random, people’s responses exhibit systematic patterns. Random phenomena, however, are not instantaneously random. They require sufficient time between observations (e.g. the weather) or for enough iterations of a randomizing process to have occurred (e.g. card shuffling). It is unknown whether human sequences can be random if afforded such delays. Here we show that a modest temporal separation between items can make human sequences indistinguishable from random ones. We carried out our own experiment (N = 54) and analyzed ten existing datasets with different production rates, response sets, and response modalities. We found that when the delay between items was between two and four seconds, differences between human and random sequences disappeared. Furthermore, by comparing sequences produced by the same participants at different speeds, we confirmed that when participants make an effort, the needed delay is independent of production rate, akin to the weather. Our results show that people are able to generate randomness, and within a few seconds, giving us an accessible protection against potential exploits.",

          "abstract": "Facial attractiveness influences social life, and a series of experimental and computational studies have been conducted to provide insights into such outcomes. Computational deep-learning studies have been conducted to predict facial attractiveness and explore its contributing factors. Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the mainstay of these analyses, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model has recently attracted considerable attention. In this study, facial attractiveness prediction models were constructed using CNN-based models or ViT, and the facial regions the models focused on were identified. While the CNN focused on local features, particularly facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth, the visual geometry group 19 (VGG19), a CNN model with a deep architecture, covers a wider range. In contrast, ViT focuses on global features, such as skin texture and facial contours, suggesting that it may reflect holistic processing based on the relationships between facial parts. In research on understanding facial attractiveness factors using deep learning models, the extracted facial features differ by model architecture, advocating the need for an approach that considers both local and global features based on the research objective.",

Confirming these predictions, prior research has shown that acoustic change and unpredictable sound features are linked to increases in physiological arousal and disruption of concurrent task performance. However, it remains unclear whether linguistic features, such as phonemic and lexical/semantic surprisal, help drive attentional orienting, or whether instead attentional capture takes place prior to linguistic analysis. To address this question, we introduce a new technique for assessing attentional capture by naturalistic task-irrelevant speech. In this paradigm participants tap to a metronome while ignoring a spoken passage from an audiobook. Salient features of the task-irrelevant speech capture attention, increase arousal, and expand subjective time, leading to shifts in tap timing. We show that distortions of subjective time are driven not only by acoustic change but also by phonemic surprisal. Thus, attentional orienting to sound takes place after the initial stages of linguistic analysis.",

          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that the phonological production of words does not follow a single pathway, as was assumed in the past. Rather, some words are produced via dedicated production pathways. Previous studies showed such pathway separation for words from different categories (e.g., number versus non-number words) or with different meanings (number words with numerical versus non-numerical meaning, e.g., ‘Nine West’). Here, we show that the separation of phonological production pathways is even greater than that: even the same word with the same meaning can follow different phonological production pathways, depending on the context in which the word is produced. We report HLI, a woman with aphasia. She erred in 5 number-production tasks, all with phonological output but with different input modalities: digits, written number words, dice patterns, encyclopedic questions, and approximate quantities. We conclude she had impaired phonological production of number words. Critically, she performed relatively well in 3 other phonological number production tasks: oral calculation, counting, and repetition. This dissociation indicates multiple phonological production pathways for verbal numbers. We propose that HLI has a deficit in a default phonological production pathway, which serves most number-production tasks. At the same time, other, dedicated pathways of phonological number production, which are recruited uniquely by the calculation, counting, and repetition tasks, are spared. Finally, we propose a concrete model that explains when and how the dedicated, task-specific phonological-access pathways are created, and we show that HLI’s performance satisfies a central prediction of this model.",

          "abstract": "Isager, van ’t Veer and Lakens (2021) proposed a quantitative operationalization of replication value (denoted RVCN), using average yearly citation count and sample size as proxies for value and uncertainty, respectively. In this commentary, we suggest that the approach of Isager et al., while a good theoretical departure point, oversimplifies the complex decision-making process that underpins replication target selection in practice. We present what we view as some issues with RVCN, notably the use of citation count and ambiguity as to whether RVCN is prescriptive or descriptive. We also present preliminary empirical evidence that RVCN diverges on its performance as a replication target selection method, compared with existing selection methods (such as those published by us in the past). We conclude with the recommendation that going forward, approaches should emphasize the multifaceted nature of replication target selection to maximize their practical utility.",

          "authors": "Noa Handelsman; dror dotan",
          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that the phonological production of words does not follow a single pathway, as was assumed in the past. Rather, some words are produced via dedicated production pathways. Previous studies showed such pathway separation for words from different categories (e.g., number versus non-number words) or with different meanings (number words with numerical versus non-numerical meaning, e.g., ‘Nine West’). Here, we show that the separation of phonological production pathways is even greater than that: even the same word with the same meaning can follow different phonological production pathways, depending on the context in which the word is produced. We report HLI, a woman with aphasia. She erred in 5 number-production tasks, all with phonological output but with different input modalities: digits, written number words, dice patterns, encyclopedic questions, and approximate quantities. We conclude she had impaired phonological production of number words. Critically, she performed relatively well in 3 other phonological number production tasks: oral calculation, counting, and repetition. This dissociation indicates multiple phonological production pathways for verbal numbers. We propose that HLI has a deficit in a default phonological production pathway, which serves most number-production tasks. At the same time, other, dedicated pathways of phonological number production, which are recruited uniquely by the calculation, counting, and repetition tasks, are spared. Finally, we propose a concrete model that explains when and how the dedicated, task-specific phonological-access pathways are created, and we show that HLI’s performance satisfies a central prediction of this model.",

          "abstract": "The built environment profoundly influences human cognition and behavior, with light playing a crucial role in modulating attentional processes. This study investigates the interplay between attentional load and correlated color temperature (CCT) on neural activity using electroencephalography (EEG) during scene perception. Twenty participants were exposed to combinations of three different CCTs (2000K, 6000K, 10000K) within a virtual coffee shop environment, presented from four different angles. During the experiment, participants completed a visual detection task under both low and high attentional load conditions. EEG data were analyzed using frequency analysis to assess alpha-band (8–13 Hz) oscillations, a key neural marker of attentional engagement. Results revealed that high attentional load led to significant alpha suppression, particularly in the right hemisphere, indicating increased cognitive demand. While a trend of greater alpha-band modulation was observed as a function of lighting (from blue-enriched to warm lighting), this effect did not reach statistical significance. These findings highlight the potential role of lighting conditions in shaping attentional processes and suggest that thoughtful lighting design may contribute to creating environments that support cognitive engagement. Optimizing lighting environments in spaces designed for both focus and relaxation could enhance productivity and well-being by accommodating diverse cognitive demands.",

          "abstract": "In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms—e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1) Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2) Trust in the labels and 3) Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s\nbelief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by defining a design space for label  implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of \nlabels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.",

          "abstract": "Self-Categorization Theory (Turner et al., 1987; 1994) has proven itself to be one of the most influential and robust explanatory theories in social cognition. Its two foundational texts have been cited almost 25,000 times and it has spurred theoretical, empirical, and applied research across a wide array of topics. Despite its successes, I will argue in this talk that its theoretical commitment to a “Roschian” prototype view of categorization holds it back. In particular, I will argue that its reliance on the “principle of meta-contrast” for category discrimination (1) renders it computationally intractable; and (2) saddles it with a model of semantic content that does not meet the criterion of naturalness. I will propose instead that Fodor’s (1995; Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn, 2015) “conceptual atomism” should be adopted. I will outline Fodor’s critiques of what he refers to as the “inferential role semantics” of prototype models and discuss their relevance to self-categorization. I will then explore the implications for Self-Categorization Theory of adopting a conceptual atomism approach, with a particular emphasis on issues of context dependence, prototypicality, and perceiver readiness.",

We investigated double standards in judging collective action—that is, whether observers judge the same protest actions to be more acceptable depending on who the protesters are and what they are protesting. In two studies, we used item response theory to develop an instrument of 25 controversial protest actions to measure where people draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable forms of collective action. In three preregistered experiments (N = 2776), we found no consistent evidence for ingroup bias in terms of social class when judging protests for workers’ rights (Experiment 1), in terms of race when judging protests for and against defunding the police (Experiment 2), and in terms of gender when judging protests for and against restricting abortion (Experiment 3). Instead, we found that progressive participants (Experiments 1–3) who rejected system-justifying beliefs (Experiments 1–2) considered the same protest actions more acceptable when a cause aligned with their ideological orientation (for workers’ rights, for defunding the police, against restricting abortion) than when it did not (against defunding the police, for restricting abortion). Conservative participants considered the same actions somewhat more acceptable when protesters supported, rather than opposed, restricting abortion (Experiment 3) but considered all protest actions, for and against defunding the police, equally unacceptable (Experiment 2). Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for understanding the often-divided response to social movements.",

Standard, stationary eye tracking has been used to test for age differences in attention and cognition toward understanding decline trajectories and identifying ways to enhance functioning into late life. More recently, advanced methods of at-home eye tracking, mobile eye tracking, and simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and eye tracking have suggested promise for insight into more dynamic and naturalistic processes of visual attentional and cognitive processing as well as their brain correlates in aging. Here, we outline challenges, best practices, and novel frontiers in the use of eye-tracking methodology among older adults. We cover considerations pertaining to optimized age-tailored study designs and procedures, eye-tracker setup as well as data quality and analysis. Throughout, we reflect on our experiences conducting novel experiments via at-home and mobile eye tracking as well as simultaneous MRI-eye tracking in aging populations. We also present empirical data comparing the quality of eye tracking in the behavioral lab vs. the MRI environment among both young and older adults, in support of simultaneous MRI-eye tracking informing brain-behavior links in aging, while acknowledging trade-offs in data quality of this combined methodology. We propose for future research to leverage these novel, advanced eye-tracking applications for a more comprehensive and real-life capture of attentional and cognitive changes with age.",

          "abstract": "Objectification—the psychological phenomenon of relegating people to the status of objects, denying their humanness—is associated with a host of negative consequences for those targeted, from diminished cognitive performance to heightened risk of danger. Girls and women constitute the primary targets of objectification; thus, these harms fall disproportionately on them. Despite the persistence of such gendered patterns, however, it is not clear how they arise. That is, we do not yet know whether and to what extent perceivers objectify children along gender lines (i.e., associating girls with objects and boys with humans), thus limiting our grasp of this phenomenon both theoretically and practically. In the present studies, we addressed this gap on two fronts. First, we tested whether adults (n=430) objectify young children based on gender. Second, we tested whether children themselves (n=418, ages 4-10 years) display gendered patterns of objectification toward other children. We found evidence that adults objectify children based on gender: in both their categorizations and attributions, adults revealed overlap between their concepts of girls and objects and their concepts of boys and humans (although the degree to which each specific pattern manifested varied across studies). Children showed more limited evidence of this phenomenon: boys, but not girls, displayed the predicted pattern of conceptual overlap, and only in their categorizations. Together, these findings reveal that gender-differentiated patterns of objectification may take root in perceptions of young children—suggesting that the gendered consequences of this phenomenon may be larger in scope and earlier-emerging than previously assumed.",

          "abstract": "A steady rise in global migration has led to a growing share of immigrant-origin children in schools, who face manifold challenges. Primary schools are a key environment for these children’s development and adaptation. The normative developmental, psychological adjustment, and acculturative tasks shaping their adaptation are reflected in different measures of school success. Additionally, students’ families can support their development, but the specific mechanisms may vary between first-generation, second-generation, and non-immigrant students. As few studies differentiate between students from different immigrant generations, there is a need to investigate adaptation process of first-generation and second-generation immigrant students separately, and in comparison to their non-immigrant peers. For a comprehensive view, we investigated several central measures of school success (reading competence, grade point average, academic track recommendation, life satisfaction), as well as the role of the family microsystem, including family structure variables (majority language use, socio-economic status), educational believes (educational aspirations), and family process variables (parent-child reading). Collecting data from N = 271 German fourth-graders (M(age) = 10.47 years, SD = 0.55; 54.2% female, 44.6% male, 0.4% non-binary; n = 102 first-generation, n = 68 second-generation, n = 101 non-immigrants) and controlling for age differences, we found disadvantages regarding first-generation students’ reading competence, grades, and likelihood of receiving a high track recommendation compared to second-generation and/or non-immigrant students. However, no significant differences emerged between second-generation and non-immigrant students. Multigroup analyses revealed that, among family variables, high educational aspirations were positively associated with grades and parent-child reading positively related to higher life satisfaction independent of immigrant status. Furthermore, life satisfaction was additionally positively predicted by educational aspirations in first-generation immigrant students only, and by socioeconomic status among second-generation immigrant students. The results highlight families as a source of valuable resources to protect students against educational disadvantages, but specific mechanisms may differ depending on students’ immigrant status. This is especially important for first-generation immigrant students, for whom we found significant educational discrepancies compared to second-generation and non-immigrant students.",

The memory of young (18–30 years old) and older (60–75 years old) participants was tested after encoding word lists using the method of loci under two conditions: congruent or incongruent with pre-existing knowledge, compared to a control condition. The objective was to assess memory performance improvement based on encoding conditions and age groups. The results showed significant memory performance improvements in both groups when the method of loci was used with congruent associations. In contrast, performance in the incongruent condition was similar to that observed during encoding without a specific strategy, highlighting the importance of semantic links for associative memory.  Furthermore, using the method of loci with congruent associations, older adults displayed recall performance equivalent to young adults, while it was not the case with incongruent associations. The method of loci applied in conditions of semantic congruence thus appears to be a promising compensatory strategy for older adults.",

          "abstract": "Theories of memory consolidation claim that new word learning is bolstered by existing semantic knowledge. However, when semantic knowledge exerts its effects (i.e., at encoding and/or consolidation) and whether semantic benefits change across development remains unclear. Sixty-one children (Experiment 1) and 63 adults (Experiment 2) learned novel word forms paired with pictures of (i) real but rare animals akin to existing animals (Highly Linkable to existing knowledge), (ii) fictitious animals that were less clearly associated with familiar animals (Less Linkable), and (iii) “name tags” written with unfamiliar symbols (Unlinkable). Word form and meaning recall were tested immediately, 1 day and 1 week after learning. Children showed greater improvements across tests than adults despite comparable performance immediately after learning. Regardless of test sessions, semantic knowledge benefited adults’ recall of word form and meaning, with additional benefit from highly versus less linkable knowledge. Children only showed semantic benefits in meaning (and not word form) recall, with additional benefits from highly linkable knowledge. Instead, children’s word form recall was more globally associated with receptive vocabulary and nonword repetition. These results suggest that when present, the benefits of semantic information permeate across the timecourse of word learning; they also point to developmental differences in word learning mechanisms. Adults made clear use of associated semantic knowledge, whereas children showed more general associations between word learning and language abilities and greater benefit from offline consolidation. These results highlight the need for models of word learning and consolidation to incorporate developmental and individual differences.",

          "abstract": "Musicians’ performance experiences range widely, from elation to severe anxiety. In this study, we examined musicians’ performance experiences through the lens of the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat. According to this model, a challenge state arises when perceived resources meet or exceed perceived demands, while a threat state occurs when demands outweigh resources. These states can be quantified using the Demand Resource Evaluation Score (DRES), calculated as the difference between resource and demand evaluations, with higher values indicating a greater challenge-type response. Although post-event processing is a key factor in maintaining social anxiety, research on factors influencing musicians’ post-performance thoughts remains limited. Additionally, the link between DRES and post-performance thoughts is unknown. This study aimed to determine 1) how DRES is influenced by the general music performance anxiety (MPA) level, audience presence, and time (pre-performance vs. during-performance); 2) how negative and positive post-performance thoughts are influenced by general MPA level and audience presence; and 3) whether DRES predicts post-performance thoughts. Classical music students (N = 121) with varying levels of MPA performed solo in a private and a public session. We assessed pre-performance and during-performance DRES, and negative and positive post-performance thoughts. DRES decreased with increasing general MPA level, was lower in public than private sessions, and declined from pre-performance to during-performance. These effects were qualified by a three-way interaction: the effect of general MPA level was strongest before performing publicly, the audience effect was most pronounced at higher general MPA levels before performing, and the time effect was greatest at lower general MPA levels during public sessions. General MPA level was associated with more negative thoughts and fewer positive thoughts. Audience presence increased only negative thoughts. Higher during-performance DRES predicted fewer negative and more positive thoughts both intraindividually and interindividually, with pre-performance DRES showing similar interindividual effects. These findings demonstrate the complex interplay of personal and situational factors in shaping musicians’ challenge and threat experiences. Moreover, high general MPA levels are associated with a general tendency toward more negative and fewer positive post-performance thoughts. Interventions fostering challenge-oriented appraisals may enhance musicians’ post-performance processing, potentially mitigating performance anxiety.",

          "abstract": "Repeatedly seen or heard statements are typically judged to be more likely true than statements not encountered before, a phenomenon referred to as truth effect. Similarly, statements judged to be old typically receive higher truth judgments than statements judged to be new. However, it is unclear whether and how this recognition-based truth effect depends on the latent memory states underlying observed recognition judgments. In order to investigate this question, we used a model-based approach to compare truth judgments as a function of recognition judgments ('old' versus 'new') and their underlying memory states (state of memory certainty vs. state of uncertainty). In three experiments, we observed a recognition-based truth effect and found this effect to be larger in the state of memory certainty than in the state of uncertainty. This result also replicated for subjective instead of modeled memory states. Moreover, we found effects of recognition judgments on judged truth to be stronger than effects of factual repetition in all three experiments. Taken together, our research highlights the role of episodic memory processes in the truth effect and provides a methodological tool that takes underlying memory states into account.",

          "abstract": "Affective polarization—antipathy towards members of one’s political outgroup—may pose challenges to social cohesion and personal well-being. Prior studies have suggested that one’s affective polarization may cause intrapersonal harm as well as interpersonal harm. It has been associated with reduced social support, increased stress, and worse physical health. This pre-registered study investigated the intrapersonal harm of affective polarization using a six-wave longitudinal survey (N = 470). Affective polarization, social support, perceived stress, and self-rated health were measured fortnightly for three months preceding the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models were employed to investigate the within-person effects of affective polarization on these indictors of wellbeing. Contrary to hypotheses, none of the hypothesised cross-lagged effects were significant, suggesting that changes in affective polarization did not predict changes in social support, stress, or health. However, cross-sectional analyses did reflect past findings, showing that higher levels of affective polarization were associated with lower social support, greater stress, and worse health. We additionally found evidence for perceived stress causing moderate increases in affective polarization. Stable differences by political orientation were also observed in our sample, with liberals reporting higher affective polarization and stress, lower social support, and worse health. Despite the lack of significant effects, potentially due to limitations such as sample size and measurement constraints, our findings underscore the importance of further investigations with appropriate robust designs to clarify the relationship between affective polarization and well-being. These results challenge the assumption that affective polarization directly drives declines in well-being.",

Additionally, the study examined the role that resilience variables–mindfulness and emotion regulation–play in the association between victimization timing and PTSS severity.\nMethod: Participants were 247 cisgender community women aged 21-30 recruited for a larger study on high-risk drinking and sexual behaviors. Victimization history was assessed using the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory and Sexual Experiences Survey-Revised. PTSS severity was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were evaluated using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-36 and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Negative binomial regression models tested the hypotheses.\nResults: Analyses revealed significant differences in PTSS severity by victimization timing: CSA + ASA was associated with the greatest PTSS severity, followed by ASA-only, and CSA-only reporting the lowest severity. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were directly associated with reduced PTSS severity across all victimization profiles. \nConclusions: Revictimization was linked to the most severe PTSS, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were associated with reduced PTSS severity, regardless of victimization timing. Future interventions could prioritize enhancing psychological skills, like mindfulness and emotion regulation, to reduce distress for victim-survivors of sexual victimization.",

Findings in the misinformation literature that have\nbeen surprising or unexpected (e.g., relatively few people are exposed to and share\nmisinformation online) are predicted and explained by TDT. Robust conclusions from TDT\nabout deception in human communication (e.g., people are truth-biased) are challenged by\nfindings from misinformation research, prompting deeper investigation. Deception detection\nresearch paradigms have important lessons for misinformation research about the design of\nmisinformation-detection tasks that should be considered when interpreting results (e.g.,\ntrue-false base rates, prompted vs. unprompted veracity judgments). Analytic approaches from\nTDT (e.g., analyzing accuracy for truthful and deceptive messages independently) provide a\nframework for misinformation research to better understand the detection of misinformation and\nmore holistically evaluate the outcomes of misinformation interventions, and TDT’s lessons on\nhow to improve deception detection accuracy also suggest strategies for interventions which\nimprove the detection of misinformation without undermining trust in credible news and\ninformation.",

Parent-reported ADHD symptoms and diagnosis were also collected. We calculated K-CPT completion rates, mean scores, and rates of clinically elevated scores at each timepoint. Linear mixed models examined change over time in K-CPT scores. Correlations and generalized linear models investigated associations between K-CPT scores and ADHD symptoms and diagnoses.\nResults: K-CPT scores showed expected age-related improvements from age 5 to 7, with significant intra-individual variability. Up to 1/3 of children had clinically elevated attention problems and another 1/3 had subclinical elevations. K-CPT scores were modestly correlated with parent-rated ADHD symptoms and children with a parent-reported ADHD diagnosis performed worse on nearly all K-CPT metrics.\nConclusion: Performance-based measures like the K-CPT can be useful for research and clinical practice in VPT populations.",

These biases can be induced by different goals,\nmanifesting even in rational decision strategies that maximize choice efficiency. In this paper,\nwe explore how information sampling can be biased toward or away from extreme and\npolarized information, focusing on the case where people consider qualitative multi-criteria\ninformation about their options. Specifically, we examine how the incentives of a choice task\ncan lead to biased information search, while comparison or rating tasks can promote deeper\ninformation search and ameliorate or even reverse these biases. Across three studies, we (1)\ncreate ecologically valid information environments by having participants generate qualitative\ninformation they might consider when making a judgment or decision, (2) quantify the strength\nand extremeness of participant-generated pieces of information (attributes), and (3) track how\nparticipants sample this information in different goal conditions. We show that comparison and\nrating goals – where people rate the relative goodness of each option or rate them separately –\ncan reduce the extremeness of participants’ beliefs and degree of polarization relative to choice\ngoals where they simply decide between the options. This benefit occurs even when participants\nsample from the same pool of information (i.e., have the same information environment) across\ndifferent tasks. Put together, our results suggest that comparison and rating goals can serve as\nbias-reducing interventions that promote more balanced information sampling across domains\neven for qualitative and multi-criteria information.",

In two conditional-wording conditions (one of which involved a delayed decision), participants were asked about their risk if they did not get vaccinated. For an unconditional/benchmark condition, this conditional was not explicitly stated but was still formally applicable because participants had not yet been informed that a vaccine was even available for this disease. \n\nResults: When people gave risk estimates to a conditionally-worded risk question after making a decision, the observed relationship between perceived risk and prevention decisions was inflated (relative to in the unconditional/benchmark condition). \n\nConclusions: The use of conditionals in risk questions can lead to overestimates of the impact of perceived risk on prevention decisions, but not necessarily to a degree that should call for their omission.",

          "abstract": "Ageism can be defined as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination based on a person’s age and has been shown in past research to be both common and harmful. In 2016 WHO received a mandate from its Member States to lead a major global campaign to address ageism against all ages. Evidence synthesised as part of the campaign brought into focus the need for new measures of ageism experiences that can capture its multidimensional nature, and that can be used to measure the experiences of  individuals of a wide range of ages and living in diverse country settings. Previous research has documented the development and validation of a 15-item version of the newly developed 15-item scale; however, as space in large-scale surveys is at a premium, there is a strong need for even briefer versions. The current article proposes and evaluates a 5-item brief WHO ageism experiences scale that measures self-directed, interpersonal, and institutional ageism and covers stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. Psychometric properties, including test-retest reliability and concurrent validity in a UK mixed-age adult sample (N= 402) were tested. Findings supported the convergent and divergent validity of the scale, and its test-retest reliability. It also showed patterns of associations with health and age that would be expected based on previous research.  These results provide preliminary for support the use of the brief scale in contexts where survey space is highly constrained. It lays the foundation for future work to extend the testing of the 5-item scale in other languages, populations, and settings and to a wider range of relevant psychometric properties.",

          "abstract": "Theories of adaptive (and cognitive) control assume that selecting target information in the context of highly salient distractors depends on limited-capacity resources. Building on this assumption, theories of language-control associations propose that the opportunities afforded by bilingualism to engage such effortful selection, such as when speaking in a nondominant language, might improve domain-general adaptive control. The assumption that domain-general or language-specific selection is resource-demanding, however, has surprisingly little empirical support. Here, we tested that assumption by having unbalanced Italian-English bilinguals perform both an L1 Stroop task and an L2 picture-naming task simultaneously with an n-back task. Both tasks showed costs due to the load produced by the n-back task and distractor interference, with slower responses to incongruent (the word GREEN in the color red) and congruent stimuli (RED in red) than neutral ones (XXX in red) in the L1 Stroop task and to noncognate than cognate pictures (pictures with different/similar L1 and L2 names) in the L2 picture-naming task. However, neither task showed larger distractor interference with greater load, with Bayesian analyses favoring the absence of such interactions. These results suggest that domain-general and language-specific selection may occur reactively, i.e., only when the need arises, with no strong reliance on limited-capacity resources. Further, they invite a rethinking of both adaptive-control theories assuming resource-demanding selection and theories of language-control associations assuming that regularly engaging such selection would be conducive to domain-general benefits.",

In Experiment 2, we replicated this pattern using a more implicit manipulation of perceived performance, a surreptitious delay in the onset of response targets. Participants were more likely to report MW after delay than control trials. In both experiments, confidence in on-task reports was lower when the corresponding indicator (falsely) implied poor performance.

          "abstract": "Love of neighbor holds a prominent place in ethical and theological thinking across many cultures and world religious traditions. While arguably central to the promotion of societal wellbeing and human flourishing, little has been done on its empirical assessment. We present a measure of love of neighbor, grounded in a broader conceptual framework concerning interpersonal love, and examine its psychometric properties using cognitive interviews and analyses from datasets from numerous countries, cultures, and contexts. We present evidence for two distinct facets: unitive and contributory neighbor love. We discuss distinctions of unitive and contributory neighbor love from compassionate love, which might be conceived of as contributory neighbor love within the context of suffering. Psychometric properties of the measure concerning consistency, reliability, internal structure, relations between indicators, and measurement invariance are presented. The measure lays the foundation for future empirical study of the distribution, causes, and consequences of love of neighbor.",

          "abstract": "The 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar has been criticised for numerous social, political, and environmental issues. While an important call to boycott the tournament spread worldwide, research has yet to document the motives underlying a boycott of such a mega sporting event. We investigated fans’ intentions to boycott the 2022 FIFA World Cup in four countries of the Francophonie engaged in the World Cup (N = 1,635). We found that being highly identified with the team and enjoying football for aesthetic pleasures predicted rejection of the boycott, while the most robust predictor of boycott intentions was a concern for environmental issues. When assessing actual boycott behaviours among fans after the World Cup (N = 286), we found a significant decrease compared to boycott intentions. Importantly, this intention–behaviour gap was even more pronounced among politicised fans with high awareness of social and environmental issues who had initially planned to boycott the tournament. We discuss the paradox of calls to boycott mega sporting events: Unlike other consumer products, these events often have no alternatives, yet they are central to the social identity of sports fans. As a consequence, such a boycott may be better explained by a low level of fandom rather than solely by strong political values, with remaining boycotters likely being those who had little interest in the event from the outset.",

          "abstract": "Adult and young bilinguals co-activate their languages in different degrees, even in entirely monolingual tasks. However, many studies use translation pairs with high phonological overlap (e.g., the English-GERMAN: 'milk'-'MILCH') making it difficult to discern the origin of the co-activation. This study examined language co-activation in Catalan-Spanish bilingual toddlers using words with minimal phonological overlap across translations. Three-year-olds participated in a visual word paradigm, searching for an absent target (e.g., 'apple' in Catalan: 'poma', Spanish: 'MANZANA') among images with labels that shared the initial phoneme across languages or were unrelated. The design included three types of images: (a) Catalan-to-Spanish phonologically related images (e.g., Spanish 'PATO' for 'duck'), (b) Spanish-to-Catalan phonologically related (e.g., Catalan 'mitjó' for 'sock'), and (c) unrelated items (e.g., 'brush', 'sandwich'). If bilingual toddlers co-activate languages, they should look more at related than unrelated images due to shared phonological onsets. The results supported the hypotheses and provided solid evidence that young bilinguals co-activate phonologically related words in their familiar languages.",

          "abstract": "Sequence learning in the serial response time task (SRTT) is one of the few learning phenomena that are widely agreed to be implicit in nature (i.e., that learning may proceed in the absence of awareness), while it is also possible to explicitly learn a sequence of events. In the past few decades, research into sequence learning largely focused on the type of representation that may underlie implicit sequence learning, and whether or not two independent learning systems are necessary to explain qualitative differences between implicit and explicit learning. Using the drift-diffusion model, here we take a cognitive-processes perspective on sequence learning and investigate the cognitive operations that benefit from implicit and explicit sequence learning (e.g., stimulus detection or encoding, response selection, or response facilitation). To separate the processes involved in expressing implicit versus explicit knowledge, we manipulated explicit sequence knowledge independently of the opportunity to express such knowledge, and analyzed the resulting performance data with a dynamic drift-diffusion model to disentangle the contributions of the aforementioned processes on. Results revealed that implicit sequence learning does not affect stimulus processing, but benefits response selection. Moreover, beyond response selection, response execution was affected. Explicit sequence knowledge did not change this pattern if participants worked on probabilistic materials, where it is difficult to anticipate the next response. However, if materials were deterministic, explicit knowledge enabled participants to switch from stimulus-based to plan-based action control, which was reflected in ample changes in the cognitive processes involved in performing the task.\n  First implications for theories of sequence learning, and how the diffusion model may be helpful in future research into implicit and explicit sequence learning,\n  are dicussed.",

There is currently little consensus on the conditions under which video modeling is most effective. Using non-overlap metrics as effect indices, the current meta-analysis of video modeling interventions was conducted by synthesizing single-case research studies published between 2013 and 2019. A systematic literature search using two databases (ERIC and PsycINFO) and screening based on the inclusion criteria yielded 48 studies for analysis. Calculation of the four non-overlap indices (percentage of non-overlapping data, non-overlapping of all pairs, improvement rate difference, and Tau-U) suggested that video modeling interventions were moderately to largely effective in most studies. The effectiveness score was greater for videos that included adults as models. Furthermore, effectiveness scores can be enhanced when video modeling is used in conjunction with reinforcement strategies or implemented as part of an intervention package.",

          "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that the phonological production of words does not follow a single pathway, as was assumed in the past. Rather, some words are produced via dedicated production pathways. Previous studies showed such pathway separation for words from different categories (e.g., number versus non-number words) or with different meanings (number words with numerical versus non-numerical meaning, e.g., ‘Nine West’). Here, we show that the separation of phonological production pathways is even greater than that: even the same word with the same meaning can follow different phonological production pathways, depending on the context in which the word is produced. We report HLI, a woman with aphasia. She erred in 5 number-production tasks, all with phonological output but with different input modalities: digits, written number words, dice patterns, encyclopedic questions, and approximate quantities. We conclude she had impaired phonological production of number words. Critically, she performed relatively well in 3 other phonological number production tasks: oral calculation, counting, and repetition. This dissociation indicates multiple phonological production pathways for verbal numbers. We propose that HLI has a deficit in a default phonological production pathway, which serves most number-production tasks. At the same time, other, dedicated pathways of phonological number production, which are recruited uniquely by the calculation, counting, and repetition tasks, are spared. Finally, we propose a concrete model that explains when and how the dedicated, task-specific phonological-access pathways are created, and we show that HLI’s performance satisfies a central prediction of this model.",

Participants rated individuals' reasoning quality in short vignettes that varied by reasoning type (fast-intuitive vs. slow-deliberative) and past accuracy (high, low, unspecified). Consistently, participants rated deliberative reasoning as superior to intuition, regardless of accuracy. Deliberative thinkers were seen as smarter and more trustworthy—a preference that held even under time pressure and cognitive load, suggesting it arises intuitively. Studies with LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5 and 4) replicated the human preference pattern, indicating that AI language models capture human folk beliefs about reasoning. These findings suggest a strong intuitive link between deliberation and reliability, with critical implications for public trust in human and AI recommendations.",

Thematic analysis results were critically examined to systematically position praxis against our current understanding of listening theories. Findings are presented as a “dialectical listening theory” which posits that at its core, listeners’ behaviours often exist in direct tension with their mindset or intuition. Furthermore, we posit that this tension is amplified when individuals are faced with conversations that conflict with their perspectives or values. Finally, we argue that listeners may need to oscillate between dual-process states of unconscious (intuitive) and conscious (intentional) listening.

          "abstract": "Narrative comprehension, a cognitive skill essential for social participation, relies on a range of abilities, including memory and inference-making. While aging-related cognitive changes are well-documented, research on narrative comprehension in aging populations yields mixed findings, underscoring the importance of this study. This preregistered study examines how age, education, and presentation format (i.e., the narrative’s codality: pictorial vs. textual) influence inference generation in older adults (N = 143, aged 62–86 years). Participants were presented with pictorial and textual stories consisting of three panels, with the second panel replaced with a blank panel. Their task was to comprehend the stories and determine whether the inferences provided for the missing event were correct or incorrect. Results reveal that pictorial narratives were better comprehended than textual ones; however, this advantage attenuates with increasing age. Contrary to expectations, narrative comprehension was largely resilient to age-related declines, as neither age nor education significantly impaired performance. Exploratory analyses tested the influence of protective (e.g., physical and mental activity, companionship) and risk factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, chronic pain, stress, and poor sleep) but found no significant impact on comprehension. Notably, narrative comprehension correlated with memory performance but not with other cognitive abilities, underscoring its specificity within the broader cognitive domain. These findings highlight the stability of narrative comprehension across media and aging, while also suggesting a narrowing pictorial advantage with age. Implications for existing cognitive theories and future research directions are discussed.",

Empirical evidence for this theory is mixed, and studies in clinical populations are virtually non-existent. One group of interest are adolescents with ADHD, as these adolescents engage more often in status-relevant behaviors like risk taking, aggression and sensation seeking. In the current investigation, we therefore tested if testosterone and cortisol, and their interaction, mediate the association between ADHD and risk taking, aggression, and sensation seeking. Adolescents with (N=80) and without (N=100) ADHD (Mage=15.1 years) performed an experimental risk-taking task and completed self-report measures of aggression and sensation seeking. The results showed that (1) the groups did not differ on testosterone or cortisol, whereas evidence for a group difference in testosterone × cortisol was limited to one of the mediation models; (2) the groups did not differ on measures of risk taking, aggression and sensation seeking; (3) cortisol and testosterone × cortisol did not predict any of the outcome measures, and testosterone was associated with sensation seeking. Accordingly, analyses found no evidence of endocrine mediation between ADHD status and status-relevant behaviors. The current study was the first to test the dual-hormone hypothesis in adolescents with ADHD. The findings suggest that in this group testosterone, cortisol, nor their interaction were related to the higher propensity towards status-relevant behaviors.",

Order and complexity have often been suggested as important factors related to appreciation, but the exact type and direction of their relation to appreciation is still under debate. To clarify the contributions of order and complexity to appreciation, it is important to manipulate order and complexity independently and in a parametrically controlled fashion, to study their relation to appreciation in combination rather than separately, and to acknowledge the multidimensional nature of order and complexity. In an online study, we investigated individuals’ aesthetic preferences (N = 367) for three different types of complexity (i.e., the number of colors, shapes, and sizes in the display) while also varying the order level of the display (i.e., the number of element position switches in the applied pattern). Firstly, results indicated that not all complexity types are appreciated similarly: Whereas color complexity was on average preferred, size and shape complexity influenced preferences negatively. Secondly, all three complexity types were more often preferred in highly ordered stimuli than in stimuli with a lower order level, indicating a stimulating effect of order on preferences for complexity. Thirdly, we found both individual and contextual variation in preferences for complexity: Especially the extent to which color complexity is preferred varied across individuals and the specific set of colors used in the display.",

          "abstract": "Semantic context effects in picture naming and categorization are central to word production theories. However, unlike naming studies, categorization studies have shown inconsistent results. Recently, Wöhner, Luckow et al. (2024) replicated the inconsistent pattern in blocked categorization in a within-participant and within-item design. Pictures were presented in a semantically homogeneous or heterogeneous context. In the homogeneous context, there was interference for naming, facilitation for naturalness categorization, but no context effect for size categorization. The authors concluded that the inconsistent categorization findings in their own and previous studies could be due either to the use of tasks based on different kinds of features (stored in semantic memory [natural vs. man-made] vs. ad hoc [smaller vs. larger than a standard]) or to a difference in the response mapping for the exemplars from the semantic categories creating the context (convergent vs. divergent). The present study again contrasted the Wöhner, Luckow et al. tasks, but used materials which resulted in convergent response mapping for both categorization tasks. There was semantic interference in naming and semantic facilitation in both naturalness and size categorization. This pattern suggests that convergent response mapping, not the use of a task based on a stored semantic feature, is critical for obtaining facilitation in blocked semantic categorization. Our result provides further support for the notion that semantic interference in blocked word production has its locus at the lexical level and its origin at the semantic level. This conclusion does not depend any longer on data from only a single categorization task.",

This study aims to address this gap by examining the vulnerabilities and health risks faced by this population. Materials and methods: Individuals aged 18 and older documented in pornography in Sweden were recruited to participate in face-to-face interviews. A total of 120 participants completed study-specific questions and standardized questionnaires on their background, experiences in pornography, and health status. Descriptive statistics were reported, and regression analyses were performed to assess factors impacting PTSD symptom severity and dissociative symptoms.\nResults: Participants reported high levels of abuse both in childhood and during pornography\nproduction. Nearly all participants had experienced sexual abuse (88%), psychological abuse (90%), and physical abuse (79%) as children. In the context of pornography production, they were subjected to further abuse and exploitation, including verbal abuse (87%), rape (65%), physical assault (56%),\nthird-party control (56%), and online harassment (57%). The consequences of this continuous\npolyvictimization were significant: 84% exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms, 60% clinically\nsignificant dissociative symptoms, 69% had attempted suicide, and 80% had been diagnosed with at\nleast one mental health problem. Regression analyses revealed that childhood and online polyvictimization significantly predicted PTSD symptom severity, while polyvictimization within pornography production predicted dissociative symptoms.

          "abstract": "Careless responding is defined as a pattern of responding to survey items that reflects a latent construct distinct from—and disruptive of—the measurement of the primary construct of interest. In the social science literature, these response patterns are sometimes labeled “insufficient effort,” “unserious,” or “bogus, among other terms.”The issue of such responses has been gaining in relevance as research data are increasingly collected through anonymous online surveys. Standard practice calls for identifying careless responders and excluding them from the data. The common reasoning behind this approach is that such responses can bias “descriptive” statistics (e.g., sample means) and effect size estimates / measures of associations (e.g., correlations and  standardised mean difference) as well as increase measurement error. When they confound our causal effect of interest, deleting or adjusting for careless responses is justified. However, using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that different careless responding patterns can plausibly take on the role of a mediator, a collider, or both simultaneously, among others. Given this, we argue that, in contrast to previous calls, there cannot be a general rule about how to deal with careless responses and that greater attention to their data-generating mechanism from a causal perspective is necessary.",

          "abstract": "In conflict tasks, congruency effects are thought to reflect attentional control mechanisms needed to counteract response conflict elicited by incongruent stimuli. Although congruency effects are well-replicable experimentally, recent studies have evidenced low correlations between congruency effects measured across different paradigms, leading to a heated debate over whether these low correlations indicate a lack of construct validity or are rather attributable to high measurement error, as indicated by the poor reliability typically displayed by congruency effects. In the present study, we investigated whether the poor reliabilities of congruency effects are due to their poor theoretical specification. Specifically, we tested whether the psychometric properties of congruency effects can be improved by focusing exclusively on those trials in which response conflict is theoretically expected to be highest. We considered two factors modulating the degree of response conflict: previous trial congruency, with higher conflict following congruent trials, and the time elapsed since stimulus onset, with higher conflict in fast responses. Data from 195 participants completing a Simon and a spatial Stroop paradigm showed that generally poor split-half reliabilities for the full set of trials improved greatly when excluding post-incongruent and slow trials. Importantly, between-task correlations also increased substantially when controlling for these factors, suggesting that, with increased reliability, these tasks capture a common attentional control ability. Our results suggest that individual differences in conflict tasks can provide valid and reliable measures of attentional control when focusing on the trials with the theoretically highest response conflict.",

However, no study has compared lower and higher variability multi-talker conditions to determine how the number of talkers affects training outcomes, even though such information can shed additional light on how talker variability affects phonetic training. In this study, we randomly assigned 458 L2 Spanish learners to a two-talker or six-talker HVPT group or to a control group that did not receive HVPT. Training focused on L2 Spanish stops. We tested performance on trained talkers and words as well as several forms of generalization.

          "abstract": "With the Five-Dimensional Curiosity-Scale Revised (5DCR), Kashdan et al. (2020) developed the most sophisticated measure of curiosity to date. We validated a brief measure of this instrument, namely, 5DC-S, by reanalyzing two existing samples from Germany (N = 486) and the UK (N = 483). Using the German sample, we reduce the number of facets from six to five and selected the ten most suitable items, out of 24, in a data-driven manner, and this brief measure’s psychometric properties extensively. In the UK sample, we then confirmatorily check the resulting 5DC-S, providing further support for the measure’s factorial structure through statistical modelling and construct validity by widely replicating the nomological network of the original measure. Lastly, we show that 5DC-S is measurement invariant to the highest level across both countries as well as age groups, sex, and education levels. We end on practical implications and future research suggestions.",

          "authors": "Yutaka Horita; Miku Yamazaki; Asuka Tahara",
          "abstract": "Relational mobility, the degree of opportunity to form new relationships in a particular environment, explains cultural differences in interpersonal behavior. Theoretically, relational mobility is thought to be related to the contrasting tendencies in social networks: expansion of relationships (i.e., trust) and commitment to existing relationships (i.e., intimacy). This study reexamined whether perceived relational mobility is associated with the formation and maintenance of social networks. We conducted a cross-cultural survey and investigated the correlations between generalized trust, intimacy with friends, self-disclosure, and the number of social networks with the data of 297 American and 292 Japanese people. Consistent with previous studies, this study found that Americans are more likely than Japanese to trust strangers, feel intimate with and disclose themselves to their closest friends, and have more relationships. Relational mobility explained the cultural difference in generalized trust but not in intimacy with friends when controlling for individual characteristics, such as personality traits. Generalized trust was associated with a greater number of people to seek advice from, and a greater number of advice networks was correlated with higher levels of subjective well-being. The results suggest that relational mobility is associated with psychology related to expanding networks, rather than strengthening existing relationships.",

          "abstract": "To manage life’s stressors, we can self-regulate our emotions or seek social regulatory support. One commonly used strategy is reappraisal, where individuals reframe their own negative emotions (i.e. self-reappraisal) or help others reframe their negative emotions (i.e. social-reappraisal). Here, we compared the neural mechanisms underlying self- and social-reappraisal of negative autobiographical memories using standard univariate contrasts, Bayes factor and multivariate classifier approaches. Both self- and social-reappraisal recruited regions associated with control, such as dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Notably, multivariate patterns within control regions were indistinguishable, suggesting they play similar roles in self- and social-reappraisal. Second, social-reappraisal was both quantitatively and qualitatively different from self-reappraisal in its recruitment of control and mentalizing regions, such as the right lateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex and right temporal pole. Multivariate patterns within regions associated with mentalizing were distinguishable between self- and social-reappraisal, suggesting that they are specifically involved when reappraising for others. Finally, both self- and social-reappraisal modulated activity in regions associated with affective responding and the perceptual representation of remembered scenes, including the mid-orbital frontal cortex, left insula and parahippocampus. Taken together, these data reveal the processes supporting self and social emotion regulation with implications for both basic and clinical research.",

          "abstract": "The surge of online psychological assessments have brought the autism research community both opportunities and challenges: while they enable rapid large-scale data collection and more power to characterize individual differences, they also bring concerns about data quality, generalizability beyond online samples, and whether autistic traits can be reliably characterized with self-report measures administered online. Here we tackle these concerns by providing a systematic characterization of the autistic traits variability across individuals in a large cross-sectional dataset (N=2826) as well as its temporal reliability within individuals in a test-retest dataset (N=247), with both online and in-lab samples. We measured autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd version, Adult Self Report (SRS-2-ASR) - a tool that quantifies individual differences in autistic traits along a continuum for the general adult population. Across individuals, we found elevated SRS scores in online samples and were able to trace this effect to specific subsets of SRS items. SRS scores also covaried with internalizing symptoms, decreased with age, and were lower in women compared to other genders. Within individuals, we find moderate-to-good test-retest reliability of SRS scores over long intervals, with no difference between online and in-lab samples, suggesting robust temporal stability. We conclude that there are systematic differences in autistic traits between online and in-lab samples that are partly explained by systematic population-level differences in internalizing symptoms, particularly social anxiety. Future studies that sample across different populations should measure, control for, or stratify with respect to these factors.",

          "abstract": "The professionalisation of esports has led to increased investment in high-performance environments. However, differences in resources and infrastructure between major and minor regions pose significant challenges to achieving competitive parity. In this study, we aimed to explore key success factors in high-performance esports environments and develop a preliminary conceptual framework capturing the core elements of elite esports environments. Following semi-structured interviews with elite players (n = 10), coaches (n = 9), and support staff (n = 7) from major and minor esports regions, we generated three categories to represent key factors contributing to success in esports: training environment, interpersonal dynamics, and intrapersonal development. Major region players benefited from structured support, including dedicated training facilities, access to psychological services, and in-person team cohesion strategies. Alternatively, minor region players faced resource constraints, limited access to psychological and physical training, and appeared to be at increased risk of burnout. Based on the novel insights generated, we proposed a preliminary Esports High-Performance Model (EHPM), a multi-layered, context-specific framework that highlights the interconnectedness of the training environment, interpersonal dynamics, and intrapersonal development in high-performing esports environments. Our findings provide a foundation for future research and can be used to inform policies and practices supporting the development of sustainable, high-performance esports environments. We propose that the EHPM could be a promising way to address current challenges and consequences surfaced by disparities between minor and major regions, potentially aiding the rebalancing of the competitive landscape in esports and improving player well-being.",

          "abstract": "Cultural appropriation is a critique of cultural borrowing or outgroup cultural use, typically when a more powerful cultural group adopts cultural elements from a less powerful group. Accusations of appropriation have been fiercely debated in recent years, which raise questions about appropriate versus appropriative adoption of another group’s culture. We propose that these different evaluations hinge in part on diversity ideologies. In four studies of U.S. participants (total N = 1549), we examined the differing effects of three diversity ideologies (colorblindness, multiculturalism, and polyculturalism) on judgments of common cases of cultural appropriation. We found that multiculturalism was associated with harsher judgment, whereas colorblindness and polyculturalism were associated with more lenient judgment. Additionally, we explored perception of costs and benefits involved in cultural appropriation and found the associations between diversity ideologies and judgments to be mediated by perceived misrepresentation, permission, distinctiveness, and honorific intent. We conclude that each diversity ideology makes different tradeoffs salient in perceived costs and benefits of cultural use across groups.",

          "abstract": "Dynamic events can be perceived at different levels of granularity, with coarser contexts (e.g., “morning routine”) requiring more conceptual integration than finer contexts (e.g., “having breakfast”). We investigated whether this increased integration yields more abstract mental representations (i.e., fewer perceptual details) across three experiments. In these experiments, participants encoded events (presented via text or video) in coarse- or fine-grained contexts and then matched these events to corresponding stimuli. Our results indicated that coarse context consistently took longer to process, which is consistent with higher integration demands. Participants were also faster when encoding and test modalities matched (suggesting modality-specific processing) and when the test modality was video (reflecting slower reading times in text). Crucially, we found no interaction between context grain and encoding or test modalities. Contrary to the expectation that coarser contexts would produce more amodal mental representations, participants showed no coarse-grain cross-modal advantage in recognizing events. We propose that the contents of everyday events might be abstracted similarly within mental representations for both fine and coarse contexts. Furthermore, our results provide evidence for amodal representations when the environment is unpredictable. That is, participants transformed their mental representations into both verbally and visually compatible formats, regardless of the original encoding modality.",

          "abstract": "Whether it is the first day of school or a new job, individuals often find themselves in situations where they must learn and integrate into novel social relationships. However, the mechanisms through which individuals evaluate the strength and nature of these existing relationships – social-relational inference – remain unclear. We posit that linguistic features of conversations may help individuals evaluate social relationships and may be associated with social-relational inference. Leveraging a naturalistic behavioral experiment (57 adults; 34,735 observations), participants watched a mid-season episode of Survivor and evaluated the observed dyadic relationships between contestants. We employed novel person- and stimulus-focused approaches to 1) investigate social-relational inference similarity between participants, 2) examine the association between distinct linguistic features and social-relational inference, and 3) explore the relationship between early season conversation similarity and later perceived relationship formation. We found high pairwise participant response similarity across three experimental conditions, distinct associations between relational judgments and linguistic features, including semantic similarity, sentiment, and clout, and no evidence of an association between early conversation similarity and later friendship inference. These findings suggest that naturalistic conversational content is both a potential mechanism of social-relational inference and a promising avenue for future research.",

          "abstract": "This reply to Conway et al. (2025) illustrates how points of contention in the evaluation of mindreading (or Theory of Mind) measures can arise from the use of divergent validity concepts. The construct validity model used in Wendt and colleagues’ (2024) empirical study contrasts with the perspective implicit in Conway and colleagues' commentary, which is more consistent with Lennon's content validity model. This is reflected in the authors' conception of the nature of what is to be measured (i.e., the measurand), the criterion for what makes a measure superior (i.e., validity), and the proposed methods for judging this (i.e., validation). The mismatch between the validity concepts adopted by the respective authors has three major implications: First, Conway and colleagues' critique does not fully address the specific goals, assumptions, and intricacies of construct validation methodology. Second, their approach to measuring mindreading should not be confused with, or considered as an alternative to, construct validation, but is valuable in its own right. Third, the two validity frameworks mentioned offer unique opportunities for different phases of the research process. While a content validity approach can be valuable for describing an empirical phenomenon that seems worthy of explanation (e.g., real-world mindreading), a construct validity approach helps identify the theoretical constructs that might help explain it (e.g., mindreading ability).",

In practice, using large language models (LLMs) remain infeasible for many researchers due to concerns around privacy, cost, compute requirements, and computational expertise, and may prefer interpretable models to avoid mistakes in high-stakes scenarios. Lexicons offer a simpler solution by counting relevant words and phrases, making them very popular in the social sciences and as baseline models in computer science.  Existing lexicons are limited because they measure a fixed set of constructs that are unlikely to cover the specific constructs of interest for a given application, resulting in low content validity. Building and validating new lexicons is resource intensive. In this study, we found that GPT-4 turbo was able to automatically create a lexicon for 49 known risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, which we release as the Suicide Risk Lexicon. We used the lexicon counts to predict risk levels in crisis counseling conversations. After validating it with experts, our model outperformed the widely-used LIWC lexicon and performed similarly to deep learning models. Through feature importance analysis, we discovered that active suicidal ideation, suicidal planning, and direct self-injury were stronger indicators of imminent risk than passive suicidal ideation or depressed mood. To simplify creating and validating new lexicons for any domain of research, we introduce a protocol and Python package, construct-tracker, that works with a variety of generative AI models.",

          "abstract": "Eye-tracking has become a valuable tool for studying cognitive processes in second language (L2) acquisition and bilingualism (Godfroid et al., 2024). While research-grade infrared eye-trackers are commonly used, there are a number of issues that limit its wide-spread adoption. Recently, consumer-based webcam eye-tracking has emerged as an attractive alternative, requiring only internet access and a personal webcam. However, webcam eye-tracking presents unique design and preprocessing challenges that must be addressed for valid results. To help researchers overcome these challenges, we developed a comprehensive tutorial focused on visual world  webcam eye-tracking for L2 language research. Our guide will cover all key steps, from design to data preprocessing and analysis, where we highlight the R package `webgazeR`, which is open source and freely available for download and installation: https://github.com/jgeller112/webgazeR. We offer best practices for environmental conditions, participant instructions, and tips for designing visual world experiments with webcam eye-tracking. To demonstrate these steps, we analyze data collected through the Gorilla platform (Anwyl-Irvine et al., 2020) using a single word Spanish visual world paradigm (VWP) and show competition within and between L2/L1. This tutorial aims to empower researchers by providing a step-by-step guide to successfully conduct visual world  webcam-based eye-tracking studies.

          "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying pathological safety behavior is crucial for the development of effective treatments for mental disorders. This study investigates the interplay between intolerance of uncertainty (IU), not just right experiences (NJRE), and safety behaviors using a behavior-based checking paradigm in individuals (N = 164) diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or anxiety disorders. Findings revealed that IU was related to more disturbance caused by experimentally induced NJRE. In addition, IU was linked to more NJRE on a trait level. Regarding safety behavior in the form of checking, IU was also indirectly associated with longer checking durations via NJRE-related disturbance. This indirect effect supports a conceptual pathway where IU causes NJRE-related disturbance, leading to excessive uncertainty reducing safety behaviors. These results reinforce IU’s role as a transdiagnostic factor driving safety behaviors, which can contribute to maintaining pathology. Furthermore, the findings confirm a mediating role of NJRE in this relationship. Thus, the relevance of NJRE may extend beyond OCD into other anxiety disorders whenever IU is a critical feature. Implications include considering IU and NJRE in therapies across anxiety-related diagnoses as a mitigating factor of pathological safety behaviors. Despite strengths like a large, formally diagnosed sample and a behavior-based paradigm, sample heterogeneity and the use of novel methodology constitute limitations of the study.",

          "authors": "Rémi Thériault; Romane Masson; Stéphane Dandeneau",
          "abstract": "Context. Many spiritual traditions, like Buddhism, emphasize the importance of developing feelings of love and altruism toward others regardless of circumstances, but doing so can be challenging, especially in situations where individuals have little self-control resources, for example due to cognitive fatigue. These traditions offer techniques to train the mind, such as loving-kindness meditation, in order to facilitate the achievement of this altruistic goal. However, the evidence in favour of the prosocial benefits of loving-kindness meditation is scant and at times conflicting. Methods. To investigate the long-term effects of loving-kindness training on prosociality and aggression, we investigated changes in a range of prosocial variables at pre, post, and follow-up in a preregistered randomized controlled trial comparing three groups: loving-kindness meditation (N = 58), loving-kindness reflection (N = 53), and waitlist control (N = 92). Furthermore, to establish the robustness of the loving-kindness training relative to challenging circumstances such as cognitive fatigue, we introduced an ego depletion task at post-testing. Results. Planned contrasts analyses suggested effects on positive affect only for the meditation group, on self-reported compassion for both the meditation and reflection groups, and explicit social attitudes, aggressive behaviour, cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour, willingness to help, only for the reflection group. There were no other group differences in attitudes toward aggression, dehumanization, implicit aggression, or charity donations. Moderation analyses revealed three-way interactions between group, implicit attitudes, and ego depletion, as hypothesized, but only for compassion and cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour. Discussion. In conclusion, results suggest that the effects of reflecting on loving-kindness concepts provide robust and reliable prosocial effects, perhaps more than meditating on those concepts. Even those benefits are limited to certain behaviours, cognitions, or affects, and they do not generalize to many common behaviours such as charity donations. However, ego depletion seems to only moderate implicit attitudes when loving-kindness is embodied through meditation and not when it is confined to the intellectual mind.",

Despite there being numerous scales to choose from, little work has been done to compare their psychometric properties. To address this shortcoming, we compared the internal consistency, two-week test-retest reliability, criterion validity, and construct validity of five short-form conspiracist ideation measures: the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale – 5 (GCB-5), Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ), General Measure of Conspiracism (GMC), American Conspiracy Thinking Scale (ACTS), and One-Item Conspiracy Measure (1CM). The results of our investigation indicated that all five of the scales are reliable and valid measures of conspiracist ideation. That said, the GCB-5 tended to perform the best while the 1CM tended to perform the worst. We conclude our investigation by discussing trade-offs among the five scales, as well as providing recommendations for future research.",

          "abstract": "Successfully navigating the social world requires making accurate predictions about others. Individual differences in emotion prediction–the ability to predict someone’s subsequent emotion given their current emotional state–can lead to variability in social success. Across three studies (N = 1,024) we found evidence that individuals with heightened schizotypy displayed worse emotion prediction accuracy. This difficulty with emotion prediction was associated with increased loneliness, diminished social support, and smaller social networks, partially mediating some of the social difficulties in individuals with heightened schizotypy. Individuals with heightened schizotypy showed disruptions to key sources of affective information, meaning they had less reliable information about how emotions work when making emotion predictions. Specifically, their own emotion experiences were less typical, and their perception of others’ emotions was less accurate. These findings highlight emotion prediction as a key social cognitive construct that should be considered in future research for individuals across the schizophrenia spectrum.",

Daily arts engagement rates remained stable from 2003 to 2023, with small underlying increases in participatory engagement (dancing, performing, arts and crafts, writing) and slight declines in receptive engagement (attending performing arts, museums, watching dancing). Listening to and making music did not change over time. There were less consistent trends in time spent on the arts. People increasingly did arts activities alone at home. There were disparities in engagement, with differing trends according to sex, age, and income.

In this paper we report two dyadic interaction experiments studying the semantic extension of novel labels in controlled circumstances. We find that participants can use salient and shared associations in their perceptual environment (between colours and shapes) to bootstrap a communication system, and can then extend those labels figuratively, to convey both concrete and abstract targets, by exploiting shared understandings such as colours associated stereotypically with specific objects and emotions. By manipulating the presence of reliable statistical associations between colour and shape early in this process we show that such shared associations facilitate both an initial semantic extension and subsequent chaining of extensions; we also find that extensions relying on less certain grounding (e.g. between colours and emotions) lead to greater variability in how extensions are made. Our method can be used to test the creative processes of semantic extension under controlled conditions, and provides experimental purchase on the relationship between association and extension which have only previously been studied through correlational means.",

          "authors": "Jussi Jylkkä",
          "abstract": "Both psychedelic substances and meditation have been proposed to facilitate personally meaningful and transformative experiences, where insights have been proposed as a central component. However, previous research has mainly relied on questionnaires, which limit the range of insights that can be identified. We recruited participants who reported personally meaningful experiences facilitated by either a psychedelic substance (including classic and non-classic psychedelics; n = 147) or meditation (n = 66) and asked them to provide narrative reports of the insights they experienced. Qualitative analysis revealed three main insight themes: Mystical-type (subclasses Unity, Metaphysical, and Other), Psychological (subclasses Metacognitive, Value, and Compassion), and Philosophical-existential (subclasses Purpose, Value, and Other). Mystical-type insights were more frequent in reports of meditation experiences, while value insights were more frequent in psychedelic reports. Otherwise, the reported insights were highly similar across the two types of reports, and no differences were observed between various psychoactive substances. Regression analyses indicated that metacognitive insights were positively associated with perceived improvements in positive affect, while mystical-type insights predicted increased meaning in life. Unexpectedly, compassion insights predicted lower levels of peace of mind and cognitive defusion. These findings suggest that both psychedelics and meditation can facilitate a broad range of insights that are not fully captured by existing questionnaires. The findings extend previous research indicating similarities between psychedelic and meditation experiences and can be taken to support the notion that transformative experiences are not unique to psychedelics and can be facilitated through various means.",

Using fMRI (N = 48; right-handed, healthy, male adults), we separately identified activation maps preferentially associated with imagining places and persons, respectively. When participants imagined misfortunes happening to individuals in specific places, both the place and person maps jointly predicted affective empathy, and, less consistently, prosocial behavior. Place-preferential activation was at least as predictive as person-preferential activation. Results were robust to several group-, participant-, trial-level, and covariate-adjusted analyses. Moreover, place-preferential activation itself was strongly predicted by person liking, beyond place-related ratings. These findings are consistent with social affinity potentiating place imagination, which in turn increases empathy, above and beyond person imagination.",

The current study aims to test this function by analysing the difference in filler-use in a self-directed and social speech condition. Additionally, the influence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) traits and stress on the difference in filler-use between the two conditions were examined. In the first condition, participants described a series of different tangrams to themselves. In the second condition, participants described tangrams to another participant. More words and filled pauses were used when talking to someone else, but there were no more filled pauses per word. This suggests that filled pauses do not primarily serve as communicative signals. Instead they indicate that at least to some extent, they appear involuntary and automatically as a result of errors in the language production system. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between the score on the ASD questionnaire or stress and the difference in fillers used in both speech conditions. Future research should consider experimental designs that more clearly differentiate between the presence or absence of a communicative goal, as the context of a monologue may still provide speakers with reasons to use communicative signals.",

Measurement best practices have long been overlooked in ESM research, and recent reviews show that item quality is often not reported in ESM studies. The absence of information about item quality may partly be explained by the lack of consensus on how ESM item quality should be evaluated. As part of the ESM Item Repository project (esmitemrepository.com) — an international open science initiative that collects ESM items in an open item bank and evaluates their quality — we brought together 42 international ESM experts to develop an ESM item quality assessment tool. In four Delphi phases, experts suggested 57 item quality criteria, rated the criteria, provided arguments for and against the criteria, and rated the criteria again, considering reflections from other experts. The result of the Delphi process is ESM-Q: A quality assessment tool consisting of 10 core criteria, as well as an additional 15 supplementary criteria, to be used depending on the type of items being rated and the availability of supplementary information. The criteria cover topics ranging from construct validity to the optimal wording of items. ESM-Q can aid ESM researchers in selecting existing ESM items, developing new high-quality ESM items, and evaluating the quality of ESM items in systematic reviews. Expert reflections also highlight open research questions surrounding ESM item design that form a research agenda for ESM measurement.",

To investigate the long-term effects of loving-kindness training on prosociality and aggression, we investigated changes in a range of prosocial variables at pre, post, and follow-up in a preregistered randomized controlled trial comparing three groups: loving-kindness meditation (N = 58), loving-kindness reflection (N = 53), and waitlist control (N = 92). Furthermore, to establish the robustness of the loving-kindness training relative to challenging circumstances such as cognitive fatigue, we introduced an ego depletion task at post-testing. Results. Planned contrasts analyses suggested effects on positive affect only for the meditation group, on self-reported compassion for both the meditation and reflection groups, and explicit social attitudes, aggressive behaviour, cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour, willingness to help, only for the reflection group. There were no other group differences in attitudes toward aggression, dehumanization, implicit aggression, or charity donations. Moderation analyses revealed three-way interactions between group, implicit attitudes, and ego depletion, as hypothesized, but only for compassion and cognitive accessibility of a recent altruistic behaviour. Discussion. In conclusion, results suggest that the effects of reflecting on loving-kindness concepts provide robust and reliable prosocial effects, perhaps more than meditating on those concepts. Even those benefits are limited to certain behaviours, cognitions, or affects, and they do not generalize to many common behaviours such as charity donations. However, ego depletion seems to only moderate implicit attitudes when loving-kindness is embodied through meditation and not when it is confined to the intellectual mind.",

          "abstract": "Conspiracy beliefs are widely considered resistant to factual correction, yet recent research shows that relatively brief, personalized “debunking” dialogues with a generative AI model can substantially reduce such beliefs. To identify the mechanisms driving this effect, we conducted an experiment spanning eight treatment arms that varied key features of participants’ interactions with GPT-4 during such debunking dialogues (N = 1,297). The debunking effect proved robust across most manipulations—including whether participants were explicitly told the AI aimed to change their minds, were asked to debate the AI, or whether the AI offered them factual information without otherwise seeking to persuade or was concise in its exposition. The only condition that undermined the debunking effect was prompting the AI to persuade participants without presenting any counterevidence, which yielded a null effect. Furthermore, analyses of the AI’s persuasive strategies identified reasoning-based tactics as the sole significant mediator of belief change. Participants who reported feeling persuaded overwhelmingly cited the AI’s rational, evidence-focused approach. Finally, participants higher in actively open-minded thinking showed larger treatment effects. These findings suggest that AI-driven interventions reduce conspiracy beliefs principally by providing factual, targeted counterarguments that address the specific reasons people hold these beliefs.",

          "authors": "Noham Wolpe; Daniel Harlev; Eyal Bergmann; Richard Henson",
          "abstract": "People show significant individual differences in their ability to recognise emotions. These differences are particularly pronounced in ageing, with dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. Older people, for example, tend to have poorer recognition of negative emotions, such as anger, fear and sadness, but better recognition of positive emotions, such as happiness. This ‘positivity bias’ has been suggested to support mental well-being in ageing, but has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the brain correlates of increased positivity bias with age. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large, population-derived cohort across the adult lifespan, together with a standard emotion recognition task using facial expressions. We first replicated previous behavioural findings showing increased perceptual thresholds in older adults for detecting negative emotion, but reduced threshold for positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (non-clinical) depressive symptoms. This age-related bias was associated with reduced grey matter volume in bilateral anterior hippocampus-amygdala. Moreover, resting-state functional connectivity between these regions and orbitofrontal regions was greater with increased positivity bias. Together, our results suggest that the age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. Similar to neurodegenerative conditions, a positivity bias in emotion recognition may reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, which could be confirmed in longitudinal studies.",

          "authors": "Drew E. Winters; Juliet Spitz; Kristen Raymond; Crystal Natvig; Rebecca Waller; Susan Mikulich; Joseph Schacht; Joseph T. Sakai",
          "abstract": "Background: Cognitions role in youth antisocial phenotypes of callous-unemotional (CU) traits (i.e., lack of remorse, guilt, and empathy) from conduct problems (CP; i.e., antisocial patterns of disruptive and aggressive behaviors) has been a debated topic. Recent evidence points to the need for more nuance in parsing different inhibitory processes. Specifically, selective control (i.e., selectively inhibiting a prepotent response for an alternative to specific stimuli) rather than passive control (i.e., non-response action restraint) has been linked, independent of CP, to affective processing deficits in CU traits. However, it is not known whether CU traits relate to a general difficulty with cognitive demands or a specific impairment in selective control. \nMethods: The present study tested whether CU traits were differentially related to difficulties in passive versus selective control, while accounting for CP. The design for this test leveraged a randomized parallel-arm design with test and control groups. Data from 85 participants aged 12-14 (female 47%) were analyzed using mixed effects analysis accounting for individual variance across repeated measures.\nResults: CU traits were associated with better passive control performance but worse selective control performance, whereas CP were unrelated to these trials when including CU traits. These findings were supported across individual trial type accuracy and reaction time, as well as contrasts between trials (e.g., selective &gt; passive). Follow-up analysis suggested that CU traits were related to a more rigid cognitive style during selective control trials only.  \nConclusions: This study provides additional evidence of a specific cognitive limitation in selective control that differentiates CU traits from CP. Additionally, initial evidence on cognitive strategy during selective control may implicate difficulties with cognitive resources in how cognitive information is processed that aligns with work on adult psychopathy. Thus, selective control may be an important feature for understanding antisocial etiological pathways.",

Both short- and long-term effects of these conditions on the brain are poorly understood, however. We therefore initiated the PROMUS project, a high-powered longitudinal brain imaging study of ED. Here, we present the cross-sectional baseline results from the analysis of associations between symptom severity and regional gray matter volumes We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess associations between symptom severity and regional gray matter volumes in 300 participants on sick leave due to ED. Symptom severity was measured using the total score of the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ), and the subscales Physical exhaustion, Listlessness, Cognitive weariness and Tension. All analyses were adjusted for age, intracranial volume, salary, education and sick leave duration. Total SMBQ scores and Physical exhaustion were negatively associated with gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex, and right insular cortex. Listlessness was negatively associated with gray matter volume in the bilateral hippocampi, right insular cortex, left cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. These associations remained significant after adjusting for symptoms of depression, except for the insular cortex. No significant associations were observed for Cognitive weariness or Tension. These results support a link between symptom severity and gray matter alterations of brain circuits involved in stress in ED and suggest that these effects may extend beyond those attributable to depressive symptoms.",

These findings support previous research linking persistent stress conditions to a spectrum of demographic, occupational, psychiatric, psychological, and lifestyle measures.

          "abstract": "Objective: Despite growing popularity and scientific interest in meditation retreats, their effects on mental health and their safety remain poorly understood. Accordingly, we aimed to study their salutary and adverse effects on mental health. Method: We conducted a preregistered prospective intervention study among 89 adults who registered for 6-day insight mindfulness meditation retreats and 46 matched controls (Mage(SDage) = 33.75(9.50), 56.3% female). Controls were selected from a pool of 543 people recruited from the same community of meditators as retreat participants and matched to retreat participants on age and lifetime meditation experience. Participants completed measures of well-being (WHO-5), affect (I-PANAS-SF), emotion regulation (DERS-16), repetitive negative thinking (PTQ), brooding rumination (RRS-B), depression (PHQ-9), and anxiety (OASIS) at baseline and at 2-week follow-up. Results: Retreat participants demonstrated significant improvements in well-being, negative affect, perseverative thinking, brooding rumination, and depression symptoms at follow-up compared to matched controls (η² range = .04–.08, ps &lt; .05). Importantly, the % of participants exhibiting statistically reliable deterioration in mental health outcomes were equal or lower among retreat participants than among matched controls in the entire sample, as well as in a sub-sample with clinically elevated depression and/or anxiety (ORs &lt; 1). Conclusions: A 6-day mindfulness meditation retreat can produce mental health benefits on par with effect sizes of longer 8-week mindfulness-based programs. Findings challenge concerns about adverse effects of intensive high-dose meditation training and suggest that it may be a safe and effective intervention modality, even for clinically vulnerable adults struggling with depression and anxiety.",

          "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has long been associated with economic and social decision-making in neuroimaging studies. Several debates question whether different ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) regions have specific functions or whether there is a gradient supporting social and non-social cognition. Here, we tested an unusually large sample of rare participants with focal damage to mPFC (N = 33), individuals with lesions elsewhere (N = 17), and healthy controls (N = 71) (total N = 121). Participants completed a temporal discounting task to estimate their baseline discounting preferences before learning the preferences of two other people, one who was more temporally impulsive and one more patient. We used Bayesian computational models to estimate baseline discounting and susceptibility to social influence after learning others’ economic preferences. mPFC damage increased susceptibility to impulsive social influence compared to healthy controls and increased overall susceptibility to social influence compared to those with lesions elsewhere. Importantly, voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) of computational parameters showed that this heightened susceptibility to social influence was attributed specifically to damage to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, area 9; permutationbased threshold free cluster enhancement (TFCE) p &lt; 0.025). In contrast, lesions in the vmPFC (areas 13 and 25) and ventral striatum were associated with a preference for seeking more immediate rewards (permutation-based TFCE p &lt; 0.05). We show that the dmPFC is causally implicated in susceptibility to social influence, with distinct ventral portions of mPFC involved in temporal discounting. These findings provide causal evidence for sub-regions of the mPFC underpinning fundamental social and cognitive processes.",

Here, we study how differing training curricula help or hinder learning in a classic probabilistic cue combination task. Training curricula that ‘divide and conquer’ by presenting one cue at a time facilitate later performance on test trials involving multiple cues. We show that this can be explained by a boundedly rational learning model in which credit is (erroneously) assigned to each input independent of every other. We use this model to generate new ‘skewed distribution’ multi-cue curricula that should, and should not, successfully promote human learning. The model makes accurate predictions, demonstrating that we can use cognitive models to accelerate human probabilistic learning.",

We\nargue that attention control plays an important and fundamental role in mediating the relationship\nbetween basic sensory processes and more complex cognitive processes such as fluid\nintelligence.

In this paper, we examine the mental speed and the\nattention control perspectives on the inspection time task and its relationship with fluid\nintelligence. Integrating experimental and correlational approaches, we find that attention control\nexplains the inspection time task’s correlation with fluid intelligence and working memory\ncapacity. Attention control and inspection time are correlated beyond their relationship with\nother measures of processing speed. Further, while we find no evidence that selective attention\nspecifically is related to inspection time performance, both attention control and inspection time\npredicted declines in accuracy as participants sustained their attention over time; other measures\nof processing speed did not predict sustained attention performance.

          "abstract": "Objectives: Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) describes a dispositional aversion to uncertainty. Recent research has identified IU as a causal contributor to pervasive decision difficulties (indecisiveness). Given that IU and indecisiveness occur across mental disorders, understanding whether IU's causal role in indecisiveness extends to clinical populations is critical. This study therefore tested the effect of IU on indecisiveness in a clinical sample.\nMethods: In this pre-registered experiment, N = 154 individuals with formally diagnosed obsessive-compulsive and/or anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to a condition aimed at either increasing or decreasing IU. Subsequently, participants reported their current levels of (situational) IU and, critically, their indecisiveness regarding two personally relevant decisions.\nResults: The experimental manipulation successfully altered IU levels. Participants with heightened IU exhibited more indecisiveness compared to those with reduced IU, but this effect occurred only indirectly through situational IU. The observed effect sizes were small.\nLimitations: Compared to preceding research, effect sizes were small and the effect of IU on indecisiveness only manifested itself indirectly. More robust interventions may be necessary to induce more pronounced changes in IU within clinical populations. The reliance on a heterogeneous sample with various diagnoses limits the disorder-specificity of the findings.\nConclusions: These results extend the causal role of IU in indecisiveness to mental disorders. The findings suggest IU as a potential approach for addressing problematic indecisiveness.",

          "abstract": "Understanding fractions is a major hurdle for many students. A key aspect of fraction comprehension\nis the ability to evaluate their numerical magnitude. Here, we use a number-to-line task, where\nstudents point to the location of a number on a graduated line, to characterize errors in fraction\ncomprehension. A total of ~26,000 French pupils from 6th to 10th grade were tested. Error rates were\nhigh, almost 80% in 6th grade and 45% in 10th grade. Errors could be classified into seven dominant\npatterns, whose frequency varied by grade level and individual performance. Younger and\nlower-performing children mostly confused fractions with decimals. Older and higher-performing\n𝑎\n𝑏\nchildren often confused a fraction 𝑏 and its inverse 𝑎 . All grades also confused the roles of the\nnumerator and the denominator. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting that errors arise as\nbugs in the execution of one of two main strategies: children converting the fraction into a decimal,\nor partitioning the line into units and counting them. This model explains the observed error patterns\nas stemming from inappropriate strategy selection, flawed execution, or incorrect corrective steps\ndue to flawed execution. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the various traps that\nstudents face when interpreting a fraction’s magnitude, the frequency of these errors, and their\nsequential order.",

          "abstract": "Despite the complexity of real-world environments, natural vision is seamlessly efficient. To explain this efficiency, researchers often use predictive processing frameworks, in which perceptual efficiency is determined by the match between the visual input and internal models of what the world should look like. In natural scene processing, predictions derived from our internal models of a scene should play a particularly important role, given the highly reliable statistical structure of our environment. Despite their importance for scene perception, we still do not fully understand what is contained in our internal models of the environment. Here, we argue that the current literature on scene perception disproportionately focuses on an experimental approach that tries to infer the contents of internal models from arbitrary, experimenter-driven manipulations in stimulus characteristics. To make progress, additional participant-driven approaches are needed: Rather than solely relying on manipulating the input to the visual system, researchers should adopt a complementary approach focusing on participants' descriptions of what they believe constitutes a typical scene. Such descriptions promise to capture the contents of internal models in more unconstrained ways on the level of individual participants. Critically, the descriptions of internal models can in turn be used to predict the efficiency of scene perception. We highlight recent studies on memory and perception using innovative methodologies like line drawings to characterize internal representations. These emerging methods show that it is now time to also study natural scene perception from a different angle – starting with a characterization of individual’s expectations about the world.",

          "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a powerful clinical tool for treating neuropsychiatric conditions, yet our understanding of how TMS modulates neural circuits in the human brain remains limited. While decades of research have established the therapeutic efficacy of TMS, fundamental questions persist about the spatial and temporal dynamics of TMS effects, including which brain regions are activated and modulated, how long neural changes persist, and the mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effect. Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and intracranial electroencephalography (TMS-iEEG) can fill this gap by providing important insights into how the human brain responds to non-invasive stimulation. TMS-iEEG enables investigation of both local cortical responses and network-level propagation with millisecond temporal resolution and precise spatial localization. This chapter provides an overview for conducting TMS-iEEG experiments. We first detail phantom validation procedures for evaluating potential heating, electrode displacement, and induced currents. We then outline safety monitoring protocols for human participants, including continuous electrophysiological monitoring for epileptiform activity. Finally, we outline procedures to perform TMS-iEEG experiments – from equipment setup through data collection and analysis. When properly implemented, TMS-iEEG can reveal both immediate local effects and network-level responses to TMS that are not accessible through conventional recording approaches, providing critical insights into the mechanisms of brain stimulation.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive sciences are grappling with the reliability paradox: measures that robustly produce within-group effects tend to have low test-retest reliability, rendering them unsuitable for studying individual differences. Despite the growing awareness of this paradox, its full extent remains underappreciated. Specifically, most research focuses exclusively on how reliability affects correlational analyses of individual differences, while largely ignoring its effects on studying group differences. Moreover, some studies explicitly and erroneously suggest that poor reliability does not pose problems for studying group differences, possibly due to conflating within- and between-group effects. In this short report, we aim to clarify this misunderstanding. Using both data simulations and mathematical derivations, we show how observed group differences get attenuated by measurement reliability. We consider multiple scenarios, including when groups are created based on thresholding a continuous measure (e.g., patients vs. controls or median split), when groups are defined exogenously (e.g., treatment vs. control groups, or male vs. female), and how the observed effect sizes are further affected by differences in measurement reliability and between-subject variance between the groups. Overall, we show that just as for correlational strength, observed standardized group differences are attenuated as a function of sqrt{reliability} for each measure. This has important implications for biomarker discovery, clinical translation, and other areas of group differences research that inform policy and real-world applications.",

While previous research has primarily focused on perception (vision, audition), this study explores the application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model visual working memory through a 2-back task. Participants viewed sequences of images and identified whether each image was seen two steps back in the sequence. We trained Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks on this task using pixel-level representations of complex images from the ImageNet database and utilized the learned representations to predict functional brain activity recorded from subjects performing the 2-back task designed by the Human Connectome Project. Results demonstrate that ANNs can perform the 2-back task with high accuracy, and sparse attention mechanisms were beneficial for a fixed network capacity. The artificial representations of images effectively encoded individual brain activity during 2-back trials. High encoding accuracy was consistently observed in regions such as the dorsal and visual dorsal streams, and frontal cortices.",

Whilst evidence indicates multiple factors contribute to dissociative experiences, a multifactorial explanation of increased risk for dissociation has yet to be achieved. Methods: We used multiple regression to investigate the relative influence of five plausible risk factors (childhood trauma, loneliness, marginalisation, socio-economic status, and everyday stress), and machine learning to generate tentative high-risk profiles for ‘felt sense of anomaly’ dissociation (FSA-dissociation) using cross-sectional online survey data from 2384 UK-based 16- to 25-year-olds. Results: Multiple regression indicated that four risk factors significantly contributed to FSA-dissociation, with relative order of contribution: everyday stress, childhood trauma, loneliness and marginalisation. Exploratory analysis using machine learning suggested dissociation results from a complex interplay between interpersonal, contextual, and intrapersonal pressures: alongside marginalisation and childhood trauma, negative self-concept and depression were important in younger (16–20 years), and anxiety and maladaptive emotion regulation in older (21–25 years) respondents. Conclusions: Validation of these findings could inform clinical assessment, and prevention and outreach efforts, improving the under-recognition of dissociation in mainstream services.",

          "abstract": "Irritability and anhedonia are two prevalent, co-occurring, and impairing symptoms of major depression that are proposed to result from dysfunctions in reward processing. While irritability is associated with heightened sensitivity to reward receipt, anhedonia is linked to blunted sensitivity to reward receipt. Given these supposed paradoxical effects on reward sensitivity, it is noteworthy that no studies have examined how both symptoms interact to affect reward sensitivity. In a community sample of young adults (N=73, Mage=21.21±2.27, 56.16% females), we evaluated the interacting effects of dimensionally-assessed irritability and anhedonia symptoms on neural (i.e., event-related potentials and time-frequency) measures of reward and loss sensitivity during the Doors task, a well-known reward paradigm. We used univariate and multivariate (based on generalized eigendecomposition) approaches to isolate patterns of delta and theta activity in response to reward and loss. General linear models tested the unique and interacting effects of irritability and anhedonia on EEG measures of reward sensitivity (Feedback-Related Negativity [FRN], Reward Positivity [RewP], theta, and delta power). Results revealed a significant interaction effect of irritability and anhedonia on the FRN to loss (R2=.13, F(3, 69)=3.35, β=-.03, p&lt;.01). Specifically, anhedonia was associated with larger (i.e., more negative) FRN to loss only in the presence of high irritability. At low levels of irritability, anhedonia was associated with smaller (i.e., more positive) FRN to loss. We also found that anhedonia was associated with reduced theta power to win (R2=.20, F(3, 69)= 5.89, β=-.01, p&lt;.01) at mean and high irritability levels. These effects remained significant when controlling for broader depressive symptoms, gender, and income. These findings provide preliminary evidence of an interactive effect of anhedonia and irritability on neural sensitivity to both reward and loss in individuals without clinical levels of symptoms. Our results highlight the importance of considering symptom interactions to better understand reward-related mechanisms in depression.",

While such similarities may stem from perceptual tendencies, cognitive heuristics, or cultural transmission, they also deeply resonate with concept of the Unus Mundus explored by Jung and Pauli.

          "abstract": "For spatial frequency and orientation modulated textures, the cue combination advantage in target detection and discrimination is much stronger than expected from independent cue processing, known as \"feature synergy\". We explored the neural origin of this effect, having 38 observers perform target localization and more difficult shape identification, while simultaneously recording EEG. The results showed a strong feature synergy effect over a wide range of feature contrasts in both tasks, which was accompanied by a strongly reduced posterior P2 amplitude in a time window from 240 to 280 ms after stimulus onset (TOI-1) and to a lesser extent by a reduction of P3 in a later time window from 320 to 380 ms (TOI-2), both in a cluster of 13 adjacent electrodes from the left, central and right occipital and central parietal-occipital lobes. Only a subset of electrodes responded to increased target saliency due to higher feature contrasts, while all electrodes consistently showed the strongest amplitude reduction for the double-cue condition. In TOI-1, ERP amplitudes were lower for localization than for shape identification at the same feature contrasts, but the effect was reversed in TOI-2, where significant double-cue effects mainly concerned shape identification. The task dependence of the P2 reduction and the specificity of the P3 double-cue effects for the more demanding shape identification task indicate that fewer resources need to be allocated to a given task when features are combined. This suggests an origin in sites where features and shapes are processed under attentional control.",

          "abstract": "Sudden changes are common in clinical trajectories, yet a theoretical framework to understand the underlying mechanisms is still lacking. In this article, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing the mechanisms and features of four distinct types of transitions drawn from complex dynamic system research: bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping), noise-induced tipping (N-tipping), rate-induced tipping (R-tipping), and noise-induced diffusion (N-diffusion). Those types of transitions differ in the main cause of the change and data characteristics. To illustrate their application to clinical phenomena, we present two real-life scenarios using simulated time series. These examples demonstrate how theoretical types of change may connect to clinical phenomena and highlight how different types of transitions can co-occur in various subsystems. In the first example, we show that the mood system and the momentary affect system of a patient with sudden loss may show B-tipping and N-diffusion at the same time; in the second example, we show that increasing the stimulus strengthening speed in exposure therapy may lead to R-tipping, while the therapeutic decision in this context may be caused by N-tipping. Finally, we lay out possible pathways for determining the appropriate type of transition for future empirical research, highlighting methods both from dynamic system research and special opportunities for research in clinical psychology.",

Yet, differential diagnosis is challenging and limited to clinical interviews and self-report symptom questionnaires. We predicted that obsessions and paranoia would be associated with distinct patterns of behavior in our well-established probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task. Probabilistic reversal learning involves updating beliefs about rewards when contingencies change. Obsessions and paranoia have been linked to excessive switching behaviors during reversal learning, although some report perseveration in patients with OCD and those with schizophrenia. Here, we analyze data gathered from the general population to assess the associations between obsessions, paranoia, and PRL task performance. Using a novel computational method – Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Modeling combined with a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter – we distinguish the impacts of paranoia and obsession on reversal learning – despite their significant correlation. We find that win-switching arises in paranoia from deficits in learning about uncertainty in the global task structure, whereas excessive switching in OCD arises from challenges in learning about uncertainty at the local choice level.",

Recently, it has been shown that a low-level summary statistic, net contrast\nenergy, predicts this double-cue advantage, suggesting integration at an early stage\nof image analysis. Here we asked whether there is also a double-cue advantage in more\nadvanced shape-from-texture judgments beyond figure-ground segregation. In target\ndetection and a more complex shape discrimination task d’ sensitivity was adjusted to\nthe same baseline levels for targets with feature contrast in orientation and spatial frequency\ncues, and performance was measured for double-cue targets. Contrary to earlier\nresults reported for simpler shape discriminations we found a weaker double-cue advantage\nin the more complex shape identification task. Particularly, double-cue sensitivity\nwas notably lower than the algebraic sum of the single-cue sensitivities, a level which\nwas consistently reached in the detection task. Control measurements with high feature\ndifferences between target and background showed perfect detection performance,\nboth with single cues and their combination. Shape identification performance, however,\nsaturated at levels between 83% − 90% accuracy, depending on the feature condition,\nindicating that enhanced target saliency is insufficient for extracting unique shape representations\nfrom the texture stimuli. The findings corroborate that cue summation enhances\nfigure-ground segregation in cluttered images, while there is no evidence that it\nalso augments more specific processes involved in the recognition of 2D texture shapes.",

          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of curve group such as similarity curve using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using an exponential distribution. We obtained an equation relating the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time he or she is depressed, and described the importance of considering the time when a person becomes depressed. Next, we derived an equation giving the time of being depressed and showed that the time of being depressed has an exponential distribution. We also described the connection to similarity curve and other results in the previously discussed paper. Finally, we stated that placing oneself in an environment or state where one is less likely to become depressed is a way to cope with depression.",

          "authors": "Andrea Adriano",
          "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying numerosity perception remain debated, with theories proposing either a dedicated system for segmented items or reliance on low-level features such as spatial frequency (SF) and texture-density. Numerosity adaptation—where exposure to an array of objects shifts the perceived numerosity of a subsequently presented array—has been considered strong evidence for a dedicated numerosity-processing system. However, a recent hypothesis suggests that this effect results from filtering previously processed information rather than genuine numerosity adaptation. To clarify the visual features driving this phenomenon, we employed a novel adaptation paradigm in which participants were exposed to arrays of illusory-contours (ICs) items before performing a comparison task on arrays of real dots. ICs arrays, generated using the Ehrenstein-illusion, allowed us to disentangle numerosity adaptation from texture-density/SF or filtering effects. Because ICs-numerosity in the Ehrenstein grid is negatively correlated with texture-density/SF (e.g., fewer ICs cause greater power in low-SFs), the texture-density hypothesis predicts a reduction in the point of subjective equality (PSE) after adaptation, whereas the filtering hypothesis predicts no effect. Our results showed a significant increase in PSE following adaptation, suggesting that adaptation was driven by the number of ICs in the adapting arrays rather than by SF. Moreover, the strong difference between control and adaptation conditions indicates that adaptation was not merely due to filtering. In sum, our findings demonstrate that numerosity adaptation is driven by item quantity, irrespective of stimulus type, providing further support for a numerosity-selective mechanism and challenging theories based solely on low-level visual features or filtering.",

We present data from a large survey of the Danish population, showing that some types of supernatural beliefs are somewhat widespread in Denmark (with some beliefs, e.g. angels, being much more prevalent than others, e.g. vampires), but much less so than in Sweden and in particular the USA. Supernatural beliefs are non-randomly distributed and fall into meaningful clusters, including clusters of spiritualism and magical thinking. Our analysis shows a strong correlation between biological sex and belief (with women being more likely to believe in the supernatural, including religious items) and a small, negative correlation between educational attainment level and belief. The findings are consistent with the assumption that while people may be naturally predisposed for belief in supernatural agency, such belief can be facilitated or counteracted by cultural structures.",

Its two foundational texts have been cited almost 25,000 times and it has spurred theoretical, empirical, and applied research across a wide array of topics. Despite its successes, I will argue in this talk that a number of its theoretical and meta-theoretical commitments and the underdetermination of some of its core tenets hold it back. Specifically, I will outline 5 related issues in current statements, understandings, and/or operationalizations of the theory: (1) an overemphasis on (and sometimes conflation of) groups as categories; (2) a general ambiguity with regard to the nature of the stimuli being categorized; (3) an underappreciation of the distinction between categories and entities; (4) a relative absence of recursive embedding in conceptions of the self and of the relations between self and other; and (5) the implausibility (and perhaps the computational intractability) of meta-contrast as a basis for category differentiation. I will conclude the talk with a discussion of ways in which these challenges can be addressed, with the goal of strengthening Self-Categorization Theory and extending its scope into the future.",

          "abstract": "Models like the drift diffusion model have been highly influential in explaining decision-making as a tug-of-war process, where evidence for competing options accumulates until a threshold is reached. While these models capture several key aspects of decision-making, they have difficulty accounting for others, including the influence of individual option values on choice speed and the subjective cost of choosing, as well as the fact that that choice competition is itself malleable. This chapter argues for a broader framework that moves beyond a strict tug-of-war approach, by incorporating both independent and competitive evidence accumulation. We show that adopting this alternate framework not only better accounts for the evaluative processes underlying choice (e.g., which option is best), but also how the same evaluations can be applied towards decisions about how good one’s options are on the whole; whether and when to make a choice; and how many options to choose.",

Since special relativity provides the groundwork for the general theory of relativity by providing the building blocks consisting of local Lorentz reference frames, the imaginative, cognitive component found in the relativity of simultaneity is key to understanding general relativity as well.

Cognitive control training has shown potential as a preventative intervention in RMD with small to moderate effect sizes, but substantial heterogeneity in effects between individuals exists.\n\nObjective: This study aimed to identify individual characteristics associated with treatment response to CCT in RMD participants using machine learning models.\n\nMethods: A sample of 227 RMD participants underwent a CCT regimen of at least 10 sessions. Three machine-learning models were evaluated: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost, alongside one random classifier benchmark. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were computed. The importance of individual features in predicting preventative effects was assessed using SHAP values.\n\nResult: All models demonstrated low performance, despite different machine learning methodologies and robust analyses. The random forest model scored the highest performance, although this was still considered low (accuracy: 0.52; AUC-ROC: 0.46). Exploratory feature importance analysis revealed that age, sense of well-being, and life satisfaction were important variables in the models, while current use of psychotherapy, number of prior depressive episodes, and a history of inpatient treatment were not.\n\nConclusion: All models performed poorly, indicating that baseline characteristics did not confidently predict CCT preventative effects in this RMD sample. Exploratory feature analysis proposed some variables that increase the likelihood of benefiting from CCT, as well as  indicated that most demographical variables did not strongly affect treatment effects, suggesting that CCT may be suitable for a broad range of RMD individuals.",

Support vector regressions were applied to analyze eight minutes of resting-state EEG with eyes open and closed before and after unrelated tasks. The decoding performance between the spectral power of 59 EEG channels within 30 frequency bins and fluid and crystallized intelligence, was evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation. We could not identify any meaningful associations between resting-state EEG spectral power and either fluid or crystallized intelligence. However, we replicated the previously reported association between state sleepiness and theta power, attesting to the integrity of the CoScience data set. Furthermore, the decomposition of the EEG signal into its periodic and aperiodic components revealed that the aperiodic offset parameter is significantly correlated with state sleepiness, emphasizing the relevance of aperiodic signal components in understanding states of alertness versus sleepiness.",

Here, we systematically charted the variability of PGS predictions in N=8,115 dizygotic twins from UK, US, Swedish, and German samples aged 7 to 19 years. \n\nPopulation-level PGS predictions of educational achievement ranged from beta =.16 to .37 across ages and countries. Indirect genetic effects due to environmental confounding accounted for 10% to 65% of the population-level PGS predictions, with family socioeconomic status explaining 29-100% of these indirect genetic effects. Variability in direct and indirect genetic effects was largely unsystematic across countries’ school systems (multi-tiered vs. comprehensive) and children’s ages. Therefore, interpretations of indirect genetic effects on educational achievement remain, at present, speculative.",

          "abstract": "Background: Conduct problems trajectory studies suggest their development is highly heterogeneous and that different trajectories may be uniquely associated with different risk factors and outcomes. Yet studies combining trajectory modelling and a varied set of genetic and early-life risk factors, as well as adult outcomes, are scarce. \n\nMethods: We analysed data from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), a longitudinal UK twin cohort (N=18,993). Conduct problems were measured using parent reports of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) conduct problems subscale at four time points between ages 4 and 12. Trajectories were identified using growth mixture modelling. We then explored associations between trajectory class membership and genetic and early-life factors (age 4), and adult life and clinical outcomes (age 26). \n\nResults: Four conduct problem trajectories were identified: Low Stable (n=15,304, 81%), Childhood-Limited (n= 1,395, 7%), Childhood-Increasing (n=1,791, 9%) and Persistent (n=503, 3%). Associations with risk factors followed a stepped pattern with individuals in the Persistent class reporting higher genetic liability and early-life risk. Higher genetic vulnerability to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder distinguished between the Low Stable and all other classes. Higher externalising problems polygenic score, negative family environment and hyperactivity/inattention, distinguished between all classes, except the Childhood-Increasing and the Childhood-Decreasing ones. Children experiencing conduct problems in childhood were at higher risk for reporting poorer current and lifetime mental and physical health outcomes, lower educational attainment and financial difficulties.\n\nConclusions: Children experiencing conduct problems face multiple risk factors that should be addressed. Previously identified risk factors (i.e. negative family environment, hyperactivity/inattention), continued to differentiate between all classes after accounting for various psychiatric polygenic scores, validating existing interventions targeting these factors. Childhood conduct problems were associated with poor outcomes in adulthood, emphasising the need to develop interventions identifying those at risk early.",

          "authors": "Takuya Yabu",
          "abstract": "So far, we have used stochastic differential equations to explain the process that leads to feelings and thoughts that assume a Wiener process. In reality, however, depressive symptoms may suddenly appear when one is feeling at ease. When a person is suffering from depression, the value of a group of curves, such as the person's similarity curve, is at a negative minimum if we consider the Wiener process. However, a person may go from being at ease to being depressed, i.e., the value of the similarity curve or other curve group may suddenly go from a positive value to a negative minimum. This cannot be explained by the conventional concept of similarity curves and other curve groups using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depressive symptoms using exponential distribution (exponential process) and Poisson process. We derived the stochastic differential equation given for the time when the person is not depressed, and showed that the time when the person is not depressed is an exponential distribution (exponential process). We also derived an exponential distribution (exponential process) for the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time, and showed that the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time is a Poisson process. Based on these results, we explained the relationship between the number of times a person becomes depressed during a certain period of time and the time when he or she is not depressed. We also discussed the connection with similarity curve and other results in the previously discussed paper. Finally, he stated that placing oneself in an environment or state where one is less likely to become depressed is a way to cope with depression.",

          "abstract": "Both obsessions and paranoia are characterized by cognitive inflexibility, particularly in uncertain environments. Yet, differential diagnosis is challenging and limited to clinical interviews and self-report symptom questionnaires. We predicted that obsessions and paranoia would be associated with distinct patterns of behavior in our well-established probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) task. Probabilistic reversal learning involves updating beliefs about rewards when contingencies change. Obsessions and paranoia have been linked to excessive switching behaviors during reversal learning, although some report perseveration in patients with OCD and those with schizophrenia. Here, we analyze data gathered from the general population to assess the associations between obsessions, paranoia, and PRL task performance. Using a novel computational method – Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Modeling combined with a Hierarchical Gaussian Filter – we distinguish the impacts of paranoia and obsession on reversal learning – despite their significant correlation. We find that win-switching arises in paranoia from deficits in learning about uncertainty in the global task structure, whereas excessive switching in OCD arises from challenges in learning about uncertainty at the local choice level.",

          "abstract": "The rapid growth of psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) research and considerable debate around PAT’s promise and limitations as a healthcare intervention demand addressing theoretical gaps in PAT development. Traditional clinical trials evaluate PAT as a simple pharmaceutical treatment, overlooking its inherent complexity as a multi-component intervention. This position piece advocates for applying the UK Medical Research Council’s complex intervention framework to PAT, emphasising: theory of therapeutic change, structured development phases, contextual interactions, and stakeholder inclusion. The limitations of standard explanatory clinical trials, particularly their challenges with real-world validity, are contrasted with pragmatic clinical trial designs. Pragmatic randomised controlled trials (RCTs), informed by the PRECIS-2 tool, provide a pathway to align PAT clinical trial designs with real-world applications. This approach enables the exploration of how PAT interacts with existing healthcare systems potentially optimising its therapeutic utility in the intended patient population.  Furthermore, we discuss the philosophical divergence between perspectives on PAT’s efficacy, contrasting drug-centric views with psychotherapy-augmented theories and how this should influence PAT trial design. We propose the integration of qualitative data, adaptive designs, and comparative effectiveness research to refine PAT interventions and address the shortcomings of conventional double-blind RCTs. By leveraging academic and community-led research, this work proposes a pluralistic evidentiary model, enabling more inclusive, practical trial designs that might be considered in expanded evidence assessments. This approach holds the promise of advancing psychedelic medicine while avoiding the historical pitfalls that limited its development in prior decades.",

Many traditional neuropsychological assessments are time-consuming, require specialized training, and are impractical for widespread use in primary care settings. In this study, we review the current landscape of cognitive screening tools and present a novel, fully automated screener based on two tasks from the Creyos cognitive assessment platform. This screener, designed for rapid administration without clinical supervision, effectively differentiates between cognitively normal individuals and those at risk of progression along the Alzheimer’s disease continuum. Validation analyses demonstrate that the screener has high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming many conventional assessments while promising to significantly reduce the burden on clinicians. By offering a brief, accessible, and reliable alternative to standard screening tools, this approach has the potential to enhance early detection efforts and facilitate timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resources.",

          "abstract": "In 1952, the psychiatrist Erwin Stengel hypothesized that suicide becomes rarer in times when the value of life within a society is lower, when death is more common. In Canada, suicide rates and death rates present with consistent seasonal patterns between years. However, these were broken by the high death rates occurring at unusual times of year during the COVID-19 pandemic. This offers a unique opportunity to observe whether suicide rates follow suit. The present study models weekly Canadian suicide rates using death rates, from time series data spanning 2010 to 2019 (n = 521). Results indicate that suicide rates decrease on average by 0.27 standard deviations per 1 standard deviation increase in the death rate. This model is then used to predict 2020 suicide rates, using 2020 death rates (n = 52). These predictions account for 11.6% of the variation in actual 2020 suicide rates. However, this model does not perform well when predicting 2021 suicide rates. Limited evaluation of incomplete data from 2022 and 2023 was carried out as additional validation. We conclude that the process co-generating suicide and death rates pre-pandemic was maintained during the pandemic in 2020, but was disrupted in 2021.",

          "abstract": "Background: Ageism, defined as stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination based on a person’s age is prevalent and negatively impacts individuals and society. In 2016 WHO received a mandate from its Member States to lead the global campaign to combat ageism. However, success in combating ageism is critically dependent on the availability of valid and reliable measures of people’s experiences of ageism that can capture its multidimensional nature and as directed against multiple age groups across diverse country settings. The goal of current study is to present a preliminary psychometric validation of a measure specifically designed to meet this need: the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale. The scale includes items measuring self-directed, interpersonal, and institutional ageism and spans stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination. \nMethod: We collected data from a UK mixed-age adult sample (N = 402), and several psychometric properties were tested, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity. \nResults: Results suggested that the 15-item WHO experiences of ageism scale has good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The exploratory factor analysis supported a one-factor model for self-directed ageism items. This scale also proved to have adequate convergent validity. \nDiscussion: The results provide sufficient supports for the adoption of the scale in this population and underscore the need for its translation and validation in other settings, as well as the evaluation of a more extended set of psychometric properties in future studies.",

          "abstract": "Neuroinflammation represents a crucial pathophysiological process of cognitive decline during aging and may play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Many magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have investigated the extent and consequences of neuroinflammation in the elderly and in people at various stages of ADRD. These imaging tools allow quantification of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, white and gray matter injuries, and functional loss of the brain. Here, we reviewed this literature and provided a summary of the pros and cons of these various imaging protocols. With a focus on neuroinflammation, studies that characterized structural and functional brain changes but did not relate the findings to neuroinflammation were outside the scope of this review. However, we provided a brief survey on studies combining multiple imaging modalities for readers to have a broader view on neuroinflammation, aging, and ADRD. We first introduced the techniques of MRI to study BBB dysfunction, neuroinflammation, gray and white matter deficits, and functional brain changes. In the second section, we focused on the studies of neuroinflammation during aging. Finally, we described the imaging studies of ADRD in the context of neuroinflammation. Collectively, studies indicate that aging and AD are marked by progressive BBB dysfunction linked to cognitive decline, whereas neural markers derived of diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic transfer imaging, MR spectroscopy, structural imaging, and functional connectivity provide insights into neuroinflammatory processes. This literature supports MRI’s potential as a non-invasive tool for monitoring neuroinflammation and disease onset and progression.",

We found a bifactor model provided the best fit, with separate specific\nfactors for Machiavellianism/psychopathy, grandiose narcissism, and everyday sadism in addition\nto a global latent factor. This finding suggests that the four subscales are united by a common\ncore. Moreover, it indicates the unique aspects of Machiavellianism and psychopathy represent\nopposite ends of the same dimension and the sadism subscale is empirically distinct from the\npsychopathy subscale. However, the differentiation between the sadism and psychopathy\nsubscales appears to primarily be a consequence of the sadism subscale being defined almost\nentirely by vicarious sadism. Taken together, these findings contribute to our understanding of\nantagonistic personality traits, while also pointing to the need for further refinement in the\nmeasurement of everyday sadism within the SD4.",

Despite being heralded amongst the “kinematic laws of nature” (Flash 2021, p. 4), there is no consensus on its origin, common reporting practice, or vetted analytical protocol. Many legacy elements of analytical protocols in the literature are suboptimal, such as noise amplification from repeated differentiation, biases arising from filtering, log transformation distortion, and injudicious linear regression, all of which undermine power law calculations. This article reviews prior power law calculation protocols, identifies suboptimal practices, before proposing solutions grounded in the kinematics literature and related fields of enquiry. Ultimately, we synthesise these solutions into a vetted, modular protocol which we make freely available to the scientific community. The protocol’s modularity accommodates future analytical advances and permits re-use of modules useful in broader kinematic science applications. We propose that adoption of this protocol will eliminate spurious confirmation of the law and enable more sensitive quantification of recently noted power law divergences. These divergences have been linked to neurochemical disturbances arising from ingestion of dopaminergic drugs, and in neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s and autism.",

The central hypothesis is that trauma exposure is linked to the emergence of PTSD and DSO, with shame and guilt serving as key mediators in this relationship.\nThe study will involve young adults participants. The investigation will examine how trauma exposure contributes to the onset of PTSD and DSO, while focusing on the role that shame- and guilt-proneness may play as mediators.\nWe anticipate finding notable correlations between shame-proneness and PTSD/DSO symptoms, as well as between guilt-proneness and PTSD/DSO symptoms. Additionally, trauma exposure is expected to predict PTSD, DSO, and both guilt- and shame-proneness. Indirect effects are also anticipated, suggesting that trauma exposure influences the development of PTSD and DSO through its impact on guilt- and shame-proneness.\nThe findings from this study may offer important insights into the emotional regulation mechanisms that underlie trauma-related disorders, highlighting the potential for interventions that focus on shame- and guilt-proneness in the treatment of trauma survivors. Future research will delve into the role of these emotions in the development of Complex PTSD and examine how they contribute to the progression of trauma-related symptoms.",

However, this approach offers limited insights into human generalization. Here, we propose refining classical RL by incorporating the efficient coding principle, which emphasizes maximizing reward using the simplest necessary representations. This refined framework predicts that intelligent agents, constrained by simpler representations, will inevitably develop the abilities to 1) distill environmental stimuli into fewer, abstract internal states; and 2) detect and utilize rewarding environmental features. Consequently, complex stimuli are mapped to compact representations, forming the basis for generalization. In two experiments, we demonstrate that, whereas classical RL models focusing on maximizing reward fail in generalization, an efficient coding model that learns compact representations achieves human-level generalization performance. We argue that efficient coding, rather than reward maximization, represents a more suitable computational goal for understanding human behavior, in terms of both learning and generalization.",

Method: Forty-six adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD or subthreshold PTSD with associated insomnia were randomly assigned to WET (n =15), WET+MBA (n = 15), or minimal contact control (MCC, n = 16). PTSD severity was assessed by the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview (PSSI-5) and the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), and insomnia with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Assessments occurred at baseline and post-treatment for all groups, with a 3-month follow-up for WET and WET+MBA participants. Results: Completion rates were 50% for WET. Treatment satisfaction was high in WET and moderate in WET+MBA. WET showed significantly greater reductions in PCL-5 (p = .022, d = -.68) and marginally greater reductions in PSSI-5 (p = .053, d = -.68) than MCC at post-treatment, with these reductions maintained during follow-up. ISI scores were significantly higher in the WET+MBA group compared to the WET group at post-treatment and follow-up. Conclusions: WET demonstrated preliminary effectiveness for PTSD treatment in Chinese patients but requires adaptation to improve feasibility and acceptability. Adding an MBA did not improve insomnia outcomes and may have negatively impacted satisfaction and effectiveness.",

In two quota samples from Germany (N = 539) and the UK (N = 554), we compared two prominent traditional scales of intellectual curiosity, namely, NCS-6 and ECS, and a new scale, namely, ICS, for internal consistency and factorial, construct, and predictive validity. We find that the recently proposed and culturally invariant ICS has particularly high validity in all these aspects, while also being a highly efficient measure with only six items. The EC scale also shows very good validities. The NfC scale shows the least promising results, especially regarding its internal consistency and factorial validity.",

          "abstract": "Cognitive training and physical activity independently provide benefits in cognitive functioning. However, less is known about the benefits of combining sustained cognitive and physical activity training. The Walk and Play pilot randomized controlled trial compares the preliminary efficacy of combining daily walking and gamified inhibitory control training on cognitive and physical activity outcomes among individuals endorsing cognitive challenges. After a seven-day run-in period, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions for three weeks: (1) daily 30-min walks (Walk) or (2) alternating between 30-min walks and 30-min app-based cognitive training (Walk and Play). Participants (n=32; Mage = 61) were majority women (84%), who reported cancer-related cognitive challenges (75%). Participants completed a computer-based cognitive battery at baseline and post-intervention and wore Fitbit devices to monitor physical activity metrics. Daily step count significantly increased in both study arms. The Walk &amp; Play group showed a significant increase in daily active minutes (p=.014), while Walk participants had a significant reduction in daily sedentary time (p=.0006). Walk &amp; Play participants’ performance improved on Rule Switch [t(15) = -3.05, p = 0.028], UCancellation [t(15) = -3.61, p = 0.007], and Corsi [t(15) = -2.91, p = 0.04] tasks. Post-intervention Rule Switch task performance was also significantly higher in the Walk &amp; Play group than in the Walk group [t(15) = 3.15, p = 0.019]. Combining daily walking and gamified inhibitory control training is feasible and promising as a digital, scalable solution for promoting cognitive health and physical activity.",

          "abstract": "Goal representation characterizes the cognitive structures people use to frame, perceive, and evaluate goals. Variance in goal representation provides meaningful insight into goal pursuit. However, the conceptual structure of this multifaceted construct has yet to be established. Most Goal-related theories and empirical research focus on a limited subset of dimensions, such as specificity or importance. The present project explores and evaluates the conceptual structure of goal representation using a data-driven meta-theoretical approach. We collected more than 2000 goals from 669 participants in three studies with college and online samples. In Studies 1-3, participants rated all their goals on 31 goal representation dimensions. In Study 3, participants completed three monthly follow-ups and rated all their goals again at the end. We independently conducted exploratory factor analysis in each study and extracted a four-component (Value, External Motive, Clarity, and Consensus) and a six-component structure. We evaluated the replicability and reliability of both structures. We found that all components from the four-component structure aligned across three studies and had moderate to high inter-rater reliability. All components from the six-component structure aligned between baseline and post-assessment at 3 months, and Value, External Motive, and Consensus had test-retest reliability &gt; .7. In Study 3, we found that External Motive and Attainability were positively associated with goal progress, but Value was not. Attainability was also positively associated with progress satisfaction. This project establishes a dimensional space to describe mental representations of goals and sets the foundations for future research to build tools to assess goal representation.",

          "abstract": "Electric potentials (EEG) were first recorded on the human scalp in 1924 and have since become a key window into brain activity. However, no consensus has emerged regarding their origins. Over the past 50 years, EEG has been modeled using two distinct mathematical approaches: local network models, which focus on cell membrane properties such as synaptic rise and decay times [E4,E5], and global models, which emphasize axon propagation delays in white matter [E6,Z9].\nGlobal models predict longitudinal waves of synaptic activity, akin to sound waves in an opera house. These large-scale brain waves are recorded as electric potentials or electric fields on the scalp or cortex, though they should not be confused with the (transverse) electromagnetic fields governed by Maxwell’s equations.\nThe foundational global model is classified into “Toy Model Levels” (1–11) based on its physiological accuracy and ability to replicate EEG dynamics. These models predict the dynamics of EEG frequency bands—delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma—which occur in certain brain states, selectively modulated by neocortical excitability. \nKey topics include EEG dynamics, dispersion relations, white matter properties, resonance phenomena, wave packets, and complex systems theory",

          "abstract": "Background \nMost previous research has investigated whether performing a demanding cognitive task reduces the time a person can hold a subsequent physical effort. However, no previous research has investigated if performing an intense physical exercise reduces the time a person can complete a cognitive task with an adequate level of performance. The aim of this study was to assess the subjective, behavioral and physiological responses of performing an intense physical exercise on a posterior cognitive tak until failure.\nMethods \nIn a pre-registered, within-participant experiment, 29 active participants performed a cognitive task until failure after either running to exhaustion at 90% maximal aerobic speed or walking for 10 minutes (control). Brain activity was recorded via EEG, brain complexity measured, and subjective experience assessed using the Temporal Experience Tracing (TET) method. \nResults\nPhysical exercise reduced maximal force capacity and increased perceived exertion compared to the control, highlighting significant workload differences. Cognitive task durations were 4755.8 s (95% CI: 3326.8–5107.8) and 4308.2 s (95% CI: 3902.9–5481.2) for control and experimental conditions, with no significant difference (BF10 = 0.329). Subjective experience analysis revealed two task-demand clusters, but time spent in these states was similar across conditions. Cognitive performance was better during phases of low perceived demands. Brain complexity decreased after maximal aerobic effort, suggesting a physiological shift, though cognitive performance and subjective feelings remained unaffected.\nConclusion\nThere was no evidence that short intense physical exercise negatively affected participants' ability to sustain a cognitive effort to failure.",

          "abstract": "Chronic pain represents a formidable global health issue, affecting a considerable segment of\nthe population. Even with advancements in medical interventions, a notable number of\npatients persistently suffer from pain in the absence of identifiable organic causes, designating\nthis category of chronic pain as nociplastic pain. In recent years, there has been growing\nrecognition of the significant role that danger signal processing plays in the development and\nmaintenance of chronic pain. In response to this need, an innovative online group-based\ntherapeutic approach was developed. The approach targets the mental mechanisms associated\nwith danger signal processing, using coaching to incorporate therapeutic instruments and\nreaching a wider audience with an affordable and accessible online group format.\nThis study aims to investigate the efficacy of online group intervention, termed Personal Danger\nSignals Reprocessing (PDSR), as a means to alleviate chronic pain and mental health\ncomorbidities.\nA cohort of women (N=19, mean age 43) participated in an 8-week online program, receiving\nweekly sessions. The program encompassed a comprehensive understanding of chronic pain\nwithin a systemic framework of PDSR. We collected pain outcomes, mental health\ncomorbidities, and potential psychological mechanisms at three-time points: before, in the\nmiddle, and after completing the intervention for a group of 19 participants, while the waiting\nlist group (N=20, mean age 43.5) only completed the self-report assessments on the same\ntimeframe. Finally, we also collected pain levels of the PDSR group 6 months after the formal\nintervention termination.\nThe PDSR group experienced significant reductions in pain levels throughout the intervention (p\n&lt; .001). Notably, pain levels in the PDSR group were robustly reduced both at the middle\n(Cohen's D = 0.7) and end (Cohen's D = 1.5) of the intervention compared to the waiting list\ngroup. Similarly, pain interference showed significant reductions (p &lt; .01), with a substantial\ndecrease observed in the PDSR group compared to the waiting list group after the intervention\n(Cohen's D = -1.7, p &lt; .0001). Well-being also significantly improved for the PDSR group at both\nthe middle (p &lt; .001, Cohen's D = 1.7) and end (p &lt; .001, Cohen's D = 1.8) of the intervention.\nSecondary outcomes, including pain catastrophizing, sleep interference, anxiety levels, and\ndepressive symptoms, all showed consistent reductions for the PDSR group compared to the\nwaiting list group (all p-values &lt; .01).\nFindings reveal that the PDSR online intervention holds the potential to significantly reduce\npain, enhance functional capabilities, and elevate subjective well-being for individuals grappling\nwith chronic pain. The study underscores the effectiveness of online interventions while\nemphasizing the need for further research to optimize implementation strategies.",

In this study, we aim to determine whether the coupling between structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) is linked to symptoms trajectories in a longitudinal sample of individuals diagnosed with ADHD in childhood and followed into adulthood. Specifically, we will test whether differences in SC-FC coupling within a network of neural regions centered on two specific white matter tracts (the cingulum angular bundle and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus), previously found to be altered in adults with ADHD histories, are associated with the persistence or remission of ADHD symptoms. We will also examine how to SC-FC coupling in these neural pathways relate to developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms from childhood. By focusing on the interplay between SC and FC, we aim to uncover neural signatures that differentiate adults with persistent ADHD symptoms from those whose symptoms have remitted. Findings could provide new insights into the neurodevelopmental processes underlying ADHD and may help identify neural markers predictive of symptom persistence as well as inform targeted interventions contributing to more personalized treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD across the lifespan.",

          "abstract": "The Bayes Factor is often proposed as a superior replacement to p-values in testing null \nhypotheses for various reasons, with the availability of many user-friendly and easily \naccessible statistical software tools facilitating the use of Bayesian tests.

Despite tools for conducting BFDA \nbeing limited and mostly relying on Monte Carlo methodology, methods based on root \nfinding algorithm have been recently developed (e.g., Pawel and Held, 2024), overcoming \nweaknesses of simulation approaches. This paper builds on these advancements by presenting \na method generalizing the existing approach for conducting BFDA for sample size \ndetermination in t tests. The major advantage of the current method is that it does not assume \nnormality of the effect size estimate, allowing more flexibility in the specification of the \ndesign and analysis priors.

          "abstract": "A common behaviour in natural environments is foraging for rewards. However, this is often in the presence of predators. Therefore, one of the most fundamental decisions for humans, as for other animals, is how to apportion time between reward-motivated pursuit behaviour and threat-motivated checking behaviour. To understand what affects how people strike this balance, we developed a novel ecologically inspired task and looked at both within-participant dynamics (moods) and between-participant individual differences (questionnaires about real-life behaviours) in two large internet samples (n=374 and n=702) in a cross-sectional design. For the within-participant dynamics, we found that people regulate task-evoked stress homeostatically by changing behaviour (increasing foraging and hiding). Individual differences, even in superficially related traits (apathy-anhedonia and anxiety-compulsive checking) reliably mapped onto unique behaviours. Worse task performance, due to maladaptive checking, was linked to gender (women checked excessively) and specific anxiety-related traits: somatic anxiety (reduced self-reported checking due to worry) and compulsivity (self-reported disorganized checking). While anhedonia decreased self-reported task engagement, apathy, strikingly, improved overall task performance by reducing excessive checking. In summary, we provide a novel multifaceted paradigm for assessment of checking for threat in a naturalistic task which is sensitive to both moods as they change throughout the task and clinical dimensions. Thus, it could serve as an objective measurement tool for future clinical studies interested in threat, vigilance or behaviour-emotion interactions in contexts requiring both reward-seeking and threat-avoidance.",

          "abstract": "So far, we have been using stochastic differential equations to explain the process of deriving emotions and ways of thinking based on the assumption of a Wiener process. However, in reality, there are cases where depression suddenly appears when things are going well. If a person is suffering from depression, the values of the group of curves, such as the similarity curve, will be at their lowest negative value if we consider them using a Wiener process. However, there are cases where a person goes from feeling good to suffering from depression, in other words, where the values of the group of curves, such as the similarity curve, suddenly change from positive to their lowest negative value. This cannot be explained using the conventional approach of considering groups of curves such as similar curves using the Wiener process. Therefore, we considered depression symptoms using the Poisson process and the exponential distribution (exponential process). We derived a stochastic differential equation that gives the number of times a person become depressed within a certain period of time, and showed that the number of times a person become depressed within a certain period of time follows a Poisson process. We also derived a stochastic differential equation that gives the time a person is feeling depressed, and showed that the time a person is feeling depressed follows an exponential distribution (exponential process). Based on these results, we explained the relationship between the number of times a person become depressed within a certain period of time and the length of time one is depressed. We also discussed the connections with similarity curve and other topics discussed in previous papers. Finally, We stated that putting oneself in an environment or situation where one is less likely to become depressed is a way of dealing with depression.",

          "abstract": "Compulsivity and emotional impulsivity (negative urgency) are considered transdiagnostic risk factors for compulsive-impulsive psychopathology that is linked to a neural imbalance between executive and motivational-emotional systems. However, existing evidence does not derive from within-subjects designs, leaving it unclear whether imbalance occurs with high expressions in compulsivity and negative urgency. To address this gap, we conducted a preregistered analysis to examine how feedback sensitivity and inhibitory control interact as a function of compulsivity and negative urgency.\nParticipants (n = 205; collected 2018-2019) expressing a wide range in compulsivity and impulsivity performed two inhibition and two feedback tasks during electroencephalography. We examined how the relationship between neural correlates of inhibition (nogo/stop&gt;go) and feedback sensitivity (loss&gt;gain) was moderated by compulsivity and negative urgency. Compulsivity emerged as the most robust moderator. Across multiple tasks, feedback sensitivity was associated with inhibitory activity in participants with low, but not high, compulsivity. A similar, less pronounced effect was observed in low versus high negative urgency. However, the effect of negative urgency did not remain significant after controlling for compulsivity, whereas the moderation by compulsivity remained when controlling for negative urgency. These results suggest a neural imbalance between systems tied to executive functioning and feedback sensitivity in transdiagnostic risk. This imbalance manifests such that strong motivational-emotional sensitivity is insufficiently compensated by inhibitory resources. It could drive repetitive or rash behaviors in response to distress in compulsivity and negative urgency, respectively. Whereas shared mechanisms may underlie compulsivity and negative urgency, the current interactions appear most relevant to compulsive psychopathology.",

          "abstract": "While altered motivation is central in sickness behaviour, previous research has mainly focused on motivation for rewards, rather than motivational changes in a broader perspective. In a larger study following a randomized within-subject placebo-controlled crossover design, we investigated the effects of systemic inflammatory activation on self-rated motivation in 21 healthy participants, using an intravenous injection of 2.0 ng/kg body weight lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to an intravenous injection of saline (placebo). Self-rated motivation was measured before, 3 hours, and 7.5 hours post-injection using the Motivation Scale of Sickness (MOSSick), a 26-item scale covering categories: ‘hunger and thirst’, ‘food preferences’, ‘physical activities’, ‘rest and sleep’, ‘social activities’, ‘care seeking’, and ‘utilization of resources’ (i.e., willingness to ‘pay’ and ‘walk’ to be able to rest or to be healthy at once). At the peak of the sickness response (3 hours post-LPS injection), there was an increased motivation to seek care, rest, and sleep, as compared to placebo, while motivation to partake in physical and social activities decreased. Several of these effects remained at 7.5 hours post-injection. When in the LPS condition, participants were also willing to pay more money to rest and to be healthy compared to when in the placebo condition. Hunger increased over time in both conditions, but less after LPS administration. During the peak of the sickness response, higher sickness ratings were weakly associated with lower motivation for ‘social activities’ and higher motivation for ‘rest and sleep’. No associations were found between MOSSick categories and sickness ratings or other sickness measures, i.e. concentrations of cytokines and tympanic temperature. These findings illustrate that motivational changes during acute sickness are not restricted to a general decrease in motivation. Instead, sick individuals are more motivated to take part in behaviors that enable energy preservation, care, and recovery, compared to when healthy. The MOSSick can be used in future studies to obtain an ecologically relevant and comprehensive description of subjective motivational drives in sick individuals.",

We developed embedding models for four types of values that are expressed in public comments.  We then fit models to 409,241 public comments on actions proposed by the United States Forest Service from 2011 to 2020 and regulated by the Natural Environmental Policy Act.\n4.\tThe embedding model generally outperformed the lexicon word-count, particularly for value types with shorter lexicons, and, like human evaluators, the embedding models performed better for more evident values and were less reliable for more abstract or latent values.\n5.\tBy applying the resulting model, we furthered our understanding of how the public values National Forest lands in the United States.  We observed that aesthetic and moral values were expressed more often in comments for projects that received more public interest, as gauged by the number of comments a project received and in comments for projects addressing recreational management.",

          "abstract": "The historical use of native languages for secure military communication, often referred to as code talking, has provided tactical advantages in warfare. However, this paper argues that such methods, like those employed by the Navajo code talkers of World War II, are no longer effective in modern warfare. A recent case is Russia's deployment of North Korean soldiers in the Russo-Ukrainian War, which raised the question of whether their language could provide a linguistic advantage. This paper examines why native language secrecy, including the potential use of North Korean as a code language, has lost its effectiveness. Factors such as advancements in AI-driven linguistic analysis, extensive international intelligence monitoring, and the well-documented nature of the North Korean language have significantly reduced the viability of native language ciphers. Additionally, the logistical challenges associated with deploying large numbers of North Korean soldiers without sufficient language support have further undermined their strategic value. While such methods may still hold limited utility in small-scale operations, reinforcing psychological cohesion, and confusing the enemy, they are no longer a significant asset in the modern, highly interconnected intelligence landscape.",

We show that GPT-4o's moderation decisions align with human judgments, particularly in recognizing norms regarding the use of reclaimed slurs by marginalized groups, and additional prompting can further enhance sensitivity to context. We further demonstrate that multimodal identity cues---combining visual and textual information---facilitate more nuanced content evaluation than unimodal approaches. This research underscores the potential and limitations of MLLMs for automated moderation and introduces conjoint analysis as a tool for auditing AI use in complex, context-sensitive applications.",

          "abstract": "Where do LGBTQ+ immigrants settle in the United States? The policy landscape for same-sex couples in the U.S. has changed rapidly in recent years, and number of immigrants in same-sex couples have increased rapidly. But little is known about where these lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) immigrants choose to settle and enjoy their new rights. Do they behave more similarly to their straight immigrant counterparts and locate based on job opportunities and cost of living? Or do they gravitate toward more LGBTQ+-friendly cities and states, as U.S.-born LGB people do? How have these patterns changed over time, especially in conjunction with local policy changes relevant to LGBTQ+ people and immigrants? Using American Community Survey data from 2008-2023 and original datasets, this paper studies the geographic context of immigrants in same-sex couples in the U.S. We find that the distribution of immigrants in same-sex couples is expanding across the U.S. over time. These settlement patterns generally look more similar to fellow U.S.-born LGB Americans: locations with higher concentrations are more progressive, have more robust LGBTQ+ civic life, and have higher incomes. Yet immigrants in same-sex couples also live in more racially and ethnically diverse areas compared to U.S.-born Americans in same-sex couples. Our findings contribute to a fuller understanding of this rapidly growing population and its unique characteristics.",

          "abstract": "Conjoint experiments have gained popularity in political science, accompanied by methodological discussions. We contribute to these by investigating the impact of (randomly) offering an abstention option alongside the usual forced choice dependent variable. We explore the usage of abstention employing data from a novel experiment with 4466 respondents. The findings reveal that a notable proportion of respondents abstain due to non-acceptance and unwillingness or inability to choose. Abstention from binary choice also impacts the subsequent rating tasks, suggesting binary choice may overestimate favorability deduced from conjoint experiments. Mirroring the real-world decision process, which often includes abstention options, improves our understanding of preferences and prevents biases in the analysis, highlighting the importance of considering offering an abstention option in conjoint experiments.",

We apply a differential exposure approach (DEA) to Danish population data collecting public-school reading comprehension tests. The approach exploits variation in children’s birth dates and test administration dates to decompose children’s learning as the product of joint exposure to school and non-school environments. Key findings reveal that children experiencing parental separation have 5-7% lower test scores, with lower learning returns to non-school environments, and diminishing learning outcomes proportional to time spent in separated households. Critically, school appears to neither mitigate nor exacerbate these achievement gaps, suggesting that degrading of non-school environments post-separation primarily impacts children's learning.",

          "authors": "Marie-Caroline Compans; Heini Väisänen",
          "abstract": "According to clinical studies, miscarriages, that is spontaneous pregnancy losses before 22–24 weeks of gestation, affect approximately 13 to 18 % of recognized pregnancies. However, clinical studies are rarely representative of the population. Surveys tend to be, but they are subject to misreporting of miscarriages, as suggested by existing work in the US. Thus, existing evidence of social inequalities in miscarriage risk is inconsistent. This study first applies a model to estimate the extent of miscarriage misreporting in the French FECOND survey (2010-11). Estimated 92% of miscarriages were reported and underreporting was slightly more pronounced among women with lower education. Nevertheless, the estimated prevalence of miscarriages (14% of all pregnancies) remained largely unaffected and only with small educational differences. These findings indicate that estimating miscarriage risk factors can be done without correcting for reporting bias in this survey. Second, we used multilevel multinomial logistic regressions to estimate socio-demographic characteristics and epidemiological factors associated with miscarriage. As in previous work, advanced reproductive ages were associated with a higher miscarriage risk. Our models reveal that the association between miscarriage risk and prior reproductive history is explained by unobserved time-consistent individual characteristics, such as potentially. Conversely, education and self-assessed financial conditions were not associated with miscarriage risk. Younger cohorts exhibit a higher miscarriage risk, suggesting either an age effect on recall, a cohort effect regarding pregnancy recognition, or reduced stigma resulting in more reliable reporting of miscarriage in surveys.",

          "abstract": "Organizations vary in the degree to which their members experience social belonging. Interventions designed to boost belonging have typically focused on changing individuals’ mindsets. We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues---ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: consonant, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and dissonant, to colleagues from different network communities. We hypothesize that consonant exposure engenders more group solidarity, more persistent relationships, and enhanced social belonging. We test these expectations in a pre-registered field experiment at a non-profit organization. Participants (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development experience with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either consonant or dissonant groups. Although the anticipated solidarity advantage of consonant exposure was only marginally significant when assessed immediately following the intervention, consonant-condition participants maintained more intervention-group ties and reported greater social belonging three months after the intervention. Yet, pointing to the potential tradeoffs of consonant versus dissonant exposure, dissonant-condition participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational interventions.",

          "authors": "Kamo Araz",
          "abstract": "The historical use of native languages for secure military communication, often referred to as code talking, has provided tactical advantages in warfare. However, this paper argues that such methods, like those employed by the Navajo code talkers of World War II, are no longer effective in modern warfare. A recent case is Russia's deployment of North Korean soldiers in the Russo-Ukrainian War, which raised the question of whether their language could provide a linguistic advantage. This paper examines why native language secrecy, including the potential use of North Korean as a code language, has lost its effectiveness. Factors such as advancements in AI-driven linguistic analysis, extensive international intelligence monitoring, and the well-documented nature of the North Korean language have significantly reduced the viability of native language ciphers. Additionally, the logistical challenges associated with deploying large numbers of North Korean soldiers without sufficient language support have further undermined their strategic value. While such methods may still hold limited utility in small-scale operations, reinforcing psychological cohesion, and confusing the enemy, they are no longer a significant asset in the modern, highly interconnected intelligence landscape.",

          "abstract": "Social networks shape both international migration flows and residential settlement decisions, yet few studies address the links between job-related residential networks and employment outcomes among immigrants and their children. Using Norwegian linked employer–employee administrative data with information on detailed neighborhood locations, we study how connections between neighbors are tied to workplace sorting and wages among workers of immigrant and native background. To assess the presence of residential networks, we compare workers’ observed exposure to neighbors at work against a simulated baseline of random workplace allocation within municipalities. Our findings show that immigrants are considerably more likely to show an excess workplace exposure to immigrant neighbors, particularly coethnics from the same country of origin, compared to natives living in the same neighborhood. However, working alongside immigrant neighbors is only modestly associated with lower wages among immigrants, suggesting that these networks facilitate employment but offer limited economic benefits. In contrast, children of immigrants exhibit a weaker reliance on neighborhood-based immigrant networks and show no significant wage disadvantage when working with immigrant-background neighbors. These findings highlight how residential networks concentrate immigrants in specific workplaces, while less reliance on local networks in the second generation suggests greater integration into the mainstream economy.",

          "abstract": "When researchers recruit participants for an online survey via Facebook advertisements, a \ntargeting algorithm determines which individuals receive the survey invitation. Because the \nalgorithm maximizes the number of clicks on the survey link, predominantly easy-to-reach \npopulation groups in a country or region might be reached (simple demographic targeting: \nSDT). To reduce representation bias, researchers can target selected demographic population \ngroups separately (complex demographic targeting: CDT). In this study, we evaluate whether \nCDT effectively leads to less bias in univariate, bivariate, and multivariate estimates than \nSDT. This is done by comparing socio-demographic and health-related measures of health \nsurveys recruited via Facebook with and without CDT in six African countries against \nprobability-based survey benchmarks. Independent of the targeting strategy, our results show \nthat many estimates were strongly biased, especially the univariate estimates of education and \nInternet use, whereas other estimates (e.g., HIV knowledge) were less affected. Although we \nfound minor evidence that the CDT method reduced bias in univariate estimates, bias in \nrelationship estimates stayed similar. Moreover, the study shows that univariate estimates are \ngenerally more often biased than relationship estimates and that bias is partially related to \ncoverage issues.

Social research has addressed health implications and the role of social contexts, which is crucial given pathologizing tendencies in IP research. However, large-scale empirical evidence is rare, partly because suitable instruments are missing. This study introduces the Impostor Phenomenon Short Scale (IPSS-3) as a time-efficient IP instrument suitable for surveys covering various topics with limited assessment time. Data from 424 German and 477 Hebrew-speaking adolescents and young adults is used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the IPSS-3. Results demonstrate that the IPSS-3 is a reliable instrument ready for implementation in different fields, showing high internal consistency and strong correlations with two validation scales, namely external locus of control and self-esteem. The IPSS-3 is thus a robust tool that can facilitate new ventures in IP research from a social science perspective.",

          "abstract": "The Impostor Phenomenon (IP) represents a popular research topic among scholars in various disciplines, frequently approached through a lens of individualization and pathologization. This study explores its relevance within the educational domain and contextualizes the IP by examining its association with social group membership along the dimensions of gender, immigration origin, and socioeconomic status. Providing empirical insights into the implications of the IP for social upward mobility through educational gains, this study addresses two research questions: (1) “who is particularly affected by the IP?” and (2) “is the IP negatively associated with educational efficacy beliefs and educational aspirations?”. To investigate these questions, the study applies a sociological framework for understanding the IP from a lens of social theory and examines its social stratification drawing on data from a register-based data collection among German adolescents aged 15-18 (n=4,697). The results of linear regression and probability models for three dependent variables show that (1) the IP is positively associated with disadvantaged social group membership, whereas it is negatively associated with two drivers for educational upward mobility, namely (2) educational efficacy beliefs and (3) educational aspirations. These findings suggest that the IP can undermine opportunities for social upward mobility by reinforcing internalized notions of inadequacy and not belonging to higher educational spheres. As individuals from disadvantaged social groups are more susceptible to the IP, which is associated with lower confidence in educational abilities and reduced pursuit of higher education, the IP appears to constitute an internalized barrier to upward social mobility. These results highlight the societal role of the IP, emphasize the value of understanding it from a sociological perspective, and demonstrate the importance of analyzing it through a lens of social stratification, both within and beyond the educational domain.",

          "abstract": "This article examines the wellbeing implications of activation policies, focusing on the lived experiences of long-term unemployed jobseekers with public employment services. Using a phenomenological approach and the theory of sustainable wellbeing as a framework, the article explores how activation services function as either need satisfiers or barriers across four well-being dimensions: having, loving, doing, and being. Drawing on 24 individual and 4 focus group interviews in the city of Espoo in Finland, the findings highlight the potential of group-form services enhance wellbeing, particularly in the doing dimension through providing meaningful activity and fostering a sense of autonomy and capability. At best, providing meaningful activity could lead to improvements in the being dimension of wellbeing, such as improved self-image and functional ability, creating a self-reinforcing circle of wellbeing. However, to offer successful need satisfiers, group form services had to also support the loving dimension by offering experiences of social relatedness. Additionally, the interviewees lived experiences highlight conditionality as a need barrier, as jobseekers may prioritize maintaining basic material needs over engagement, fearing benefit loss. Ultimately, the article argues for a holistic approach to welfare policy design, considering the interplay of different wellbeing needs to create more inclusive support structures.",

Using restricted-access census microdata, I examined the segregation of the 12 largest immigrant groups to the Japanese majority and among each other. I then assessed the relationship between dissimilarity and factors affecting integration using pooled linear regressions and individual location attainment models. My findings reveal that all immigrant groups exhibit high residential segregation from the Japanese majority and notable pairwise segregation. There is a general trend of spatial assimilation that higher levels of socioeconomic factors predict less segregation, while Brazilians and Peruvians, the earliest contemporary immigrant group who arrived in Japan as ethnic descendants, demonstrate a pronounced tendency towards place stratification. These observations provide support for both spatial assimilation and place stratification theory in the Japanese context. Moreover, there is a strong trend of self-segregation among highly skilled elite, particularly Western immigrants from the Japanese majority and peer immigrants. The results provide support for this dichotomy in segregation trends, underlining the integration challenges for minority groups in global new destinations and the pronounced self-segregation among elite skilled minorities.",

          "abstract": "Objective: This study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine influenced fertility preferences among young adults in Finland. Background: Crises and periods of uncertainty often lead to declines in fertility preferences in high-income societies. However, some groups may experience an increase in fertility preferences. Method: Using a nationally representative survey conducted in August 2022 (n=1960), we analyzed self-reported changes in fertility preferences in relation to socio-demographic variables through multinomial logistic regression. Additionally, qualitative analysis was conducted on open-ended responses to identify common themes behind these changes. Results: Overall, 17.2% of respondents reported changes in their fertility preferences: 10.1% decreased them, while 7.1% increased them. Men were more likely to increase their fertility preferences in response to both crises, whereas women tended to decrease them due to the war but not the pandemic. Parents were more likely to increase their fertility preferences due to the pandemic but not the war. Unemployed individuals were less likely to change their preferences compared to employed respondents. Qualitative analysis identified two key themes: postponing childbearing due to uncertainty and increasing childbearing due to family values. Conclusion: The two recent crises in Europe had distinct effects on fertility preferences across different demographic groups. Implications: Family planning and social support policies should consider not only economic factors but also non-economic uncertainties, such as political and military instability.",

The survey assesses gender issues in the labor market, LGBT rights, and the perceptions of feminists. Linear regressions reveal that intense social media usage is associated with more regressive attitudes on these issues.

          "abstract": "The #MeToo movement has been influential across over 85 countries and has remained an active part of modern feminist movements for since its inception. Scholars have argued that media representations and constructions are an important part of feminist activism and scholarship. This study examines if and how #MeToo has structurally altered the way sexual violence is represented in news media across 47 countries through the frequency of rape myths. Drawing from feminist scholarship that have employed content and thematic analyses to identify the varieties and categories of rape myths, this study employs multilingual natural language processing methods to extend these analyses to an international scale. Drawing from recent methodological developments, GPT-4 is utilized in augmenting qualitative annotations for subsequent model fine-tuning. Bayesian Structural Time Series are subsequently applied to understand the causal impact before and after the movement took off in each country. Scholars have also theorized that countries with greater political openness should be more receptive to change demanded by social movements. We find that, in most countries, the #MeToo movement did not significantly lower the frequency of rape myths in the media, and in the countries that it did the frequency often appeared to revert back to pre-2017 levels by 2022. Political openness did not explain which countries were found to have significant change or not.",

Our study aims to address this gap by investigating the polarization measurement bias that arises when only visible engagement is considered. Using a combined dataset that links survey responses with YouTube digital traces froma representative sample of Hungarian Internet users (N=758), we uncover disparities at both user and channel levels.\nWe find that users who visibly engage through commenting are more politically polarized. People tend to comment and subscribe to ideologically concentrated content, while viewing\nideologically diverse content. We also notice that ideologically heterogeneous channels are more likely to share viewers than subscribers or commenters. Thus, the segregation of\npolitical channels may be overstated or simplified when relying solely on public comment data. Our results suggest that research using only visible engagement may overestimate the extent of polarization and the prevalence of echo chambers online. We highlight the benefits of data donation to address measurement bias in online political communication, and contribute to the polarization literature by providing a fresh evaluation of potential biases in platform-focused research.",

          "abstract": "This paper examines the rapid growth of China’s science and technology (S&amp;T) sector within the broader context of higher education, focusing on the often-overlooked role of Hong Kong in this transformation. While conventional explanations emphasize China’s relationship with the United States, this study argues that Hong Kong has played a crucial, yet underappreciated, role in advancing China’s higher education and S&amp;T capabilities. Despite its reputation as a finance-driven city, Hong Kong has developed a robust academic and scientific community that fostered close collaborations with mainland institutions. In the 1990s, as Hong Kong’s research doctoral programs were gaining momentum, mainland students sought high-quality advanced training, and members of the overseas Chinese academic diaspora returned to join Hong Kong universities. This cross-border collaboration thrived despite cultural and ideological differences, combining the mainland’s motivated talent pool with Hong Kong’s free academic environment. Using a comprehensive dataset from the Web of Science, institutional archives, university leader biographies, and PhD dissertation records from Hong Kong’s top universities, this paper provides both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the historical collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. The findings reveal that this relationship was evolutionary, initiated by forward-thinking educators long before formal mechanisms were in place, and was instrumental in China’s rise to global prominence in higher education and S&amp;T. By revisiting this underexplored dimension of China’s educational development, this paper offers a new understanding of the forces behind the country’s remarkable achievements in higher education and scientific research.",

          "abstract": "Recent research on post-socialist societies demonstrates that as institutional barriers decline, the genetic effects on educational attainment become more pronounced. However, extant studies have only partially considered the role of gender in this process. To reduce this gap in the literature, this study examines gendered genetic influences on educational attainment in Germany before and after reunification. Drawing on Gene-SOEP data (N=1,573), we analyze polygenic risk scores across cohorts (1943 to 1992) in East (German Democratic Republic, GDR) and West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany, FRG) using stepwise OLS regression with three-way interactions. Our findings reveal that genetic influences on educational attainment increased over time, thereby reducing gendered educational inequality in both regions. However, this positive trend was more gradual in the FRG. Although the GDR promoted gender equality, its policies alone were insufficient to eliminate gender-based differences in genetic educational attainment.",

          "authors": "Cameron Thomas Langfield",
          "abstract": "Exceptional events bring with them exceptional consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most devastating exceptional events in recent memory, the lives and routines of millions of people around the world were significantly disrupted. Criminologists were quick to document the immediate and short-term effects of pandemic-related restrictions on recorded crime, with the meta-story being that most types of recorded crime declined beyond statistical expectations. However, in the aftermath of these discoveries, it has become clear that research focusing on young people and their offending has not garnered the same level of attention. To remedy this, the current paper uses officially recorded unit-record offence data from the state of New South Wales (NSW) to explore and document to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic has affected youth offending. With this data in hand, we estimate the prevalence and frequency of offending among this cohort of young people pre-and-post the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. We find that throughout periods of lockdown restrictions in NSW, the prevalence and frequency of this cohorts offending declined significantly, and that most of these declines were clustered in property and violent offences. Interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) was conducted to confirm these findings, with statistical evidence suggesting the largest declines in prevalence and frequency occurred at the point of the first national lockdown in 2020 and the second state-wide lockdown in 2021. We end this paper by discussing why these findings are important and how they continue to shed light on the COVID-crime puzzle, specifically addressing the gap in research on youth offending during an exceptional event.",

          "authors": "Nora Fink",
          "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by differences in communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early detection of ASD can significantly improve patient outcomes by facilitating timely interventions, thereby reducing challenges in later life. Nonetheless, diagnosing ASD can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, prompting researchers and healthcare professionals to explore automated screening and diagnostic tools. In this paper, we present a comprehensive data-driven approach to ASD screening using a publicly available dataset of 704 adult participants. We examine and compare six different modeling techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep Dense Neural Networks (DDNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). By optimizing hyperparameters and carefully preprocessing the data, we achieve a 100% accuracy on the hold-out test set using SVM and XGBoost, and above 98% accuracy with all deep learning models. We discuss the methodological framework, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, encoding, scaling, and model evaluation. We also present significant insights from the machine learning pipeline and highlight implications for future research in the domain of ASD screening. Our results underscore the feasibility of leveraging modern computational approaches to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and resource prioritization for ASD.",

          "authors": "Janine Huisman; Rosanne Martyr; René Rott; Jeroen Smits",
          "abstract": "In this paper we present estimates of socioeconomic vulnerability along three major scenarios developed as part of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for 181 countries over the period 2020-2100. The estimates are based on the GDL Vulnerability Index (GVI), a composite index for monitoring the human components of vulnerability to climate change across the globe. The GVI is based on an additive formula that summarizes the essence of seven major socioeconomic dimensions of vulnerability into a single number. This formula approach makes it possible to compute the index for any region at any point in time for which the underlying indicators are available. This makes the GVI the first composite index which can be used to estimate projected values of vulnerability. We use and derive projected indicators from the databases underlying the SSPs and other sources to compute future values of the GVI at the level of countries, major global regions and for three vulnerability levels. Projections of GVI are provided for three SSPs: a green road scenario (SSP1), a middle of the road scenario (SSP2), and a rocky road scenario with high international fragmentation (SSP3). Vulnerability decreases most substantially under SSP1, the green road scenario with largest emission reductions. Countries and regions which at present are most vulnerable are projected to show the largest improvements.",

          "abstract": "I present new measures of generosity, coverage and institutional characteristics of work-injury policy across 189 countries in the Global Work-Injury Policy Dataset (GWIP) version 2.0. To date, major research efforts produced detailed social policy data for the rich Western countries, and more recently countries of Eastern, Central and Central-Eastern Europe. One of the products of this work, the Social Insurance Entitlements Dataset (SIED) has become a benchmark for social policy research. Using hand-coded data, indicators from the International Labor Organization, and the U.S. Social Security Administration’s ‘Social Security Programs Throughout the World’, and computational social science, I demonstrate a process to successfully extend and harmonize the SIED work-injury coverage and generosity variables to cover the Global South; in total 167 countries, plus a further 189 with imputation for the year 2020 or latest. These data will help further various welfare state and social policy research agendas, in particular in the area of work-injury policy which is often understudied in comparison to other social security policies. I analyze to classic hypotheses in welfare state research to demonstrate and guide the potential contribution of these data. One is a logic of industrialization and the other a cultural values hypothesis about work-injury policy development.",

          "abstract": "Neoliberal conservation is enjoying its latest zenith in the form of ‘biodiversity finance’. The endurance of neoliberal conservation is rooted in often unseen negotiations of knowledge and power; hence it is crucial to understand how material futures are being shaped by discourse. Analysis of interviews with biodiversity finance professionals in Australia revealed novel discursive mechanisms centred on innovation and regulation. Commodification of nature is seen as impossible, but inevitable – with tradeable biodiversity units being the primary object of innovation. The complexity of biodiversity markets elevates the power of the “innovators”, whose expert knowledge and elite networks reshape the material world. These discourses risk entrenching biodiversity loss, particularly for threatened components, and further subordinating the role of government. The data also revealed fear, risk and the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures as potential loci for disruption – highlighting one of several opportunities to chart materially better pathways for biodiversity.",

This study presents a bibliometric assessment of archaeology’s status relative to other fields alongside a systematic review of computational reproducibility in published archaeological research. Analyzing nearly 10,000 articles, I identify trends in authorship, citation practices, and related metrics that position archaeology between the natural and social sciences. A review of reproducibility assessments for the Journal of Archaeological Science reveals persistent challenges, including missing data, unspecified dependencies, and inadequate documentation. To address these issues, I recommend to authors basic practical steps such as standardized project organization and explicit dependency documentation. Strengthening reproducibility will enhance archaeology’s scientific rigor and ensure the verifiability of research findings. This study underscores the urgent need for cultural and technical shifts to establish reproducibility as a cornerstone of rigorous, accountable, and impactful archaeological science.",

          "abstract": "This research evaluates the effectiveness of the European Union’s (EU) 2030 Digital Decade Policy Programme (DDPP), highlighting its current shortcomings and providing recommendations for improvement. The DDPP aims to enhance the EU’s global competitiveness and align digital transformation with European values, focusing on digital skills, infrastructure, business digitalisation, and public services. However, the 2023 and 2024 reports indicate that the EU is off track to meet its 2030 goals, with slow progress on all targets. Potential challenges stemming from a failure of the DDPP include a loss of technological competitiveness, a widening digital divide, skills polarisation, and the creation of new vulnerable groups. Reckoning with the critical state of the DDPP, President von der Leyen has tasked Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President (EVP) for Tech, Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, with a review of the strategy to be carried out in 2026. Ahead of it, this research aims to kickstart a conversation on the need to substantially and comprehensively revisit the DDPP targets. It combines desk research with expert discussions to assess the effectiveness of the Digital Compass and reveals significant delays, funding issues, and an overall lack of coherence in the strategy.",

          "abstract": "Understanding the ``fit'' of models designed to predict binary outcomes has been a long-standing problem. We propose a flexible, portable, and intuitive metric for quantifying the change in accuracy between two predictive systems in the case of a binary outcome: the InterModel Vigorish (IMV). The IMV is based on an analogy to weighted coins, well-characterized physical systems with tractable probabilities. The IMV is always a statement about the change in fit relative to some baseline model---which can be as simple as the prevalence---whereas other metrics are stand-alone measures that need to be further manipulated to yield indices related to differences in fit across models. Moreover, the IMV is consistently interpretable independent of baseline prevalence. We contrast this metric with alternatives in numerous simulations. The IMV is more sensitive to estimation error than many alternatives and also shows distinctive sensitivity to prevalence. We then showcase its flexibility across examples spanning the social, biomedical, and physical sciences. We also demonstrate how it can be used to provide straightforward interpretation of logistic regression coefficients. The IMV allows for precise answers to questions about changes in model fit in a variety of settings in a manner that will be useful for furthering research with binary outcomes.",

There is a wide range of evidence on Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland and their integration, although substantive and systematic gaps remain. The review provides a brief historical background, looks at the demographic composition of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, discusses economic integration, housing, education, social integration, crime and safety, health and well-being, and attitudes to Ukrainian refugees. Much less is known about cultural integration and political participation. Given the size of the population and the ongoing war in Ukraine, more research on Ukrainian refugees is warranted, particularly in the direction of successful integration in a context where return seems increasingly unlikely --- although dual-intent remains the official focus ---, and in areas beyond economic integration that affect well-being and intentions to return.",

          "abstract": "Immigrants to high-income countries often face considerable and persistent labor market difficulties upon arrival, while their native-born children typically experience economic progress. However, little is known about the degree to which these immigrant–native earnings differences stem from unequal pay when doing the same work for the same employer versus labor market processes that sort immigrants into lower-paid jobs. Using linked employer–employee data on 13.4 million workers from nine European and North American countries, we find that the segregation of immigrant-background workers in lower-paying jobs accounts for about four-fifths of immigrant–native earnings differences. Although within-job pay inequality remains consequential for immigrants in several countries, our results demonstrate that lack of access to higher-paying jobs is the primary driver of the immigrant–native pay gap across a range of highly diverse institutional and demographic host-country contexts. These findings highlight the importance of policies aimed at reducing between-job segregation, such as language, job training, and job search assistance programs; improving access to domestic education; recognizing foreign qualifications; and settlement programs aimed at enhancing access to job-relevant information and networks. Policies targeting employer bias in hiring and promotion decisions are also likely of high relevance, whereas measures aimed at ensuring equal pay for equal work may have more limited potential for further progress in closing the immigrant–native pay gap.",

          "title": "What is the external validity of sentencing research? A multi-level meta-analysis of race and gender disparities",
          "authors": "Jose Pina-Sánchez; ian brunton-smith",
          "abstract": "Sentencing research is rarely cross-jurisdictional. More problematically, most quantitative sentencing research is based on a limited number of American jurisdictions where court data is available. As a result, it is difficult to assess the extent to which key findings from the sentencing literature apply universally. We build on the recent growth of sentencing research outside the US to explore the external validity of studies reporting the conditional association of offenders’ race and gender with sentence length. To do so, we conduct two multi-level meta-analyses, distinguishing the proportion of between-study heterogeneity attributable to differences at the study and jurisdiction levels. Our findings reveal that while race disparities in sentencing are statistically significant, they are minimal in magnitude (a 3% penalty for racial minorities) and remarkably consistent across jurisdictions. In contrast, gender disparities are more pronounced (a 13% penalty against men) but highly variable, with some jurisdictions showing parity. Both analyses uncover substantial variability due to sample and modelling choices, highlighting the limited generalisability of existing sentencing research. We urge caution in interpreting findings from single studies on sentencing disparities and advocate for the pre-registration of analytical strategies to mitigate researcher bias.",

          "title": "Economic Outcomes of the Great Migration in the U.S. South",
          "authors": "Mikel de Julian",
          "abstract": "In the 1940s, almost 1.5 million african americans moved from the South to the North of the United States. Previous literature on the Great Migration has mostly focused on migrant outcomes and local effects in the North. This paper studies the impact of the Great Migration for those who stayed in the South. It employs linked, full-count census data for 1940 and 1950 as well as World War Two veteran records. Leveraging preexisting migrant networks and variation in war mobilization rates in the North, it identifies exogenous variation in out-migration from the South. It finds that a 10 percentage point increase in out-migration – the average rate in the 1940s – is associated with a 0.63 percentage point increase in a county’s income growth and a 0.72 years increase in its population’s educational attainment. Potential mechanisms include reductions in unemployment and farm mechanization. Taken together, these effects suggest the Great Migration led to economic convergence between the South and the North of the United States.",
